ukip leader nigel farage said an indian nhs doctor almost killed him by failing to diagnose his cancer nigel farage has launched an astonishing attack on the national health service accusing doctors of ' incompetence and negligence ' over their failure to diagnose his cancer
the controversial politician developed cancer in his 20s and said an indian doctor tried to convince him he had an infection even though his left testicle had swollen to the size of a rock hard lemon
the ukip leader claimed he was ' fobbed off by one nhs doctor to the next ' , and , without private health insurance , he would ' probably be dead '
writing in his memoir , the purple revolution , which is being serialised in the telegraph , nigel farage wrote : ' several doctors examined me - registrars , locums , all that lot - and they came to the conclusion that i had a twisted testicle
i would need an immediate operation , they said
i was taken by ambulance to hospital in farnborough , hampshire , where i was re-examined by another four doctors
' an indian doctor told me that the bromley doctors had got it all wrong : i had an infection
i was to go home and take a heavy dose of antibiotics
i did not need an operation after all
a few weeks went by and the pain was just as bad
all the time , my left testicle was getting markedly larger
' mr nigel farage said that six weeks later he was having difficulty walking and his ' left testicle was as large as a lemon and rock hard '
but despite being in a ' terrible state ' a consultant directed him to '' keep taking the antibiotics ' and sent him away
eventually mr nigel farage said he sought an opinion from a private consultant who diagnosed cancer
mr nigel farage told how he was ' terrified ' when doctors told him he may have secondary tumours in his stomach and lungs
more than 30 years on , recounting the period ' makes me upset ' , he added
on the day of the 2010 general election , mr nigel farage said a plane crash during a publicity stunt and an earlier car crash has left him with the body of a 70 - year - old.d
mr nigel farage , pictured , revealed that one of his testicles had swollen up to the size of large rock hard lemon mr nigel farage , pictured after a plane crash on election day in 2010 admitted the nhs was good in emergencies after the air accident mr nigel farage was told that he could be signed off as partially disabled but having a blue badge would be ' conceding defeat '
' i remember thinking , ' so this is it , this is how it ends ' , ' he said of the air crash
' when people say that their life flashed before them when they thought they were about to die , it is rubbish
' all i could think of was how much there was i still wanted to do and the impact my death would have on others - my girls were still so little and the boys were only just finding their way in the world
' he added : ' having nearly died three times has made me a much bigger risk - taker
when you think your life is about to be taken away and you are given it back , you just want to get on and do things
' there 's no time to waste : children to bring up , elections to win , pheasants to pluck , wine to drink
' the ukip leader accused other political parties of being afraid of criticising the nhs he has also taken the opportunity in his memoir to attack the other major westminster political parties over their fear of criticising the nhs
he said that he is ' better qualified to criticise and defend our health care system than most politicians '
mr nigel farage praised the nhs for being ' astonishingly good ' at emergency critical care but claims the nhs will ' probably let you down ' over screening and a fast diagnosis
he said the system is ' so over-stretched that if you can afford private health care , you should take it ' and warned that the nhs ' is so battered and poorly run that unless you are really lucky , you will fall through the cracks '
' there are huge problems with the nhs , deep structural ones , but , as i have said , i know more than most what that means on a personal level , ' he wrote
' when i had cancer , the incompetence and negligence of the nhs almost killed me , but it has also saved my life
i am certainly not taking any flak from gutless politicians who claim that i am no fan or supporter of the nhs
