these stunning images show the moment a pack of polar bears brace themselves against the harsh winter as a fierce snow storm swirls around them
the mother and cubs were pictured huddling together against the blizzard in kaktovik , alaska - 800km north of the arctic circle
judith conning , a social worker from australia , took the trip to the remote town to watch the family of polar bears as they prepared to fish on the frozen beaufort sea
safety in numbers : a mother and her two cubs huddle together to keep warm as a fierce blizzard sweeps across kaktovik in alaska cold front : the mother bear and her two cubs sit together with their backs towards the bitter gale as snow swirls around them wintery : the mother bear nuzzles one of her cubs as snow sweeps across a freezing cold beach 800km north of the arctic circle brightening up : with the blizzard finally subsiding , one of the cubs takes a seat in the snow while its proud mother watches on face - off : despite the blizzard , two bears from the pack found the energy to stand up on their hind legs and square - up for a play fight while the mothers wanted nothing more than to rest and sleep , the cubs were content with playing in the snow and exploring their surroundings
the bears seemed unperturbed by the blustery conditions - but the weather played havoc on the photography trip
judith conning , whose pictures were awarded the australian photography magazine 's ' nature photographer of the year ' , said : ' the weather kept most people indoors as at times it was impossible to stay upright outside
' i was overwhelmed by the intelligence , the love , care and protectiveness the mothers show for their cubs
we watched a group of cubs - young ones and teenagers - play and it was for all the world like watching kids in the school yard
rough and tumble : the weather may have been dismal , but it did not stop the polar bear cubs from enjoying a play fight as their mother watched on just yards away the big chill : three bears huddle together as they attempt to sleep through harsh winter conditions in northern alaska last october on the march : the family of polar bears waited until the blizzard had passed before prowling along the shoreline looking for food play time : while the mothers wanted nothing more than to rest and sleep , the cubs were content with playing in the snow and exploring their surroundings ' there was pushing and shoving , making friends and general rough housing with some in the thick of it and others keeping to the sidelines
' despite the difficult weather conditions , the rare sighting of the endangered animals moved the photographer
she said : ' i want to weep when i think of what may ultimately happen to them
' i want to weep when i think about how difficult it has already become - how many of them now die of starvation or drown
i also despair at the fact that fewer and fewer cubs survive to adulthood
i am awed by the privilege of seeing them
