wawrzynski claims the ' little dipper ' condiment package he patented in 1997 led heinz to develop its dip & squeeze ketchup packets , which it rolled out in february 2010 a michigan food entrepreneur claims the ' little dipper ' condiment package he patented in 1997 led heinz to develop its dip & squeeze ketchup packets , which it rolled out in february 2010 , lawyers in opening statements told a federal court jury in pittsburgh on monday
the trial , expected to last through until thursday , will determine whether or not pittsburgh - based heinz used wawrzynski 's ' concrete , new and novel ' ideas when it developed the dual - purpose ketchup packets
if the jury rules in the detroit businessman 's favor and determines heinz agreed to pay for the ideas , a separate trial will begin june 10 on how much heinz owes wawrzynski
' heinz says it did n't use any of mr. wawrzynski 's ideas â they thought it up all on their own , ' his attorney , boyle told the jury
' we 're here to tell you that 's not true
' boyle told the associated press he ca n't say how much wawrzynski is seeking because an expert hired to calculate the sum has n't issued a final report
but heinz attorney wolfsohn said heinz owes nothing because the dip & squeeze owes nothing to the cone - shaped container that wawrzynski invented
drawings of two versions of that product were shown to the jury , including one with a keyhole - shaped opening that enables a person to dip a french fry into ketchup , while wiping off excess amounts as it 's pulled out of the opening
wawrzynski is n't claiming heinz copied the exact design
rather , he contends heinz did n't have the idea for a ketchup container that could be dipped into and squeezed until they heard his pitch
heinz claims the dip & squeeze grew out of an earlier idea called the ' dunk ' n squirt ' that it shelved in 2006 because it could n't make it cheaply enough the dip & squeeze grew out of an earlier idea called the ' dunk ' n squirt ' that heinz began working on in 2002 but shelved in 2006 because it could n't find a vendor to make the throwaway ketchup packets cheaply enough , the company says
the packets must be cheap to purchase because fast - food restaurants and others give the packets away for free , wolfsohn said
prototypes developed in 2006 were keystone - shaped â like heinz 's iconic ketchup label â and had a peelable top if a customer wanted to dip a fry and a tear - off end so the ketchup could be squeezed , wolfsohn said
except for the keystone shape , the dip & squeeze packets are nearly identical
but boyle insists the idea came from the 44 - year - old wawrzynski , who began working in the food industry at 13
after working at pizzerias over five years from the time he was 16 , wawrzynski launched wok to you , a firm that delivers asian food from 30 different detroit - area restaurants
' dave 's been tinkering with condiment packaging since high school , ' boyle said
when an earlier letter to heinz did n't attract attention , he wrote to then - ceo william johnson in march 2008 and met with heinz officials a month later , boyle said
heinz does n't deny the meeting took place , but says the discussions revolved around his hand - held , cone - shaped container designed to keep french fries from dripping ketchup
' the ideas that were discussed at that meeting had nothing to do with the dip & squeeze , ' wolfsohn said .
