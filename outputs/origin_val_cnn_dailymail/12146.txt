andy murray finds himself with the task of killing off usa in the davis cup on sunday after great britain âs scratch pair came tantalisingly close to doing the job for him
taking their cue from james ward âs heroics on friday , jamie murray and dom inglot almost mimicked his comeback before going down 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 7 , 9 - 7 to the bryan brothers , mike and bob , in another epic , this one lasting three hours and 39 minutes
it left gb leading this davis cup first - round match 2 - 1 with two to play , but it could so nearly have been all over as the british pair shocked the sport âs most feared duo with the force of their comeback

dom inglot was impressive from the start in only his second davis cup tie while jamie murray recovered admirably from a terrible first two sets
by opting to rest andy murray , gb captain leon smith knew he could be sacrificing a doubles point , with the calculated trade - off that his no 1 player would be fresh for this afternoon âs reverse singles
he will tackle isner , whom he has beaten in all three meetings , and if he can extend that record , a home quarter - final will be secured against france , who have beaten germany

â it âs pretty obvious we are a much tighter team than the usa , â he said
â i did nât feel the rest of their team were cheering much , while our guys were up on every point
â i do nât think isner will be back - flipping out of bed tomorrow to play andy murray
i guess with his serve he has a chance but i would nât bet against andy murray in this situation
â so far this tie has uncannily mirrored last year âs first round between the countries in san diego , when andy murray sealed it in the fourth rubber after the bryans had reduced the deficit to 2 - 1 by the saturday night
dom inglot and jamie murray played together a few times as juniors but are unfamiliar as professionals

mike bryan had no complaints about the atmosphere but did point out that the dj ramped up the music after the home team won a game , while playing â a lullaby â when the usa struck back
while dom inglot did not lose his serve throughout , andy murray dropped his first four service games as they lost the first two sets before another massively committed crowd of nearly 8,000
once andy murray had held early in the third he stepped his game up and they held on to take the set
gb slipped behind 3 - 5 in the fourth - set tiebreak but after running off the next three points , andy murray converted a volley on their second set point to take it 10 - 8 , having saved a match point at 7 - 8
the usa bench started to look like death row as their banker pair struggled and the decider became desperately tight
but the older andy murray brother could not hold on at 7 - 7 , and was broken , with inglot , ranked 38 in doubles , making several mistakes that belied his previous form
the usa are still in with a chance of completing an unlikely comeback from 2 - 0 down but they have done that only once in 40 davis cup ties , and andy murray looks mightily up for the contest .
