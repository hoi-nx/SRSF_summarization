mr clegg lent a helping hand to putting up election boards for local candidate layla moran mr clegg said : ' of course we have different views to the conservatives
i 'm the leader of the lib dem , david cameron is the leader of the conservatives
' they have a completely different attitude towards europe
they have this hokey cokey where one day they want to leave , the next day they do n't want to leave
' we are unambiguous as a party that says ' yes , europe needs to be reformed , yes there needs to be a referendum when a decision needs to be made about the transfer of powers to the european union , we guaranteed that in law '
' we are not like the conservatives , half of whom are straining at the leash to leave
we think that would be a terrible thing for the britain economy
' but in the same way i strongly disagree with ed miliband and ed balls 's failure to spell out when they would actually balance the books

' large parts of the conservatives and ukip appear to want britain to cut itself off from what is the world 's largest marketplace with hundreds of millions of customers for britain goods and services
' for me it 's stating the flaming obvious that we need to secure britain 's presence at the heart of the european union in the same way it 's flaming obvious that we should secure the britain economic recovery by finishing the job of balancing the books but doing it in a fair and sensible way - not taking an ideological approach to cuts , which is the conservatives approach , nor taking such an irresponsible approach to borrowing , which is labour 's approach
