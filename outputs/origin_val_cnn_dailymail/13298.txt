his satire took egypt , and the world , by storm
but now , bassem youssef -- egypt 's most famous satirist known as his country 's jon stewart -- has the public profile of a politician in retirement , leading study groups at the harvard
" well , you know , sometimes circumstances are not the best for you to continue a political satire show , " bassem youssef told cnn 's amanpour in an interview that aired monday
" sometimes jokes kind of are annoying
" his show -- literally called " the show , " or " al bernameg " -- ran for three seasons during egypt 's turbulent and utterly confusing post-arab spring days
bassem youssef 's biting satire left nothing unscathed -- whether the president , political and militant muslims , or the military
" there is room for satire and comedy as long as it 's acceptable by the people controlling the atmosphere
" his incredible story from cardiac surgeon to satirist to political target is the subject of a documentary currently in production , directed by a senior producer for jon stewart , with whom bassem youssef developed a close relationship
" it 's talking about political satire , humor , how ( people can ) be all for a certain program or a joke , but when the joke turns on them , they kind of like turn on you , " he said
" and so maybe we were an equal opportunity satirist , but they were not ( an ) equal opportunity audience
" the chances are small that his show would be allowed back on air , if he even wanted to do so -- " the question is will i be allowed to do , make fun of whatever ( i want ) ? " ( " who said that my country 's authoritarian ? come on , " he joked
" i mean , do n't put words in my mouth
we are -- it 's a very , very good , democratic country ; please , please
" ) but he is far from idle , seemingly casting around for ways to occupy his immense talent
at harvard , he is a visiting fellow working on " political satire and humor , and how they interact with political , social and even religious taboos
" he is careful not to say he is teaching , as " harvard professors are very touchy when resident fellows come here and say they teach
" he is also writing a script for a movie comedy , and building a platform to identify talent in the arabs world and allow more people to experience the extreme and unexpected success he did
" satire did n't begin or end with my program
i mean , it is a part of people 's culture , a part of people 's thoughts
so if one program is off , there are people who will find other ways
" his program showed the arabs world in a new light for many in the west , and he said he hopes more will follow in his footsteps
it 's a counterbalance , if you will , to the messianic image propagated by isis
" i do n't want to even call them extreme muslims
i think they are a bunch of lunatics , who instead of playing ' grand theft auto ' on video games , they want to do it in real life
" it may not often reach a western audience , but bassem youssef said that youtube is filled with arabs making fun of isis -- for example , setting the group 's favorite " anthems " to images of belly dancers
" it happens with all religions ... , " he said
" so they are crazy , and they are a threat for me as much they are a threat to you
" despite all bassem youssef 's projects , many simply want him to return to the airwaves
is he eyeing , amanpour asked , the seat that will soon be vacated by his mentor , jon stewart ? " the day that i actually have been chosen to replace jon stewart will be like -- it will be glorious , " he said
" but i do n't think that americans would like to take their political satire from a middle eastern guy with a thick accent
i think this is going to be even more difficult than electing a black president
" but you know , let 's hope
