obama has said that young united states should be more worried about climate change than whether smoking pot was legal
the united states president said the legalization of marijuana should come at the bottom of a long list of priorities for youths which also included the economy , war and peace
he was asked in an interview whether he legalising the drug would be part of his legacy as leader
young people , i understand this is important to you , but you should be thinking about climate change , the economy , jobs , war and peace - maybe way at the bottom you should be thinking about marijuana
' so far , four states and the d.c. have legalized some recreational use of the drug , and 23 states and d.c. permit its use for medicinal purposes
but obama said that the united states justice system was ' skewed ' towards non-violent drug offenders and the ' disproportionate ' prison sentence came at the huge cost to communities and the state
the president has come out in favour of decriminalization as a way to tackle the skewed system but said he felt that the issue was very separate from encouraging people to use marijuana he added that he felt ' encouraged ' by the numbers of politicians , including conservative republicans , who were beginning to see the cost of keeping the drug illegal did n't add up
obama has been very open about his past experimentation with drugs and alcohol in high school
in 2006 , then a new hampshire democratic presidential candidate , obama was asked about his use of marijuana
when asked if he inhaled - a reference to former president bill clinton who , while admitting to trying marijuana , claimed he did not inhale - the future president said : ' i did
' it 's not something i 'm proud of
it was a mistake as a young man
' obama also suggested that if medical marijuana was the best way to relieve pain and suffering then it was something he would be open to
' we may actually be able to make progress on the decriminalization side , ' he added , ' at a certain point , if enough states end up decriminalizing , then congress may then re-schedule marijuana
' but while he appeared to take steps towards decriminalization , obama warned legalization was n't a ' panacea ' and there will still many who had concerns about the drug 's affect on society
there are currently 23 states and d.c. which allows marijuana for medicinal purposes
the controlled substances act on 1970 listed marijuana as a schedule i drug making it illegal to manufacture , distribute or possess marijuana in the united states
but in august 2013 , the u.s. justice department confirmed it would n't challenge colorado or other states with laws legalizing recreational marijuana
punishment for people found in possession of the drug currently depends on the location they were caught
for example , in colorado , individuals aged over 21 can carry up to one ounce of cannabis and growing up to six marijuana plants at home without prosecution
the increasingly relaxed stance on the drug has seen a rise in the numbers of states looking to decriminalize or legalize the drug
in last year alone , alaska , and oregon voted to legalize recreational marijuana , which came into force this year , and maryland became the 18th state to decriminalize the drug
minnesota and new york became the 22nd and 23rd state to legalize medical marijuana in some form
they are likely to be swiftly followed by others next year when ballot initiatives in california , massachusetts , maine , nevada and arizona other states are likely to be put to voters
only this month , a trio of senators unveiled a package of drug reforms that would effectively end the federal war on medical marijuana
while it would n't legalize it , the bill would remove the threat of federal prosecution for patients who use it in states where it is legal .
