atlanta this is a tale of two storms
the one that ( kind of ) hit atlanta and the one that hit everywhere else
ask folks along a line from arkansas to virginia
unlike last year , when city officials were caught completely by surprise , atlanta was prepared this time
but the storm stayed north of town
it did do some damage , slicking up roads and knocking out power to tens of thousands of people
still , snowmageddon 2015 it was n't
georgia gov. nathan deal did his part
he ordered a state of emergency for 51 northern counties
there were more snow plows , more trucks to spread brine and they were out in force ahead of the bad weather
and people helped out by staying home or leaving work early
still , social media was n't about to give the governor a break
" as a stockholder of a grocery store here , i appreciate you guys invoking a false panic again
# atlsnow , " tweeted tommy sale
north of the city , there was lots of snow , especially in the mountains , but atlanta mainly got rain
it was a disappointing prospect for those who had their hearts set on making a snowman from a rare snowfall
" serious question , how am i supposed to build a snowman with rain ? " asked angelica monteon
" lol , a little imagination and your freezer , " responded ashley hamilton
other parts of the south found enough snow to put together more than your basic snowman
in northeast mississippi they were channeling " star wars " and the ice planet hoth in creating a snowy version of an imperial walker
in alabama , the snow inspired a host of elsas , annas and olafs to spread their wintry magic " frozen " style
by early thursday , the storm system had largely left the south behind , instead spreading a blanket of white on the carolinas and northward
north carolina gov. mccrory noted that this marked the second time in two years that a major winter storm covered his entire state
there were no casualties or major injuries , thankfully , but the central part of the state got up to 7 inches while a few inches fell in the east
it was n't just that snow fell , but the type of snow -- heavy stuff that snapped branches and weighed down power lines , especially in durham and wake counties
that led to some 224,000 duke energy customers being in the dark at one point , a number that had fallen to about 78,000 by 6:25 p.m. thursday
" the biggest issue for us , especially greensboro to the east , was power outages , " mccrory said
" that is something that ... we did n't anticipate
" thankfully , though , north carolinians were ready in other ways
they heeded officials ' warnings by stocking up , staying off the roads and staying safe
the storm did leave behind its share of slippery misery
north of atlanta , interstate 75 was in gridlock wednesday afternoon
catching flights was a nightmare in some southern cities
atlanta , dallas and charlotte were the hardest hit
some 1,600 flights were canceled at all us airports on wednesday
nearly 900 have been scrubbed for thursday
in alabama , day and some friends thought it would be better for them to drive home to evansville , indiana , instead of worrying with canceled flights
they did n't make it far
they were stuck on i-65 about 30 miles north of birmingham
day says a hill and snow - covered roadways led to backed - up traffic for miles
in tennessee , 30 weather - related deaths have been reported in the past 10 days
a small child died in mississippi after the car she was in hydroplaned
and a student from the university of mississippi in oxford was killed in a sledding accident wednesday
the south 's fascination with snow is a bit bemusing for those who live north of the mason-dixon line
after all , in boston , they were over winter about 70 inches ago
" how 's the snow treating you , southern us folks ? having fun yet ? " asked canadian l.m. murphy on twitter
" do n't mock our southern snow panic ! " warned whitney waddell in nashville
and then there was this bit of empathy from points north
" i love all the snow pictures of my southern friends because they actually appreciate the snow , " tweeted abby kreuser .
