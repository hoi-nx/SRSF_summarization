the white house , the state department and senate democrats on capitol hill are side - stepping questions about hillary clinton as the controversy over her cyber hygiene escalates
while some of the presumed presidential candidate 's party members have come to her defense , many lawmakers headed for the exits this week as reporters asked them for their opinion on the way clinton handled her email while at the state department
dem strategists were more willing discuss the scandal - but what they had to say , clinton probably wo n't like
senate democrats are running for cover this week as former secretary of state hillary clinton takes fire from the press for over her cyber hygiene
officials at 1600 pennsylvania now claim they did n't know that clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business officials at 1600 pennsylvania now claim they did n't know that clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business until congress reopened an investigation into the benghazi attack
according to the associated press , it was the white house counsel 's office that ordered the state department to retrieve clinton 's old emails
that version of events was never relayed to the press at large , despite the fact that president obama 's spokesman josh earnest spent the better part of his briefings with reporters on tuesday and wednesday answering questions about what the white house knew about clinton 's exclusive use of her personal email address , when it knew it , and a host of other related inquires
he deflected as often as possible and referred press to the state department and clinton
josh earnest did note that clinton 's detractors and government watchdogs have n't provided ' any evidence ' that would indicate that the former administration official and her team are ' not being forthright ' about turning in copies of all of her email communications from her four years in the president 's cabinet
his comments were hardly a ringing endorsement of clinton 's honesty , however
the white house got a break on thursday when a snowstorm bore down on washington , d.c. , giving earnest cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps
a large - scale , public q and a session is n't likely to make friday 's schedule , either , as the president is travelling to south carolina for an event at benedict college
usually a spokesperson for the president holds a small gaggle with press riding air force one on those days
unwilling or unable to say who in at the state department was responsible for making sure clinton fully complied with the demand , the deputy spokesman there , marie harf , directed journalists to the former secretary of state
pressed to declare that she was ' confident ' that all of clinton 's pertinent emails were now in the possession of the federal government she said , ' what i âm saying is her staff has stated that anything related to her work has been given to the state department
' ' but this is obviously a confirmation her staff has to make , ' she added , after a reporter asked if she has any ' reason to doubt ' the veracity of clinton 's claims
she said she did not
former obama adviser david axelrod said wednesday night that he thinks the clinton is adding to her woes by keeping silent
' it would be good to get out there and answer these questions
' clinton is pictured here in 2008 taking questions from the press during the democratic national convention a few months before she was sworn in as secretary of state clinton 's former colleagues in congress were wo n't to discuss the issue at all
' can we talk about it later ? i have to go to my vote , ' clinton 's successor in the senate , kirsten gillibrand of new york , told the national journal
the news publication said minnesota sen. amy klobuchar , normally outspoken , excused herself for the same reason
' i do n't know enough about it to appropriately respond , ' new hampshire sen. jeanne shaheen said
congressional democrats were equally reticent to comment to cnn
' i 'm not up to speed on it
i 'm really not , ' montana sen. tester told the network on wednesday - more than a day after story broke
' check back , ' tester , the chair of senate democrats ' campaign arm , said
north dakota sen. heidi heitkamp also asked for a mulligan
' i do n't know enough about what those rules are , honestly , to comment , ' she claimed
and the list goes on
west virginia sen. joe manchin told national journal he does n't ' know the facts ' but ' it sounds like somebody made a mistake
' ' she 's going to have to give an answer to it , ' vermont rep. peter welch told cnn
maryland rep. elijah cummings , the ranking member on the white house 's select committee on benghazi , said it 's not his job to protect clinton , his party 's possible nominee for president
' i want to be clear , i am not trying to defend hillary clinton , ' he said
' i am trying to defend the truth â¦ we have some things we are going to try and figure out
' if clinton ca n't make the email story go away quick enough , she could go from presidential front runner in 2016 to persona non-grata
supporters of clintons are shown here in 2008 after she lost that year 's nomination to obama retiring california sen. barbara boxer was one of the few dem senators to stand by clinton
' that 's a nothing burger
total , ' she told national journal
' there is n't one secretary of state that ever did that because the law did n't change until after she left , so they 're making a mountain out of a molehill , ' she added
likewise , delaware sen. tom carper said he 'd ' be surprised if a number of secretaries of state department had n't done that for as long as we 've had email
' ' that 's all i 'm going to say , ' he added
new york rep. steve israel blamed republicans for the mess and accused them of ' trying to manufacture or amplify crisis or scandal
' ' that 's what they do here , ' he told cnn
' pretty soon we 'll have a special investigative committee for every action that hillary clinton takes
there will be a special select committee on her breakfast , her lunch and her dinner and what she had in between
just add this to the list
' it is true that clinton 's predecessors also used their personal email addresses to conduct official business
but other secretaries of state did not create private email addresses the day before their confirmation votes for the explicit purpose of communicating with their future staff
nor did they house their email addresses on a privately owned server that is inaccessible to the government and can be wiped clean at their leisure
they were n't actively considering a bid for president , either
reporters showered white house press secretary josh earnest with questions on wednesday about the clinton email controversy
the white house got a break on thursday when a snowstorm bore down on washington , d.c. , giving earnest cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps former obama adviser david axelrod said wednesday night that he thinks the clinton is adding to her woes by keeping silent
' it would be good to get out there and answer these questions , ' david axelrod said on msnbc 's the last word with lawrence o'donnell , according to the hill
' why did she used a separate email ? how did she secure that email ? was there another email through which she communicated with people ? ' he asked
' by not answering these questions , they are allowing this story to fester in ways that are unhelpful
so lack of speed kills in this case , ' the former white house official said
the state department has said that clinton had just one email address during her tenure there - the account in question
and clinton , first through a spokesman , and then through twitter has touched on the issue
she has not explained why she did what she did , though , or responded to any of the other questions david axelrod - and the media - put forward
a dem strategist who spoke to the hill warned that if clinton ca n't make the story go away quick enough , she could go from presidential front runner to persona non-grata
' we âre probably a month or so away [ from the campaign launch ] and if this is not handled really well within the next three to six weeks , you âre going to see chatter among dem operatives saying , " maybe we need another person in this race
" and that is really problematic
' ' when you do stuff like this , man , you just raise a lot of concerns and red flags , ' the hill 's source said
' it âs kinda weird
