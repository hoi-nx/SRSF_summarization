the woman whose secret life as a Â£ 300 - an - hour call girl made her a fortune is suing her ex-boyfriend for libel - because he claims she was never a prostitute
dr brooke magnanti , 39 , whose diary of her adventures working as a high class escort was published anonymously under the pen name ' brooke magnanti ' , is reportedly suing on the grounds that the claim damages her reputation
her blog told of her life as a struggling graduate in london and working as call girl to fund her studies - and included her former lover owen morris , known only as ' the boy '
it led to two bestselling books and the successful secret diary of a call girl series , starring billie piper
the 39 - year - old 's blog spawned two bestselling books and an itv series starring billie piper ( left ) but american - born dr brooke magnanti has said she faced a backlash for glamourising prostitution after her identity was revealed
the books and series also led mr owen morris , a former raf officer , to file a lawsuit in 2013 challenging dr brooke magnanti 's version of events
he claimed her stories were based on her sex life with him
but in what is likely a legal first , dr brooke magnanti 's legal team had launched a counter-claim at edinburgh 's court of sessions , vice reported
they are set to argue that claiming she had never worked as a prostitute is defamatory
mr owen morris , who is known only as â the boy â in the books , pursued damages for defamation and breach of privacy against dr brooke magnanti after the release of her books , who has a phd in forensic science
dr brooke magnanti 's ( pictured left , with billie piper ) has filed a counter-claim to ex-lover owen morris 's suit claiming her books were based on ' fantasy ' soon after their relationship ended in 2008 , he claimed her books - the intimate adventures of a london call girl , in 2005 , and the further adventures of a london call girl , in 2006 - were ' fantasy '
writing on blog sexonomics at the time , she said : ' i have no choice but to defend this
but am happy to do so even though it will almost certainly mean losing everything i have even when i win
' she took to her blog to vehemently deny his allegations , insists her blog and the resulting books are true
a statement from dr brooke magnanti 's legal team to vice said : ' i can confirm a counter-claim has been lodged
' i have been advised by my qc to offer no further comment pending the resolution of this litigation
