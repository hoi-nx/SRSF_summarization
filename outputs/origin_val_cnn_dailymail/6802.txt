a woman who tried to video conference with her colleagues was left red - faced after she accidentally called them while she was naked
the australian in her mid- 20s shared her story via social media site reddit under the user name swallowing_panda
she claimed she worked for ' a corporate job at a big firm ' and the incident happened on wednesday morning , while she was working from home
an australian woman ( not pictured ) claims she accidentally video called her colleagues naked while working from home on the day she decided to work from home , she also decided not to wear clothes
' there 's lots of perks working from home , one being that clothes are optional , ' she wrote
' i set up my laptop and sit it in front of my naked body
' the corporate worker explained she then went to boot up a new program that allowed her to take calls on her computer from her office phone
as it was the first time she had used it , she chose to test it out - with awkward results
' i first call my mobile from the program and all works great
i then proceed to call my boss [ 45 year old awkward male ] from my laptop , ' swallowing_panda said
the woman , only known as redditor swallowing_panda , said the incident happened on wednesday morning ( above is a stock picture ) ' and , like a baby boomer using skype for the first time , lean up close to the mic to test the audio : " hi boss ! just testing the new program out ! hows everything going ? " ' swallowing_panda said she was puzzled when her boss did not respond and heard only background noises for 10 seconds before he hung up
she then goes on to call a colleague who she describes as a ' mid- 30s nerd - like male '
but his reaction was as confusing as the first after she asked her workmate if he could hear her
' a stumble of words come out from my mic , i hear a faint gasp , a laugh and then after a few seconds he too hangs up , ' swallowing_panda said
she is on the cusp of giving up when she receives a call from another colleague named patricia
' i answer with a " patricia ! "
there 's a long pause
i lean in further to my screen , boobs perked above the keyboard , " patricia , i 'm working from home today , can you hear me ? " ' swallowing_panda wrote
' i hear a " oh my god " then she too
' thirty seconds later , swallowing_panda finally gets an explanation for her colleagues ' bizarre behaviour
' i receive an email from patricia : " swallowing_panda , sweetie , put some clothes on "
i want to die , ' she said
