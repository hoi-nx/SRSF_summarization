a former special forces soldier is rounding up supporters for a leadership bid against miliband if he does not win the general election , the mail on sunday has learned
dan jarvis , who entered the commons only four years ago , has told potential supporters he is prepared to run if mr miliband fails to dislodge david cameron from no 10
one senior labour mp , who met privately with mr dan jarvis in the commons a month ago , said : â dan jarvis wants to go for it if the result is disappointing
' ex-special forces : dan jarvis has told potential supporters he is prepared to run if mr miliband fails to dislodge david cameron from no 10 he added : ' i thought about it for a couple of weeks , then rang him to say he could count on my backing
â the news has emerged as the labour leader faces the embarrassment of two senior party figures openly debating his failings during a broadcast interview this week
with polling day barely six weeks away , labour mp danczuk will discuss mr miliband âs lack of voter appeal with party peer lord glasman in an interview broadcast on lbc on monday evening
during the debate , mr danczuk asks : â what has nigel farage got that miliband does nât ? â the peer â a former adviser to mr miliband â responds : â he has got the ability to sit in the pub and be at his complete ease , which is a very magical gift
miliband is â¦ from the seminar room
â mr dan jarvis , the shadow justice minister , is rapidly gaining support on the party back benches as a â clean skin â candidate who , unlike many rivals , was not an adviser or minister during the blair or brown governments and is â untainted â by association with mr miliband âs inner circle
some mps also argue that the 42 - year - old ex-para âs military career â a rarity in labour ranks â would be more appealing to voters than mr miliband âs background as a policy adviser
in any leadership contest , mr dan jarvis is likely to face the more experienced figures of health spokesman andy burnham , shadow home secretary yvette cooper , shadow business secretary chuka umunna , education spokesman tristram hunt and ambitious frontbencher liz kendall
miliband faces the embarrassment of two senior party figures openly debating his failings during a broadcast interview this week the backer added : â dan jarvis has a clear view of his own strengths , and an even clearer view of his rivals â weaknesses
â mr dan jarvis became the first person since the second world war to resign a military commission to contest a by - election
he successfully stood in barnsley central in 2011 , shortly after his wife caroline died of cancer , aged 43 , leaving him to care for their two children
mr dan jarvis has since remarried and now has a third child
the former major spent 15 years in the paras , and was awarded an mbe after serving in afghanistan , iraq , kosovo and sierra leone
in keeping with his action - man image , it was reported last week he had pacified a drunken thug wielding a bottle who demanded his wallet
under party rules , if mr miliband fails to win power in may but does nât resign , a leadership election can be triggered only if 20 per cent of the party âs mps nominate a specific challenger
the winner , elected by mps , meps , party members and unions , would be announced at the party âs next annual conference .
