chelsea captain terry has revealed how manager mourinho keeps his premier league title - chasing team on their toes and says he sometimes goes wild even when they are winning
mourinho has guided chelsea to the top of the premier league this season , six points clear of nearest rivals manchester city with a game in hand , and it seems his methods are getting results
captain terry says that the portuguese coach is unpredictable , calmly reacting to games when chelsea are struggling or kicking off with his players when they are winning
mourinho keeps his chelsea team on their toes , according to captain terry terry says mourinho can flip tables over when chelsea are winning but stay calm when they are losing ' sometimes you 're losing a game at half - time , which does n't happen often at this club , and you expect to come in and get a rollicking , ' terry said
' but you come in and the manager is calm , collected , the complete opposite
he 's like , " listen , we 're going to win the game
we 're going to get an early goal " and he talks you through it
' while mourinho 's calmer side has been used to get his team through difficult periods , such as when they were drawing 2 - 2 with hull at half - time on sunday after taking an early two - goal lead , he can also operate at the other end of the scale
mourinho sometimes knocks tables over and sends water flying during his half - time speeches the blues boss used his calmer side to help them through a difficult moment against hull but terry feels those little details from mourinho 's behaviour keep his team ready for anything , something that has helped them take the initiative in the title race all season while winning the capital one cup earlier this month
' other times you 'll be winning 2 - 0 or 3 - 0 and you 'll come in happy at half - time and he 'll go ballistic , ' terry told chelsea pitch owners
' tables will go over , bottles of water will go flying
you think " where 's that come from ? " ' but you go out for the second half and win the game 5 - 0 rather than scraping through 3 - 1 , 3 - 2
' he knows when players take their foot off the gas
he can sense something before the game
he just gets a feel for everyone and every single game
and i look at that and think no one else has got that that i âve experienced
