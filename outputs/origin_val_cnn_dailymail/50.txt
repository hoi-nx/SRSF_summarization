prince william arrived in chinese tonight for one of the most high - profile â and diplomatically sensitive â tours of his fledgling royal career
following four successful days in japan , the future king flew on to beijing where he was greeted at the norman foster - designed capital international airport by british ambassador barbara woodward , british 's first female ambassador to the country
also present was the chinese ambassador to the british , liu xiaoming , and ambassador sun of the chinese people 's institute of foreign affairs
stepping foot for the first time on chinese soil , the second in line to the throne became the most senior member of the royal family to visit the country since the queen nearly 30 years ago
in truth , many had believed that william âs father , prince charles , would be the first to stake that claim
the queen âs heir has been assiduously courting the chinese in recent years on behalf of his charities , setting up a number of initiatives in the country , including the prince âs charities foundation ( chinese ) and an organisation to preserve historic architecture
he has also met with several senior communist party leaders in the british
however he has also made no secret of his personal , and deeply held , opposition to chinese actions in tibet , regularly welcoming their exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama ( reviled in beijing as a dangerous separatist ) , to clarence house
the pair have even been photographed holding hands
prince william with the british ambassador barbara woodward after taking part in the formal handover of the former british colony of hong kong in 1997 to chinese , charles also memorably described the officials taking part in ceremony as â appalling old waxworks â
two years later let it be known he was boycotting a buckingham palace banquet in honour of the then visiting president of chinese , jiang zemin
william âs grandfather , prince prince , also has form in the country
during the queen âs 1986 visit to chinese he memorably caused enormous offence by telling a group of british students : â if you stay here much longer , you âll all be slitty - eyed
â something of a herd of elephants in the room , then , for 32 - year - old william to manoeuvre â and that âs even before he flies to the west of the country to visit chinese âs own dwindling band of wild asian elephants and convince the locals to curb their demand for ivory and other illegal animals products
first , however , he will spend a morning in beijing , visiting the exquisite forbidden city â the ancient home of chinese âs deposed emperors - as well as a traditional hutong , a traditional narrow alley unique to the country
he will also meet several senior communist party leaders , including , it is believed , the chinese premier , li keqiang
with chinese on course to overtake the united states as the world âs largest economy , the british government is keen to foster positive diplomatic relationships - and william âs visit will be seen as part of that
given the sensitivity of these meetings the prince â who is putting off becoming a full - time working royal for at least two years to work as an air ambulance pilot â will have to show both maturity and diplomatic dexterity
the royal is scheduled to visit the forbidden city â the ancient home of chinese âs deposed emperors ( pictured : william with barbara woodward ) he will no doubt be grateful for the assured presence of the queen âs favourite diplomat , sir david manning , who has accompanied him to the far east at her request
later on monday he will fly to shanghai to embark on a concerted push to promote british business and culture when he opens the government âs great festival of creativity at the city âs long museum
the festival is designed to showcase british innovation and creativity in everything from fashion to health , technology , education and entertainment
he will even attend the premiere of home - grown success story paddington , although william will be too busy to see the actual film
it âs a packed programme and while there is palpable disappointment that the prince âs wife , the duchess of cambridge , had been forced to remain at home due to the advanced stage of her second pregnancy , william has made the right noises so far , it seems
earlier in the day the prince was in northern japan , where he was greeted by chinese - style lions thousands of well wishers lined the streets during his visit to the chime of hope shopping centre in onagawa , northern japan earlier today in japan he even threw his usual caution to the wind and was persuaded to don a samurai outfit â although drew the line at a ponytailed wig
earlier today he looked delighted to be greet by a traditional lion dance as he visited the north - eastern city of ishinomaki , which was devastated by a tsunami in 2011 , which killed some 19,000 people
william placed a bouquet at a hilltop shrine and was mobbed by wellwishers , taken aback by the prince âs willingness to interact , in stark comparison with the rather staid nature of their own imperial family
william placed a bouquet at a hilltop shrine for the victims of march 11 , 2011 earthquake and tsunami in ishinomaki , japan prince william took a moment to remember the victims of the tsunami at the hilltop shrine
