' as well as having no choice but to leave work , i now need assistance with basic household tasks and i ca n't drive â so am almost entirely reliant on my wife , family and friends
' i have completely lost my independence as i can not bear weight on my leg
' the holiday to the tropicana jasmine hotel has become memorable for all of the wrong reasons
' i just hope that no - one else faces what i have been through , which is why tour operators and resorts have to make sure that the safety of holidaymakers is a top priority
' mr mark robson and his wife gillian 's holiday in august 2010 was the first time the couple had been on away since their honeymoon 16 years earlier
just one day into the holiday mr mark robson felt a pain in his right foot and noticed it was bleeding as he stepped out of the pool
he said : ' i realised i must have caught it on the lining of the pool , which was quite sharp and had what seemed to be a rough concrete surface
' i got it bandaged up but thought it would heal fairly quickly like a standard wound
' it stopped me from swimming for the rest of the holiday and also stopped us going on an excursion or two , but ultimately i did n't think there would be any lasting damage
' when he returned to the uk , medics at a walk - in centre told him his toe may be infected so he went to sunderland royal hospital and was prescribed antibiotics
mr mark robson underwent an operation in 2012 to remove all of his toes and part of his bone from his right foot

in february this year he had another operation in which doctors removed his remaining toes

he has now been awarded Â£ 25,000 to help with his living and care costs
