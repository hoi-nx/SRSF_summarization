eating an apple a day does not actually keep the doctor away - but it might stop you going to your pharmacist
researchers looked at data on 8,399 us adults and initially found evidence to support the proverb
they discovered that those who had one small apple a day had a nine per cent lower chance of visiting the doctor several times a year
however when they adjusted their statistics for other factors , their conclusions changed
the university of michigan researchers adjusted for ways that â apple eaters might be very different from everyone else , â such as how they were less likely to smoke and be more educated
eating an apple a day does not actually keep the doctor away - but it might stop you going to your pharmacist
apple eaters were less likely to use prescription medicines , researchers found considering those factors , the study found that people who eat an apple a day were just as likely as everyone else to go to doctors
they were also just as likely to stay overnight in a hospital or visit a mental health professional
apple eaters were , however , less likely to use prescription medication
of the 8,399 adults who took part in the study 753 , or nine per cent , ate an apple a day while 7,646 , or 91 per cent , did not
lead author matthew davis , an assistant professor at the university of michigan 's school of nursing , said : â our findings suggest that the promotion of apple consumption may have limited benefit in reducing national health care spending
â in the age of evidence - based assertions , however , there may be merit to saying : â an apple a day keeps the pharmacist away
' â apples have long been known to promote good health and contain vitamin c , which aids the immune system
they also reduce tooth decay by cleaning the teeth and may even protect your brain cells from conditions like alzheimer âs
the proverb about eating an apple a day can be traced back to pembrokeshire in the 1860s where it was said by locals
apple eaters were less likely to use prescription medicines , less likely to smoke and more educated than non-apple eaters , researchers found the original version is said to be : â eat an apple on going to bed , and you âll keep the doctor from earning his bread â
over the years it became : â an apple a day , no doctor to pay â and : â an apple a days sends the doctor away â
the modern use of the phrase was first recorded in 1922
wendy brannen , director of public relations for the us apple association , said that the research should not put people off eating apples
she said : â while we appreciate the university of michigan ( a top apple - growing state , by the way ) took the time to put the " apple a day " adage to the test , it 's foolish to even imply you should n't enjoy a daily apple for your health when centuries of advice and stacks of current research would imply otherwise
