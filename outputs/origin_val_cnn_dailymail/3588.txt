hart has declared that he totally respects the authority of manuel pellegrini , as the manchester city boss comes under increased pressure at the etihad stadium following defeat to barcelona
the goalkeeper was outstanding as manchester city were beaten 3 - 1 on aggregate in the champions league last - 16 , with only his string of saves over the two legs preventing manuel pellegrini 's side from an even more embarrassing result
hart was dropped by the chilean following a poor run of form last season , but returned soon afterwards as manchester city went on to win the premier league title and the league cup

' it was bad because i never wanted to come out the team , but i had to - the manager made his decision , ' said hart
' i thought he was fantastic with me how he was
' as a manager , i totally respect his authority
he had a decision to make , he did nât just flip a board and suddenly you âre not playing
' i just wanted to use the time for the best , and when i did come in , i wanted it to feel natural
i just wanted to slot in
i did nât want to come in and make a million saves
i did nât want to come in and change a game
i just wanted to slot back in , that âs the way it should be , and carry on
' hart ( left ) , robert green ( centre ) and james training with england during the 2010 world cup in south africa manuel pellegrini gestures in frustration on the touchline during manchester city 's 1 - 0 defeat at barcelona his side were eventually beaten 3 - 1 on aggregate in the last - 16 of the champions league for the second time , manchester city have struggled in the premier league following a title - winning campaign , and hart admits his side have n't been good enough this year
' we âve definitely got the capabilities and we âve got the team , ' he continued
' but that âs only half the battle in this league
it does nât matter how good you are , or how good you think you are
it âs what you do on the day and you can lose against anyone
' i âve only had two ( titles ) to defend
i can only speak from that experience and the first one we did find hard because we âd built on everything to get it
' i think we would openly admit that the season afterwards we expected that we would do it , that we had cracked it and that we were going to be that team
' but we were nât
we had to fight tooth and nail
we had to change managers
we had to change players
we had to come against all odds to win the league again last season
so i think we are all well aware of how hard it is to win the league in the first place , let alone back to back
' but like i say , with the team and set up that we âve got , we âve got everything in the right places
that said , to do it is another thing and at the moment it is proving difficult
but we are going to keep trying
' hart has won the league cup , fa cup and premier league with manchester city , but still has designs on winning the champions league , completing a medal haul never managed by an english goalkeeper in history
he added : ' ( my dream is ) to keep winning those three ( domestic titles ) as many times as possible and to try and add the champions league to it
' ivan rakitic ( second left ) scored the only goal of the game past hart as barcelona won 1 - 0 on wednesday but hart was otherwise superb during the result , with the spanish press calling him a ' phenomenon ' hart rates germany and bayern munich goalkeeper manuel neuer as the best in the world in his position the 27 - year - old stopper received praise from all corners of europe following his display at barcelona , with some spanish press even referring to him as a ' phenomenon '
but hart still rates germany and bayern munich goalkeeper manuel neuer as the best in the world in his position
' his style is something that i do nât think technically you can coach , ' said hart
' people have got wrapped up in the whole flying out and tackling people and that side of it is not for me , to be honest
' but manuel pellegrini in terms of dominating a game , being hard to beat , winning world cups
i remember him right back from when we played him ( i did nât play â i âd got booked in the semi-final ) in the under 21 tournaments , just seeing this colossal guy in goal
' he has kept going and from a few times of meeting him , i like everything about him
i âve heard some very important people in football say what an animal , and what an amazing talent he is
