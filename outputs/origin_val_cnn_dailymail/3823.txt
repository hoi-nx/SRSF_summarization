the perfect end to a rewarding week
england âs five - day stay in the czech republic finished with a win that enhanced their credentials for summer success
england went olomouc on monday to familiarise themselves with the place they will call home and under - 21 head coach gareth southgate was thrilled with how the experiment went
he was even happier , then , after carroll âs goal in prague chiselled out victory for a much - changed side
having flattened inferior opponents in qualifying for euro 2015 , gareth southgate was keen to see how his squad will fare against better nations and so far , it has gone how he wanted
portugal â who will be opponents in group b â were beaten in november and now the hosts have gone the same way
carroll celebrates his goal during the international match between czech republic u21 and england u21 though this performance against the host nation was not the flashiest but it had showed qualities that england will need if they are to go all the way
more than anything , it proved there is strength a depth beneath the core
â i thought we did some very good things , â gareth southgate noted
â there were also plenty of things we can improve on
the czechs are a good side and they put us under pressure but we still wanted to play the same way
it was a good test
â there were four debutants in this experimental line - up , most notably arsenal defender calum chambers , and for periods in the first half england lacked the cohesion of a team that has played regularly together
as an attacking force , they offered little
the england under 21 squad celebrate as they take the lead against czech republic on friday night one thing , though , that was not in question was their fight to keep the czechs at bay
nobody embodied the spirit more than carroll â whom gareth southgate called a ' super footballer ' â who was well placed in the 29th minute to kick a header from watford striker matej vydra off the line
gareth southgate anticipated this being a game when england would have a lot of the ball and be on the front foot but the opposite was true ; the physically strong czechs kept pushing england further and further back and the visitors â passing was not sharp as it can be at their most fluent
it was clear from looking at gareth southgate âs demeanour he was not happy with what he was seeing
he strode purposely down the tunnel at the interval and whatever he said worked as england re-emerged purpose
england u21 ace pritchard skips over czech republic star tom kalas during the game at letna stadium they were immediately aggressive and within three minutes , they had taken the lead
chambers surged forward and zipped in a cross that tomas kalas â the chelsea defender on loan at middlesbrough â failed to clear and carroll took advantage , sweeping in from eight yards
here was another indication of his tenacity : he took a heavy blow to the ankle when scoring his first international goal since august 2013 and hobbled away as his team - mates raced over to him ; the swansea midfielder managed just another five minutes before his night ended
â we think he will be ok for monday , â said gareth southgate
â he just caught his ankle a bit
but he produced a real captain âs performance
he is at a club that really suits the way he plays and is developing physically
there is no reason why he ca nât score more goals
â cauley woodrow looks to beat czech republic u21 ace matej hanousek at letna stadium in prague his replacement , derby âs will hughes , almost made an immediate impression when skipping past a number of challenges to set up pritchard but , somehow , a posse of red shirts managed to smuggle the ball away from danger
with the bit between their teeth , england looked for a second but ultimately , they could not find a way through and in the final 20 minutes they were penned back
that they came through it was thanks to an outstanding cameo from everton defender john stones
so another test has been passed and now germany await on monday
negotiate that and england really will start to dream
â this was a game we needed with small margins , â said gareth southgate
â we enjoyed qualifying but we are playing real football now
â gareth southgate described england 's win as ' real football ' following their narrow victory on friday night
