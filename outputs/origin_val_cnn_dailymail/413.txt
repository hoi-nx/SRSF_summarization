what an incredible day of rugby that was
i thought it might be exciting , i hoped it would be exciting but never did i think it would hit the levels it did
what a shame , then , that scotland allowed themselves to get caught up in the story which unfolded rather than focus on their task at hand
in the second half at murrayfield , vern cotter âs men lost the plot rather than doing the basics right and there did not seem to be anyone giving direction in the last 20 minutes
it is an inexperienced side and we saw that naivety in spades on saturday
scotland 's dismal six nations campaign ended with a 40 - 10 thrashing by ireland at murrayfield scotland should not concede 40 points at home and lose by a margin of 30 points to ireland
a championship that promised so much has , ultimately , delivered very little and scotland âs dismal run in the six nations continues
in 12 matches , we have won only once and that was courtesy of a last - minute drop goal in rome last season
that says it all really
it is particularly painful when placed against the style and substance displayed by the irish , england , france and wales on what was a stunning day
for the tournament to go down to the last second of the last game was amazing but it was what happened in the lead - up to those tense dying moments which made saturday truly remarkable
scotland 's huge loss on saturday was their fifth in the tournament and they finished bottom of the table i thought wales would rack up a load of points against italy but they only did this in a devastating second - half display
as that game was drawing to a close , with wales 28 points better off than ireland and looking like scoring again , it appeared that it was game over and wales would win the six nations
but they missed the chance and italy scored down the other end
there was a collective cheer in italy , ireland and england because it gave the latter two countries a chance
i felt wales were still favourites as , although i thought ireland and england would win their games , i did nât think they would be able to accumulate enough points to go above wales
how wrong i was ! i felt it was a perfect day for scotland to really show what they were all about because there was no pressure on them whatsoever and they could just go out and play with total freedom
to a point , they did this but so did ireland â and they did it far better than their hosts
ireland were crowned six nations winners after a dramatic final day that saw them edge england and wales both england and ireland had targets they knew they had to win by to have a chance of lifting the six nations trophy
this very rarely happens in rugby and i thought this might mean their focus would be on scoring tries rather than playing the game in the normal safety - first manner
england did adopt this approach and it ultimately cost them but ireland were able to operate a normal game plan , mainly because of how scotland were playing
it was an exciting first half where ireland dominated the early stages but scotland hung in and eventually played some really good rugby that led to finn russell âs try
that was just about it for scotland and the last 40 minutes of the championship was painful â with so many mistakes , turnovers , penalties conceded and poor leadership
england beat france 55 - 35 at twickenham but it was n't enough to overhaul ireland wales had earlier moved into pole position when they beat italy 61 - 20 in rome with that thumping victory , ireland set england a target of 26 points that they had to win by to snatch the trophy
the difference in this game was that france really did come to the party and easily produced their best performance of the six nations
mind you , so did england â and 90 points scored tells you that the attack was very much on top with defence an optional extra at times
that england came within a metre and six points of winning the six nations was incredible and the drama was off the scale
when france won a penalty after 80 minutes had passed , the whole of ireland celebrated but the drama was not over
inexplicably , france ran the penalty on their own line and gave england one more chance to win the ball back and caused a nation to have a collective heart attack
eventually they saw sense and kicked the ball out to finish off the most amazing day in the history of the six nations
when the dust settled , ireland were crowned six nations champions but huge credit goes to england , wales and france for their contribution to an incredible day
as for scotland and italy , they contributed as well but in a very different way .
