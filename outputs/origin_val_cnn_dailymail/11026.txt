gidman hit his neighbour irene wills , 75 , in his ford focus , crushing her against a wall
the grandmother of three had to have her leg amputated and died in agony in hospital six days later , leaving her husband of 52 years bereft

wheelchair - bound gidman , 80 , from stoke-on-trent , ( pictured above with friends outside court ) was sitting in his stationary car when his foot slipped on the accelerator and the vehicle crashed into irene wills ' a two - year driving ban and a Â£ 500 fine for taking my wife 's life is ludicrous , ' he said
â i âm not an awful person but if you lose your wife you expect more than this
' everybody thought it was going to be in the crown court but he has been given a slap on the wrists
mr joe wills , from norton , stoke-on-trent - on - trent , did not attend court earlier this week after being told by police that the matter was likely to be transferred to the crown court
however , gidman pleaded guilty to causing mrs irene wills âs death through careless driving at his first appearance at north staffordshire justice centre , and was immediately sentenced by magistrates
' i was waiting for the case to be sent off to crown court - i thought it was impossible when i heard he had been sentenced on tuesday , ' said mr joe wills
' the charge should have have been much more serious - it is shocking
â i actually thought they were kidding me
he has got away scot - free for killing my wife
â we had the best life together and it was cruelly snatched away like this and all he gets is a slap on the wrist , and has the cheek to laugh about it
i am still distraught and really very angry that justice has not been served
i will love irene wills until the day i die
i just can not believe that a life can be that cheap
â irene wills ( pictured above with her husband joe ) , died aged 75 , after being pinned against a wall by gidman 's car after his foot slipped on the accelerator
she had a leg amputated but died from her injuries chairman of the bench howard ball told gidman : â we feel no amount of fines or other community activity is going to change this very , very sad situation
â outside court , wheelchair - bound gidman was seen laughing with friends
magistrates heard gidman was waiting for his daughter in his car in a doctor âs surgery car park when his foot slipped on to the accelerator
the car leapt forward in a 90 - degree arc , propelled by â high - level harsh acceleration â , crossed a road , then hit mrs irene wills , a retired kitchen assistant , as she walked just yards from her home
the court heard how witnesses reported a ' high - level harsh acceleration ' of a car before it crashed into mrs irene wills
she was taken to the university hospital of north staffordshire where medics were forced to amputate one of her legs but she died six days later
at the court hearing yesterday , prosecutor andrew bodger said : ' mr gidman had been to the surgery close to the scene of the accident
he got in the car , which was an automatic , while his daughter went to a chemist 's shop nearby to fetch a prescription
' the ford focus with the defendant at the wheel shot forward out of the car park in a 90 degree arc and ended up hitting mrs irene wills who was walking along knypersley road
gidman ( pictured outside court ) admitted causing death by driving without due care and attention and was handed a two - year driving ban and fined Â£ 500 ' she suffered very severe injuries and had to have part of her leg , above the knee , amputated
' right from the outset the defendant said his foot had slipped from the brake pedal on to the accelerator
' mr joe wills , a retired national union of mineworkers regional president , met his wife when they were teenagers
they married in 1962 , aged 21 and 23 , and had one child , valerie , three years later
their daughter , who lives in san francisco with her family , said mrs irene wills had only stepped out for a â breath of fresh air â when she was struck by the car
police investigators found gidman âs vehicle had no mechanical defects
simon dykes , defending , said gidman suffered a â momentary lapse in concentration with tragic circumstances â
he added : â mr gidman knew the lady involved in the collision which makes it more difficult for him
he has been absolutely devastated by what has occurred
â the court heard gidman handed in his driving licence the day after the collision
he was not using a wheelchair at the time
all driving licences expire when the holder turns 70
to continue driving , motorists need to renew their licences before they turn 70 , then every three years after that
but there is no requirement for them to re-take their driving test or have their licence reviewed because of their age
sarah - jane martin , of road safety charity brake , said : â statistically , older drivers are less likely to be involved in a crash as they are more experienced and tend to take fewer risks
â however ... brake believes fitness to drive regulations need to be strengthened to prevent needless tragedies , particularly through the introduction of compulsory sight checks
â when someone admits causing death by their own careless driving , it should warrant a penalty that properly reflects the severity of the crime and its impact on others
â anything less is likely to serve as an insult to bereaved families , and does little to encourage people to take greater care behind the wheel and prevent future tragedies
â joe wills , 77 , of stoke-on-trent , staffordshire , said he had lost ' the best wife in the world ' and expressed disappointment at gidman 's punishment
he said : ' a ban and a Â£ 500 fine for taking my wife 's life is ludicrous ' as well as being banned from the road for two years and fined Â£ 500 , wheelchair - bound gidman was also told to pay Â£ 85 costs at the hearing
irene wills 's daughter valerie , who has three children , said : ' i 'm heartbroken
my mum was my best friend
' even though i live in california we would speak every day.i 'm really going to miss her
when she went outside - it was just to get some fresh air
' my mum was a kind , caring and incredibly loving
her grandchildren love her to bits and call her grammy
' she loved my dad
they were best buddies and it breaks my heart because now my dad 's on his own
