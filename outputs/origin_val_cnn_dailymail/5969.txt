durst 's enigmatic second wife is the ' mastermind ' who controls the couple 's real estate fortune , according to anonymous sources
debra charatan , 58 , married the 71 - year - old in 2000 and sources have claimed she ' knew things were going to blow up before he was arrested ' last weekend
debra charatan , a powerful real estate agent in manhattan , is also understood to manage durst 's estimated $ 65 million fortune
real estate millionaire durst was arrested last saturday in new orleans for the 2000 murder of his friend susan berman
in 2003 , he was acquitted of murder in a dismemberment death in texas
his arrest came shortly before the finale of the hbo series ' the jinx ' which detailed his links to the three killings
the source told the new york post that charatan had allegedly arranged to fly durst to cuba ahead of his arrest and said : ' she knew stuff was coming down
' she 's very , very smart
any time he 's in trouble , she 's leaving and going to these places
' she 's extremely cunning
people call her a shark
' last night , durst was moved to the elayn hunt correctional center , a jail equipped to deal with the mentally ill , an orleans parish sheriff 's spokesman said
in one episode of ' the jinx ' , one interviewee said : ' a lot of people believe debbie knows bob 's secrets , whatever they may be
' the source went on to describe debra charatan and durst 's relationship as ' very businesslike ' and said : ' he asks her opinion on things , and she tells him the truth
' they added : ' while the documentary was ongoing , she was acting like everything was fine
only now is she 's realizing that a volcano is about to erupt and it will be a real s * * t show , ' arrested : durst is pictured being transported from orleans parish criminal district court to the orleans parish prison after his arraignment on tuesday sources have also claimed that debra charatan ' knew a lot of stuff ' about durst when she married him in 2000
the pair had been close friends for years before that - even before durst 's first wife , kathie , vanished in 1982
it is believed they first met in dated in 1988 and briefly lived together in 1990 before separating
the couple were married in december 2000 â a month after durst discovered that authorities were reopening their probe into his first wife 's disappearance
as his wife , charatan gained spousal privilege , which meant she would not have to testify against him
moved : last night , durst was moved to the elayn hunt correctional center , a jail equipped to deal with the mentally ill , an orleans parish sheriff 's spokesman said
durst was charged on monday in los angeles with first - degree murder in the shooting of susan berman , the daughter of a prominent las vegas mobster
he could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime
a california police department is also interested in speaking with the law enforcement agencies that have investigated durst in connection with a teenage girl who went missing in the late 90s , reported nbc news

her friend , durst was charged with her murder on monday eureka police department chief andy mills has said that he would like to talk to investigators who have dug into durst 's past in connection with the disappearance of karen mitchell , who was 16 when she went missing from eureka , california , in 1997
in the documentary ' the jinx : the life and deaths of durst ' , durst mumbled about how he ' killed them all , ' providing a dramatic finale to the series
durst appears to confess to killing multiple people when he thinks the audio on his microphone is off
but los angeles police have insisted his arrest has nothing to do with the recording or the screening of the documentary
yesterday , authorities removed two boxes after searching the houston home of durst
a marked police car and three unmarked cars were in front of a 17 - story building in houston 's rice village neighborhood where durst has three condominiums
at least five plainclothes officers were working inside the guarded building
two officers were seen walking to a nearby unmarked car , retrieving a small bag from the trunk and returning to the building
dick deguerin , durst 's defence attorney , said he was baffled by what investigators could be looking for in the condominium building
he said : ' i think it 's a publicity stunt
i 'm not surprised by it , but i would really be surprised if they found anything of any evidentiary value
' missing : durst 's first wife , kathleen mccormack ( pictured left ) , has been missing since 1982
her brother , jim mccormack , said that following the hbo show he hoped durst would have an ' epiphany of conscience ' and tell them what happened to his sister
