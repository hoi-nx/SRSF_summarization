crimmins has been banned from using online dating sites after he punched a woman he met on the internet in the face a judge has taken the unusual step of banning a violent misogynist from all online dating sites after he punched a woman he met on the internet in the face
judge william gaskell told violent crimmins , 29 , of bedwas , caerphilly , that women who replied to his online dating profile ' did not know what they were getting into '
qualified fitter crimmins pleaded guilty to unlawfully wounding his then - girlfriend evans in january this year - four months after meeting her through a dating site
the court heard he had been at her home in llanrumney , cardiff , complaining about repairs needed to his car when she made a joke and was punched in the eye by crimmins
she needed hospital treatment and the split above her right eye had to be stitched
but it was his previous appearances before judges and magistrates which shocked the court
lloyd , prosecuting , said they included not only violence against women but even against one partner 's five - year - old child
mr lloyd said in 2008 crimmins , then in his early 20s , had assaulted a woman in bedwas by pulling her hair and punching and grabbing her by the throat
just over a year later , in september 2009 , he was at grays gardens in caerphilly when he grabbed a woman around the neck as she was holding a young baby
' it is not known if it was the same woman but each is listed as domestic violence , ' mr lloyd told the court
' and the same address in grays gardens is given for the location of three more offences of assault in 2010 when a woman was punched and a five - year - old child had a towel placed around his neck before he was pulled off a chair , causing bruising
' the boy was also shaken on another occasion
' in 2011 crimmins was back before another court for what was described as an ' incident ' with a partner in blaengarw , bridgend
cardiff crown court ( pictured ) heard crimmins has a long history of being violent towards his partners mr lloyd said : ' they had a verbal argument over his driving and when they got home he pushed her into a cupboard under the stairs and closed the door
' that was in october and in december he was in another argument with her when he put his arm around her neck and held her in a headlock , restricting her breathing and causing her to vomit
' judge william gaskell said a point had been made that crimmins managed to stay out of trouble from that time until this year
but he told him : ' it really shows how utterly contemptible you are if that is thought to be an achievement
' the court heard crimmins ( pictured ) has a problem with women and ' needs to change his ways ' crimmins ' own solicitor described him as a man who had a problem with women , saying : ' he 's a misogynist who needs to change his ways
' edward mitchard , defending , said the prospect for future partners had to be considered and the risk to them would be reduced if crimmins went on a special programme
judge william gaskell said the programmes had failed in 2008 and 2009 but agreed the court had a public duty to try again
' you are not fit to be on a dating site or in any relationship , ' the senior circuit judge sitting at cardiff crown court told him
' women would have nothing to do with you if they knew they were contacting a serial abuser
' ' i am not unduly optimistic but this behaviour has to stop , ' he told the defendant as he gave him an eight - month prison sentence suspended for two years with supervision
he also ordered crimmins to complete 250 hours unpaid work and attend a ' building better relationships ' course
' what happened to ms evans was that she fell into a relationship with you while you are quite unfit to have a relationship with anyone , ' the judge said
' she put her trust in a violent man who likes hitting women
' he also imposed a four - month night - time curfew ' to curtail your social life ' and made a restraining order keeping him away from ms evans , her home and any dating site
' it is necessary to protect those who may be at risk of violence from you , ' he said .
