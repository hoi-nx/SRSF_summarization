a mother who witnessed a paediatrician hog - tying her seven - year - old son during a consultation has called for the doctor to be deregistered
one of australia 's leading experts in child behaviour , dr davis , pleaded guilty to assault after allegedly sitting on the young boy 's back at a gold coast clinic in october 2012
the mother , who can not be identified for legal reasons , took photos of the incident on her camera phone which show mr davis tying her son 's hands behind his back and ankles together
fearing her son may have had aspergers , the mother raised concerns with mr davis but she never expected he would use a rope as a technique to control her son 's behaviour
' he just told me that he was going to prove to me that he did n't have aspergers and that 's when he [ son ] was tied up , ' the distraught mother said
' he told me an aspergers child would be screaming their lungs out by now
that was his way of telling me he does n't have aspergers
' aspergers syndrome is a condition that falls within the autism spectrum
people with the condition often have difficulty forming friendships and communicating with others , as well as having difficulty understanding social rules and interpreting the body language of others , according to the victorian state health department
despite her photo evidence , dr davis was hit with just a 12 - month , $ 1000 good behaviour bond with no conviction recorded for the alleged assault
' i am absolutely furious
i 'll never have that closure that i needed to see him standing there getting the guilty verdict i knew he 'd deserved , ' the mother said
