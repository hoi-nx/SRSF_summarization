religious protests have been planned in opposition to northern ireland 's first ever home sunday fixture against finland
the national side have played overseas on a sunday in the past , most recently in their opening euro 2016 qualifier in hungary , but this weekend will break new ground in belfast
the ifa has been careful in the past not to arrange sunday fixtures , and once had an article of association enshrining such a policy , but was powerless to act once uefa introduced its ' week of football ' blueprint for the current qualifying campaign
but that cuts no ice with critics , some of whom have called on the ifa to boycott the fixture
a general view of windsor park during a world cup qualifier between northern ireland and slovakia in 2009 the free presbyterian church is planning to hold a service at its tyndale memorial church , located just a few hundred yards from windsor park , 75 minutes before the 5pm kick - off
the evangelical protestant society , meanwhile , has issued a statement expressing its dismay at events
' this will be the first time an international football match has been held in belfast on a sunday , and it marks another watershed moment in modern ulster 's increasing rejection of the lord 's day , ' it read
' far too many sporting and social events are now organised on sundays with , it seems , scant regard for the rights of evangelicals who , because of their faith , are unable to be involved
many evangelical protestants are ardent fans of the national team and would dearly love to be present at the match
' we fully accept that we are out of step with the majority of public opinion on this matter , and we suspect that many who claim to be protestants will be present at windsor park on sunday
' northern ireland boss michael o'neill , speaking earlier this week to the belfast telegraph , said : ' we appreciate and understand people 's religious beliefs - but the game must be played on sunday , as that date was decreed when the fixture was made by uefa
northern ireland manager michael o'neill gestures on the touchline at hampden park on wednesday evening ' we hope for a victory on the night , and for the usual wonderful support from all northern ireland fans
' there was a conciliatory message from mcallister , chairman of the amalgamation of northern ireland supporters ' clubs
mcallister told press association sport : ' we understand there will be a protest near the stadium and that is their right
i imagine it will be very peaceful and they are fully entitled to do that
' but this is not an ifa decision and i do n't think suggestions that the game is forfeited are realistic at all
' it is clearly a matter of choice
some fans have made the decision not to attend for sincerely held beliefs and no doubt they are passionate as any other fans
' i fully respect those who oppose it but it must be , and it will be , played
