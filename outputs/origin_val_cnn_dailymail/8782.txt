a tooth belonging to a peking man â an ancient human ancestor that lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago - has been re-discovered after being lost for decades
it was found in one of 40 forgotten boxes at the museum of evolution at uppsala university , sweden , allowing scientists to re-examine it using modern techniques
from wear - and - tear on the canine tooth , they say that the individual it belonged to was quite old when she died and probably gnawed on bones and crunched on hard nuts
a tooth belonging to the peking man â an ancient human ancestor that lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago - has been re-discovered after being lost for decades in an unopened box in a museum fossils , including a number of teeth , were found in caves in zhoukoudian near beijing in the 1920s , but most of the pieces were lost in the chaos of world war two
the tooth surfaced in 2011 in a box that had never been unpacked or studied since it was shipped from chinese in the 1920s
the tooth indicates that peking man ( a bust is pictured ) gnawed on bones and ate nuts two chinese palaeontologists , liu wu and tong haowen from the institute of vertebrate palaeontology and palaeoanthropology ( ivpp ) in beijing have now examined the tooth and it has at last been described in the journal acta anthropologica sinica
they quickly determined that it was a canine tooth from a peking man
â it is a spectacular find , â said ahlberg , who was one of the team who came across it in the box
â we can see numerous details that tell us about this individual âs life
â the crown of the tooth is relatively small , which indicates that it belonged to a woman
â the tooth is quite worn , so the individual must have been quite old when she died
â in addition , two large chips have been knocked out of the enamel , as if hit by something , or perhaps by biting into something really hard such as a bone or a hard nut
â at least one of the chips was old when the individual died , since it is partly worn down
â dr ahlberg told mailonline the woman may have been between 30 and 40 years old when she died , which was a ripe age at the time
previous studied have shown that the peking man used fire to stay warm and wore animal hides
the very first samples of the prehistoric ancestor were found by otto zdansky from uppsala university in the 1920s and are on show alongside a third tooth discovered in the 1950s , at the museum
it became a world sensation in 1927 when crania and other bones were found at the site by wenhao weng of the geological survey of chinese and canadian davidson black , who had taken over the excavations
peking man , an ancient human ancestor lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago
the name describes the species , not an individual and around 15 partial crania have been found
examination of a tooth now shows that the species ate nuts and meat with wear and tear indicating he gnawed on bones
in order to survive the harsh weather , peking man would have needed to be able to create and manage fire , and now there is solid proof to back this theory in the form of soil samples
it 's thought the peking man wore animal hides that had been softened using stone tools
belonging to the species homo erectus , the peking man was also able to make bizarrely drilled holed objects , but it is not understood why
fossils , including a number of teeth , were found in caves in zhoukoudian ( marked on the map with an ' a ' ) near beijing in the 1920s , but most of the pieces were lost in the chaos of world war two the peking man became a world sensation in 1927 when crania ( pictured ) and other bones were found at the site by wenhao weng of the geological survey of chinese and canadian davidson black sadly , the unique collection disappeared during the chaos of the world war two and has never been found since , but over the last decades , several fossils of homo erectus have been found in other parts of the world
â â we now know that the species is a direct ancestor to the modern man
â however , the lost materials of the peking man remain one of palaeontology âs greatest mysteries and most tragic losses â , said dr ahlberg
archaeologists first arrived in zhoukoudian in 1921 where they were directed to the site by quarrymen
first , human teeth were found at the site but it was canadian scientist davidson black who made some of the most significant discoveries , including a skull , despite his initial findings being treated with scepticism by scientists around the world
around 200 fossils were gathered until excavation came to an end in 1937 with the japanese invasion
sadly , the vast majority of the finds disappeared during the chaos of the world war two and have never been found since , making the discovery of the tooth especially important fossils were placed in the cenozoic research laboratory of the peking union medical college for safe - keeping , before being packed up for the us in 1941
but the fossils were inexplicably lost as they were being transported through northern chinese
it is still unknown what happened to the fossils with some believing they sank on japanese ship the awa maru in 1945
us financier christopher janus appealed for information on their whereabouts in 1972 , promising a reward of $ 5,000
one woman made contact , demanding $ 500,000 , but nothing ever came of the approach
the chinese government also initiated a committee to locate the fossils to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the end of world war two.the fossils , however , have yet to be located .
