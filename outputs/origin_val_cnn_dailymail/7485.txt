the party reportedly took cash from a journalist posing as a businessman who registered the donation as coming from his stepfather

a lib dem spokesman said lord strasburger â recorded discussing the donation in a channel 4 dispatches investigation â denied wrongdoing

parties are required to identify all donors who have given more than Â£ 7,500
but because only the name of the donors are published , it can be difficult to identify individuals with a common name such as martin taylor
yesterday , under further pressure from newspapers , labour party issued a statement from mr martin taylor which identified him as a hedge fund millionaire
the donor said : ' there is no mystery
this ' martin taylor ' is me
i am a born and bred londoner , who also happens to be a hedge fund manager
and i am proud to support the labour party
' the 46 - year - old runs a fund for nevsky capital and at one point was in charge of more than Â£ 2billion of funds
he said his support reflected a belief that ' everyone should contribute to society and that those who are lucky enough to earn a lot should contribute more '
mr martin taylor is domiciled in the uk for tax purposes
sir alistair graham , the former chairman of the committee on standards in public life , told the bureau of investigative journalism that the revelation exposed labour party to a charge of hypocrisy and the party should detail all donations
