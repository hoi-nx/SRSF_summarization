for burnley , a famous victory
for champions city , plenty of soul - searching required
after failing to stop george boyd , not many will fancy their chances of coping with lionel messi and luis suarez at the nou camp on wednesday
it was a famous night at turf moor , their first win over city since 1974 ranking alongside their 2009 victory against manchester united in their first season in the premier league when robbie blake scored the winner
city deserved what they got â absolutely nothing
their manager , manuel pellegrini , looked pale and drawn by the final whistle as well he might
city dominated possession but not energy , commitment or even goal chances
george boyd scored burnley 's winner with a sweetly struck shot into the bottom corner vincent kompany 's clearance fell straight to george boyd who caught it sweetly with his left foot george boyd celebrates his 61st minute strike at turf moor on saturday night burnley ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : tom heaton 6.5 , kieran trippier 6.5 , michael duff 6.5 , shackell 7 , mee 6 , george boyd 8 , arfield 7 , jones 7 , ashley barnes 6 , vokes 6.5 ( ward 87 ) , ings 7 ( reid 90 )

click here to see more from sportsmail 's match zone they are still five points behind leaders chelsea , having played two games more , and the immediate reaction from tv pundit jamie redknapp was that this was the type of performance by city players that gets managers the sack
it was city , not the underdogs of burnley , who used illegitimate strongarm tactics
aguero was lucky that referee marriner did not spot his studs - up challenge that caught michael duff on the ankle
demichelis crudely targeted burnley dangerman ings and caught him in the leg , chin and back of the head on at least three occasions
the argentine was very fortunate not to sent off on the totting - up procedure
everywhere you looked there was a city horror story
silva gave one of his worst performances in a city shirt and was hooked after missing their best chance from aguero âs pass
skipper vincent kompany was partly culpable for burnley âs winner after being recalled to the side
pablo zabaleta claimed a late penalty when he was challenged mee
nothing was given , correctly
burnley are still third from bottom but only one point behind sunderland in the premier league safety zone
and their winning goal after 61 minutes was excellent
kieran tripper âs delivery from a free - kick was fantastic , kompany rose to head away from goal but only to george boyd , lurking on the edge of the box
the celebrations were akin to another famous burnley goal , robbie blake 's winner against manchester united city prepare to kick off after conceding the first goal at turf moor new signing wilfried bony ca n't believe that city have slipped to another defeat the scot caught his half - volley sweetly with his left foot and it arrowed past hart into the goalkeeper âs bottom left corner
job done and george boyd described it as â the most important goal of my career â
manuel pellegrini was measured but his words rang hollow
â i do nât think we played very badly , it was a normal performance , â he said
â we just needed to create more chances
football is not about money
in the premier league any team can beat another
â on his side âs fading title prospects , he added : â we are second so we are not doing so badly
every point we drop , it will be more difficult , but when you have mathematical chances , you have to keep fighting
we must trust what we are doing and see at the end of the season
â burnley boss dyche , who has seen his side earn draws at chelsea and city this season , said : â we deserved to edge it
a lot has been made of this tough run of games but i said this is the challenge we want
â this is what the league is about and we will have a piece of it
we are brave , and were again today
â burnley did not let city settle and the visitors took half - an - hour to test goalkeeper tom heaton through edin dzeko and aguero
surprisingly , the champions resorted to rough stuff as they got frustrated
city striker aguero was frustrated by the stubborn burnley defence city striker edin dzeko has an effort blocked by burnley defence city boss manuel pellegrini saw his strongarm tactics backfire ahead of their big date in the nou camp burnley forward ashley barnes challenges city winger jesus navas burnley defender kieran trippier clears the ball from city midfielder silva city defender vincent kompany clears the ball despite challenge from burnley 's sam vokes michael duff was caught by that studs - up challenge from aguero that mr marriner missed
demichelis clumped ings on the back of the head when they jumped for a high ball and was booked for a late challenge on the same player a few minutes later
dyche looked unhappy at the time but was magnanimous after the game
â you should have seen me as a centre - half , â he quipped
city âs big chance came when aguero played in silva
the spaniard should have scored but his first touch was uncharacteristically poor and his final shot was comfortably gathered by tom heaton
city paid for it when scotland international george boyd struck after 61 minutes
the champions sent on wilfried bony , stevan jovetic and , finally , frank lampard to try to salvage a point
the cost of their substitutes , Â£ 50million , equals the sum burnley have spent on transfer fees in their entire history
the visitors did have a late penalty appeal when ben mee challenged pablo zabaleta
it was 50 - 50 as to whether the burnley player took the ball or player first , and dyche said : â i have nât seen it but we âve been on the wrong end of margins this season
if it was a penalty , maybe that âs the balance you get over the season
â city now need a miracle in barcelona to overturn a 2 - 1 first leg deficit and keep alive manuel pellegrini âs hopes of landing a trophy this season
at the other end of the table , sunderland will be nervously looking over their shoulder after this great and deserved burnley victory
city defender pablo zabaleta shows his frustration after being denied a late penalty city players ca n't hide their disappointment after another lacklustre display burnley keeper tom heaton celebrates after the final whistle on saturday night
