murray goes into his next match at the miami open against colombia âs santiago giraldo on sunday , but his great britain davis cup colleague ward has had to fly home to rest a sore knee
ward , the uk no 2 , has paid a high price for his heroic win over john isner in glasgow earlier this month , having lost three first rounds subsequently , and now finds himself out of action for two weeks
he was due to play in guadeloupe next week but instead has gone back to london , where he eventually hopes to be able to begin preparation for next month âs clay court events , once his knee has settled down
murray is gearing up for a miami open clash with colombia 's santiago giraldo on sunday ward has had to return to england to rest his sore knee , and wo n't play in guadeloupe as planned santiago giraldo , murray 's miami open opponent on sunday , is number 31 in the world rankings murray , who plays colombia âs world no 31 giraldo in the third round on sunday , expects to team up with ward this summer at queen âs club for the davis cup quarter - final against france
with the newly - extended three - week gap between the roland garros and wimbledon , it will mean six weeks of high profile grass court tennis in the uk , and murray feels the longer run - in after paris will help him
â i think it âs better for me if there are more weeks on grass , â he said
â a lot of the players will go and spend a week at home after roland garros whereas for me i can easily practise on grass , for a lot of the players it âs not easy to get on grass courts
