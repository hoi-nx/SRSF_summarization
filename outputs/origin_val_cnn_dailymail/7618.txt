cricket world cup winners australia could arrive in england this summer with arguably the most fearsome pace attack in test cricket since the ferocious west indies sides of the 1980s
less than 48 hours after claiming their one - day prize , the australian turned their attention on the summer 's ashes series
while captain michael clarke might have marked sunday 's final triumph over new zealand by confirming his retirement from the 50 - over game , his desire for test cricket success burns as bright as ever
team australia celebrate after winning the cricket world cup in melbourne cricket world cup hero glenn maxwell is the glaring omission despite starring on australia 's run to the final michael clarke was still recovering from a day - long champagne party with fans on the streets of melbourne when the australian confirmed their squad to play a test series in the west indies before arriving in england for the start of the ashes in july
and if alastair cook & co still have nightmare memories of the way they were blown apart by the pace of mitchell johnson as they suffered a 5 - 0 whitewash in australia , then there is a new nightmare to come
australia could have as many as four bowlers who have all logged speeds of 90mph plus in their line - up , with both mitchell johnson and his cricket world cup pace partner mitchell starc in the squad
they will be backed up by ryan harris , who misses the west indies trip to stay home for the birth of his first child but will then join up in time for the ashes
while 24 - year - old james pattinson is also not on the list because he is currently out with a damaged left hamstring , he will also be monitored with the chance to be included in time to travel to england
player of the tournament mitchell starc has been included in australia 's fast paced attack for the ashes mitchell johnson 's pace bowling terrorised england as australia ran out 5 - 0 victors last year michael clarke will lead a side anxious to rub away bitter memories of their last ashes tour when they were beaten 3 - 0 in 2013
cricket world cup batting hero steve smith , who averaged only 38 in that series , is a far improved batsman now and will be expected to get big runs

david warner , axed from the early tests and sent away in disgrace after throwing a punch at joe root in a nightclub , will also want to make his mark on the series
national selector marsh told cricketaustralia.com.au : ' the test team has performed very well in recent times , but the big challenge is to do that away from home

' two players who starred in the cricket world cup campaign , glenn maxwell and james faulkner , were tipped for the squad but have missed out
