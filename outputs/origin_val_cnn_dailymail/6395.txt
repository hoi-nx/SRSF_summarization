white children will be outnumbered by minority kids in the americans in just five years , new census bureau projections reveal
this is the result of an ongoing trend of declining birth among white americans and a baby boom among immigrant groups , as well as a surge in immigration
by the year 2020 , 50.2percent of all children in the americans are expected to be non-white , according to the census bureau
by 2044 , whites will be outnumbered by minorities
the census bureau study , released this week , predicts that by year 2060 , nearly 20percent of the population will be foreign born - thanks to an influx of 64million new immigrants
deadline : in less than five years , minority children will outnumber white ones
in 14 years after that , more than half of all americans will be minorities the americans will add nearly 100million people to its population in the next 40 years
64million will come from immgration and another 40million will be born to foreign - born mothers the populations of hispanic in the americans will rise 114percent - from 55million in 2014 to 63.6million in 2060 - making up about 29percent of the population
and the number of non-hispanic whites will actually likely to decline over the next 40 years - from 200million and 62percent of the population now to 182million and 44percent of the population in 2060
the number of people who identified themselves as only black will also decline about 8percent to about 59million
the number of asian-americans will also increase dramatically - even more than the hispanic population - rising 128percent to 22million
the census bureau reporty also projects a massive surge in the portion of the population that 's over age 65
by 2030 , 20percent of that population will qualify for a senior discount
in 2033 , there will be more americans over age 65 than children - thanks to the aging baby boom generation
by year 2060 , there will be 76 ' dependents ' - those over age 65 and drawing government benefits or under 18 - for every 100 working - age americans
demographers estimate that by 2060 , the population of the americans will increase by 98million - from 319million to 417million people
even so , the overall population growth of the nation will slow considerably over the next 40 years - as immigrants and the children of immigrants reach higher incomes , their fertility rates will drop - like native - born whites have
big change : this chart shows how the portion of whites in americans will fall from 62percent to 44percent in the next 40 years the portion of foreign - born residents will increase from 13percent now to nearly 20percent by year 2060 a new census bureau study , paints a demographic portrait of americans in the year 2060 than it looks today
