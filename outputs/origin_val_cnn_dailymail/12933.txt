all three of that woman 's children were unresponsive when officers encountered them friday evening , including a 7 - year - old girl who was reported dead soon thereafter , according to the palm bay police department

and on saturday , palm bay police announced on the department 's facebook page that mccarty was being charged with two counts of murder in connection with her children 's deaths
the 33 - year - old woman is also facing an attempted murder charge regarding her infant son , who was in critical condition at a nearby hospital
after initially being taken to a hospital after suffering what police called " non-life threatening injuries , " mccarty was moved to the brevard county detention center , where she 's being held without bond
she will face a judge within 24 hours to address the charges , according to the palm bay post from around midday saturday
