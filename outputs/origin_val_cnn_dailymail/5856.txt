sherrington , head of highbury grove school sent 300 pupils to detention a day during his first week in charge back in september a super-strict headmaster has transformed behaviour at his secondary school by putting more than 300 pupils a day in detention
sherrington joined highbury grove school last september and immediately enforced a tough discipline policy , which was called â orwellian â by some parents
automatic one - hour detentions were introduced for arriving late to a lesson or wearing uniform incorrectly
disruption in lessons led to a full day in an isolation room
the approach led to â huge numbers â in detention â more than 300 every day in the first week
now , the figure is about 80
however , punctuality and uniform standards at the school in islington , north london , have â improved dramatically â
the turnaround contributed to society magazine tatler naming it one of britain âs best state schools this year
writing in the times educational supplement , mr sherrington said : â standards continue to improve ; behaviour is not yet impeccable but we âre well on the way
â more and more students are prepared to admit that they like it ; the school is still a happy , friendly , supportive place â but now they can get on with learning and teachers can get on with teaching in a way that was nât always possible before
â when he started at the music specialist school there was a feeling among staff that approaches based on â restorative justice had nât really worked â
this trendy discipline method in many schools involves taking a no - blame approach to bullies
mr sherrington wrote : â the perception was that it had created a need for constant negotiation , enacted inconsistently across the school because of a lack of clarity around the rules and the consequences of breaking them
â several teachers who left last summer even cited behaviour as a reason
it was nât terrible in general , but some classes were just too hard to teach
clearly i needed to act
â in january , tatler magazine said the school , pictured , had been transformed by ' a brilliant new head ' pupils were given a set of coded warnings and consequences , so they had to make a choice between meeting standards or â sit a detention â
mr sherrington said : â after 15 weeks , the impact has been clear
uniform standards and punctuality improved dramatically almost overnight : students run into school now instead of dawdling and 99 per cent have perfect uniform
teachers are extremely positive too
â he admitted the early weeks were â tough â , with parents complaining about the detentions
some critics said it was â draconian â for pupils to sit in silence for an hour
but others urged him not to change the strategy
in january tatler said the school was â transformed â with a â brilliant new head â who was keen on â impeccable behaviour â and â details â including top buttons being done up at all times
this is in stark contrast to the school âs low point in 2005 when channel 4 âs dispatches sent an undercover teacher who filmed pupils clambering across desks , throwing books across the room and attacking each other .
