the 40p tax rate is hitting too many people on â middle incomes â , david cameron said yesterday â as he hinted at fresh action on the issue in next week âs budget
the prime minister said it was wrong that millions of people doing normal jobs like teaching are now paying a tax rate that was â only ever meant for the better off â
mr david cameron announced last year that a future conservative government would raise the threshold for paying 40p tax from Â£ 41,865 to Â£ 50,000 by 2020
but chancellor george osborne is expected to set out the aspiration during next week âs budget , including laying out the timetable for raising the threshold
tories are pushing for the first significant rise in the threshold to be made next year if the party wins the election
the number of people paying 40p tax has risen by about two million to five million since 2010 , as a result of coalition decisions to cut the threshold to help pay off the huge budget deficit left by labour
in a speech at a school in london yesterday , the prime minister yesterday pledged to start easing the pressure on middle class families
he said : â we will raise the threshold at which people start paying the 40p rate of tax
this rate was only ever meant for the better off
but over the years it âs dragged more and more people into its reach - police officers , teachers , people on middle incomes
â that âs why we will move that threshold to Â£ 50,000 â so more hardworking people can keep more of the money they earn
â the prime minister made the comments during a visit to the green school for girls in west london ( above ) mr david cameron ( pictured during his trip to west london ) also confirmed that the tories will press ahead with plans to raise the starting threshold for paying income tax to Â£ 12,500 â an ambition shared by the lib dems despite the pledge , the number of people paying 40p tax is expected to rise , albeit at a slower rate
many tory mps are pushing mr david cameron and mr george osborne to go further and faster on the issue
mr david cameron also confirmed that the tories will press ahead with plans to raise the starting threshold for paying income tax to Â£ 12,500 â an ambition that is shared by the lib dems
the threshold is already due to rise to Â£ 10,500 next month , and mr george osborne is expected to announce it will rise to Â£ 11,000 in the budget
mr david cameron said the move would be â a tax cut for 30 million people
â he added : â it will take everyone on the minimum wage working 30 hours a week out of income tax altogether
