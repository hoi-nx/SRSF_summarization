authorities had been monitoring a farm that they believed servando gã³mez martã­nez , or la tuta as he was known among members of the knights templar cartel , could possibly he using as a hideout , and thanks to the delivery of a chocolate cake from his girlfriend marã­a antonieta luna ãvalos on his birthday , their suspicions were confirmed
mexico security forces moved in on the hideout in morelia , michoacan on february 27 , and were able to capture martinez without firing a single shot
while martinez , 49 , never used a cell phone , one messenger did , and would frequently communicate on his device travelling to and from the farm
unbeknownst to that messenger however , his phone was being tracked
' michoacan now is in a better position , ' said federal police commissioner enrique galindo ceballos said
' the important parts of the [ cartel ] structure are neutralized
' the arrest was also an incredibly big boost for president enrique pena nieto as he tries to deal with the increased gang violence in the country
though frequently on the move , and at times living in caves to evade the authorities , martinez still loved the spotlight , and would often release videos in which he criticized the government for supporting other drug cartels
he was also known to hand over cash for favorable press
