assessing the situation , john booth said : ' we knew our first weekend of running would not be without its challenges
' although we had a positive day on friday , it has been important to keep our expectations for qualifying in check
' our two drivers have done a solid job and friday 's practice showed promise in terms of having the pace for the 107 per cent time
but today underlined we have a lot of work to do

being in the race , however , at least affords manor and the drivers the opportunity to make progress
' obviously i was very disappointed not to take part in qualifying , ' said stevens
' in fp3 we had a fuel system problem and we were trying to resolve that , but sadly we were n't able to get on top of it in time for me to take part
' looking at the positives , as we always try to do , the practice sessions showed promise and my times were within the 107 per cent throughout friday
' step by step we 'll get there
