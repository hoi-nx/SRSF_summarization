a popular health blogger who reportedly failed to donate $ 300,000 in profits to charity has now admitted she was ' wrong ' about the extent of her terminal cancer
the whole pantry founder gibson , whose app has about 200,000 followers , claims she was ' misdiagnosed ' by a doctor after announcing last year that life - threatening cancer had spread to her live , uterus , spleen and blood , the australian reports
the 26 - year - old , who became a social media sensation when she launched her hit lifestyle and recipe app after being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer , says she feels ' humiliated ' after a german medical team 's examination led her to announce she was battling a third and fourth cancer
the latest revelations come just a day after it emerged that ms gibson may have misled her followers by failing to donate 25 per cent of the profits from the whole pantry - totaling $ 300,000 - to charity , despite promising she would
' it 's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong ... ( i felt ) confused , bordering on humiliated ' , ms gibson told the australian
she revealed a medical team from german had examined her using ' magnetic ' therapy and believes this investigation led to her misdiagnosis , although she declined to name the medical team
in july 2014 she broke the news of her illness to her followers through an impassioned post to her personal instagram page
it read in part : ' with frustration and ache in my heart / / my beautiful , gamechanging community , it hurts me to find space tonight to let you all know with love and strength that i 've been diagnosed with a third and fourth cancer
' one is secondary and the other is primary
i have cancer in my blood , spleen , brain , uterus , and liver
i am hurting , ' ms gibson wrote
around 12 weeks after the initial post she followed up her initial post , revealing she was undergoing ' german integrative oncology protocol '
' i 'm following the same , yet amplified holistic medicine treatment plan , taking what i need from each respected modality ; herbalism , acupuncture , nutrition etc and a new addition to it all with a german integrative oncology protocol
it took me a while , but i 'm back in ( adjusted ) full force and taking each day as it comes
' on monday fairfax revealed ms gibson had not delivered on her promise to donate 25 per cent of the whole pantry 's profits to charity , and reported she had lied about donating $ 300,000 in funds to a number of organisations
the whole pantry brand , which has hundreds of thousands of followers across social media platforms , is run by mother - of - one ms gibson , who charges $ 3.79 for the app ms gibson has almost 200,000 followers on her personal instagram account , who she has kept updated on her health and progress over the past few years
however there appear to be a number of inconsistencies in her medical history , age , and some recent ailments
the australian reported that in 2009 she claimed to have undergone multiple heart surgeries where she died on the operating table , and months later was told by a doctor she had terminal brain cancer which left her only four months to live
she has said publicly that she was 20 at the time , but other documentation has indicated that she was born in 1991 , meaning she was 17 in 2009
many of ms gibson 's social media postings from recent years have been removed , and her instagram account is now private
furthermore , when the whole pantry took to facebook on monday to defend the company , they appeared to be deleting comments questioning the validity of ms gibson 's illness and business plan
the whole pantry brand , which has hundreds of thousands of followers across social media platforms , is run by mother - of - one ms gibson , who charges $ 3.79 for the app. at least five charities who purportedly had money raised for them through a number of campaigns run by ms gibson never saw any funds
the app , which has been downloaded over 300,000 times , proved so popular she was flown out to silicon valley last year where she was told her app was to be included on the apple watch
the 26 - year - old has publicly claimed that 25 per cent of the business ' profits were being donated to charity , last year claiming that $ 300,000 had been donated
however ms gibson told fairfax this week that those donations had never been made , citing disappointing app sales and miscalculated profit margins
neither melbourne 's asylum seeker resource centre or one girl - who were donated $ 1000 after questions were raised - received any money from ms gibson initially and the former claimed that it was n't aware money was being raised in its name
' in late 2013 the whole pantry advised one girl that they would be fundraising on our behalf in an online fundraising event , ' baxter , ceo , one girl told daily mail australia in a statement
' in early 2015 one girl approached gibson from the whole pantry to enquire about when a donation would be made to one girl and how much was raised from the fundraising event
' she has also released a cookbook version of the creations following the success of the app ms baxter said one girl received a response from the whole pantry last week , which coincided with initial media inquiries into the business and they ' have since made a donation of $ 1,000 to one girl
' ' since this donation one girl has asked the whole pantry for confirmation of the total amount raised through the online event and are awaiting their response , ' ms baxter added
apparently only $ 7000 in total has reached charities so far , after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated
penguin , the publisher of ms gibson 's book which was launched off the back of her app 's success said they did not see it necessary to seek confirmation on the entrepreneur 's medical history or age during their dealings with her
' penguin did not seek or receive documentary evidence of gibson 's medical condition or birth date prior to publication , ' a spokesperson told daily mail australia
' we did not feel this was necessary as the whole pantry is a collection of food recipes , which penguin has published in good faith
' we are concerned about the questions raised in recent days - we 'll discuss them with gibson as ultimately only she can answer the questions , ' the spokesperson added
there were also revelations that neither the business nor ms gibson were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises , a situation that could lead to huge fines and potential jail time
daily mail australia has contacted the whole pantry for comment and while they could not be reached at the time of publishing , they had earlier posted a lengthy response on social media addressing some of claims made in the original article
there have been revelations that the whole pantry business nor ms gibson were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises ms gibson has appeared across a number of networks ( pictured on sunrise ) speaking about her approach to healing in the post to their facebook page the company clarified they were a ' for - profit ' company and claimed the discrepancy in funds was due to their inexperience in the industry
' we have , like all start ups , struggled with managing all facets of a new business , biting off more than we could chew , juggling internal and external priorities with little staff
' we have since passed our overdue business records and accounts over to an external business manager and accounts team , an issue we are reassured arises often with overwhelmed new businesses
' they have been working over our finances for the last five months , and are still proceeding with a resolution in close sight
we were advised by this team to follow their process and allow them to finalise the donations once all business keepings were accounted first and brought forward , ' the post read in part
' our books are taking longer to bring up to date than anticipated
twp forecasted income in october 2014 which was not fulfilled , creating cash - flow issues and unforeseen delays on finalising three discussed charitable donations , ' another section of the post read
by citing ' cash flow issues ' as ms gibson did when explaining the business model and why charities had received no donations , the lengthy response garnered harsh criticism from commentators
last year it was revealed the app would feature on the new apple watch apparently only $ 7000 of a projected $ 300,000 has reached charities so far , after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated ' appalling - your organisation not the media
money for charity does n't go into ' cash flow ' - that is beyond unethical , surely it 's illegal ? ' , one angry subscriber posted
' you have skipped the entire point in your very long and wordy response
you took money from people who gave you the money believing it would go to said charities , you failed to forward on the money , ' another poster wrote
' ... that my friends is dishonesty / theft in the highest degree and takes advantage of peoples good natures
shame on you , ' the comment continued
daily mail australia has contacted gibson , the whole pantry , and a number of the charities who were to receive donations , for comment .
