the swansea university student is suspected of posting : â your a gay c * * * awful performance against france tonight , how did england top wales ? â the comment sparked hundreds of replies in which rugby fans of all colours said it was disgraceful and voiced their support for nigel owens
but james , who lives with his family in cynwyl elfed , near carmarthen , west wales , claimed his phone had been stolen and he was not responsible
the teenager , who describes himself online in welsh as a â welshman who enjoys life â , has posted many other comments about his love of rugby and heavy drinking sessions
his mother meiner james , 58 , told the daily mail she was â aware something has happened â and said she was â trying to get to the bottom of it â
nigel owens , once named as gay sports personality of the year , was encouraged by many other internet users to report the abuse while others said he should ignore it
the veteran referee â who came out seven years ago â was generally praised for his control of england âs 55 - 35 victory over france
among those who spoke out for him were former wales fly - half jonathan davies , will carling and wasps fly - half andy goode
nigel owens later tweeted : â an absolute pleasure & privilege to ref one of the best games of rugby ever
huge credit to england & france for making it a great game
â dyfed powys police said it has launched an inquiry into â alleged homophobic remarks â
a spokesman said : â this follows a number of complaints made by members of the public
the tweet concerned has now been removed from the page
the investigation is at an early stage

trolls who post racist , homophobic and threatening abuse have been dealt with extremely harshly in other high profile cases
police forces are keen to show that comments made online are as damaging as those made to someone âs face in the street

peter nunn , 33 , from bristol , retweeted â menacing ' posts threatening to rape stella creasy , mp for walthamstow , and branded her a ' witch '
last month twitter âs chief executive admitted that the company â sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls â in a leaked memo .
