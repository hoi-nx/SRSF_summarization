rebekah gregory , 27 , from houston , texas , lost half of her left leg after 18 surgeries following the april 15 , 2013 blast
she and her 5 - year - old son , noah , had been watching her boyfriend 's mother compete in the race when the explosion occurred
' today ... i looked at you right in the face ...
and realized i was n't afraid anymore , ' gregory wrote
' and today i realized that sitting across from you was somehow the crazy kind of step forward that i needed all along
' the emotional letter has been shared more than 2,500 times and received over 11,000 ' likes ' within hours of being posted
earlier ms rebekah gregory had told the court that the last thing she remembered before the explosion was entertaining noah who was bored watching the runners
she said that the force of the blast had thrown her backwards and immediately she began looking for her son - but realized she had bones sticking out of her legs and arms and flesh hanging from her body
' my bones were lying next to me on the sidewalk , ' gregory recalled during her testimony in federal court in boston
' i felt that was the day i would die
' ms rebekah gregory 's boyfriend dimartino , 30 , was also present at the bombing and suffered a shattered ankle , a ruptured eardrum , and lost his right achilles tendon in the blast she told the court that she could hear noah screaming ' mommy ' and asked god to take her but not her son
ms rebekah gregory began to weep as she said that as she scanned for noah , she saw the body of krystle campbell lying behind her
she recalled that an emergency responder told her she was going to be ok then yelled : ' we have an amputee ! ' several jurors were close to tears as ms rebekah gregory told the court that she still has shrapnel in her body and each time a piece works its way to the surface , she will have an operation
her son noah suffered a shrapnel injury to his leg and head
ms rebekah gregory was shown a photo in court in which she was able to identify herself and her family with bomber , tamerlan tsarnaev , standing directly behind
ms rebekah gregory 's boyfriend dimartino , 30 , was also present and suffered a shattered ankle , a ruptured eardrum , and lost his right achilles tendon in the blast
the couple announced last month that they have separated after just 10 months of marriage
gregory and dimartino announced last month that they have separated after just 10 months of marriage , left , while tsarnaev is on trail for his role in the marathon blast on april 15 , 2013 despite getting married and staying together as gregory had her leg amputated , the couple have decided to part ways citing irreparable strain , the people reported
gregory , who struggled her way down the aisle after learning to walk again following the amputation , told the people : ' after the decision was made to amputate my leg in november , i found myself having to make an even more painful choice â to separate from my husband pete
' over the last several months i 've come to realize that going through such a horrific event together put a fast - forward on our relationship that we each handled differently
' while my heart is beyond broken , i have a certain peace knowing from day one , i truly gave it my all , and have been fully invested in keeping this marriage , and my commitment before god
' i still love pete with all of my heart and ask that everyone respect our privacy as we try to figure out our next steps
' as for now , i am focused on doing what i feel is best for my son and i , and will concentrate my time on healing , both physically and emotionally
' the couple had a fairytale wedding , documented on the season finale of tlc 's popular reality show , say yes to the dress
they wed in asheville , north carolina , in april last year then moved to houston , texas
seeing tsarnaev in court had helped her realize she is n't afraid of him anymore , wrote rebekah gregory dear tsarnaev , my name is rebekah gregory
we do n't really know each other and never will
but over the last two years , i have seen your face not only in pictures , but in almost every one of my nightmares
moments before the first blast , your stupid backpack even brushed up against my arm , but i doubt you remember because i am no one to you
and although i was merely just a blip on your radar , ( someone that happened to be standing 3 feet from your designated ' good spot ' for a bomb ) , you have been so much more to me
because you have undoubtedly been my source of fear since april 15th , 2013
( after all , you are one of the men responsible for nearly taking my child , and for the permanent image embedded in my brain of watching someone die
) up until now , i have been truly scared of you and because of this , fearful of everything else people might be capable of
but today , all that changed
because this afternoon , i got to walk into a courtroom and take my place at the witness stand , just a few feet away from where you were sitting
did you get that ? ) and today i explained all the horrific details , of how you changed my life , to the people that literally hold yours in their hands
that 's a little scary right ? and this afternoon before going in , i 'm not going to lie
. my palms were sweaty
and sitting up there talking to the prosecution did make me cry
but today , do you know what else happened ? today ... i looked at you right in the face ...
and realized i was n't afraid anymore
and today i realized that sitting across from you was somehow the crazy kind of step forward that i needed all along
and i think that 's the ironic thing that happens when someone intends something for evil
because somehow , some way , it always ends up good
but you are a coward
a little boy who would n't even look me in the eyes to see that
because you ca n't handle the fact that what you tried to destroy , you only made stronger
and if your eyes would 've met mine for just one second , you would 've also seen that what you ' blew up ' really did blow up
because now you have given me ( and the other survivors ) a tremendous platform to help others , and essentially do our parts in changing the world for the better
so yes ... you did take a part of me
congratulations you now have a leg up ... literally
but in so many ways , you saved my life
because now , i am so much more appreciative of every new day i am given
and now , i get to hug my son even tighter than before , blessed that he is thriving , despite everything that has happened
so now ... while you are sitting in solitary confinement , ( awaiting the verdict on your life ) , i will be actually enjoying everything this beautiful world has to offer
and guess what else ? i will do so without fear ...
because now to me you 're a nobody , and it is official that you have lost
so man that really sucks for you bro
i truly hope it was worth it
sincerely , someone you should n't have messed with âª # â bostonstrong
