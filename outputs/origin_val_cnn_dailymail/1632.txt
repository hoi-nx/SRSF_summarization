an inquest heard the couple who were planning to move in together had watched a movie before going to a friend 's house where they drank a bottle of rosÃ© wine each and three cans of fosters lager
ms hoskins also took some cocaine with friends before their group travelled to the newtown working men 's club in wigan
trouble began when mr hughes became angry over a man trying to dance with ms hoskins
they left at around midnight and continued the argument on the way home , where witnesses saw ms hoskins walking in front of and then behind her boyfriend
mr hughes told the bolton hearing : ' a man had came over to dance with hoskins and i said " that 's my girl , what are you doing ? " it did wind me up
i knew she would n't do anything but it did wind me up
we had a bit of an argument and decided to leave
mr hughes , right , got annoyed while out with ms hoskins , left , when a man approached her for a dance a witness who overheard the row saw ms hughes lie down in the road , pictured , and shout ' watch now , the next car that comes ' as a fire engine approached , which managed to avoid her but was hit by a hackney taxi ' we decided to walk home and were having a dispute , a stupid argument like couples do but nothing serious
i was jealous and it wound me up and we were having a go at each other
at some point walking home i made a comment and she laughed
' we were crossing over the road and she was stood at the side of me to my right
i crossed over the road then turned to the left to grab her hand and turned round to see her and it took three or four seconds to figure where she was
i saw her lying in the road and that 's when the cars have come
' mr hughes said he did n't hear ms hoskins fall or hear her shout for help and added : ' that 's what i ca n't get out of my head
she would normally only fall over if she had heels on but she did n't have heels on
she did n't say anything
' she would usually have a go at me if it was my fault
' mr hughes , pictured , said ms hoskins normally only ever fell over when out if she was wearing high heels asked whether he thought she lay there intentionally , mr hughes replied : ' i have thought that but she would n't have any reason to do that
ours was a loving relationship and she was my best friend
she was always laughing and joking and she was a bubbly young lady
i had returned from work that weekend and planned to spend it with her
' eyewitness howarth who was having a cigarette from her bedroom window said she heard raised voices and saw a young couple in the road below
she said : ' i could hear them shouting
' when they reached my house the male crossed the road and at this point the female ran on to the road and passed him to get in front
she was in the road in the path of cars then shouted " watch now , the next car that comes "
she carried on walking in the road
i could see a fire engine going to a call with its blue lights on
i thought it was going to hit her
' ian dunham , the driver of the fire engine said : ' i saw a person in the road
i turned the sirens off , i did n't swerve , and went on the wrong side of the road to give that person room
i knew they had had a drink so not to startle them i turned the siren off
' i noticed it was a female and as we were travelling up i was watching where she was and she continued to walk not in the middle of the road but about a car 's width from the pavement
' the inquest heard the driver black hackney cab brian sharples could not have avoided a collision
coroner rachael griffin returned an open conclusion after the inquest describing ms hoskins as ' caring ' joseph parkinson the driver of the skoda octavia following behind him said : ' the taxi in front did n't so much swerve as rock
when the lights came on i took my foot off the accelerator and then without warning at all there was a figure in the road
i hit the brakes as hard as i could
i did n't have time to swerve
if i could have done , i would have done
' the hearing was told ms hoskins had studied health and social care after leaving school in order to help people
tests showed she had traces of cocaine , cannabis and alcohol in her blood at the time of death which may have affected her judgement
mr hughes was initially arrested on suspicion of ms hoskins ' manslaughter but no action was taken against him
recording an open conclusion , coroner rachael griffin said : ' she was very clearly a bubbly young lady who was intelligent , bright and spent her life caring for others
in miss howarth 's opinion , she believes hoskins was deliberately standing in front of cars
we have heard from hughes that that did n't happen
' i do n't know how or why she was in the road
it could have been that she fell , although she would normally fall if wearing heels
it could have been that she collapsed
it could have been that she was purposefully lying in the road
' sadly for unknown reasons to me , through collapse or choice , hoskins was lying in the road in the path of oncoming vehicles
the difficulty i have is i do n't know why she was on the floor
the only person who can tell me why she was on the floor is hoskins and sadly she is not here to tell me that
