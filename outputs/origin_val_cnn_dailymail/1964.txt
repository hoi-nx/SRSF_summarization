manchester city players trained in spain on thursday following their champions league exit the night before the manchester city squad are put through their exercises at espanyol 's training ground in barcelona the players were given no time to mull over their european exit after they were taught a lesson over two legs to find themselves on the wrong end a 3 - 1 aggregate result
after such a commanding performance by the la liga leaders captain vincent kompany was forced to admit that manchester city are still a long way behind the very best in europe
' the reality is they were a better team , there is no shame in admitting that
for me there is a big , big difference
' i will just mention bayern munich and barcelona , and then there are the rest of the teams , with real madrid probably in between
' ultimately we have always said our goal is to become as good as them , but it will take some time

they have generations that have played together a long time
' of course we want to make up the gap but you just have to be true to yourself
we have the ambition to be as good as they are one day , but it is not going to happen overnight
' manchester city 's exit meant that england will not have a representative in the quarter - finals of the champions league for the second time in three seasons
' the gap will eventually get closer , ' said vincent kompany
' whether it is arsenal , chelsea , ( manchester ) manchester united , the gap will become closer and i just hope it is us that gets there the first
' vincent kompany and hart , who produced a fine goalkeeping display against barcelona , take a break from training manchester city were outplayed in the first leg at the etihad stadium three weeks ago but had hoped hart 's late penalty save , which kept the score 2 - 1 , might have proved the tie 's turning point
it proved anything but as barcelona dominated from the outset , hitting the post within moments through neymar
messi was at his inspirational best , setting up ivan rakitic 's 31st - minute goal and generally running manchester city ragged
it was remarkable the scoreline stayed at 1 - 0 , with luis suarez also hitting the woodwork twice and england goalkeeper hart producing a series of stunning saves in one of the best performances of his career
manchester city might have made the latter stages interesting had sergio aguero not had a penalty saved by marc-andre ter stegen but they could complain little about the result
ivan rakitic beat hart with a brilliant lob over the manchester city keeper to give barcelona a 1 - 0 win at the nou camp the croatia midfielder celebrates with his team - mates after opening the scoring the hosts asked about hart 's display , centre - back vincent kompany said : ' it was phenomenal
on that side of the pitch i felt we had all the luck we needed to get a result
' it was probably just the penalty - if we had scored a goal it could have been a different game
it would have been a great way to get back into the tie and it would have been interesting to see what the last 15 minutes would have been like back at 1 - 1
' if you want to win against those teams you need a very special performance and a little bit of luck on your side
then you can beat them , but every team can lose
' despite progress always seeming unlikely , the defeat is another blow to manchester city 's morale after an indifferent spell in the premier league

they could even face a battle to hold onto second place as the likes of arsenal , liverpool and manchester united gear up for a strong finish
vincent kompany is determined to ensure that does not happen
the 28 - year - old said : ' forget about chelsea
we owe it to ourselves , to our fans to have a good end to this campaign
then again if we finish this campaign as good as we can , maybe there is still something in it
we will have to see
' it is not in our hands by any means , but we just have to go back and work hard and improve
