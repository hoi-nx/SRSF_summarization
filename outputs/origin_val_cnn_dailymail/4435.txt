murray said it was impossible to choose between brother jamie , and friends ross hutchins and carlos mier as best men , so will invite all three murray has announced he will have three best men at his wedding when he marries to long - term girlfriend kim sears next month
the british tennis star says the honour will be shared between his brother jamie , close friend and fellow tennis player ross hutchins , and former training partner carlos mier
murray , 27 , is due to marry miss sears , who he has been dating for nine years , in a ceremony at his luxurious comlix house hotel in dunblane on april 11
the wimbledon champion has previously played best man at brother jamie 's wedding when he married alejandra gutierrez at cromlix house in 2010 , and when ross hutchins got hitched to lindsay wood last year
murray told how he was not feeling nervous about the wedding but would be more apprehensive about starting a family
he said he could n't choose who should be his best man and so decided on asking all three to keep up with kim sears , who is having four bridesmaids
he said : ' i 'm actually not nervous about getting married to be honest , we 've been together about nine and a half years so , we 've lived together for six , seven years as well so i do n't think a whole lots going to change
' i think i 'll be more nervous about starting a family because i feel like for me , that would be more life changing , in a good way but , i kind of feel we have been married already in the way we spend our lives together and live together so i 'm not that nervous about the day at all
' i 'm going to have a couple of best men
jamie 's going to be one of them , ross hutchins is also going to be a best man
' hopefully my good friend carlos from spain , in barcelona
' the thing for me is it 's double standards in a way with the guys and girls because kim sears has four bridesmaids and i was saying well , ' why is that fine for you ? ' ' imagine you had to pick one of your four best friends which you 've had since you were at school
it 's very difficult to chose one
murray is due to marry girlfriend of nine years kim sears ( second left ) at his cromlix house hotel in dunblane next month ( pictured , murray as best man at brother jamie 's wedding at the hotel in 2010 ) murray said it was unfair that kim sears was allowed to name four bridesmaids , while he was only allowed one best man , so picked three including his brother ( pictured , the pair play together during the 2012 olympics ) ' she was like , " come on , come on , pick one "
i said , " no , it 's difficult , so i think i 'm going to have two for sure possibly a third if he can come "
' murray and ross hutchins are former roommates and known to be very close
when murray won the brisbane international in 2012 , he dedicated the win to ross hutchins
in a post-match speech he paid tribute to a ' friend ' who was watching back home , adding ' you 're going to get through ' , a reference to hutchins diagnosis with hodgkin 's lymphoma , a form of cancer
ross hutchins ( left ) was a roommate of murray 's , and murray supported him through his battle with cancer , while carlos mier ( right ) was murray 's best friend while he was training in spain murray will wed kim sears at the cromlix hotel which he owns in dunblane , where he grew up , during a ceremony to be held there next month murray has since revealed that his double - handed victory salute , in which he points both index fingers at the sky , was a sign to ross hutchins to show he was thinking of him
carlos mier , meanwhile , was murray 's roommate and hitting partner while he was at academia sã¡nchez-casal in spain
the peruvian has continued his friendship with murray over the years , and still joins the scot for the occasional practice
speaking about his choice of best men , murray added : ' i did n't spend loads of time with my brother when we were 15 - 20 , he was training in france
the Â£ 1.8million hotel contains its own chapel ( pictured ) , which is where murray 's brother jamie got married to alejandra gutierrez in 2010 the wedding party will have 10 bedrooms and five suites to chose from
pictured : the eden room at the luxury hotel the hotel underwent an extensive redevelopment after it was bought by the tennis ace and re-opened last year where suites can go for up to Â£ 600 per night ' i was training in spain , and my friend carlos , he was my best friend during that time , which were very important years of my life when i moved away from my family and my friends and he was the guy who was always there for me , he was my best friend though that period
' i feel like he knows extremely well from then , my brother knows me obviously since i was a child , and ross hutchins over the last six or seven years , we 've become extremely close and we 've been through a lot together as well
' so , picking one was for me , a very , very difficult thing to do because i had three guys who were clearly my three best friends and i would like all of them to be involved in some way
' murray said he had no firm plans for a honeymoon yet but added : ' we will probably do it later in the year , probably in the off season
i 'm not sure where we 're going to go yet but there 's a few ideas
' murray proposed to miss sears , his girlfriend of nine years , in november last year with a three - carat diamond engagement ring , believed to be worth around Â£ 200,000 ( pictured ) miss sears has long been pictured at murray 's side , cheering him on from the sidelines ( pictured , left after he won wimbledon in 2013 , and right after being caught swearing at the australian open earlier this year )
