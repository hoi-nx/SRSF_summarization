nasa 's tractor - trailer sized dawn spacecraft spacecraft will snuggle up to ceres on friday , getting close enough to be pulled into orbit and to complete the first mission to a dwarf planet
" i 'm just delighted that dawn spacecraft is now on the doorstep of ceres , " jim green , director of nasa 's planetary science division said in a news conference on monday
dawn spacecraft is expected to begin orbiting ceres around 7:20 a.m. et , but nasa says it may take an hour or two to confirm it
ceres was discovered in 1801 ( pluto was n't found until 1930 ) and was the first object found in our solar system 's main asteroid belt between mars and jupiter
it 's about 310 million miles from earth and was initially classified as planet , then later demoted to an asteroid , only to be reclassified again as a dwarf planet
the early images from dawn spacecraft already have mission scientists excited
" ceres has really surprised us , " said carol raymond , dawn spacecraft 's deputy principal investigator
" the first images have produced some really puzzling features
" one of the puzzles -- two bright white spots that showed up in photographs taken by dawn spacecraft in february
" these spots were extremely surprising to the team , and they have been puzzling to the team and to everybody who 's seen them
" the spots are in a 57 - mile wide ( 92 kilometer ) crater
the spot in the center of the crater is about twice as bright as the spot on the side of the crater
" this extreme brightness was really unexpected , " raymond said
the dawn team is " really , really excited about this feature because it is unique in the solar system
" raymond says the brightness is consistent with highly reflective materials such as ice or salts
this might help add more credence to a discovery made in 2014 by esa 's herschel infrared space observatory
the telescope detected water vapor around ceres coming from the same area where the spots are located
" it might be related to that water vapor emission , " raymond said
herschel 's scientists also said their research showed ceres has an atmosphere
raymond said her team is keen to confirm that
scientists expect to learn more as dawn spacecraft is gradually lowered to about 235 miles above the surface of ceres in december
" the mystery will be solved , " she said
but ceres seems to have lots of oddities
" we see many strange features , " raymond said
" we see smooth areas , some areas that are chaotically fractured and we see craters of all sizes
" one of the other things scientists noticed is how round ceres is
being round is very important because it is the main characteristic of a planet -- a title that ceres had -- then lost
ceres was demoted to an asteroid because 19th century astronomers could n't be sure it was round
but it was bumped up to a dwarf planet when that category was created in 2006
according to the iau -- the group that came up with the definition -- a dwarf planet is similar to the eight main planets ( mercury , venus , earth , mars , jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune ) except it has a lot of other stuff orbiting with it around the sun. the iau recognizes five dwarf planets : eris , pluto , ceres , makemake and haumea
scientists say there could be many more of these small worlds that have n't been discovered
dawn spacecraft was launched on september 27 , 2007 , from cape canaveral , florida
its journey has taken it past mars and on a short layover at the asteroid vesta
on friday , dawn spacecraft will make its closest approach yet to ceres , flying about 25,000 miles from it , according to robert mase , project manager for the dawn spacecraft at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california
" that 's about 10 times closer than the moon is to the earth , " he said
but the beautiful images coming in from dawn spacecraft will stop for awhile
" we 're now on the dark side , so we 're going to have a blackout for about the next month until we get back over toward the lit side of the body , " he said
but he says the " floodgates will open " when its main science mission starts in april
dawn spacecraft will stay in orbit around ceres for years , even after its primary mission ends in june 2016
but at some point , it will run out of hydrazine , the fuel used to guide the spacecraft
between now and then -- mission managers hope dawn spacecraft will help solve the mysteries of ceres and add to our knowledge of how our solar system formed .
