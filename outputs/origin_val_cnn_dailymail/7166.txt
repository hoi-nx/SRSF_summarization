a danish sexology professor is calling for students to view pornography films in class as part of changes to the country 's sex education curriculum
professor christian graugaard said the changes would help students understand the differences between what they see in pornography and the reality of sex
his suggestion echoes similar calls made in britain last year by a government - backed sexual health forum , which said youngsters must be taught that pornography does not reflect real life
danish students could soon be watching pornography films in class in order to teach them the differences between what they see on screen and the reality of sex mr christian graugaard told public broadcaster dr : ' instead of having sex education be boring and technical , where you roll a condom onto a cucumber , i 'd rather have us educate our children to be critical consumers who see porn with a certain distance and reflection , ' according to the local
he added that teenagers attempting to copy what they saw in pornography was a ' recipe for broken necks and disappointment '
danish is known for its liberal attitudes to pornography - it was the first country to legalise it , and a recent survey showed three quarters of danish men , and a third of danish women , regularly watch it , the local reported
early last year in britain , a document drawn up by sexual health charity brook , the pshe association and the sex education forum issued new guidelines for sex education in schools
the guidelines , criticised by an education campaigner for ' taking children 's childhoods away from them ' - also called for students to be told about the dangers of ' sexting ' - sending explicit text messages - and sharing sexual photos and images
pupils must instead be taught the difference between real - life relationships and the distorted world of x-rated films
this could involve playing card games in class to decide whether various sexual scenarios belong on â planet earth â or â planet porn â and a greater emphasis on relationships , sexuality and staying safe , rather than just the ' mechanics ' of reproduction .
