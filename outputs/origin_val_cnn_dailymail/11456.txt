the team behind reckless have yet to decide if the gelding will run in the arkle challenge trophy at cheltenham after just one run over fences
trainer mick , former trainer henrietta knight and owner tim will discuss the situation after the eight - year - old strutted his stuff in pleasing fashion in a schooling session over two miles after racing at doncaster on saturday
ridden by will kennedy , reckless put in a clear round of jumping as he came home ahead of his stable companion paradise valley
reckless comes home in front to win an all weather maiden at lingfield in january watching on were radford and the trainer 's son michael channon jnr
' we 're in a horrible position in that everyone 's telling us how to train him yet we know he 's only half the horse if he has n't got good ground , ' said channon jnr
' the ground was good here at doncaster and we would have loved to have been in a race
' he jumped very well and will kennedy was more than happy
it 's another step towards what we 're going to do and we have to do what 's right by the horse
' he 's in the arkle and also in the county over hurdles
the arkle is our dream
it 's whether we 're doing the right thing in terms of what we 've got under our belt
mick and henrietta knight will again team up for the cheltenham this year ' we 'll leave the decision to mick ( channon ) , hen ( henrietta knight ) and tim ( radford )
' we 've done everything right there
we know he 's got the ability , but whether he 's got the experience to go into the arkle
' i wish it was n't this way
i just wish we could do what everyone is telling us to do , but we know the horse wo n't go in soft , horrible ground
' cheltenham is the holy grail , but we will do what is right for the horse
we all want to go to cheltenham but is it right for the sergeant ? ' since making a successful debut over fences at uttoxeter in late october , reckless has finished fifth behind faugheen in the christmas hurdle at kempton and won a mile and a half maiden flat race on the polytrack at lingfield in january
