an undercover investigation in chinese has revealed the disgusting conditions in which a wildly popular snack known as ' spicy sticks ' are made
the food - made from flour , spicy oil and food additives - is especially popular among young adults and children due to their cheap cost , but reports in the media of them causing extreme sickness have prompted concern
the snacks are popular among chinese people living abroad , with thousands of people ordering them via online marketplaces such as amazon - and there was even an online campaign recently to promote the red sticks among westerners
the most popular brands sell more than 400,000 packets a month , solely online
but many consumers have reported suffering from severe sickness and diarrhoea after eating them , and one three - year - old girl was reportedly left with festering sores around her mouth after gorging on the snack
people 's daily online reported that , during secret , filming at one of the many firms which produce the snack , investigators found one worker handling food with a finger that had blistered through exposure to the chemicals used in the process - without wearing protective gloves
at the factory in tongxu county , henan province , an undercover reporter saw workers visit dirty lavatories and return to work without washing their hands - again without wearing gloves or face masks when handling food
this three - year - old girl allegedly developed sores and ulcers after eating too many of the snacks roaring trade : they are popular on online sites such as amazon
( there is no suggestion the product pictured here was manufactured at the plant in the undercover filming ) the finished product was also packed with bare hands , with workers ' hands stained by the red oil that coats the food - leading at least one woman to suffer sores on her finger
when challenged as to why they were n't wearing gloves , staff said they slowed down their work
boxes used to store the snacks were also seen covered in an oil - like substance , while a choking smell filled the entire site
close to the production line were various boilers , pipes and a large metal drum filled with a reddish liquid that emitted a strange smell as well as a small bucket that was full of black sludge
the manufacturer , kaifeng jinsong food co , shared the premises with other businesses and there was evidence of paint particles spreading into the spicy stick workshop from a toymakers next door
it comes after a toddler in the city of jiujiang was hospitalised with severe sores and ulcers which were caused by eating too many of the sticks , reports people 's daily online
and one blogger claimed he suffered five hours of diarrhoea after eating 10 of the sticks in quick succession to test their effect
stomach - turning : many consumers have reported suffering from diarrhoea after eating spicy sticks stench : the undercover reporter said a vile smell came from vats holding chemicals like the one above campiagn : chinese fans of the snack have been encouraging westerners to try it and posting their comments online many consumers who have bought the snack online have also left comments reporting similar symptoms
chinese fans of the snack had recently started an online campaign to make it popular with westerners
a site showing pictures of western workers in chinese eating the sticks - known in mandarin as ' latiao ' - alongside their thoughts on them , gained a large following
among the comments on the site were ' latiao is taking over the world ' and ' we 've found the weapon that will defeat america '
but the campaign that included plans to formally export the spicy snack abroad ended this week as quickly as it started , after the images of the manufacturing process emerged
chinese media have reported several scares in the past in which the snack had been accused of being unhealthy and even causing cancer
the authorities claim they are working to crack down on breaches of hygiene and safety regulations among food producers
according to the latest report by china food and drug administration , there were 15 brands of spicy stick on the banned foods list because they exceeded acceptable levels of acid , bacteria or other chemicals
in 2011 , 53 manufacturers of the snack were ordered to shut down by the beijing food safety committee , but critics claim many firms continued to operate illegally under new aliases
a manager claiming to be in charge at kaifeng jinsong food co told the undercover reporter : ' we are checked regularly by the authorities and there are areas that we fail on
if you are talking about washing hands , changing clothes before going to the toilet ... then the workers will find this very constricting and it will be difficult to recruit for this work
