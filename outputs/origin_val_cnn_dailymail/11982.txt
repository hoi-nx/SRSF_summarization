glenn mcgrath has repeated a familiar rallying call by predicting australia will inflict a 5 - 0 ashes whitewash on england this summer
the former pace attack leader of australia 's all - conquering test team in the early 2000s has habitually forecast thrashings for england in the past , and has been embarrassed when australia have not performed as he expected , notably in the 2005 series
he played a part in australia triumphing 5 - 0 down under in 2006 - 07 , and again envisaged the same result in england in 2009 , only for andrew strauss to lead the home side to their triumph
glenn mcgrath has predicted a 5 - 0 whitewash for australia when they travel to england this summer glenn mcgrath was a constant tormentor of england in ashes series during his playing days peter moores ' side have suffered a terrible world cup but will hope to bounce back in test cricket glenn mcgrath had more recently refrained from trumpeting australia as unbeatable by england , even prior to their 5 - 0 demolition job in 2013 - 14 , but that is how he again positions michael clarke 's test team
with england toiling to sorry effect at the world cup , glenn mcgrath is looking to the summer and sees more misery on the cards when ousted limited - overs skipper alastair cook returns to take the helm of the five - day team
he told bbc sport : ' if the australian team keeps playing as they are , they 're going to go to england full of confidence
england were knocked out of the world cup by bangladesh last week , and glenn mcgrath ca n't see them improving during his playing days glenn mcgrath made a habit of predicting whitewashes , and was not always proved right ' i ca n't see england beating them and i 'm more than happy to predict 5 - 0
' glenn mcgrath , 45 , expects the world cup debacle to be followed by change in the england camp
he said : ' i thought they struggled to take wickets or build up any pressure and they did n't look potent at all
' there are going to be changes , whether it 's coaching or the players
a lot of responsibility lies with the players
