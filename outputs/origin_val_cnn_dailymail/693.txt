sergeant bergdahl , the enlisted american soldier who left his post in afghanistan in 2009 and was later ransomed from an islamist extremist network by the obama administration for five taliban leaders , was charged with desertion and ' misbehavior before the enemy ' buy the army on wednesday
but he wo n't face the death penalty if a military court martial finds him guilty of ' desertion with intent to shirk important or hazardous duty
' the level of that charge the pentagon levied on him carries a maximum of just a 5 year prison term
the other charge , however , ' misbehavior before the enemy by endangering the safety of a command , unit or place , ' could send him to a military prison for life
the uniform code of military justice describes examples of that crime as running away from a fighting enemy , throwing down his weapons , abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit , or otherwise purposely failing ' to do his utmost to encounter , engage , capture , or destroy any enemy troops , combatants , vessels , aircraft , or any other thing , which it is his duty so to encounter , engage , capture , or destroy
an army spokesman said in a hastily scheduled press conference at ft. in north carolina that the next step in the procedure would be an ' article 32 ' hearing at sam houston in texas
that 's where bergdahl remains on active duty , and will remain unless he 's convicted
an article 32 hearing is analogous to a grand jury in the civilian court system
its purpose is determine if there is enough evidence for a formal court martial
bergdahl , 28 , disappeared from his post in paktika province , afghanistan on june 30 , 2009 after tellign comrades that he had grown cynical about american 's mission there
the haqqani network , a pakistan - based network of islamists aligned with the taliban regime , took him prisoner and held him for nearly five years
a deal brokered by the persian gulf nation of qatar brought him home , but at the cost of releasing the taliban insurgents from the military prison complex at guantanamo , cuba
two of them have recently said they are eager to rejoin the fight against the west when their qatar - imposed year of restrictions and monitoring is over
a government official meanwhile told fox news channel that three of the men have already tried to 're - engage ' with their old networks , and one was ' trying to provide advice , council or inspiration ' to his former terror network
bergdahl will face charges under articles 85 and 99 of the uniform code of military justice ' desertion with intent to shirk important or hazardous duty ' : article 85 charges a soldier with desertion if he ' quits his unit , organization , or place of duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service
' it can carry a death sentence but the military wo n't seek that option in the bergdahl case maximum sentence : 5 years in a military prison plus reduction in rank , dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay ' misbehavior before the enemy by endangering the safety of a command , unit or place ' : article 99 charges a servicemember with running away from a fighting enemy , throwing down his weapons , abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit , or otherwise purposely failing ' to do his utmost to encounter , engage , capture , or destroy any enemy troops , combatants , vessels , aircraft , or any other thing , which it is his duty so to encounter , engage , capture , or destroy
' maximum sentence : life in a military prison plus reduction in rank , dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay the pentagon was set to announce a decision in the case wednesday afternoon at ft. , north carolina , but the white house insisted it was in the dark
' i 'm not aware of any plans for them to do that , ' white house press secretary earnest said during his daily press briefing , after daily mail online asked him for comment on the looming pentagon press conference
' but this is a process that 's being run by the army , ' earnest added
' so i 'd direct you to the pentagon for an answer
' a pentagon official confirmed the charges in advance of the announcement
house speaker john boehner , an ohio republican , said in a statement after the army 's announcement that ' every american is innocent until proven guilty , and we all wanted to bring sgt. bergdahl home
' ' but my chief concern remains president obama âs decision to release five hardened terrorists , with no guarantees that they wo nât return to the battlefield
i believe it made american less safe
' bergdahl 's case has seen a series of shifts in administration policy , but charging him with a potentially capital offense would represent a stunning 180 - degree turn
last year after bergdahl came home , national security adviser susan rice claimed he had served his country ' with honor and distinction
' but in the days before his then - mysterious disappearance in 2009 , he wrote an email to his parents spelling out his disillusioned thoughts
' the future is too good to waste on lies
and life is way too short to care for the damnation of others , as well as to spend it helping fools with their ideas that are wrong , ' he wrote , according to rolling stone magazine
' i have seen their ideas and i am ashamed to even be american
' bergdahl 's father reportedly responded with an email whose subject line read : ' obey your conscience ! ' the fox news channel reported in 2014 that bergdahl 's platoonmates found a note in his tent telling them that he had left to start a new life â and that he intended to renounce his citizenship
' taliban five ' : the terror leaders traded for bergdahl were ( top , from left ) : abdul haq wasiq , khirullah said wali khairkhwa , mohammad nabi omari ; and ( bottom from left ) : mohammad a fazl , mullah norullah noori proof of life : bergdahl 's captors released a video on july 19 , 2009 showing him with his head shaven , and showing his military ' dog tag ' idaho to the camera gen. mark milley , the commanding officer at ft. , has been leading the inquest into the bergdahl case
the army 's decision to send the desertion case to a court martial signals that military prosecutors believe they can prove bergdahl never intended to return to his combat unit
desertion itself can carry a death sentence , but only in the most serious of cases
that penalty has n't been levied on a american servicemember since 1944
the pentagon has broad discretion and can charge soldiers , sailors , marines and airmen with desertion on a variety of different levels
bergdahl 's attorney spoke to reporters in advance of the pentagon 's announcement
the washington post reported that eugene fidell , bergdahl 's attorney , said his client was handed his ' charge sheet ' wednesday at ft.
president obama attracted scorn when the prisoner swap was announced , especially from bergdahl 's former platoonmates â who insisted he deserted them and their mission
one of them , cody full , told a congressional committee in june 2014 that bergdahl could â and should â be court martialed on eight separate charges , including disobeying orders and ' misconduct ' as a prisoner
ballet bowe : bergdahl was a classical dancer from the age of 16 or 17 , studying at the sun valley ballet school before he enlisted in the army swap : the army opened an investigation into bergdahl 's ' capture ' almost immediately after his release , shown here in a still frame from a video of the prisoner exchange ( bergdahl is 3rd right , back to the camera ) temporary : jubilant signs and american flags went up overnight in the bergdahls ' hometown of hailey , idaho â but were largely taken down as the circumstances of bergdahl 's capture made the news
most of the backlash against the president , however , came from congress â which was n't given 30 days ' notice about the ' taliban 5 ' being transferred out of guantamo bay
a federal law requires such notice
the house of representatives later approved a resolution condemning obama for breaking the law , with 22 democrats breaking ranks to agree
' by setting free five top taliban commanders from american custody , the obama administration made american less safe , ' speaker john boehner said then
obama defended his actions in a june 2014 joint press conference in brussels , belgium with british prime minister david cameron , just a few days after bergdahl was released into american custody
' i make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get back a young man to his parents , ' the president said then , ' and that the american people understand that this is somebody 's child and that we do n't condition whether or not we make the effort to try to get them back
' ' we had a prisoner of war whose health had deteriorated , and we were deeply concerned about [ him ] , ' obama told reporters about sgt. bergdahl
' and we saw an opportunity and we seized it
and i make no apologies for that
' administration officials told senators that they were kept out of the loop on the hostage swap because the taliban threatened to kill bergdahl if information about the negotiations was leaked
separately , the parents of an army lietenant who died while searching for bergdahl months after he walked away from his platoon told daily mail online that the pentagon ' lied ' to them about the circumstances of their son 's death
second lieutenant andrews perished in september 2009 , and his commanders first said he was blown up while hunting a taliban commander
once bergdahl was released , they were told the truth
' it 's a big cover - up like benghazi , ' andrews ' father said three days after bergdahl 's release , ' just like everything obama has done
