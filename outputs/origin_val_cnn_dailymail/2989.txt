by the time referee wayne barnes blew the final whistle , large chunks of the world - record crowd had long since drifted away into the north london night
such was saracens â dominance of a harlequins team who have completely lost their way , even the dubious lure of a mexican wave had lost its appeal for the â away â fans
those left inside did muster a roar when billy vunipola dotted down for a deserved try with two minutes remaining , but harlequins had been so inept for large parts of this game that a five - try victory felt slightly hollow
saracens ' chris wyles ( left ) manages to go over the line despite a last ditch tackle from marland yarde ( right ) saracens ' chris hodgson ( centre ) releases the ball as harlequins ' joe marler ( left ) close him down pop singer pixie lott performs at half - time in front of the record breaking 84,068 crowd at wembley the 24 - year - old performs for the saracens and harlequins supporters during the aviva premiership match saracens wo nât care a jot
they were tack sharp for much of the game , physical and confrontational when they needed to be with a pack more than willing to mix it and a back line full of invention
it was just a shame the 84,068 crowd , many of them no doubt watching their first game of professional rugby , witnessed such a no - contest
saracens have won all but one of their last 14 matches against their london rivals and on this evidence it will be a long time before they are troubled again
harlequins , eighth in the aviva premiership table and with next to no chance of european qualification , really were that bad
their returning england contingent of chris robshaw , joe marler and nick easter were unable to make any notable impact up front , while behind the scrum they were devoid of ideas
the world record breaking 84,068 attendance for a club rugby match is revealed on the wembley scoreboard harlequins ' danny care chips the ball forward during his side 's 42 - 14 defeat by saracens at wembley saracens ' chris wyles and harlequins ' ross chisholm both try to catch the high ball during the premiership match they missed the cutting edge of their concussed full back mike brown and scrum - half danny care is badly short of confidence after being dropped by england last autumn
the same can not be said of saracens , who consolidated their second spot in the table with a bonus - point win that saw winger chris ashton score an excellent brace
usa centre chris wyles excelled at 12 alongside the equally impressive marcelo bosch
with owen farrell , brad barritt and schalk brits set to return from injury soon , saracens appear to be coming good at the right time
â the second 20 minutes of the first half was as good as we âve been all season , â said saracens director of rugby mark mccall
â we counter attacked really well and looked dangerous on the ball
we went off the boil in the next 20 minutes but put a lot of pressure on towards the end

saracens still scored two tries with the wing off the field
â it âs incredibly frustrating , â said harlequins director of rugby conor oâshea
â we âre just too easy to knock off
it âs been a really difficult couple of months
you can see that by how easily we get knocked off our stride , mentally
when you are used to success it hurts even more
â it could all have been so different for harlequins
on the same wembley pitch where harry kane had taken just 78 seconds to open his international account for england the night before , young harlequins flanker jack clifford dotted down 28 seconds into this contest after charging down neil de kock âs clearance
it proved to be as good as it would get for harlequins as chris wyles and chris ashton scored superbly worked first - half tries
harlequins lost prop kyle sinckler with a knee injury sustained courtesy of a dubious tackle by flanker jacques burger
chris ashton âs 52nd - minute try put saracens out of sight before the two more late tries put deserved gloss on the score
they will travel to face racing metro in the last eight of europe next sunday full of belief
