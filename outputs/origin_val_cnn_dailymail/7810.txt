it was not as if england lost to bangladesh in the sub-continent
these were english - type conditions and it was seamers who took the wickets , not spinners
that makes it even more of a diabolical result
players always have to take responsibility and have a good look at themselves but mistakes have certainly been made by peter moores and this management
they had six months to prepare for this tournament rather than in two of the last three world cups when they have come in to it off the back of the ashes
chris woakes walks towards his bowling mark during the world cup match between bangladesh and england they changed the captain just ahead of this tour which to me was not the wrong call but one made too late
they should have replaced alastair cook a year ago and then hales could have been opening the batting for a year by now
then at the last minute here they came up with this cunning plan of picking gary ballance which smacked of england losing their bottle and reverting to old - fashioned type and going with the test no3
and why did it take until this game for jimmy anderson and stuart broad to pitch the ball up ? eoin morgan said it was nât a team plan so why were they bowling too short and why did nât someone tell them to stop it before now ? england 's batsman bell plays a shot as bangladesh wicket keeper mushfiqur rahim looks on james taylor heads back to the dressing room after losing his wicket to taskin ahmed of bangladesh yet , in all honesty , i watched that match and i was nât too fussed about the result because my feeling is that even if england had won and gone on to the quarter - final they would have been hammered by india , south africa or whoever they faced on a drop - in pitch at the melbourne cricket ground
england are playing a different brand of cricket from the top five or six teams and the underlying problems need to be looked at as much as the position of the coach , who comes under scrutiny after every tournament disappointment
stuart broad slips over during the world cup match between england and bangladesh at adelaide oval masrafe bin mortaza celebrates after getting the wicket of hales match at the adelaide oval there are exciting players out there
you could tell that hales had something about him two years ago
then there are others like sam billings and jason roy
we need someone with a keen eye picking these guys out and then sending them round the world to play in the indian premier league , the big bash and other tournaments where they may learn
one - day cricket can not be an afterthought any more for england
there is no magic fix but we must change our culture
let the players have a carefree attitude â not reckless â but carefree
then start moving forward and catching up
