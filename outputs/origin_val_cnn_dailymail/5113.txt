serious failings in nhs care for cancer patients have been laid bare by three separate reports
they reveal waiting times for scans are at their highest in seven years , there is an ' unacceptable ' postcode lottery in treatment and how britain spends far less on new drugs than elsewhere in the western world
today the nhs will also announce which life - extending medications will be axed from its cancer drugs fund because they are too expensive
avastin , which is used for bowel and ovarian cancers , is one of the drugs at risk of being cut meanwhile gps in the south of england have complained that nhs managers are delaying patients from having cancer tests to meet waiting times targets
as mps warned that cancer care on the nhs had been ' diluted ' and was ' going backwards ' , a string of reports revealed how : Ã· a total of 18,740 patients in january waited longer than six weeks for tests to diagnose cancer
the figure from england represents a 40 per cent increase in a year and the highest number since february 2008
Ã· there is ' unacceptable ' and ' unexplained ' variation in cancer detection and treatment across england â particularly for the elderly
ã· evidence emerged showing the nhs spends less on new cancer treatments than the us , spain , germany and scotland
the report by data analysts blamed nice , the medications rationing body , for turning down too many drugs which are not deemed ' cost - effective '
not all the patients waiting for screening , such as ct scans , x-rays and ultrasounds , will have cancer
however , it is crucial diagnosis happens as quickly as possible so any tumours found can be removed or treated before they spread
labour mp margaret hodge , who is chairman of the committee , said that despite the increasing numbers being diagnosed with cancer , the money being ploughed into the services had declined britain has one of the worst cancer survival rates in europe and this has partly been blamed on late diagnosis as well as lack of availability of effective treatments
a report by the public accounts committee warned of a postcode lottery in cancer detection and treatment across england
mps were particularly concerned about the care for older patients â the group most at risk of cancer â who are often denied chemotherapy or surgery as they are thought to be too frail
andy burnham , labour 's health spokesman , said : ' cancer care has gone backwards and patients are missing out on the treatment they need ' jevtana ( cabazitaxel ) use : advanced prostate cancer
benefit : extends survival for an average of three months but some men have lived for three more years
cost : around Â£ 22,000
zaltrap ( aflibercept ) use : bowel cancer
benefit : gives six weeks extra survival
avastin ( bevacizumab ) use : bowel and ovarian cancers
benefit : prolongs life for between five and nine months
cost : Â£ 12,000 for bowel and Â£ 16,000 for ovarian cancer
tykerb ( lapatinib ) use : breast cancer
benefit : four months extra survival
cost : Â£ 1,600 a month
alimta ( pemetrexed ) use : lung cancer
benefit : three months extra life
yondelis ( trabectedin ) use : ovarian cancer
benefit : average survival increased by six months
labour mp margaret hodge , who is chairman of the committee , said that despite the increasing numbers being diagnosed with cancer , the money being ploughed into the services had declined
' focus on cancer has also been diluted at a local level , ' she said , adding : ' it is unacceptable that nhs england does not understand the reasons why access to treatment and survival rates are considerably poorer for older people
' a report by the ims institute â an international firm which analyses data around the world â reveals how the nhs in england spends less on new cancer treatments per patient compared to scotland , sweden , canada , australia , france , germany , the us , italy and spain
it allocates an average of Â£ 7,671 per new cancer patient compared to Â£ 16,661 , the highest of the ten countries
juliet bouverie , of macmillan cancer support , said : ' cancer care in england is in urgent need of improvement
' sarah woolnough , of cancer research uk , said : ' it is depressing that too many patients are waiting longer than they should
' andy burnham , labour 's health spokesman , said : ' cancer care has gone backwards and patients are missing out on the treatment they need
this slump in cancer standards is a scandal that needs to be stopped
' it comes as gps in the south of england have accused hospital managers of downgrading patients ' cancer risk to meet waiting time targets
it means that instead of being seen in two weeks , patients could have to wait up to six months
a letter obtained by pulse magazine reveals how nhs officials have written to hospitals in dorset and hampshire warning them that the practice is ' inappropriate ' and ' against patients ' best interests '
the department of health claimed that waiting times for scans are increasing because more patients are being referred by gps
a spokesman said that five million more tests had been carried out last year compared to 2010 adding that cancer survival was at ' record levels ' .
