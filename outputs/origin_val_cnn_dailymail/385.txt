when clegg walked out of today 's farcical â yellow budget â speech , it prompted relentless jeers from labour mps - and left danny alexander speaking to a virtually - empty chamber
and , to add insult to injury , the deputy prime minister 's swift exit appeared to be for the sole purpose of trying his hand at a spot of am - dram in gravesend
as these pictures show , the lib dem leader was this afternoon seen sauntering around kent , taking selfies with residents and high - fiving passers - by as part of a ' fun ' film shoot for a party political broadcast
there were even reports that he interacted with dancing girls for the film
at one point , mr clegg opted for an outfit swap , changing into a camel - coloured jacket , which he matched with a more severe facial expression , as he walked solo along the high street
perhaps unsurprisingly , the political broadcast is not the first time that mr clegg has attempted some amateur acting
the politician is said to have enjoyed am - dram at school , taking the lead role in the government inspector while at caldicott
at westminster , he took the lead in the changeling , opposite hollywood actress in - the - making helena bonham carter
in one scene , she had to kick him between the legs - and one night she hit the target rather too authentically
' she got it spot on â¦ no acting was required , ' clegg recalls
he also once donned a purple velvet jacket to play charles condomine in noel coward 's blithe spirit - a man who boasts about his sexual conquests
woollen : wearing woolly gloves , an open - neck shirt and a v - neck sweater , mr clegg looked right at home swap : he even opted for an outfit change halfway through filming , reverting to a camel - coloured jacket strutting his stuff : mr clegg is a seasoned amateur actor and took the lead role in the government inspector while at caldicott speaking to kentonline about today 's filming , mr clegg said : ' it 's a bit of fun
i want to have fun in this general election campaign
i do n't want it to be too po - faced and serious
' asked why the party decided to shoot the video in gravesend , he added : ' it was just a really great place to do this and hopefully not cause too much disruption
' everybody in the shops here have been really warm and really generous with their time
' a lib dem source said : ' we were filming bits of a party political broadcast and other videos that are going to be used in the campaign
' the whole crew has been filming for a couple of days â clegg was there for a couple of hours today
' but you 'll just have to wait and see what 's in them
