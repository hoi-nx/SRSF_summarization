' i 'm happy to be on the podium again
obviously it would have been nice to go for the win but it 's hard when you 're coming into the final and everyone 's attacking
you ca n't really go with everything and some people do n't want to pull as much
on his crash , geraint thomas added : ' the grass was softer than the tarmac ! it was unbelievable
it was hard enough just trying to stay on the bike
fortunately it was all okay in the end
' i 'll rest up now
have a good massage , eat well , stay in bed and put my feet up until sunday
