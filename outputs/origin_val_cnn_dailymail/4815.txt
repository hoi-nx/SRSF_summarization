shazam , the app created to recognise an artist from a few seconds of music , says it wants to branch out into identifying objects , such as food , paintings and books ' shazam is already a verb , ' chief executive riley told reuters at the mobile world congress industry fair in barcelona
' we want to expand the universe of what you can shazam ' the latest funding comes on top of $ 40 million raised from mexican telecoms billionaire carlos slim in 2013
riley said these additional funds would help the venture - capital backed company add to its 250 - strong staff and sign additional partnerships with publishers and content companies
the london - based company behind the mobile app has raised $ 30 million from several unidentified billionaires to finance the change
the company has yet to reveal details about how it would work , but one possibility is that such a service would work based on bar codes ' the famous blue button that our users love will remain on the home screen but will be able to do much more , ' he said
just in time for spring , scientists hope to launch a ' shazam for birds ' that will help people identify the tweets that are waking them up in the morning
the app , dubbed warblr , claims to be able to recognise the song of 88 bird species , and could help track their migration patterns
like shazam , it works by recording nearby noises on smartphones to analyse it in real - time and identify the bird species according to its tweet whenever the app identifies a bird , geo - tracking allows it to map which species is being spotted where and when , with the information made public
the information will be made publicly available to allow zoologists and ecologists monitor species growth and decline , as well as patterns of migration
the company has yet to reveal details about how it would work , but one possibility is that such a service would work based on bar codes
this would make it similar to amazon âs fire phone which can already identify products by scanning these codes
shazam has evolved markedly since 1999 when it was founded , gaining popularity with its ability to recognise a piece of music with the click of a button on the phone
it now sells songs that its users identify , having secured deals with all the major streaming music services including spotify and deezer
lately it has also become a port of call for advertisers who want to find ways to instantly link up with their target audiences
although shazam does not disclose its revenues or other financials , it says the latest funding round valued it at over $ 1 billion
it also has the attributes of a listed company , riley said , such as a strong brand , scale and revenue , although the company is not yet profitable since it is still seeking to grow
' our business model is real and developed , not to be determined like so many web apps or start - ups , ' he said .
