it is the largest cave in the world , with its own sheer rocky cliffs , jungle - like vegetation and climate
so it is no wonder photographer ryan deboodt , 31 , relied on a drone to capture footage showing the immense size of the hang son doong cave in vietnam
the result is a spectacular video showcasing the dramatic topography inside the cave , which is 5.5 miles long , 650ft wide and 500ft tall
opening with shots pan across the vast jungle - like vegetation and adventurers are traipsing through the cave are dwarfed by their immense surroundings
ryan deboodt , originally from america but now living in beijing , china , described the cave as like an extraterrestrial planet
he said : ' this was my third visit to hang son doong
it was actually last minute that i even decided to take the drone in with me
' i was originally going in to the cave to collect three timelapse cameras i had in there for six months to document the flooding
' the process took ryan deboodt eight days to complete and he was required to take a lot of ropes , harnesses and safety equipment into the cave with him
the drone captures the staggering height of the cave and people in the images appear to be specks on the landscape a time lapse shot captures a beam of sun light moving through the top of the cave over the course of a day outside shots of the cave show the magnitude of it and capture the grand scale of its reported 500ft tourists with a spare Â£ 1,800 ( $ 3,000 ) can take tours of the cave with a company called oxalis
a team of more than 25 porters , safety experts and guides take the tour over six days
the journey to the cave takes a day and a half through dense uninhabited jungle , before you abseil 260ft down to its entrance
tours must be booked in advance as there is a strict limit of 10 guests per departure
he said : ' throughout the entire cave you have to be extra cautious , as something as simple as a twisted ankle can cause much grief and effort in order to get back out of the cave
' ryan deboodt explained that while he was within the cave he would n't have been surprised to have seen a dinosaur
he said : ' being inside hang son doong is absolutely unreal
i felt tiny , insignificant
' the cave was first discovered in 1991 , when a local farmer stumbled across it and sought shelter there from a storm
before the chance discovery , it had remained undetected beneath the annamite mountains in a remote part of central vietnam for millions of years
unable to find the cave again on a repeat visit , the farmer gave up the hunt until he was approached by a group of cavers to help him find it
the colossal underground network of tunnels was discovered in 2009 and officially named the world 's largest cave
a natural staircase covered in greenery is captured up - close and explorers can be seen climbing them the cave was first discovered in 1991 by a local farmer and is five times the size of malaysia 's deer cave a number of shots capture beams of sun light and the vast jungle - like vegetation that grows inside the cave the name ' hang son doong ' cave means ' mountain river cave '
it was created 2 - 5 million years ago by river water eroding away the limestone underneath the mountain where the limestone was weak , the ceiling collapsed creating huge skylights
the mesmerising six - minute - long video presents the different parts of the underground world , from the harsh and jagged rocks to the lush greenery and the cave 's own lake and river
a timelapse shot captures the sun filtering through one of the many sinkholes which allows natural light in to illuminated the hidden underground world
