wigan warriors player flower was banned after attacking st helens half - back lance hohaia flower is given his marching orders by the referee after the clash in the super league grand final in october wigan warriors coach shaun wane says flower will return for his struggling team once his ban comes to an end shaun wane has a policy of re-introducing players through partner club workington following lengthy lay - offs , but says his hand has been forced by his team 's disappointing start to the season and the shortage of front - row options
dom crosby and ryan sutton are currently injured , leaving lee mossop as the wigan warriors ' only specialist prop , and shaun wane has been forced to use utility forwards tony clubb , larne patrick and taulima tautai as front - row options
' it would have been hard to drop one of our middles if we had won every game but , as it stands now , it 's not that hard , ' shaun wane said
' i 've looked at him in training and he 's ready to go
i would n't have thrown him in straight away had things panned out differently
it 's definitely dictated the way we 've approached things with him over the last couple of months
' flower walks off the pitch after his sending off at old trafford last year flower , who missed out on the club 's pre-season trip to the united states , underwent knee surgery during his enforced absence and has stepped up his training under head conditioner mark bitcon
' he 's fit , ' shaun wane said
' mark bitcon has done a great job with him
his knee is good so everything he had done is spot on
' i 'm confident i can put him back in
i just need to put three middles on the bench and that will cover him
