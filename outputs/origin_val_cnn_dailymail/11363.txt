downing street was last night claiming victory in the battle over the election tv debates after ed miliband was forced to line up with the minnow parties on a â night of the non-entities â
election labour reacted with fury when the broadcasters announced â after weeks of wrangling â that neither david cameron nor nick clegg would be invited to the second debate on april 16
only the non-governing parties will feature , meaning mr ed miliband will appear with the leaders of ukip , the snp , the greens and plaid cymru
david cameron will only appear in one full debate , hosted by itv on thursday , april 2 , with the six other party leaders ed miliband will have to line up with the minnow parties on a â night of the non-entities â because neither david cameron nor nick clegg will be invited to the second debate on april 16 mr nick clegg âs absence means that mr ed miliband will not be able to accuse mr david cameron of being â chicken â by avoiding the exchange , or force the broadcasters to â empty chair â the prime minister
no10 has also successfully killed the idea of a direct head - to - head debate between mr david cameron and mr ed miliband
the two men will instead join mr nick clegg in making individual appearances in front of a studio audience for a bbc question time special
it means that mr david cameron will only appear in one full debate , hosted by itv on thursday , april 2 , with the six other party leaders
the announcement of the broadcasters â final plans represents a triumph for downing street strategists , who did not want the election campaign to be dominated by the debates , as it was in 2010 , on the grounds that mr ed miliband âs stock is already so low with the public he had the least to lose
but the lib dem have described the final arrangements as a â farce â
and election labour issued an angry statement accusing the broadcasters of reneging on a commitment to proceed with the head - to - head debate programme after â weeks of pressure from the conservative party â , insisting that the â cowardice â of mr david cameron had thwarted the head - to - head encounter
election labour also claimed that mr nick clegg had been excluded from the april 16 debate â at the conservative party âs insistence â to provide cover for the pm âs absence
election labour has claimed that nick clegg ( pictured ) had been excluded from the april 16 debate â at the conservative party âs insistence â to provide cover for the pm âs absence ukip leader nigel farage areacted angrily , saying tv debates were now ' so far from the original proposals ' a election labour spokesman said : â the whole country will understand the reasons for this : the prime minister wants to minimise the scope of televised debates between himself and ed miliband
â we hope that even at this late stage david cameron will rethink his decision not to take part on april 16
â the prime minister âs repeated attempts to dictate the abandonment of these tv programmes to independent broadcasters is deeply worrying
â the spokesman added that after the election labour would seek to put future debate programmes on a statutory footing
ukip leader nigel farage also reacted angrily , saying : â tv debates are now so far from the original proposals
they âve kow - towed to manipulation from downing street
â in a joint statement , the bbc , itv , sky and channel 4 said : â we âre delighted there will be a debate with all the party leaders during the campaign
the debate on april 2 will build on the success of the 2010 tv debates so valued by viewers
â a lib dem spokesman said : â if it was down to us , we would be in every tv debate
but the politicians and broadcasters have ducked and dived on this long enough and need to get on with it
frankly this is all a farce â
a no10 spokesman said : â we have agreed to the broadcasters â proposal
