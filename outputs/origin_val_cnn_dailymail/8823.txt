a woman has finally achieved her dream of having children , thanks to eggs donated by her sister
blake , 41 , spent six years and Â£ 7,000 trying to conceive as her and her partner stephen , 37 , both suffer from unexplained fertility problems
after a fourth round of ivf failed , the couple , from gateshead , tyne and wear , were told their chances of having a baby was less than five per cent unless they found an egg donor
seeing how desperate they were to become parents , miss blake 's younger sister , julie wealand , 35 , offered to donate her own eggs
and finally , in december 2013 , miss blake became pregnant
she gave birth to healthy twin baby boys joshua and harrison , now 8 months , in july last year
blake , 41 , gave birth to healthy twin boys joshua and harrison , now 8 month , in july 2014 miss blake said : ' i was so happy to discover that i was finally pregnant
' julie wealand has given me the best gift i could ask for , i 'll be forever grateful
' the couple 's fertility problems began in 2007 after they started trying for a baby
miss blake , who has been in a relationship with stephen for 15 years , said : ' we started trying for baby when i was 34 , but after two years we realised something was wrong
' doctors could n't explain my fertility problems - i just could n't get pregnant
my sister had also struggled to conceive so i knew my age was n't to blame
' growing up , i always dreamed of having at least two children , and there was nothing i wanted more than to be a mum
' my friends have kids , most from when they were younger , so i only had to attend one baby shower
but when i saw people with children , i wished it would be me
' aged 36 , she turned to ivf treatment in an attempt to conceive
but three agonising years and three failed ivf attempts later , the pair were still childless
meanwhile her sister mrs julie wealand , who lives in california with her husband , gave birth to two children of her own , conceived through ivf treatment
miss blake said : ' i was truly pleased for her when she said she was pregnant
even though she lives abroad , we 're really close and i loved buying clothes for my unborn nephew
' but i still longed for a child so stephen and i pooled our life savings to buy a fourth round of ivf
' adopting would have been our final chance for children because we could n't afford to pay for more treatments
' miss blake ( right ) had been trying to conceive for six years , and had spent Â£ 7,000 on ivf treatment
she was only able to have children when her sister , julie wealand , 35 , ( left ) , donated her eggs miss blake became pregnant in december 2013 , and gave birth to twins joshua in july 2014
she said her sister had given her ' the best gift she could have ever asked for ' but the consultant broke the news that they had just a five per cent chance of conceiving and the chances would only increase if they were to use donated eggs
miss blake said : ' at first we were devastated - they did n't accept anonymous donors so we had to find someone that we knew , who would be willing to donate their eggs
' we went to my parent 's house where my sister was staying and told her what the consultant said
' she promptly replied " you can use mine "
' i was in disbelief and giddy with excitement
' after mrs julie wealand 's generous offer , they began the long process of tests and counselling
her eggs were harvested and fertilised with stephen 's sperm
a year later , miss blake was implanted with mrs julie wealand 's eggs , but sadly , it was unsuccessful
miss blake said : ' i was so disappointed when i discovered that julie wealand 's eggs had n't worked
' but despite the emotional toll , i knew i had to just carry on
' so later that year in december 2013 , they tried for the final time , using miss wealand 's embryos they 'd frozen from the fourth try
miss blake , pictured with partner stephen , 37 , and her newborn babies , gave birth by caesarean section as doctors feared she might be suffering from pre-eclampsia miss blake and her partner said they were ' overjoyed ' when they discovered they were having twins , who , eight months later , are thriving she will now celebrate mother 's day with her sons
she said : ' i 'll be forever grateful to my sister for giving me the best present ever : motherhood ' miss blake became pregnant two weeks later and discovered she was having twins
she said : ' i 'd taken at least 50 pregnancy tests , which were all negative , while trying to conceive from ivf , so seeing the little blue line on the pregnancy test was surreal
' during a hospital scan , we discovered we were having twins , i was even more overjoyed
' at 35 weeks , doctors worried that blake was suffering from pre-eclampsia - a dangerous condition involving high blood pressure , which affects some women in the second half of their pregnancy
in order to minimize the risk , doctors delivered the twin babies via caesarean section
miss blake said : ' i was disappointed that i would n't have a natural birth , but all i cared about was the boys being healthy
' julie wealand wanted to be my side when i gave birth , but only one person is allowed in the operating theatre so stephen clutched my hand instead
' without her , we would n't have a beautiful family
' now eight months old , harrison and joshua are thriving
miss blake said : ' i still ca n't believe i 'm a mum and i ca n't wait to celebrate mother 's day with the boys
' i 'll be forever grateful to my sister for giving me the best present ever : motherhood
