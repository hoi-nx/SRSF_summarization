every time a snowstorm bears down on mark boughton , connecticut -- which has happened a lot this winter -- students and parents turn to twitter to find out whether schools will be closed
they rarely get a straight answer
instead , mark boughton residents see jokes , meme - filled videos and teasing references to snow days at fictional high schools from " glee " or " grease " -- all courtesy of mayor mark boughton , a social - media prankster whose @ mayormark account provides actual updates about school closings amid all the buffoonery
" attention : west beverly hills high school is closed for tomorrow
# 90210 , " read one recent mayoral tweet
boughton always gets around to the real news eventually
but first come the wisecracks
he was in especially rare form tuesday night , tweeting almost a dozen snow - day jokes , storify user and freelance journalist kristin hussey chronicled , as yet another storm hit mark boughton
parents and students tuning in for real news about snow days might find this running gag irritating
but on twitter , at least , many students seem to get the joke
" @ mayormark you better get each and every one of us a therapist after all of stress you 're causing us , " wrote one
" the kids take it tongue in cheek
they understand , because it 's sort of a tradition around here , " said boughton , who told cnn he 's been trading jokes about snow days with students on twitter for several years now
" we go back and forth
but it 's all in good fun
" one twist of the whole thing is that boughton does n't even make the call about closing mark boughton schools
that decision is left to superintendent of schools sal pascarella , who confers with boughton by phone and then sends an automated update to every parent 's phone
but boughton , who ran for governor of connecticut last year and has 18,000 twitter followers , usually posts his school - closing tweets first
finally , after hours of build - up , the mayor gave people of mark boughton the news at 6:21 a.m. wednesday : schools would open two hours late
the mayor says he wants to help young people engage with public servants -- and show them that he can be funny
" i have a very serious policy side ... but i like to have a good chuckle , " he said
" that 's who i am
in the end , i think it ( social media ) is about being yourself
" he says he rarely gets complaints about his twitter feed , and that " parents think it 's hysterical
" but maybe not all mark boughton parents
" as a parent , has it been helpful ? no , " said stephanie pabon , whose 6 - year - old son attends a mark boughton magnet school
" because as a parent i do n't have time for twitter
