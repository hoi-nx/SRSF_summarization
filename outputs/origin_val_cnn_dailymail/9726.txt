in what doctors are calling an extraordinarily rare case of survival , a 22 - month - old pennsylvania boy whose lifeless body was pulled from an icy creek was revived after an hour and 41 minutes of cpr , and has suffered virtually no lingering effects
gardell came home from the hospital on sunday , and his doctors said thursday he has made a full recovery
' it 's not only extraordinarily rare that we got the kid back , but what 's even more extraordinary is the rate at which he recovered and the completeness of his recovery , ' said dr. maffei , director of the pediatric intensive care unit at geisinger 's janet weis children 's hospital in danville
' gardell and two of his brothers had gone outside to play on march 11 when , at some point , he fell into the stream that runs through their five - acre property near mifflinburg and was swept away by the fast - moving current
his seven - year - old brother , greg , ran into the house and screamed that he could n't find gardell
their mother , rose martin , did a quick search of the property before realizing her young son had likely fallen into the creek , which was swollen because of melting snow
she called 911 while her two teenage daughters began walking downstream in a frantic search for the toddler
scene of the incident : gardell 's body temperature was 77 degrees , more than 20 degrees below normal , after he fell into this river - against all odds , his heart restarted after cpr it was a neighbor who found gardell nearly a quarter - mile away , caught up in a tree branch , the water gushing around his body
an ambulance crew arrived moments later , found no pulse and began cpr
resuscitation would continue , unbroken , for 101 minutes - in the ambulance , at a community hospital , aboard a medical helicopter and , finally , in the emergency room of janet weis , the pediatric wing of geisinger medical center , where a team of some 30 doctors and nurses sprang into action
gardell 's body temperature was 77 degrees when he arrived , more than 20 degrees below normal
in this case , the boy 's profound hypothermia worked to his advantage , dramatically slowing his metabolism and giving his organs ' some degree of protection from cardiac arrest , ' maffei said
knowing that , maffei ordered cpr to continue while the team slowly warmed his body
at around 82 degrees , they detected a pulse
against all odds , his heart had restarted
hours later , gardell regained consciousness - and his brain function was normal , stunning doctors yet again
' it was an act of god , ' said his grateful mother , rose martin
' there is no doubt in my mind it 's a miracle
god had the right people in the right place at the right time and they all did a wonderful job
' dr. lambert , the attending physician in the pediatric intensive care unit , said gardell belonged in a ' rare , rare , extreme category for recovery
' a week later , the medical team is still on a high
it ' provides us with a smile on our face , knowing you were part of something this wonderful and amazing , ' lambert said
back at home , gardell is walking - though he still needs to regain a bit of balance - and chattering away
but not about his ordeal
' it 's hard to tell how much he remembers or knows about what happened , ' his mother said
' he ca n't really tell us in that way
