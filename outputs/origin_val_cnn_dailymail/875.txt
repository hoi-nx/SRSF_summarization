the cancer was killing her , but so was the chemo
she hated what was happening to her and did nât recognise herself any more

she started enjoying life again and asked me : â can we go on holiday ? â she was looking forward to christmas and , my god , bellingham loved christmas
â every year she bought a huge tree and enough decorations to light up regent street
she was a fantastic cook , and she âd lay out the table for a banquet for 25 people
â i really thought she âd make it
i even thought that if her quality of life improved , come november she might want to continue with the chemo
but her cancer was so aggressive , she did nât make it to the end of october
