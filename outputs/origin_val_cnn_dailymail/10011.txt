a remote island in the pacific whose residents are descendants of the swashbuckling british sailors and tahitian women immortalised in the mutiny on the bounty movies is set to lose its right to self - rule
norfolk island , 900 miles east of the australian coast and settled by the relatives of fletcher christian and other hms bounty mutineers in 1856 , has about 1,800 residents and has governed itself since 1979
but it is effectively bankrupt and on thursday , canberra said it would introduce legislation next week to scrap the australian territory 's parliament
the former military barracks in kingston , the capital of norfolk island , which is set to lose its right to self - rule australian prime minister tony abbott has come under fire for the move - with the descendants of the mutineers leading the opposition
if it passes , the island 's legislative assembly will be temporarily replaced by an advisory council , before local government elections in 2016
personal and business tax will be introduced from july 2016 and residents will in return be able to access social security , healthcare benefits and services enjoyed by australian
the island , which has it 's own native dialect called norfuk , will no longer run its own immigration , customs , quarantine , education , police and social services , according to the telegraph
australian 's assistant regional development minister , jamie briggs , said the changes were long overdue and it was not sustainable to ask a community of just 1,800 to deliver local , state and federal services
he said the infrastructure on norfolk island was run down , the health system is not up to standard and the laws are out of date
' the community overwhelmingly supports reform and is of the view that the current governance arrangements are not suitable , ' he said , adding that norfolk island was effectively in administration and reliant on australian bailouts
' it is diabolical -- it is quite concerning that it 's been left for so long , ' he added
norfolk island : it is 900 miles east of the australian coast and settled by the relatives of fletcher christian and other hms bounty mutineers in 1856 romanticised : actor mel gibson played fletcher christian in the 1984 film the bounty , based on the true story norfolk island chief minister snell said it was unfair to impose such a decision on the tiny outcrop , just five miles long by three miles wide
' norfolk islanders will lose their identity , they will lose their way of life , ' mr snell told the australian broadcasting corporation
most of the population are descendants of the mutineers who set captain william bligh adrift from british royal navy ship hms bounty in 1789
the mutiny gained such a romantic gloss that chief mutineer christian has been portrayed by a series of hollywood heartthrobs over the years , including errol flynn , clark gable , marlon brando and mel gibson
the mutineers settled in tahitian but later fled , along with their tahitian women , to remote pitcairn to escape arrest
some 60 years after arriving on pitcairn , almost 200 descendents of the original mutineers relocated to norfolk island to avoid famine
queen victoria granted them the right to settle in the abandoned former penal colony
forefather : the bulk of the island 's ancestors arrived in the late 1700s when the hms bounty - the british naval vessel on which a mutiny occurred in 1790 - washed up on the isle , led by fletcher christian ( pictured )
