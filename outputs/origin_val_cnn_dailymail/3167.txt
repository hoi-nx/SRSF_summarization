colin and mcarthur are facing a Â£ 500 damages claim for discrimination after refusing to bake a cake supporting gay marriage a court ruling over a christian bakery which refused to make a pro-gay marriage cake could lead to said muslim printers being forced to reproduce cartoons of the mohammed , it has been claimed
colin and mcarthur , owners of ashers baking company , in northern ireland , are facing a discrimination claim after they refused to bake a cake featuring sesame street characters bert and ernie under the slogan ' support gay marriage
' but now a leading lawyer has warned that if the case is successful it could set a dangerous legal precedent and undermine freedom of conscience
aidan o'neill qc said the case could mean atheist web designers being forced to build a website saying god created the world in six days , or lesbian t - shirt makers being compelled to print shirts saying gay marriage is an ' abomination '
mr o'neill posed the hypothetical scenarios in a legal opinion penned ahead of a hearing at belfast county court later this month
the case began in may last year after lgbt activist gareth lee placed an order for a novelty cake featuring sesame street characters bert and ernie
the design called for the puppets , who are often likened to a gay married couple , arm in arm under the slogan ' support gay marriage '
while the bakery initially took the order and a deposit , mr gareth lee was later told they would be unable to comply on religious grounds , and he was refunded his money
aidan o'neill qc , a prominent human rights lawyer , has said the case could set a dangerous precedent that could lead to said muslim printers being forced to reproduce mohammed cartoons ( pictured , the cake design ) despite being able to find another baker who completed his request on time and at no extra cost , mr gareth lee argues that he has been discriminated against
he is now seeking Â£ 500 in damages in a case which has the backing of the equality commission for northern ireland
mr o'neill has published his legal opinion ahead of the hearing , saying that o'neill and mrs mcarthur are ' committed christian ' , and that their beliefs should also be protected by discrimination laws
he argues that , by being forced to make the cake the couple would be forced to promote a view they do not hold , which goes against their right to freedom of expression
mr o'neill argues that o'neill and mrs mcarthur are ' committed christian ' and that their right to freedom of expression is also protected under human rights laws ( pictured , the couple 's bakery ) he added : ' this freedom not to be forced or required to express support for a particular opinion or political position was , indeed , the very one which sir thomas more strove to uphold in declining to sign the act of supremacy declaring henry viii to be the supreme head of the church of england
' colin hart , director of the christian institute which commissioned mr o'neill , said : ' the strength and clarity of the advice from mr oâneill , who has a national reputation for his human rights expertise , should set off the alarm bells in this government quango
' it spells out the very real dangers and far - reaching implications for freedom of speech , but the equality watchdog seems determined to force people to use their creative skills to promote a political cause they fundamentally disagree with
' this family run bakers serve gay customers all the time but they did nât want to promote gay marriage
