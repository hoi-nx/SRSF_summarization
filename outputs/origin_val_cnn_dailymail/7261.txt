after new england chairman graves hinted last weekend there is still a possibility of a return to international cricket for the record - breaking batsman , sacked last year , the first definite attempt by a county to secure his services surfaced on friday
leicestershire chief executive wasim told cricinfo he had been in touch with pietersen 's advisers about the possibility of signing the 34 - year - old between his existing commitments at the indian and caribbean premier leagues
pietersen played for surrey in last year 's natwest twenty20 blast pietersen 's agent confirmed an initial discussion did take place , but added it was ' some time ago '
leicestershire 's gambit therefore appears to pre-date graves ' remarks , in which he indicated pietersen 's return to county cricket - as a pre-requisite of being considered again for england - would need to encompass all formats , rather than just t20
wasim told cricinfo : ' i approached his agent about his t20 availability
' but he said it was unlikely he would play any t20 ( in england ) due to his full cpl commitments
