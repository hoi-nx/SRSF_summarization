long before he was diagnosed with alzheimer 's , reagan 's speech may have contained clues to his worsening mental state
this is according to us scientists who have found subtle changes in the former president 's speech during his term in office from 1981 to 1989
reagan was diagnosed with alzheimer 's in 1994 , and always maintained that he would resign from his post if his mental health went into decline
this image was taken in 1991 in california , just three years before the president was diagnosed with dementia early detection could slow the progression of the disease before it severely damages the brain
reagan died at the age of 93 in 2004
in 2010 , a book marking the 100th anniversary of his birth included claims by his son ron , that he saw early signs of dementia in ' an out - of - touch president ' during the 1984 campaign
he says he saw those signs again in 1986 where he claimed his father could not remember the names of the familiar california canyons he was flying over
this did n't stop his adversaries claiming his tendency to forget names and make contradictory statements was the result dementia
now researchers at the university of arizona believe reagan was suffering from the early onset of alzheimer 's while acting as president
they came to the conclusion after comparing transcripts of 46 news conferences that reagan held to the 101 sessions george h. w. bush held in his term
' key word counts previously associated with cognitive decline in alzheimer 's disease were extracted and regression analyses were conducted , ' the authors wrote
reagan used words such as ' thing ' as a trigger to recall the correct words more often george h. w. bush
he also used more repetition
the team used a new algorithm based on a technique used by others to analyse changes in writing by novelists , according to a report in the new york times
' president reagan showed a significant reduction in the number of unique words over time and a significant increase in conversational fillers and non-specific nouns over time , ' the researchers said
' there was no significant trend in these features for president george h. w. bush , ' they added
the findings , published in the journal of alzheimer 's disease , do not conclusively prove that reagan had dementia that affected his judgment as president

he also used more repetition but the scientists involved in the project hope the technique will help reveal signs of alzheimer 's and other neurological diseases much earlier

the telltale signs of alzheimer âs can be seen in people as young as 20 , research shows
the â unprecedented â finding suggests that the disease starts to eat away at the brain half a century before symptoms develop
this is a â much younger age than the scientists ever imagined â
the discovery raises the prospect of giving people drugs in the very earliest stages , when it is easiest to treat , and even stopping the disease in its tracks
however , britons experts cautioned that the research is still at an early stage
crucially , it is nât known how many people who have the early signs of alzheimer âs in their brains in their 20s will go on to develop the disease
alzheimer âs and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 britons and , worldwide , the number of sufferers is predicted to treble to 44million by 2050 as the population ages

while some people suggest they knew reagan had the disease while in office , his four white house doctors said they saw no evidence of it
alzheimer 's is an incurable neurological disorder which destroys brain cells
mr reagan informed the nation in a hand written letter when he was formally diagnosed
' had the diagnosis been made in , say , 1987 , would he have stepped down ? ' , ron asks in the book
' i believe he would have '
