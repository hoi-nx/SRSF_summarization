islamic state supporters have taken to social media to boast about the recruitment of a failed party loving rapper from tunisia
maurouane douiri , better known by his stage name emino , announced his decision to join isis by posting a picture of himself holding a goat , allegedly in iraq
emino appears to have abandoned his trademark ushanka hat and is shown wearing a long red and white arab scarf
emino was one of a dozen tunisia rappers who were vocal critics of president zine el abidine ben ali 's regime
previously the 25 year old used his social media page to proudly show off photos of himself surrounded with a bevy of scantily clad ladies
one of the photos shows the rapper being touched and stroked by a group of women , with one of them appears to be drinking from a suspicious looking wine glass
emino is no trendsetter - at least three other failed rappers have joined isis over the last few years

u.s. failed rapper mccain was reportedly killed fighting for isis last august
mccain , who enjoyed smoking marijuana in the park and had previous convictions for disorderly conduct , is thought to have converted to islam in 2004
after travelling to istanbul , mccain crossed the border and entered syria sometime in june 2014
the 33 - year - old was killed whilst fighting against the free syrian army in late august his body was identified by his distinctive neck tattoo , a hallmark of his wilder days in minnesota
tunisia has long been a hot - bed of would be jihadist sympathetic to the isis cause , with an estimated 3,000 people fighting in syria â the highest number of any country
the north african country has always been a breeding ground for terrorists , with extremists advantage of bored and jobless young men looking for an escape route
but the recent surge in numbers seems to be down to the hard - line groups which have taken advantage of the relaxing laws following the jasmine revolution in 2011 - including islamist militant group ansar al sharia , which the u.s. brands as a terrorist organisation and blames for a 2012 attack on the u.s. embassy in tunis
the government also released a number of fundamentalists from prison â allowing them to mix freely with the population once more
these groups have taken advantage of the declining economy , capitalising on the disappointment felt by those who expected a change after the arab spring , according to triki , a lawyer who represents returning jihadists
â the arab revolutions raised an expectation that was n't met â people thought their lives would improve , but instead they got worse , â mr triki told the telegraph
â in syria , they are told they âll get houses , they âll get wives
these people are so alienated from our society that some choose this option in a heartbeat
â social media is also blamed , with pictures of isis fighters getting thousands of likes and recruiters using facebook to find any potential fighters , much like is seen in the british
but with the rise of isis in libya , to the east , and al-qaeda affiliated groups in algeria , to the west , it is now easy to join a â jihad â , and get arms into tunisia itself
â tunisia is surrounded by jihadist groups in the mountains who coordinate with the terrorists in libya ... libya is the main source of arms for jihadists in tunisia , â said prime minister mehdi jomaa
but despite this , tunisia is seen as the success story of the arab spring , and tourist numbers have been on the increase once more as people begin to feel the area is safe once more
in 2013 , 6.27million people visited tunisia
of those , almost 330,000 were british , while 985,000 were french .
