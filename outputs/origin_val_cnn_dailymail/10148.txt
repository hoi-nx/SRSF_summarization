home : the former university challenge host has inherited west horsley place near leatherhead in surrey the 50 - room house was left to bamber gascoigne by his aunt and godmother , the the duchess of roxburghe ( pictured ) , who was one of the train - bearers for queen elizabeth at the 1937 coronation of king george vi â but it âs such an incredible place and we knew it well , so the idea of immediately selling it off seemed not only amazingly foolish but also missing the fun that was involved
â having spent many memorable times with my godmother here , and knowing how special the house was to her and her family , together with my wife i decided to take up the challenge of carrying out the essential work to the house to ensure that it can withstand what may lie ahead over the course of its future
â christina said that once it was restored to its full glory it could be worth up to Â£ 10million
the house itself was once visited by king henry viii for a 35 - course banquet
the duchess , who was born mary evelyn hungerford crewe-milnes in 1915 , was one of the great beauties of her age and a goddaughter of george v. she died last year .
