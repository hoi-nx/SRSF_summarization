a judge told the company director he had shown â no remorse or concern â by refusing to help his lover , who was forced to make her own way to hospital for treatment
jailing him on friday , isleworth crown court recorder philip shepherd qc said : ' you were trying to force yourself sexually on her and she was unwilling to have sex with you
' you used considerable force to kick her out of bed when your advances were rejected and the injury is one she still suffers continuing effects
' the evidence from her was that you went around the side of the bed and kicked her when she was on the floor and you made no attempt to assist her when she was obviously injured and she had to make her way to hospital alone
' you showed no remorse or concern and did nothing at all and you put her through the trauma of a trial
' florey , who was cautioned in 2011 for punching another old harrovian at a school reunion over an old playground rivalry , was also ordered to pay Â£ 6,000 compensation and Â£ 2,800 court costs following the incident in the early hours of march 4 last year
florey , from high wycombe , buckinghamshire , is a director of several educational services companies and started an affair with miss olga grigorash in 2013 after she applied for an internship
at his trial , jurors were told she knew he was married and they often met in london , sometimes at a flat in shepherd âs bush where florey âs parents and sister lived
the court was also told their sex life was frequently the cause of arguments and florey could turn â violent , rude and sadistic â
â whenever i was late he was so rude , he was quite sadistic ... and i could see he became violent , â she said
â when i did nât do it the way he wanted he got pretty aggressive
â and when he failed to perform in bed he would â take it out â on her , it was claimed
â ( he ) was quite violent with me and hurt me and was very unpleasant , â she added
florey , 48 , ( pictured above outside court ) , who is cambridge - educated and originally from high wycombe , buckinghamshire , tried to force himself sexually on his unwilling mistress of one year , the judge told the court the incident took place in march last year after the pair had dinner and drinks after attending a conference at the london school of economics before returning to a notting hill flat florey had rented for the night
outlining the incident , prosecutor neil griffin told the court : ' the defendant has kicked miss olga grigorash out of bed
a kick of such force that she fell against the wall and fractured her wrist
' it seems the defendant rubbed toothpaste into her dress as they were brushing their teeth in the bathroom and this upset her , along with him going out to smoke because she did not like smoking
' she decided to keep her dress on and the defendant had undressed down to his boxers and tried very roughly to kiss her
' he had a second cigarette and returned to the bedroom and forced himself onto her and she told him he was hurting her
' suddenly he kicked her , she says , to the back
she fell out of the bed against the wall and onto the floor and florey shouted : " get out "
' florey was jailed at isleworth crown court ( pictured ) for 18 months for grievous bodily harm , handed a restraining order which bans him from having contact with miss olga grigorash and ordered to pay compensation miss olga grigorash then grabbed her clothes and left the flat before flagging down a taxi to take her to st. mary 's hospital , where her wrist was put in a cast
florey was later arrested at heathrow airport returning from a business trip
stuart stevens , defending , said his client was â a respected gentleman â and had lost his good character
he added : â he feels totally disgraced and ashamed and the hardest thing was telling his mother
this was out of character and was not calculated
it was an over-reaction , he says , to being told he was not rich enough
â he earns a decent living , but is not a rich man and with this conviction he will not be able to go to certain countries now
â speaking to the evening standard yesterday , miss olga grigorash , who has a master âs degree in art business at kingston university and is now a pa for an artist in chelsea , said : ' i am happy that justice has taken place and i hope he will thank me one day for that
' he needed to be stopped i think that what happened could have happened to someone else again and who knows what the consequences would have been
' he is a very strong man and he does not know how to control himself
i hope he has enough time [ in prison ] to think about it and i really hope he will not harm anyone else further
' i want to close the door on this episode in my life and not think about it anymore
