it is one of cambodia 's most popular tourist cities , where visitors flock to visit the nearby ruined temples of the angkor region
but while foreign visitors stay in luxury hotels and splash out of escorted trips to discover the delights of 12th - century temple angkor wat , families work in a rubbish dump just 18.6 miles away for a meager Â£ 1 a day
and now the rubbish site itself has piqued the curiosity of tourists , who have added a morbid visit of the site to their tour itineraries , so they can snap photos with the children working to sort the rubbish
sigen rathy is 12 years old
she has worked at the site for a year and has seen many tour groups passing through the landfill site to photograph what they see a japanese tourist covers her mouth with her hands due to the strong smell caused by the mountains of toxic waste and decaying food the desperate photos showing the hard life of adults and children living and working at the site were taken by spanish filmmaker david rengel , who visited the area to document child labour conditions in the country
but the director was further shocked when he saw groups of tourists visiting the rubbish site to see the locals at work , take photos of the children and hand out sweets

workers are the extensive rubbish dump breathe toxic fumes on a daily basis as they work and live at the site
lia neang syer is 14 years old
she has worked at the dump for four years and had to give up her studies because she had no money to pay for books and extra lessons
she has two sisters and one younger brother
their mother also works at the garbage dump
she does not like the job but she is forced because her family need the money to live viku tupse is nine years old and has lived at the rubbish dump for two years
among the rubbish found a broken face of mickey , he told david rengel knows that it will entertain the tourists when he places it on his head
he does not understand why tourists visit the garbage dump where he works , but he likes the sweets that tourists give him in recent years , the huge increase in siem reap 's population - in part to deal with the influx of tourists - has caused an exponential increase in the amount of rubbish taken to the dump site - causing even worse conditions for workers
local organisations have also noticed an increase in the number of tourists visiting to site out of curiosity , to photograph the poverty - stricken locals working to sort the rubbish
david rengel explained : ' i went to siem reap , where my colleague and friend omar havana , a freelance photographer for getty images , had been developing a project over various years
he gave me the contacts i needed to enter the site
' while i was taking photos to demonstrate the realities of child labour , i realised tourists were arriving to visit , sometimes in buses and other times in tuk - tuks , cambodia taxis , i thought it was horrible , and it should be reported
' in that moment , i changed my point of view and instead decided to report on the practice of tourism as one of the causes of slave labour , including child labour

the landfill is located a few kilometers from siem reap , the most famous tourist destination in cambodia kon mai is 15 years old and has worked at the dump since he was 12
he had to leave school because his parents constantly are travelling from one place to another in search of work
he has five younger brothers and theer are reported problems of domestic violence at home hael kemra is 15 years old
in the future she wants to be an english teacher
she began working at the dump at just 10 years old
her mother was who took her to the garbage dump to earn money when her father abandoned them while spending time talking to the 200 or so people living at the site , more of 50 of whom are children , david rengel realised the rubbish dump was being offered as an alternative kind of tour to the usual temple visits
he told mailonline travel : ' what disgusted me , what i did n't understand and what i do n't think is understandable is why these tourist visit places where children work , or visit orphanages where children have lost their parents
' it seems awful to me that tourists and people with money take part in this , from their position of privilege , show such contempt towards the inhabitants of the countries they visit and towards their human rights
' what is the most contemptuous , what we should n't allow under any circumstances , is that they use children like a some kind of entertainment , violating all their human rights in the process

they rest and laugh on a hammock in the landfill , while they are awaiting the next truckload of waste
most children begin work in the landfill at 10 or 12 years old a truckload of waste , organic and inorganic , some toxic , reaches the dump of anlong pi , just outside siem reap sau srey neang is 11 years old
she comes from a family of seven and her father left to work in thailand six months ago - they have n't heard from him since
she wants to continue with her studies so she can become a teacher of the 200 or so who work at the site , there are some families that also live there , building houses just beyond the dump and the toxic fumes of the site
david rengel explained : ' the houses and hammocks you see in teh pictures are areas that have been constructed so the workers can rest during their long days at the site
' they earn their money separating paper , metal , plastic and all recyclable materials then having them weighed and sold to the company that controls the rubbish dump
' children and their parents are all landfill workers and spend 10 hours a day scavenging for rubbish and recyclable materials every day tons of organic and inorganic waste arrive in large trucks forming mountains of toxic compounds , between those mountains the inhabitants of the landfill seek recyclable materials such as glass , paper and metal with which earn money in recent years the garbage generated in siem reap has doubled and the landfill capacity has been exceeded he added : ' i spoke to the locals about whether tourist visits were a rare occurrence
they told me that every day tourists arrive
hotels and tourists guides are offering trips as something exotic and different to the usual temple visits
nobody has banned these visits and the rubbish dump also charges visitors an entry fee
' dubbing the practice ' dirty tourism ' , david rengel explains in the promotional materials for his work : ' around the world , the popularity of the routes of poverty , including orphanages , slums or landfills is growing
' these types of tours use children and their families for the economic benefit of the organizers , leading to greater exploitation and denigrate children as mere leisure objects
