what 's better than the sun on a march day in europe , at the tail end of winter with spring on the doorstep ? no sun , apparently
that was the verdict of many around the continent , who found friday morning 's solar eclipse picture perfect
millions from around north africa , the middle east as well as europe woke up with a chance to see the rare cosmic event
for some of them , it was a partial eclipse ; but others -- say if you were at the north pole , or in svalbard or the faroe islands between iceland and norway -- got the full deal
such eclipses are basically as old as the galaxy itself , happening when the moon and sun are at just the right distance from the earth and they appear to be of the same apparent size in the sky -- even though the sun is actually about 400 times larger
an eclipse happens when the moon passes right in front of the sun , blocking the sunlight and casting a shadow on the earth
that means what used to be morning suddenly looks like nighttime again , until the sun and moon get out of each other 's way
staring at the sun anytime can be a bit dangerous , even when it 's there , not there , then there again during an eclipse
that 's where the term " eclipse blindness " -- which is really retinal burns -- comes from
luckily , a lot of those peering into the skies friday came prepared
at least that was the case for famous bayern munich footballers xabi alonso and pepe reina , who looked cool looking up in their 3-d movie - type glasses
or a bunch of children at stockport grammar , a united kingdom school not far from manchester
one of them looked more like a welder than a stargazer but did n't seem to mind , giving a thumbs - up to the view
not everyone was similarly enthused ; not because they do n't love a good eclipse , but because they do n't like a bad one
cnn 's nick thompson in london , for instance , went out hoping for an out - of - this - world experience and instead saw little more than a bunch of clouds
he was n't alone , as many in united kingdom in particular did n't get the big show they 'd hoped for
clouds be damned , some folks there used a sun costume , along with an earth - and - moon prop , to put on a show of their own
if the sun wo n't come out for you , then you might as well be the sun , their reasoning went
even in the united kingdom , whether you were glasgow university students cheering when a glimpse of the eclipse emerged from the clouds or a bird soaring the sky , there was a lot of enthusiasm for the eclipse
and there were even more cheers elsewhere , in berlin , beirut and beyond
norway , especially , got some of the most spectacular perspectives
eclipses are n't everyday events , and they 're getting less common
while there will be more full eclipses , they will get rarer and rarer as the moon moves away from the earth at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters ( about 1.5 inches ) every year
that means there will come a time when the moon will appear to be too small to cover the sun. but do n't sweat it just yet : nasa calculates this will take about 563 million years , meaning there 's still time to catch another eclipse
weather permitting , of course
