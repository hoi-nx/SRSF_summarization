senior lib dems dems admit the coming election will be ' really tough ' for the party it is suggested that if the tories fall between 10 and 30 seats short of a majority , a deal could be done

it is thought many in the party now wish they had halted and then scrapped the controversial health reforms which were paused but later passed by the two parties .
