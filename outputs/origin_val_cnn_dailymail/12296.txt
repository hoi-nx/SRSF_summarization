in it , fraternity members from your university are chanting a hateful , racist song about lynching african - americans
you 're president of the university
imagine being in that situation
what would you do ? there are two ways to answer the question
the first is in the moment of crisis
the second is about the long term
as most everyone knows by now , boren , president of the university of oklahoma , faced just this situation monday
and i 've been thinking about it intensely , not only because i care about race and civic leadership in u.s. , but also because boren was my first boss , when he was a u.s. senator
i 'm not from oklahoma but ended up working for boren through a college internship
he was a mentor to me during my years in washington , and a model for me when he left the beltway to be of greater use and service as an educator
though we have n't talked since the crisis broke , i see familiar patterns of leadership
boren responded to the crisis swiftly , with a statement that went viral
boren told the students from sae ( sae ) he had a message for them : " you are disgraceful
you have violated all that we stand for
you should not have the privilege of calling yourselves sooners " ( the university of oklahoma nickname )
boren went on to sever all ties between university of oklahoma and sae
the national fraternity closed the local chapter
later , boren said he 'd be glad if the students in the video left campus because " we do n't provide student services for bigots
" the next day he expelled two of them
his actions have resonated across the country
on social media , people shocked by the video find themselves also stunned by boren 's response
why ? because he did something rare in public life today
he expressed a decisive , judgmental view with moral clarity
his statements have been free of mushy lawyer - talk or euphemism
he 's led authentically , from the heart
of course , people have carped
some question whether boren has the legal authority , as head of a public institution , to expel students on the basis of their free speech , even racist hate speech
some lament that what he should have branded as disgraceful was the students ' actions , not the students themselves
the first amendment question , certainly , is being debated by legal scholars
but these concerns are eclipsed by the bigger picture
boren was n't just condemning wrongdoers ; he was shifting social norms for all
a cynic might consider laughable a refrain from boren 's statement about " real sooners
" boren said that real sooners are not racists or bigots ; they believe in equal opportunity , treat people with mutual respect and love each other like family
a cynic might say oklahoma is a state both very white and very red , not known for flying the banner of anti-racism
indeed , the original sooners were the white settlers who raced in to claim land that had been wrested from native americans
but the point of boren 's " real sooners " riff is not to describe or sanitize today 's reality ; it is to issue a challenge
it is to bind people to a creed , a standard of being and belief that is easy to assert but hard to achieve
not unlike being a true patriot
so now begins the longer term
here , another opportunity arises to lead by example
boren can now examine the institution he works for and ask how and why such attitudes and behaviors -- racism so casually vicious -- could ever take root among people as young as freshmen
he can explore the ways in which everyone -- not only the obviously guilty parties at a frat party -- is touched by unconscious bias and institutional racism
he can now ask his community to face the inequities of history and race
we can all do that
howard schultz , ceo of starbucks , is doing this at his company
he was moved after the incidents of ferguson and staten island to hold truly open forums with employees about the pain and anguish of racial division
but you do n't have to be a college president or a ceo
you do n't have to be a white man in charge to start a tough reckoning with racism ( though it 'd help if more did )
whoever you are , you can start a new kind of conversation in your neighborhood
at your house of worship
ask what the history is
ask why there are such imbalances of power and voice
ask what it would take to be truly inclusive
then , in word and deed , start answering your own questions
we can all do that
the sooner , the better .
