manchester united have not told monaco they wo n't be taking up the Â£ 43million option to make falcao 's move to old trafford permanent
reports in france on wednesday claimed manchester united officials had been in touch with their counterparts in the principality to inform them that there would be no move for the misfiring colombian at the end of the season
but a source at old trafford told sportsmail that no decision has yet been made on falcao and added that none would be forthcoming until may
manchester united will delay making a decision over falcao 's future until the end of the season falcao has just over three months to convince louis van gaal that he is worthy of a Â£ 43m transfer fee the 29 - year - old , once one of the most feared strikers in the game , has struggled for form at manchester united since he made the switch from monaco in the summer
he suffered a serious cruciate ligament injury last january that saw him miss the world cup and some have questioned whether he can return to the same level
falcao penned a season - long deal with manchester united but has scored just four goals in 20 appearances - a record that would appear to scupper any chances of his agreement being made permanent
however , an injury to robin van persie means falcao is likely to get more chances to show manager louis van gaal why he should keep him at the end of the season
the colombia international has scored four premier league goals since joining from monaco falcao is expected to benefit from an injury to manchester united team - mate robin van persie
