map showing awaji island in japan where police arrested a man suspected of stabbing five people to death the phenomenon of so - called ' hikikomori ' -- literally ' the withdrawn ' -- rears its head fairly frequently in japan
often it applies to maladjusted people in their teens or early 20s who shut themselves away for years in their parents ' homes , many living in darkened bedrooms with little or no human contact
while many eventually emerge , others continue well into adulthood , protected from the pressures of life by their ageing parents
violent crime is relatively rare in japan and even more so in most small towns
sumoto , a city of 44,000 people on awaji island , is known for its oranges , onions and awaji beef
japan television stations showed the victims ' homes surrounded by agricultural fields
' normally , we get one call a day , if that , ' mr okumoto said
' and usually it 's about a bike theft or someone getting beaten up
