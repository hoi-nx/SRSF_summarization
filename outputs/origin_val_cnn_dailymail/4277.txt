zinedine has been in charge of real madrid 's castilla side since deciding to focus on his own managerial career following his season - long stint as carlo ancelotti 's assistant
carlo ancelotti has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks following real madrid 's recent poor run of form , which has seen them lose three of their last four games
zinedine has revealed he would find it hard to reject the opportunity of managing real madrid zinedine worked under carlo ancelotti during the course of last season before becoming castilla boss and zinedine , speaking to canal + , has admitted he would be keen on replacing carlo ancelotti if the italian was to leave the la liga giants
' if the post of real madrid 's coach was proposed to me , i would certainly agree
but there is a coach right now who is doing a very good job
and i 'm in a structure and still learning
' am i ready for the job ? you are never ready , and even if you 're not you still say yes
as a player , i did n't forge my career in two years
in coaching , it will be the same
' l 've learned a lot from carlo ancelotti and he knows what i think of him
he is the perfect coach for real madrid , despite what people say
' zinedine has learned a lot from both mourinho and carlo ancelotti since hanging up his boots in 2006 zinedine insists he is ready to tackle club management after learning a lot from both carlo ancelotti and former real madrid boss mourinho
he added : ' from mourinho , what i learned is that he never gives up
his handling is surprising , but he is right because he is harsh , yet fair
after a while it can be heavy , but he is fair and does everything for his players
' for carlo ancelotti , it 's different
he is a ' cool dad ' with his players , he 's more patient
but he also knows that sometimes you need to be harsh
