world cup winners germany will be at their best when they take on euro 2016 qualifying rivals poland , scotland and ireland after their current period of experimentation , insists joachim low
the germans drew 2 - 2 in a friendly against asian champions australia on wednesday before a 2 - 0 victory at georgia in a euro qualifier on sunday
while easing past the georgia to stay on track for qualification , germany missed a string of chances again as they struggled with their finishing
joachim low 's side have failed to replicate the form previously shown at the 2014 world cup in brazil germany playmaker mario gotze ( right ) wastes a golden chance against georgia by shooting wide low , who has extended his contract recently to 2018 , has said he wants to tinker with his team that won the world cup last year to make it more flexible and adaptable to different opponents
a three - man defence and more attacking full backs have been two of his experiments , with the coach also trying to find a good mix of youth and experience after the departure of three key players following the world cup and the return of several long - term absentees , including reus , ilkay guendogan and holger badstuber
he has also announced more young players will be in his squad from september onwards
' we now have a test in the summer against the united states and there i can still try some things out , ' joachim low said of their june 10 friendly before they face gibraltar in a qualifier three days later
' after that our forces will then be very focused for our games in september , october and november
' reus ( right ) fires home to give germany the lead in their euro 2016 qualifying match with georgia germany , who have 10 points along with scotland while poland top group d with 11 , host the poles and travel to scotland on september 4 and 7 respectively , they take on ireland , who are on eight points , on october 8
' experience shows that at that time we are always in much better form because we have the chance to be longer together as a group , to play matches and train , ' joachim low said
' in the second half of the year we are always better
' while germany are expected to qualify for the tournament in france , joachim low is delighted to have reus back and in goalscoring form following a string of injuries last year , with the speedy winger on target in both games
' he had a lot of bad luck in the past months and used a lot of strength and energy to come back
our game is more versatile when he is playing and also much more dangerous
