ownership of the 180,000 carat bahia emerald has come down to two parties : an idaho businessman who says he was once swindled into buying a stake in the gem and the government of brazil , where the stone was first unearthed before embarking on 10 years of international intrigue
on one side is kit morrison , a mormon investor who says he and two associates have successfully beaten back half a dozen rogues and thieves to gain legal ownership of the 840 - pound rock
on the other stands the nation of brazil , whose lawyers contend the cartoonishly large green jewel should be repatriated after it was illegally mined and shipped out of the country in 2001
legendary gem : the bahia emerald , one of the world 's largest , has wound up in the custody of the dept after over a decade of changing hands and being shipped , stolen and fought over in court crystals the size of a man 's arm protrude from the 840 - pound stone and make the bahia one of the largest emeralds ever unearthed ' we 've beaten six people , ' kit morrison told cbs news
' we 've either settled with them or beaten them in court to show that we are the bonafide purchaser of this emerald
we are the last man standing , if you will
' kit morrison says he received it as collateral from gem dealer biegler for a shipment of diamonds for which he paid $ 1.3 million but never received
biegler in 2008 claimed to kit morrison -- who was still awaiting his diamonds -- that he 'd been kidnapped by the brazil mafia , according to bloomberg
biegler had tried to pacify kit morrison with two buckets of low quality emeralds he sold for just $ 20,000 and kit morrison realized he was unlikely to ever receive his diamonds
so , he convinced kit morrison 's cohort jerry ferrera to help him get even with biegler by taking possession of the bahia emerald
when biegler found the gem missing from his california vault , he called police
the massive stone , which was pulled from a mine in the jungles of brazil 's bahia state and is known as the bahia emerald , is not going to win any beauty contests
according to those who have seen it , it is a hulking brute of a gem , with several thick green rods the size of a man 's forearms jutting out of a stone base
however , part of its allure -- indeed , part of what led to a valuations of nearly $ 400 million -- is in its convoluted history
the bahia , one of the world 's largest emeralds , has had a long journey since silicon valley entrepreneur thomas had himself photographed with it in a carport in brazil in 2001
the la sheriff 's dept came to possess the internationally known stone after at least eight gem dealers , investors and thieves had one - by - one come to own -- or believe they owned -- all 180,000 carats of it legend has it , the emerald was originally ' carried out of the rain forest by a team of pack mules
along the way the mules were attacked and killed by a pair of black panthers and had to be carried by a team of men and a hand made stretcher the rest of the trip , ' according to thebahiaemerald.com the emerald came into the u.s. in early 2005 and was kept in san jose , california , for a time before being taken to new orleans , according to a lawyer for the remaining group of claimants , including kit morrison
it was said to have been stored at a warehouse in new orleans that was flooded with 16 - feet of water during hurricane katrina then stolen from another warehouse in the los angeles suburb of el monte
it was sighted briefly in idaho before authorities finally seized it in las vegas in 2008
the los angeles county sheriff 's department is safeguarding it until the ownership dispute is resolved
kryptonite for investors : the rock at one point was used as ill - fated collateral for business investment and a diamond purchase but now sits in legal limbo after slipping through the fingers of so many during his trial that began in september 2010 and was delayed several times , thomas testified that he paid $ 60,000 to the brazil miners who dug it up
he said he had previously paid $ 20,000 for four smaller brazil stones , including a 50lbs emerald that he still owns
unlike that gem , the bahia was too big to carry onto an airplane , so mr thomas said he returned home to morgan hill and wired the money to the brazil
months later , he said , they told him the shipper had lost it
in his ruling , the judge noted mr thomas never insured the valuable stone or contacted the shipper to try to recover it
judge kronstadt also cast doubt on mr thomas ' explanation that someone burned down his house to destroy his bill of sale
in a subsequent 2014 court ruling , gem trader downie was also eliminated from consideration by los angeles county superior court judge michael johnson
the judge found downie 's claim was not credible
most gem - quality emeralds are mined in colombia , not brazil , where they tend to have more impurities
however , the lore surrounding the bahia makes it a valuable collector 's item los angeles cops then got involved and tracked the emerald down to las vegas , where kit morrison and ferrara had planned to sell it
the gem has remained in an undisclosed los angeles facility ever since -- through years of legal wrangling between eight different parties who claimed ownership at one point or another
but just as kit morrison and company neared the end of the battle , brazil authorities threw their hat in the ring
in september 2014 , brazil petitioned to make all claims of ownership over the emerald void , claiming the rock was taken out of the country illegally
' the simple fact of the matter is when it was mined out of brazil and illegally exported , it should not have been , ' the country 's los angeles - based attorney nadolenco told fox news
' it belongs to the country of brazil
it needs to be returned regardless of what happened subsequent to it leaving the country
' brazil asked the los angeles judge to dismiss kit morrison 's case on monday , which the judge refused and instead allowed the country to put forward its own formal claim of ownership as eight parties have done before
kit morrison 's attorney treated the decision as a victory
' i 'm happy for my client , ' kit morrison 's attorney andrew spielberger told the la times
' now they 'll have to wait until a judgment
' brazil sees it as a slap in the face
' the emerald was never theirs to buy , trade , sell , or invest in , ' nadolenco said
' the second it came out of the ground , it belonged to brazil and it still does
' not so clear : now at an undisclosed location , the bahia may go to one of two or three parties , including the nation of brazil , which wishes to repatriate the emerald
