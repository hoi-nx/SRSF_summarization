in an obituary written by anjem choudary , he recalls an occasion when ali operated on him in the back of a central london cafÃ©

' ehsanullah ehsan , spokesman for the taliban group which ali had joined , vowed to avenge his death which he attributed to isi and its western allies
during his time in pakistan , ali also edited an online english - language jihadist magazine , called ' ihya-e-khilafat ' ( revival of the islamic caliphate ) aimed at recruiting muslim youths from the west
the extremist magazine which he helps to edit publishes contact details for potential jihadi youths and advises them not to use home computers which might be tracked by intelligence agencies
