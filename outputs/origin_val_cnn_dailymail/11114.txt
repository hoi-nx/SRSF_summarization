rather than burning her bra , an entrepreneur fed up with ' sexualised ' underwear in stores was inspired to design her own range that suited her feminist ideals
hayat rachi used her life 's savings to found uk lingerie brand neon moon to provide stylish underwear for women of all shapes and sizes
the first collection , called mon dieu offers simple , sporty - looking sets which are free from cleavage - boosting padding or wiring
designer hayat rachi raised money on a fundraising website to start her own feminist lingerie line ( modelled here by two real women ) in her images , hayat rachi was determined to use real women , posing naturally and not catering to the male gaze the lingerie - which comes in chartreuse , orange and black - is made from sustainable bamboo fabric rather than lace and satin because it moulds to the wearer âs body , and has antibacterial properties
on her fundraising kickstarter page hayat rachi wrote : â not everything is about being sexy or being objectified for the male gaze
' explaining why she felt driven to design the line , she said : â i found it difficult to find a lingerie brand that shared the same ethos as myself : empowerment , body confidence and the non-objectification of women
â â so instead of succumbing to the body - shaming , sexualised and objectifying lingerie on the market , i used my frustration to start my own brand , neon moon , with the support of the prince âs trust
â after being accepted on to the charity 's year - long enterprise program , hayat rachi received mentorship and professional advice for free to develop her product
in the brand 's promotional imagery , the two models certainly seem empowered lounging around the house in neon moon underwear
the underwear sets are n't underwired or padded and are made with anti-bacterial , soft bamboo fibre the women look smiling and healthy and sport natural bodies , rather than catwalk models ' ultra-slimline shape
hayat rachi named each of the underwear styles with ' francophile sounding words , calling them : coucou , bof , tac-tac and non !
she said : ' they are really vibrant and fun words to pronounce , which works well with the vibrant colours of the bras and knickers
' the entrepreneur launched a kickstarter campaign for neon moon , which ends on 10 april , and has already exceeded the original Â£ 5,000 target , with 165 backers
hayat rachi explains the brand 's story in the accompanying video with lingering detail shots panning over her creations , a behind - the - scenes look at the promotional shoot , and girls pledging their support to her campaign
she said : â i am absolutely elated with the result
i genuinely could nât fathom reaching the Â£ 5,000 goal with 18 days left ! â hayat rachi wanted to design lingerie that was n't about objectifying women â i have been so blessed by the support received from women , men , transgender and non-binary people âs generosity ! â â the amount of press created , and also zooey deschanel sharing an article on neon moon on her facebook ( to close to six million followers ) added to such a viral buzz about neon moon âs kickstarter
â all extra money funded beyond Â£ 5,000 will go into producing more lingerie for the â mon dieu â collection in order to sell directly online
' she added that there 's a deeper significance to raising money so quickly for her concept
â [ it ] just goes to show that people do not agree with the sexualisation and objectification of girls within the lingerie industry
' neon moon is ' revolutionising ' the underwear world by being ' a body - positive , feminist lingerie brand , â she added
