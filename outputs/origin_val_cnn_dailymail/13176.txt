outside of israeli politics , isaac herzog is not a well - known name
that may change on march 17 , when israeli head to the polls for election day
in the final round of polling before the elections , isaac herzog 's zionist union party is in the lead , holding a four - seat edge over prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's likud party
" i believe in a certain type of leadership that is not always customary in this region
i 'm not a general
i do n't give orders
i know how to work together , " he says
throughout the campaign , isaac herzog has been seen as an underdog , lacking the charisma and the english fluency of benjamin netanyahu
isaac herzog says that does n't bother him at all
" i have always suffered from a certain underestimation , " isaac herzog said , " and i have always surprised
" he promised , " i will surprise again , and i will show my leadership and stamina
" isaac herzog began his political career in 2003 , when he first won a seat in the knesset with the labor party
he held a variety of ministerial positions , including minister of housing and construction , minister of tourism , and minister of welfare and social services , before becoming leader of the labor party in 2013
in those elections , he also became the leader of the opposition , as benjamin netanyahu won another term as prime minister
but when benjamin netanyahu called for early elections in 2014 , isaac herzog pegged his bid for the premiership on social reform
" what i run for is social justice
i will change the nature of the division of wealth in a fair and more balanced way , close inequality and give a sense of purpose to the people here in the workplace , in the housing , and in the cost of living , " promised isaac herzog
before the election , the issue of a nuclear iran garnered international headlines as it further aggravated tense relations between the white house and benjamin netanyahu

he echoed that sentiment in an interview with cnn 's elise labott
" a nuclear - armed iran is dangerous to world peace , is dangerous to our region , is dangerous to israeli
as leader of israeli , i will never accept a nuclear - armed iran
and all options are on the table
