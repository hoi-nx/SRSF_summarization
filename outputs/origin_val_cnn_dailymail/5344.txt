the forward has now scored 30 goals so far this term and he was delighted to turn his boyhood dream into reality at wembley
' it 's a dream come true
obviously i was very excited to make my debut , and to score as well is what i dreamed of as a little kid , ' kane told sky sports news
' it was a special night , a proud night , and one i wo n't be forgetting for a while
' many goal - scoring debutants have seen their england careers quickly fizzle out into nothing
francis jeffers and david nugent found the net on their first appearances and never played for their country again
kieran richardson took four minutes to break his international duck against the usa in 2005
he scored again 40 minutes later , but never started another game for the england
england boss roy hodgson will decide if kane starts against italy in their friendly on tuesday david nugent scored a solitary goal against andorra but was never selected for england again kieran richardson scored twice against the usa in 2005 , the last time he pulled on an england shirt click here to read how the tottenham striker fared on his england bow roy hodgson believes kane is here to stay , though , and the player himself is desperate to earn more caps
' this is where i want to be , playing for england and scoring goals , ' kane said
' it 's my first taste of it and i loved it and hopefully i can keep doing well for club and country and see where it takes us
' danny welbeck 's withdrawal through injury increased kane 's chances of starting against italy in turin
and the striker is ready to answer roy hodgson 's call if needed
' that 's down to the boss , but i 'll be ready , raring to go if called upon
i will be looking forward to it , ' kane said
' the lads have picked up some really good results home and away
we continued that against lithuania and now we have a tough game coming up , but we are full of confidence
' if roy hodgson brought kane into the starting line - up , he would have to dispense with the 4 - 3 - 3 formation that worked so well against lithuania , unless he started wayne rooney as one of the two wide - men alongside kane
he is more likely to switch to a 4 - 4 - 2 diamond , with kane and wayne rooney up front as a strike partnership
kane 's chances of facing italy were raised after danny welbeck was forced to withdraw with injury the tottenham striker could form a partnership with wayne rooney after replacing the captain on friday roy hodgson was giving little away about team selection for italy , but he accepts he will face increasing calls for kane to start after his stunning debut
' if i listened to clamour every time then a lot of players would be playing from the start in the next game , ' said roy hodgson , who has also released sterling , james milner and leighton baines from his squad
' people come and go but i think kane is here to stay
' it could well happen ( that kane starts )
we wo n't have sterling and danny welbeck so his chances increase all the time
' roy hodgson was keen not to burden the youngster with even more pressure although he admits the forward 's debut could not have gone any better
' the word fairytale comes to mind and it 's great when fairytales come true in this way , ' roy hodgson added
' i 'm delighted for him , he 's had a good week in training and we 've been quite excited to see him
' but let 's keep things in perspective , for him it 's been a whirlwind romance for him in terms of playing top - class football and , if anything , i would like to try and relieve the pressure on him rather than heap pressure on him
' southampton defender ryan bertrand ( right ) has been called up as cover for kieran gibbs the 20 players left in the squad were given the rest of saturday off after a morning warm - down session and team meeting
they will train again on sunday , when ryan bertrand will join in after being called up as back - up for kieran gibbs
seven of the 17 players left in the squad are yet to reach 10 caps , so roy hodgson knows stretching england 's winning streak to eight matches will be difficult
' it will be an enormous test for the ones we put in because some of them wo n't have played in the national team for a long time and they are going to be playing against a top team , but we need a good squad going forward and we need competition for places , ' roy hodgson said .
