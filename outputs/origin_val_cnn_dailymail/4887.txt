sturgeon said snp is open to an arrangement with labour party and suggested labour party 's backbenchers would support some snp policies miliband will be ' held hostage ' in downing street by the snp , it was claimed today as sturgeon said there was no way labour party could win without her
a dramatic collapse in support for labour party in scottish is expected to rob mr miliband of an overall majority , forcing him to rely on the snp to form a government
ms sturgeon teased the labour party leader today , claiming he is still ' clinging to the pretence ' that he has a chance of winning a majority on may 7 , insisting she will wield ' clout ' in westminster
ms sturgeon said her party was open to an arrangement with labour party after the election
the scottish first minister hinted that many of labour party 's mps would support certain snp policies such as bringing an end to austerity and scrapping trident
after weeks of pressure , mr miliband has ruled out a formal coalition with the snp but he could be forced to do a deal to stop them voting down his government
ms sturgeon told bbc radio 4 's today programme : ' he is still clinging to the pretence he has got some chance of winning an overall majority
' we have got vast experience as a minority government ... the principles are the same
you have to build alliances , you have to win votes on a case - by - case basis
' it would be far better than what usually happens to scottish at westminster , which is we are ignored or sidelined
' the bottom line here is , if scottish wants to have that influence , that power , that clout in westminster , the only way get it is to vote snp
' if there is real snp strength in the house of commons we can force progressive change
' she also repeated the threat from former first minister alex salmond to lock the tories out of government , even if david cameron wins the most seats
brushing aside claims it was arrogant , ms sturgeon replied : ' if the tories ca n't command a majority , then they do n't deserve to be in government
' labour leader miliband used the launch of his election campaign at the olympic park in east london today to claim : ' there is one way to get the tories out and that 's to elect a labour party government ' senior conservative william hague condemned the remarks as proof that mr miliband would be propeped up by a party which wanted to break up the union
he said : ' now you have it straight from sturgeon â it is the snp 's sworn intention to hold miliband hostage in downing street and dictate terms on how britain is governed
' and we know too what 's in the ransom note : Â£ 148 billion more wasteful borrowing , higher taxes on ordinary families , weaker defences and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay
labour campaign chief douglas alexander ( pictured ) said ms sturgeon has an ' anyone but labour party ' strategy and is committed to independence ' we can not let this happen to our country
the only way to keep miliband and the snp out of downing street is to vote conservative on 7 may
' mr miliband sought to play down the prospect of an snp deal , tell activists at his election campaign launch : ' there is one way to get the tories out and that 's to elect a labour party government
' labour party campaign chief douglas alexander told bbc news channel : ' the agenda of the snp is very obvious - they want to drive down the vote of labour party in scottish and they want to drive up the conservative vote
' why ? because ( ms sturgeon ) remains committed to independence
she judges the most propitious circumstances to be of a conservative government here in westminster after the election in may , and after that to try to secure support in the 2016 election in scottish for a second referendum
' later ms sturgeon told bbc news : ' in that post-election scenario , if the snp wins the trust of people in scottish and is there in numbers , then we 've said very clearly there are no circumstances in which we would support a conservative government
' we would be open to a working arrangement with labour party - not a formal coalition , i 've always said that 's highly unlikely
' that could be an arrangement that 's akin to confidence and supply
' if we were to have an arrangement on that basis , we 've been very clear we would want an alternative to austerity - modest spending increases that still see debt and deficit reduce as a share of income , but nevertheless allow us to invest in things like innovation and infrastructure and protecting the vulnerable
' she said that a fresh independence referendum would not be the price for a post-election deal : ' voting snp in the general election does n't lead to another independence referendum
' if there is to be another independence referendum - and i hope that one day there will be - that will only happen if people elect a scottish government in a scottish parliament election that has that in the manifesto and has the ability in the scottish parliament to pass that legislation
