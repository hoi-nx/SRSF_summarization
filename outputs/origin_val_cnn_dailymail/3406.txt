the tomb of iraqi 's late dictator hussein has been destroyed in heavy clashes between militants from the islamic state group and iraqi forces in a fight for control of the city of tikrit
fighting intensified to the north and south of hussein 's hometown yesterday as iraqi security forces vowed to reach the centre of tikrit within 48 hours
video from the village of ouja , just south of tikrit , shows all that remains of hussein 's once - lavish tomb are the support columns that held up the roof
poster - sized pictures of hussein , which once adorned the mausoleum , are now nowhere to be seen amid the piles of rubble
' this is one of the areas where is militants massed the most because hussein 's grave is here , ' said captain yasser nu'ma , an official with the shia militias , formerly known as the popular mobilization forces
the is militants , he added , set an ambush by planting bombs around the tomb
isis has controlled tikrit since june , when it waged its lightning offensive that also saw iraqi 's second - largest city , mosul , come under their control
the terror group was helped in its conquest of northern iraqi by hussein loyalists , including military veterans , who appealed to sunni who felt victimized by baghdad 's newly shia - dominated government
isis claimed in august that hussein 's tomb had been completely destroyed , but local officials said that although it was ransacked and burnt , the building suffered only minor damage

his body has been kept in the mausoleum in his birthplace , ouja , since 2007
the complex featured a marble octagon at the centre of which a bed of fresh flowers covered the place where his body was buried
the extravagant chandelier at its centre was reminiscent of the extravagant life he led until u.s. forces toppled him in 2003
iraqi media reported last year that the dictator 's body was removed by loyalists amid fears that it would be disturbed in the fighting
its current location is not known

concerns are mounting that iraqi 's shia militias , of which an estimated 20,000 are fighting in tikrit , will carry out revenge attacks on this and other areas that are home to predominantly sunni residents
amnesty international last year said the militias wear military uniforms but operate outside any legal framework and without any official oversight , adding that they are not prosecuted for their crimes
earlier this month , human rights watch echoed those concerns , calling on the iraqi government to protect civilians in tikrit and allow them to flee combat zones
its statement noted ' numerous atrocities ' against sunni civilians by pro-government militias and security forces
shiite militants are increasingly being accused of levelling the sunni towns they capture from the islamic state group , making it impossible for residents to return
tikrit has already been heavily damaged in months of violence

local sunni tribal fighters have formed uneasy alliances with the iraqi army and shia militias in the battle for tikrit , which iraqi and u.s. officials believe is essential for defeating the sunni militant group
yazan al-jubouri , a sunni from tikrit fighting alongside the shia militias , said that the islamic state militants killed 16 of his relatives and kept his family living in horror
' we want to take revenge on those is militants who killed our children , ' he said .
