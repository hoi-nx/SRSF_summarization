for the uninitiated , skydiving can be scary enough : leaping out of a plane , free - falling at 120 miles per hour , keeping your presence of mind as you pull the cord on your parachute
now imagine having a seizure and losing consciousness more than 9,000 feet above the earth
that 's what happened to jones , 22 , of perth , australia
his experience was captured on a video that has more than 4.4 million views on youtube
" halfway through the skydive , he had a seizure and rolled onto his back , " wa skydiving academy business manager and chief instructor o'neill told the abc
instructor mcfarlane , who was wearing a helmet camera , struggled to catch up with jones
mcfarlane finally managed to grab jones at about 4,000 feet and pull the rip cord
jones regained consciousness and landed uneventfully , o'neill said
mcfarlane told the abc he was n't concerned
thanks to two " aads " -- automatic activation devices -- jones ' parachute was going to automatically deploy , he said
nevertheless , the instructor wanted to make sure the situation was completely under control
" at no time was i worried he was going to hit the ground without a parachute , but given the circumstances and where we were i thought it would be better to get him under parachute earlier than later , " mcfarlane said
" i managed to catch him on my second attempt and deploy his parachute
" jones , who described the incident on youtube as " possibly the scariest moment of my life , " told the abc that skydiving was a substitute for his dream of becoming a pilot
he had been cleared by his doctor to jump
" i 've always wanted to have the feeling of flight , so i just thought , considering i ca n't fly a plane due to my condition , i thought i 'd give it a go , " he said
jones told the abc that he 'd been seizure - free for four years but was not intending to pursue a skydiving career .
