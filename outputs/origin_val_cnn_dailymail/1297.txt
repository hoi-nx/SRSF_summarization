speaking to a local tv channel near the frontline , kirkuk governor najmaldin karim said the purpose of the offensive was to secure the city , which the kurds have held since last summer
peshmerga fighters began shelling islamic state positions at dawn before advancing along a 20 - mile front southwest of the city , seizing several villages and gaining around three miles in places
monday 's gains bring the peshmerga closer to the isis stronghold of hawijah , where black - clad militants have paraded the bodies of what they said were 20 shi'ite militiamen they had executed
speaking by telephone from the frontline near tel ward , major - general omar saleh hassan said : ' this morning we launched an attack on three axes
' he said his forces faced little resistance from islamic state militants who are also fighting to hold the city of tikrit around 110 km southwest of kirkuk , as iraqi forces close in
just north of tikrit , home city of executed sunni arabs former president saddam hussein , iraqi security forces and shi'ite militia fighters began an offensive to regain control over the town of al-alam
military commanders said some of the attacking force were ferried across from the west bank of the tigris river , while others were approaching from other directions
' we have confirmed information from inside al-alam that a few daesh ( isis ) fighters are still inside , mostly suiciders
' this is why we attacked them from multiple directions in order not to give them time to catch their breath , ' al-alam mayor jubouri said , referring to the fighters by their arabic acronym
jubouri , who has spent time with the attacking forces outside al-alam , said clashes were continuing in the south , west and north of the town
in the kirkuk offensive , elite kurds counter-terrorism units were taking part and one official said they had managed to detonate four vehicles rigged with explosives by firing on them from a distance
but the city has remained vulnerable , with the frontline no more than 20 kilometres away in some places and only an irrigation canal separating the two sides
