a onetime producer of the reality show ' survivor ' was convicted in mexico thursday of murdering his wife during a 2010 cancun beach vacation
beresford-redman , 43 , was found guilty and then sentenced to 12 years in prison by judge vã­ctor manuel echeverria tun , quintana roo state prosecutor gaspar armando garcia torres said
juanita beresford-redman , beresford-redman 's mother , said her son was also ordered to pay a fine of 43,000 pesos , which is equivalent to $ 2,800
the former producer was on vacation in cancun with his wife , monica , and their two children in 2010 when her body was found dumped in a sewer cistern at the resort where they were staying
the family of burgos issued a statement through their lawyer , triessl , late thursday
' it has been nearly 5 years since they lost their beloved sister , ' triessl said
' not a day goes by that they do n't miss her terribly and nothing will bring her back , but they can finally say that she has received the justice she deserved
' ' we are appalled and disgusted with this gross miscarriage of justice
over an exhausting three and a half year period this trial has done nothing but prove beresford-redman âs innocence beyond any doubt
whatever lies behind this ruling it is based on neither facts nor evidence
this is a disservice to monica âs memory ; this is not the justice she and beresford-redman still deserve and that we continue to demand
at some point , even in mexico , beresford-redman âs innocence will lead to his freedom
we will immediately appeal this absurd decision and will not rest until beresford-redman is exonerated and returned home
this decision must lead to a reconsideration of the extradition treaty between the us and mexico as it is clear that mexico can not meet even minimal standards of justice
we remain ever grateful to all those who continue to support beresford-redman
' beresford - monica 's family also released a statement in response to the outcome of the trial , strongly condemning what they described as a ' gross miscarriage of justice
' ' this is a disservice to monica âs memory ; this is not the justice she and beresford-redman still deserve and that we continue to demand , ' read the statement posted on a facebook page dedicated to beresford-redman 's case
the family plan to appeal the guilty verdict as soon as possible
beresford-redman maintained his innocence , but in 2011 a us court upheld his extradition
in 2012 , state department officials signed a warrant clearing his extradition to mexico
and shortly after arriving in mexico , a judge ordered the emmy - nominated producer to stand trial on a murder charge
part of the evidence in the case included statements from guests at the high - end moon palace resort resort who said they heard loud arguing and cries of distress coming from the couple 's room on the night the 42 - year - old victim went missing
the producer 's lawyers maintained the noises came from beresford-redman and his children playing loud games throughout the night and argued there was not any forensic evidence that he killed his wife
beresford-redman had been ordered to stay in mexico when his wife 's body was found , but he returned to los angeles , where he surrendered to authorities after an arrest warrant was issued in mexico
mexico authorities said beresford-redman murdered his wife â by asphyxiating her â in their room mexico authorities said beresford-redman kiledf his wife â by asphyxiating her â in their room at the moon palace resort in cancun on april 5 , 2010
her decomposing body was discovered in a sewer two days later
a coroner noted that she had suffered scratches on the neck and a blow to the right temple
british tourists in the room next door to beresford-redman âs suite reported hearing noises that sounded like a woman in distress , which his attorneys chalked up to loud playtime with his two kids , then ages 3 and six
lawyers also argued that mexico authorities found no blood evidence in the couple 's room and claimed that investigators and prosecutors used the fact that the couple was experiencing marital problems due to an affair by beresford-redman to support the theory that he killed his wife
in a statement to police , beresford-redman admitted arguing with monica at the resort but denied he was ever violent toward her
after police noted scratches on his neck and hands , beresford - monica said that he and his family had taken several outdoor excursions on their vacation and the injuries were a result of climbing over rocks and diving into the water on the trips
shortly after his wife 's death , mexico authorities seized beresford-redman 's passport and ordered him to stay in the country while they investigated
behind bars : beresford-redman maintained his innocence , but in 2011 a us court upheld his extradition unwavering support : beresford - monica 's family released a statement condemning what they described as a ' gross miscarriage of justice ' but he returned to the us and later declared himself innocent
a mexico judge issued a warrant for his arrest and he was extradited in early february 2012
during a jailhouse interview with cbs 's 48 hours mystery taped later that month , beresford - monica once again proclaimed his innocence
â i did n't kill my wife , i really did n't , â he from behind bars
â i ca n't imagine how anyone who listened to everything said could possibly think i had anything to do with killing my wife
â beresford-redman worked on 48 episodes of the competition reality show survivor between february 2002 and may 2004 , while he also helped produce hit mtv car series pimp my ride
â am i a survivor or not ? â mr beresford-redman told cbs
