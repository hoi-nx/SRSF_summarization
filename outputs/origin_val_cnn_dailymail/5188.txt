star wars fans who once flocked to the tunisians town which was luke 's home are now staying away because of the proximity of violent jihadists
the desert cliffs around the town of tataouine were once the backdrop for much of the 1977 classic , parts of which were filmed in the arab state the year before
the struggling town on the fringes of the sahara still draws a few fans of the movie but now finds itself part of a real conflict , as a way - station for jihadists crossing the libya border 60 miles to the east , according to cnn
the igloo home of luke and his foster family was destroyed in the film by stormtroopers from the galactic empire , but should militants extend their reach across the border , it could well be threatened for real
two arms caches , one of which included rocket - propelled grenade launchers and more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition , have also been found in the region this month
they are thought to have been removed from a libya armory in the aftermath of former dictator moammar gadhafi 's ouster in 2011
this area is vast and sparsely populated , with dozens of smugglers ' tracks along which petrol , drugs and other contraband are smuggled across the frontier
there is now a 1.8 - mile no - go zone inside the 380 mile long border , and the military has built fortified positions every couple of miles
the tunisians government claims the security presence has been boosted seven to tenfold

the area is under threat from an isis affiliate group a valley near tataouine.three young men were arrested in the area earlier this month as they allegedly made plans to cross into libya and join an affiliate of islamic state luke 's restored igloo home which was renovated by a group of star wars fans in 2012 a much wider 12 mile buffer zone has also been created , which people can only enter with permission , and men aged 18 - 35 have reportedly been banned from going to libya unless they have residence papers and proof of employment there
even so the two gunmen who stormed into the bardo museum in the capital tunis last week , who were both in their twenties , had been able to cross illicitly into libya in december , according to tunisians state security minister rafik chelly
chelly told a tunisians network the pair had received weapons training in the isis stronghold of derna
japanese , spanish , italian and colombian tourists were among the 20 victims when the gunmen opened fire on their buses as they arrived at the museum , which houses some of the roman artifacts that are one of tunisians 's major draws
tourism minister loumi said the impact from the attack appeared limited so far , with a few cancellations but words of encouragement from travel agency and tour company partners for the north african country 's mostly package - holiday bookings
six million tourists , mostly europeans , hit tunisians 's yellow sand beaches , desert treks and medina souks last year , providing seven percent of its gross domestic product , most of its foreign currency revenues and more jobs than anything but farming

' they wanted to hit us through our economic backbone , ' loumi told reuters
' but they wo n't succeed
' her ministry 's figures show visitor numbers have yet to catch up with the years before the arab spring uprising that toppled zine el-abidine ben ali and ushered in an uncertain period of political transition
now that democracy and political compromise have emerged , the country hopes to revive economic growth and is counting on attractions like its carthage roman ruins and the great mosque of kairouan , part of a unesco heritage site
president beji caid essebsi has ordered the army to protect major cities and more than 20 people have been arrested since the tunis attack
security forces at the scene shot dead two gunmen but another is still on the loose and some of more than 3,000 tunisians to join islamist militant groups in iraq and syria have returned home , raising fears of more attacks
after wednesday 's bardo assault , several tour companies suspended some services to tunis , notably the cruise ship owners who , shaken by the deaths of some of their passengers in the attacks , said they would bypass the city for the time being
an initial study by the finance ministry estimated that losses for the industry may reach $ 700 million , compared with annual revenues from tourism in 2014 of close to $ 2 billion
militants have targeted the tourism industry before
an al qaeda suicide bomber killed 21 people in 2002 in the southern island of djerba
in 2013 , another bomber blew himself up on the beach in sousse
no one else was killed .
