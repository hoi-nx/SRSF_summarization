thoughts of australia 's world cup campaign were in the forefront of clarke 's mind when the captain decided to end his one - day career
clarke has announced that sunday 's trans - tasman world cup decider will be his final one day international
the 33 - year - old reached closure on the decision upon realising there was no chance he 'd still be leading the side in four years
smith is yet to be confirmed as clarke 's successor
clarke suggested it was n't fair to talk about who would takeover , but that it was important they had four years to mould the one day international side
' i was very fortunate four years ago to get the opportunity to captain this one - day team and that was really good preparation for this world cup , ' clarke said
' the next aussie captain deserves the same opportunity
' it really helped me having that preparation ... to build my own team and set my own style up as a captain

' i told my teammates 10 minutes ago
i told the selectors and ( cricket australia boss ) sutherland about an hour ago
' there 's no doubt i could keep playing ( one day international cricket ) for the next couple of years
. but i know i 've made the right decision

' i 'm hopeful it will prolong my test career and that 's a priority for me , ' he said
' i do n't feel bad about saying i feel that test cricket is the toughest part of our game
' i see it as the pinnacle ... i feel like i 've still got a lot to offer the aussie test team as captain
' sutherland was full of praise for clarke , adding that his decision came as ' something of a surprise '

' regardless of the result , he will leave the one - day international game as one our greats
