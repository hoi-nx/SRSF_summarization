source : nhs choices ' i 've been on nights out before and collapsed from laughing when i 'm having a good time and people will rush over thinking i 'm paralytic and need help
' it 's really difficult not to laugh sometimes and i 've had to learn to try and control my emotions
' miss jodie kelly can have over 10 episodes a day , but over time she has learnt to control her fall
she said : ' i used to worry that one time i 'd fall and really hurt myself , but now i can sense when it 's going to happen
' the first time i noticed symptoms was when i 'd gone to see harry potter and the half-blood prince
' i ca n't remember what made me laugh but thankfully i was sitting down
' i felt a strange sensation in me neck , it became so weak it just flopped forward and i struggled to support it
' i did n't understand what was happening and i was too scared to tell my parents for a while
' while realising she no longer had control over her laughter , miss jodie kelly also became aware of her increasing tiredness
gradually she began to find herself falling asleep in the most unusual places
she said : ' i knew something was n't right as i was so young but i had no energy whatsoever some days
' instead of getting home and doing my homework like all the other kids , i would just fall straight to sleep on the sofa
' i kept going to my gp but tests revealed nothing and i was told i was just going through normal teenage stuff
the teenager has had to ban herself from watching her favourite comedy tv shows , for fears her giggles or sadness will make her fall over
she is pictured here with her parents ' on one visit to new york with my family i had to lie down next to a tree on the pavement as i was too exhausted to move
' thankfully one day i came across an article in a magazine about a girl who was suffering from both narcolepsy and cataplexy and i knew instantly that 's what i had
' luckily my auntie 's neighbour is a sleep scientist and she confirmed what i thought , because i was showing all the right symptoms
' i then went to see a sleep specialist and my diagnosis was established
' at the age of 12 , miss jodie kelly was struck down with a throat infection which experts think triggered her narcolepsy
this is a long term condition causing changes in sleep patterns , and excessive daytime sleepiness is one of the first signs
most people who have narcolepsy also suffer cataplexy
miss jodie kelly said she has learned to live with both conditions
she said : ' i need to sleep a lot more than most people and rest more
' what should be a ten minute walk can take me 40 minutes as i 'll need to sit down and take breaks
' even in my exams recently i had special circumstances where i could lie down on a mat if i needed a break
miss jodie kelly , pictured when she was younger with her aunt trish , said her friends and family have all been ' fantastic ' and have helped her cope with her conditions ' one of the perks is that when i dream they 're really vivid and it 's amazing
' but this comes with a price as when i have nightmares , they 're horrendous and so life - like
' i 've even woke up from one screaming before , but no sound came out and my whole body was paralysed
' i lay there for what seemed forever unable to move , until eventually i could finally sit up
' sleep paralysis is another side effect and it can be quite scary at times
' miss jodie kelly can sleep up to 15 hours a day and needs a daily nap without fail
she said : ' the more tired i am , the worse my cataplexy is so it 's important to sleep when i need to
' suffering from both has been tough growing up as i ca n't just be like most other teenagers
' i try to stay positive but sometimes both conditions can get me down
' thankfully i have incredible friends and family who have all been fantastic
' they 've really helped me cope and i feel safer when i 'm out with someone who actually understands and can help if i start to collapse or if i need to sleep
