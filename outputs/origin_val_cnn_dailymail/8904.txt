an epileptic hospital patient was forced to sleep on the floor for four weeks while he was waiting to have a scan on his brain
collins was kept in a receiving ward , normally for short stays of no more than two days , after being admitted to the royal infirmary in nhs greater glasgow
he hit his head during an epileptic seizure , making him prone to violent outbursts - so hospital staff removed his bed from the room and made him sleep on a mattress on the floor
it took three weeks before mr collins , 54 , was given a chair , and though he has now moved to another hospital he is still waiting for an mri scan six weeks after the accident
hospital : collins had to spend four weeks in a room without a bed while waiting for a scan relatives of the former roofer , from nhs greater glasgow , are desperate to find out what is wrong with him , but until he has the scan - which will take around 45 minutes - they are still in the dark
his partner brown , 50 , said : ' we took him to a&e at the royal and he was kept in overnight
' he had another fit the next morning so they kept him in for another few days
but a couple of days later he walked out of the hospital at 3.30am
' he threw all his medication away and walked out dressed only in his slippers , pyjamas and housecoat
' clearly , mentally he was not right
before he banged his head he was fine
he had no mental health issues whatsoever
' precaution : mr collins had to sleep on a mattress on the floor after he behaved violently waiting : he did not even get a chair in the room for his first three weeks in hospital ms brown initially took mr collins to the gp after he hit his head , and was then referred to a&e
' we waited seven hours in casualty , ' she said
' then he was put in a receiving ward
you are supposed to be there for a maximum of two days
' he was supposed to be going to the southern to get an mri scan and a lumbar puncture but they cancelled his appointments three times
' they 're sedating him because of his outburst in the waiting room but he 's not that kind of man
it 's terrible to see him like this
' i know there is something wrong with his brain
if they would just give him the scan we could find out what is the matter with him
' i thought they would at least have given him a bed with cot sides so he could n't get out or do himself an injury
a&e : mr collins spent four weeks at the glasgow royal infirmary , pictured , before moving to another hospital ' when he went in at first he was quite violent , throwing things about , so they took everything out of his room
' he keeps going back to when he was a boy and still thinks his mum and dad are alive
' ms brown praised the way doctors and nurses looked after mr collins before he was moved to the southern general , but criticised the nhs for failing to treat him promptly
a spokesman for nhs greater glasgow and clyde said : ' the patient presented with extremely challenging behaviour and for his own protection and personal safety had to be nursed with only a mattress in his room
' we accept there were delays in transferring him to the southern general
we also accept a delay in providing the appropriate tests which need to be undertaken with specialist clinical input
' these have now been arranged to be undertaken this week
