he 's a top footballer with hamburg , but maxi beister has more than just good ball skills , it seems
the midfielder has turned inventor , designing a combination beaker and bowl to help stop excitable football fans spilling food or drink while they are watching him on the pitch
sportsman biester dreamed up the double act - called the maxicup - three years ago while he was trying to juggle a cup of coke and a bowl of snacks during a trip to the cinema
the 24 - year - old hamburg star added : ' i thought about it for a few minutes and then i decided that 's exactly what i 'll do
i 'll make it myself
' maxi beister 's new maxicup carries a drink in a supersize cup while the attached bowl not only carries the snacks but also seals the top of the cup , too
he explained : ' it means you can carry everything in one hand without spilling anything at all
' the maxicup holds a drink in a supersize cup while the snack bowl on top also acts as a sealant this weekend 4,000 prototype cups were distributed at hamburg 's imtech arena stadium in the northern german city on sunday during their match against mainz
maxi beister said ahead of the handout : ' we 'll be giving away free cups and food so we 'll see just how the fans like them
in my experience , football fans are very vocal and soon let you know if you 've got it wrong
' the soccer star 's new future cup company is planning to trial the maxicup at cinemas as well
maxi beister added : ' i 'm very hopeful
it makes a change from football and i 've got a good feeling about it
