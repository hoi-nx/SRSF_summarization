taxidermy is widely considered a strange hobby and an even stranger profession
but one company has sought to showcase its creativity with a bizarre series of stuffed squirrels in a range of elaborate poses
the pictures show squirrels playing pool , getting to grips with a sniper rifle and even passed out drunk

teeter ' taxidermy studio aims to come up with ' new and interesting ' ideas to challenge themselves with
this has led to increasingly zany designs - some of which are for sale on ebay for as much as $ 600
owner teeters , from halifax , pennsylvania , runs the shop which also deals with traditional taxidermy for local hunters
but he views these works , created for fun , as an art form
he said : ' we 're always bouncing ideas off each other , often late into the night
' we are always trying to think outside the box and create a conversation

' i 've also been very fortunate to have clients that drop their animals off and say surprise us
this let us be more creative in what we give back
' mr teeters is careful not to create works too outlandish for his conservative customers , but still strives for uniqueness
the 39 - year - old said : ' we try not to cross the line with people but we can still give them a piece of art. ' ' we have worked on just about every animal legally taken in north america and africa along with a few other countries

' mr teeters has notched up over 20 years of experience often logging 60 hours weeks
each piece takes about ten hours of hands - on work as well as a few months in the freeze dryer
' the work is always different and there 's nothing like seeing a satisfied customer , ' he added
