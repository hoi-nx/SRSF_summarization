whether i am in charge or coaching â if the club need me i am here
â mcdowall has warned supporters that , even if king and allies paul murray and john gilligan do claim the keys to ibrox , it could still take five years to rebuild the shattered club

that âs why it âs so important whoever comes in that they get it right
