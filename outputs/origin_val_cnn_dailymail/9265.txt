england are the embarrassment of the world cup after a third humiliating defeat in three matches against australia , new zealand and sri lanka
sportsmail 's panel of experts â hussain , lloyd , cricket correspondent newman and cricket writer and wisden editor booth â discuss the big questions arising from another world cup failure
england captain eoin morgan plays a shot during the world cup match against sri lanka in wellington england gary ballance ( front ) loses his wicket to sri lanka 's tillakaratne dilshan during the world cup match is there any hope left for england at this world cup ? hussain : if there is , it 's because of the ridiculous format of this tournament
they should beat bangladesh and afghanistan , but the best we can hope for is some one - off brilliance in the quarter - final
newman : you would think not and yet the flawed format still gives them every chance of facing india , a team they have beaten in their past two meetings , in a quarter - final in melbourne
that should not be possible after the way england have stunk the tournament out
booth : the bare minimum for them was a quarter - final
now , if either bangladesh or afghanistan have a good day , they may not even make that
they 've had four years to prepare , yet look further off the pace than ever
lloyd : realistically , no. it 's sad to see so much effort going into plans and strategy that just do not fit in modern international cricket
i 've never seen a team leave the ball so much in the one - day game
if there 's any width other teams just whack it
root bats for england during their match against sri lanka at wellington regional stadium england have slumped to three straight world cup defeats against australia , new zealand and sri lanka can anything be done in the short - term ? hussain : they need variety in their bowling , and a more attacking no 3
if they get through to a quarter - final on a drop - in wicket against india or south africa , four 85mph right - arm seamers are n't going to surprise anyone
ravi bopara offers something different , and james tredwell is england 's best off - spinner
and i 'd get hales in for ballance
newman : they must play hales
why not ? gary ballance should not be learning the ropes in the biggest limited - overs tournament of all
england just do not seem to rate hales and if that is the case what is he doing here ? if he does not play in adelaide on monday they might as well send him home
and get jos buttler in earlier
leaving him just 19 balls against sri lanka was criminal
booth : they 've got to stop going on about stats , which mean little in the new era of fielding restrictions , and go for broke with players who scare the opposition
they should also pick their best spinner , james tredwell , because four right - arm seamers are n't doing the job
lloyd : hales can be brought in but do n't expect him to start blasting it
if he was a success from the word go it would be a bonus
so many people in the game say he should have been in the 50 - over team for the past 18 months ! england batsman jos buttler ducks a delivery against sri lanka at the wellington regional stadium sri lanka batsman lahiru thirimanne ( left ) dives to make his crease just in time against england and what about the long - term ? hussain : there 's no easy fix
but i wish selectors would show faith in their one - day players like in test cricket : look at how they backed root
give hales 20 one - dayers to see what he 's made of
newman : rip it up and start again
england need to work towards as separate a one - day team as possible , leaving jimmy anderson and stuart broad , to name two , to focus on tests
bring in the likes of sam billings , jason roy and stokes and keep them together , ideally under a different coach working on modern limited - overs skills
perhaps paul farbrace , who won the asia cup and world t20 with sri lanka , could step up while peter moores concentrates on tests
i know split coaches did n't work last time but england prioritised test cricket then
they have to give equal billing to 50 and 20 - over cricket from now
booth : england have to accept , finally , that the game has changed , and back more youngsters â the likes of jason roy and james vince
but the problem runs deeper : england is inherently a test nation
until they take 50 - over cricket seriously , they 'll always flop at world cups
lloyd : england need to show imagination in selection
think about the words ' dynamic ' and ' power ' and pick the team accordingly
i 'll throw in three names : stokes , jason roy and adil rashid
i 'd implore england to look at how other teams are doing it â people like australian glenn maxwell , corey anderson of new zealand and the dynamic australian duo of david warner and aaron finch
they show absolutely no fear at all
sam billings ( pictured in january 2015 ) has been backed by newman to help reinvent the england set - up 24 - year - old jason roy ( pictured playing for surrey in june 2014 ) , is another name being mooted for england what do you think of eoin morgan as captain ? hussain : i 've been disappointed with the way he 's become infected with management - speak
here 's a player whose flair and inventiveness made him what he is
instead , he 's talking about statistics
but you do need a plan , and a captain 's only as good as his bowling attack
newman : disappointing so far
still looks out of form with the bat , has n't been the pro-active , imaginative leader we hoped and seems to be in denial
he should be criticised for playing in the ipl rather than leading england against ireland in may
if he does n't want the captaincy , give it to root
booth : he has a bit more about him tactically than alastair cook
eoin morgan was given just the tri-series in australia to prepare
what did the ecb expect ? lloyd : i like eoin morgan immensely but i shudder at the interviews he 's giving
he 's just talking statistics all the time ! forget stats â if we 've got the players to make an impact , let them play in a different style , on instinct
he must also show more imagination in the field
eoin morgan 's form for england has come under particular scrutiny during england 's woeful world cup campaign does peter moores still have much to prove as coach ? hussain : yes , lots
he 's partly a victim of england 's one - day struggles , but it 's a worry to see some players going backwards
turning round the test series against india was to his credit , but he 'll be judged on the rest of this world cup and the ashes later this year
newman : i so want him to succeed , but there are worrying signs he looks out of his depth at international level
the players seem to like and respect him but he does not seem to be inspiring them
booth : he has everything to prove
he was lucky to be re-appointed and results have mainly been poor
he inherited a shambles but at some point that stops being relevant
lloyd : peter moores is ageing by the day
i hope he is looking at what other coaches like darren lehmann and mike hesson are doing with australia and new zealand
do n't have any regard for reputations â swing from the hip
england 's disappointing world cup has raised questions over the future of coach peter moores can kevin pietersen really play for england again ? hussain : i 've always believed in picking the best side , then man - managing it
but i feel there 's too much baggage with kevin pietersen now
also , he 's not the player he once was
if he was 24 , rather than 34 , you might give him another go
but the focus should be on england 's one - day team , not kevin pietersen
newman : well , what a can of worms incoming ecb chairman graves opened
the suggestion is that nothing has changed regarding kevin pietersen but graves ' clumsy words undermined the management while the ecb 's attempt to distance themselves from his comments by talking about ' positive influences ' just made it worse
booth : would he really have saved england at the world cup ? he played nine odis in 2013 and averaged 28
and he 'll be 35 soon
i loved watching him , but let 's not pretend he 's a panacea
lloyd : if it is going to happen kevin pietersen must be playing county cricket â red - ball and white - ball
if he commits to the english game and scores heavily then he should be back in the mix. whether or not kevin pietersen should return to the england set - up remains a hotly contested debate sportsmail experts are skeptical that 34 - year - old kevin pietersen 's return would necessarily improve england
