an eventful first day at the arnold palmer invitational saw rory mcilroy come close to achieving something that had nât been witnessed at bay hill for 20 years while ian poulter cheered up his sick three year old son joshua with a fine opening round of 67
ian poulter âs preparations for his final tournament before the masters were hardly ideal
while driving home from the course on wednesday , joshua was being taken to a nearby hospital with what turned out to be a bout of pneumonia
it was past midnight before he was allowed home
â it was certainly something of a blessing that i had a late tee - time , â said the england , who posted five birdies in a round that left him just a stroke off the pace set by american morgan hoffman
rory mcilroy waits on the first green during the first round of the arnold palmer invitational at bay hill club and lodge ian poulter hits his tee shot on the 18th hole during the first round of the arnold palmer invitational ian poulter âs in good form at present , and having thrown away a golden opportunity to win one event in florida at the honda classic three weeks ago , will be keen to give himself a chance to atone at this venue where he finished third in 2013
â it was nice to get joshua home on wednesday night and my wife katie is a trained nurse , so i knew he was in good hands when i left for the course this morning , â he said
after 15 holes of his opening round , a small slice of history loomed for rory mcilroy , just three weeks shy of his attempt at a career grand slam at the masters
the world number one was swinging so smoothly he had hit all 15 greens in regulation
not once in any round in his pga tour career has he hit all 18
no - one had done so at bay hill since 1995
ian poulter hits an approach shot on the 16th hole during the first round of the arnold palmer invitational rory mcilroy hits an approach shot on the first hole during the first round at the bay hill club and lodge next up was the easiest hole on the course , the par five 16th
yet it was here the 25 year old contrived to undo all the good work that had gone before
as soon as his second shot left the club face he started laughing at himself in exasperated fashion
he knew what was coming next
the ball bounced on the bank at the front of the green and back into one of the course âs many water hazards
there ended any hope of hitting all 18 greens in regulation
at least on the positive side , there were obviously plenty of excellent blows in those first 15 holes , and the reason he was only two under par at the time was he could nât buy a putt , which would nât have stressed him unduly given the shocking state of the bay hill greens
suffice to say that they âre nearer to municipal course standards than augusta âs
ian poulter hits an approach shot on the 18th hole during the first round of the arnold palmer invitational rory mcilroy of northern ireland talks with caddie j.p. fitzgerald on the fourth fairway in orlando , florida at least rory mcilroy finished with a birdie for a 70 , which has nât left him too far off the pace
â there were a lot of good signs out there and with this being my last event before augusta it âs important to play well in the second round and get myself into contention at the weekend , â he said
elsewhere , padraig harrington âs welcome revival continued with a 68 which left him alongside such luminaries as world number three henrik stenson , adam scott and the scot martin laird , a former winner of this event
when rory mcilroy made his way to the first tee at a shade before 1pm he must have been heartened by the enormous crowd that had gathered
rory mcilroy of northern ireland hits his second shot on the fourth hole during the first round the entire length of the hole was lined several people deep and rory mcilroy gave them something to cheer with a couple of opening blows that gave him a good look at a birdie , with the putt coming up just short
the first three holes at bay hill represent one of the toughest starts of any course on the pga tour but rory mcilroy looked in the mood as he registered three easy pars
a chance was wasted at the par five fourth but he got into red figures with a classy birdie at the signature hole
ian poulter of england reacts to a missed putt for birdie on the 18th hole during the first round in orlando rory mcilroy of northern ireland hits his tee shot on the third hole during the arnold palmer invitational the par five 6th winds its way around a lake for all of its 500 plus yards but it held no fears for the northern irishman as he played a marvellous long iron second to 20ft and two putted for a birdie
another birdie followed at the short seventh but that was the last putt he holed until he got to the 18th
after that effort from 15ft dropped he disappeared for dinner with the tournament host
he could nât keep the smile off his face when someone brought it up
â it âs going to be a really special evening , â he said
