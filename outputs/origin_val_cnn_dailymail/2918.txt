ronaldo shed tears of joy when he finally usurped messi as the ballon d'or winner for 2013
he was also officially crowned the world âs best player , above messi , for 2014
but here âs the bad news , ronaldo
despite the gongs and the widely - held opinion that ronaldo was superior to his great rival over the past two years , messi still contributed more valuable goals to his club and country in 2013 and 2014
that is the view of the number - crunchers at the economist , who have calculated the worth of each player 's goals , based on how crucial the goal was to the match result ( and the subsequent gains from that result ) , as well as the importance of the game
messi ( left ) and ronaldo ( right ) in action during last sunday 's el clasico duel messi 's barcelona beat ronaldo 's real madrid 2 - 1 at the nou camp , with the portuguese scoring the explanations of the precise formulas used and the value of certain matches in relation to others are both long and complicated , so to read them in full click here
sportsmail âs calculator also seems to be broken , so again to see the full numbers , let the economists âs boffins guide you through
be warned , though : the introduction contains a reference to ' the pythagorean formula extended for soccer ' , so it âs not for the faint - hearted
but the key facts are these
messi âs ( still fantastic ) total of 86 goals over the period does not compare with ronaldo 's superhuman 105
ronaldo shed tears of joy when he won the ballon d'or over messi in 2013 the real madrid hero stripped off to celebrate his goal in the champions league final last season but ronaldo 's penalty against atletico madrid was virtually worthless , according to the economist each of ronaldo âs 105 goals , however , were worth an average of 0.40 points to his team in relation to the most likely result of the match before the goal was scored
by contrast , messi âs 86 goals were worth an average of 0.47 points each
and if that sounds like gobbledegook , essentially this can be explained in simple terms : a goal in a match where the score is tied 1 - 1 in the final minutes yields more points ( or aggregate value in cup ties ) to his team than a goal scored in a match where the player 's team is already winning 3 - 1
the economist uses ronaldo âs three goals in the semi-final and final of last year âs champions league as an example to show their relative lack of value
in the second leg of the semi-final against bayern munich , ronaldo scored when real madrid led 3 - 0 and 4 - 0 on aggregate
and in the final against atletico madrid , his penalty in extra-time when real madrid were 3 - 1 ahead had a virtually negligible value
messi has rediscovered his best form this season after losing out to ronaldo since 2013 messi is on international duty with argentina and is pictured here training in washington messi was all smiles here at the 2013 awards nominations but ronaldo walked off with the prize the importance of messi 's goals means he should have claimed the big prize six times , says the economist messi , however , scored a winning goal in the final 20 minutes of a match on five different occasions in 2013 and 2014 , which hands him the advantage over ronaldo
the economist suggests that the only reason that the argentina star has not claimed six ballon dâors in a row is â messi fatigue â
