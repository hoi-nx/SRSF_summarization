there is always champagne at these things , but this art opening is an actual party
purple light bounces off the white walls in the massive foyer of london 's royal academy ; punk music falls down the stairs and kenneth anger 's homo - erotic biker short scorpio rising is playing on a tv screen
jarvis cocker is here , and so are bob geldof and rupert everett
there are the requisite grey ladies in fur and chapeaux , as well as twenty - somethings in backpacks huddled in groups , downing their drinks before walking into pace 's booze - free exhibition space for the opening of a strong , sweet smell of incense : a portrait of fraser
while his name may ring few bells outside of the seasoned london art community , eminent gallerist fraser , who ran a gallery in london during the swinging sixties and again in the eighties , was a seminal part of the swinging sixties scene
his notoriety hinged on scandal , parties and friendships with the most famous rock stars of the era , as well as an undeniable talent for spotting art 's next big thing
this is the eminent dealer who sold art to paul mccartney , and hosted john lennon and yoko ono 's first joint exhibition ; the savile row-clad etonian whose mayfair galleries attracted the likes of marlon brando , marianne faithfull and william burroughs in the 60s and 80s ; the silver - tongued heroin addict who introduced warhol and basquiat to britain , and was arrested -- and , in his case , imprisoned -- for drug possession with mick jagger and keith richards during the 1967 redlands bust
curated by the artist brian clarke , a strong , sweet smell of incense -- a winking reference to the police report describing the bust -- aims to blend the rebel , the art connoisseur and the hedonist to present a rounded image of an unsung star of the 60s
" there are oceans of anecdotes by fraser , and some of them are true
but the anecdote is n't enough to convey the kind of energy that he had , this kind of magnetic energy that drew you to him -- or repelled you depending on your own energy , " says brian clarke , arguably the world 's most well known stained glass artist
i first met brian clarke three weeks before the opening at his spacious cottage - cum - mansion in london 's tony notting hill neighborhood
a literal portrait of fraser painted by basquiat hangs prominently in the living room , surrounded by works by warhol , bacon and others
brian clarke , who was a close friend of fraser 's and was the first artist exhibited at his 80s gallery , is still finalizing the exhibition selection , but his energy is easy , if a little manic
vyner , a long - time friend of brian clarke and fraser , and author of the fraser biography groovy bob : the life and times of fraser , has been collaborating with him on the catalog
she 's on hand to add her own anecdotes to the ocean
" i remember going to seditionaries , ( malcolm mclaren and vivienne westwood 's 70s punk shop ) on the king 's road , and it felt a bit scary , but that was part of the thrill , " she says
" and that 's what people often felt about going to the fraser gallery in both incarnations
" the idea for the portrait came from pace 's managing director dent-brocklehurst a year ago , when brian clarke told her he 'd been entrusted with fraser 's archive
( fraser died of aids - related illness in 1986 at the age of 49
) " the ' light bulb moment ' really struck when we realized that pace founder , arne glimcher , was setting up his first gallery in boston at the time fraser was opening his own gallery in london , " dent-brocklehurst writes in an email
" we 're exploring our own dna with this exhibition while paying tribute to one of the most flamboyant dealers and aesthetes
" there 's a buzz in london right now around the exhibition and many artists , museum directors , celebrities , aspiring artists , art students are all very keen to rediscover fraser 's personality
" to hear brian clarke speak about fraser is to have assumptions alternately challenged , rebuked and confirmed
he makes no excuses and offers no explanations for fraser 's " more hedonistic side , " but emphasizes his generally quiet demeanor and modesty
the overall impression is of someone with an acute eye for talent ( he showed bacon , warhol , dennis hopper , richard hamilton , jim dine , robert mapplethorpe and jean dubuffet ) and a rebellious , destructive streak
this is reflected in the exhibition itself , which is set up like an archive
works from the luminaries fraser knew , showed or admired are on the walls , while personal effects -- a thank - you note from ed ruscha , a sex pistols never mind the bollocks poster , arrest warrants , an opium pipe with the gold rim worn to silver -- are kept behind glass cases
in one corner , there 's a recreation of his desk
take a few steps , and you 're looking at the drum from the beatles ' 1967 sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band album cover , which fraser art directed
other elements reflect their personal relationship
a gerhard richter that recalls a joint trip to berlin to see his works in person
an inscribed copy of an edward burne-jones biography was gifted from fraser to brian clarke
there was more to fraser , it seems , than the people he associated with
" there is always around fraser this aura of all these celebrities and things like that , and it 's true that they were there , but it was n't anything that he either curried or boasted about , " brian clarke says
" he was not a respecter of persons
he liked people or he hated them
" he was often reluctant to discuss his connections and friendships , even with those close to him
brian clarke remembers discussing capote with fraser at length during a stay in new york
he did n't realize the two were friends until capote came over to their table a few nights later to hug fraser
similarly , vyner remembers fraser fawning over prick up your ears , john lahr 's 1978 biography of playwright orton , without once mentioning that he was an early backer of orton 's productions
( she would discover this while researching groovy bob
) " for all of the inevitable references to the hedonistic side of fraser , he had a very sophisticated intelligence in terms of visual art , and genuinely in terms of culture , " brian clarke says
" so whilst he was not inclined to talk culture , he was eminently capable of it
a party - goer and i get to chatting about the exhibition , the party , and fraser
she enjoyed the party , but did n't -- does n't -- know much about fraser the man
" the exhibition is so chaotic and eclectic , " she says
" maybe that was him as a person ? " around 9:00 pm , security guards are shepherding the reluctant crowd out of the building , into the cold night
on the steps , a particularly drunk kid tries and fails to goad someone into a fight , while the less inclined start hailing cabs and mapping how to move the night into soho
i recall something brian clarke told me a few weeks prior , an effort to summarize the spirit of fraser 's galleries and its infamous parties , studded with stars and doused in glamor and excitement
" when you were with fraser , you felt there was nowhere really much better to be
you knew that you would not have more fun anywhere else , that 's for sure , and you would not be more stimulated , " he 'd said with a kind of wistfulness
" it was brief and short - lived , but that light burned bright
" a strong , sweet smell of incense : a portrait of fraser is on at london , burlington gardens until march 28 , 2015 .
