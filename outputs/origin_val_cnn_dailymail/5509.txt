i got a call from the police last night to say that a man had been arrested and another call this morning to say my mum 's body had been found
' i have n't had confirmation my mum 's partner is the one in custody but i 've never liked him

' mrs rosemary broadwell , who was just 4ft 8 inches tall , was well - known in the small town , where she had lived for around ten years
police are understood to have identified her by a tattoo of a lizard on her foot and another of a dolphin on her right shoulder
a spokesman for the civil guard in alicante said : ' i can confirm the body of a woman thought to be he british expat who went missing last september has been discovered
' police said they would have to wait for the results of an autopsy to establish the cause of death
