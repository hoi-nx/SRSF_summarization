they were worlds apart in life
ledger , a hollywood actor
simon , a qualified auto - electrician and the son of duck farmers from country victoria
but both men , the doting fathers of little girls , died just years apart from the same phenomenon - the abuse of prescription drugs , described as an epidemic in australia by anti-drug abuse groups
now kim , the late academy award winner 's father , has joined an effort to fight prescription drug abuse after he was moved by a ' heartwrenching ' letter from simon 's mother , margaret
the letter said simon ' wanted to stay well for maddie ' , his young daughter , ' but the hideous disease of addiction slowly crept back up again ' and he died of a pain medication overdose in 2010
' his life mattered , ' margaret wrote , ' and that is why i do what i do for others in similar circumstances
he was posthumously awarded an academy award for best supporting actor after the performance and his death kim , ledger 's father , has been involved in efforts to increase awareness about the dangers of prescription drug abuse since his son 's death in august 2008
his latest position is as patron of the not - for - profit scriptwise mr ledger 's own son accidentally died around two years earlier after he consumed a lethal cocktail of six prescription medications
the 28 - year - old actor was found dead in his manhattan apartment , shortly after completing filming for the dark knight , where he starred as the joker
' he was just desperately trying to get to sleep , ' mr ledger said
after receiving the emotional letter from margaret and john from nhill , victoria , and hosting a follow - up meeting with them last year , mr ledger today announced he will be the patron of the new not - for - profit scriptwise , which will raise awareness about the dangers and solutions to prescription drug abuse
' i met margaret and john last year ... margaret had reached out to me about maybe a year earlier or so with a little note , a letter really , a lovely letter that was quite compelling , ' he said
' it was explaining what they had to go through ( with simon )
it was really quite heartwrenching
' in a statement , mr ledger said his son 's profile was probably ' a little higher than many other loved ones ' who had experienced tragic deaths from prescription drug abuse
' if something positive can come from ( ledger 's ) passing such as raising awareness of the problem and moving towards some form of live monitoring for prescription medication , then my job is done
' margaret and john have lobbied the government in favour of measures to crack down on prescription drug abuse since simon 's death
simon had grappled with an addiction to pain medication for some sixteen years , mrs margaret millington told daily mail australia , following a devastating car accident in august 1994 , when he was just 18 - years - old
ledger was posthumously awarded the academy award for best supporting actor in the film the dark knight , following his stellar performance simon was caught in a car accident in 1994
as a result of his accident and his recovery , mr simon became addicted to pain killers and other medications , including ' benzos and opiates ' , his mother said mr ledger said : ' they 've done a great job - others around them have too - but those people who were the ones who influenced me enough to get involved in the project
' mrs margaret millington told daily mail australia she was touched by the praise from mr ledger
' we caught up with him in perth late last year , ' mrs margaret millington said
' we 've spent a lot of time sharing our stories about our sons ... ' there 's often times only the people who have been through it understand what we 've been going through
' ledger died of an overdose in august 2008 after consuming a lethal cocktail of six different prescription medications
mr and mrs margaret millington have worked hard to raise awareness about prescription drug abuse in regional victoria
they are lobbying for a mandatory national real time monitoring system to help stem the epidemic
scriptwise said pharmaceutical drugs were linked to 82 per cent of overdose deaths in victoria in 2013 alone
for the past three years i have been a volunteer on the wimmera drug action task force , the subcommittee i am on is the ' problematic use & misuse of prescription medications ' ( see terms of reference attached )
you may ask why kim ? well in 1994 , my 18 - year - old son suffered critical injuries in a single car accident
as a result of his injuries , and subsequent operations he became addicted to pain killers & other medications of all different sorts & varieties including benzos & opiates
you may well be aware of the trauma on families trying to assist , live with , and save a loved one who is on huge amounts of the above
simon was on a rollercoaster for 16 years , many times he went though rehabs and ' got well ' however the merry-go-round continued and we found ourselves and our lives had become as unmanageable as simon 's
we sought help from a family support group , nar anon , and we found if we were ' tooled up ' and implemented strategies & boundaries in our lives we could ' cope '
tough love became the order of the day and there were times when we felt we pushed simon too far with our rules however , when we changed and did not enable him , he too changed for the better
' i remember i once packed his things and asked him to leave home as it was us or his meds
he denied taking anything but his pupils & unloving behaviour told us otherwise
that was the hardest thing i ever had to do but it was worth the risk to help save him
you see kim , we had already lost a 2 year old daughter in a farm accident in 1980 & an 18 year old son in a motorbike accident in 2004
we were determined to save sime
in 2008 , whilst in yet another rehab , simon discovered he was the father of a four - year - old girl
he was overjoyed as we were also as we thought this would be the turning point for him
simon graduated from the rehab in 6 months and decided to come home and work on our farm and also volunteer at the rehab to help others
he lived at home and his little girl lived us for some of the week as well
simon was an amazing and doting dad , he wanted to stay well for maddie
we thought the bad times were behind us but the hideous disease of addiction slowly crept back into our lives again
his visits home become less and less and the doctor shopping started again
after a long and worrying time we lost our battle to keep sime alive and he died of an overdose of oxycontin in 2010
his life mattered and that is why i do what i do for others in similar circumstances
of his son ledger , kim said : ' if something positive can come from ( ledger 's ) passing such as raising awareness of the problem and moving towards some form of live monitoring for prescription medication , then my job is done '
