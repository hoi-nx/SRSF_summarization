a multi-million - pound office building just off trafalgar square has been taken over by anarchist squatters
around 50 people are currently living in the former offices of the institute of directors on pall mall in central london after moving in on friday night
the self - proclaimed ' bourgeois squatters ' today vowed to stay put for ' as long as possible ' in the building , not far from buckingham palace , which they targeted because it was originally opened by tony blair
although they have already received a court summons , they ignored the document and did not attend the legal hearing
the property has ashtrays and drinks glasses strewn across the floor , while half - eaten in what appear to be ocado and co-op bags have been piled up in rooms
the anarchists say that they have not done any permanent damage to the building , designed by scottish architect alexander peebles , apart from vandalising the plaque which records mr tony blair opening the premises in 2001
the building is currently on the market with estate agent cluttons after being vacated several months ago by the institute of directors , which used it as an annexe to its main headquarters a few doors away
food : half - eaten meals in what appeared to be ocado and co-op bags were seen in a corner of the squat vandalised : this plaque recording the opening of the building by tony blair was defaced by the squatters posters : the cluttons advert was defaced , while another poster showed the heads of ed miliband , nick clegg and david cameron on stakes hallway : a welcome table appeared to have been set up at the bottom of the stairs in the building mockery : one of the anti-capitalist messages painted on a poster in the window one squatter , 28 - year - old dominic , who was previously jailed for assaulting a police officer during an anti-capitalist protester , said that the group intended to take care of the building
referring to the mess on the floor , he said : ' we do clean up after ourselves every morning - we just have n't had the chance to do it yet
' when we leave they will get the building back in pretty much the same condition in which we found it in
' he added : ' we call ourselves bourgeois squatters
we all have different views
some are here to make a political point , but some are not
' but the main point for us all is that there are million , even billion , pound properties standing empty and i think it is disgusting that these buildings are left empty when there is a housing crisis going on in london
message : a protester known as patrick writes out a sign to be put in the window cheery : one message simply said ' have a nice day ' in contrast to other more aggressive posters washing up : this morning the squatters claimed they had not yet had time to do the cleaning claim : the squatters say they have a legal right to be in the building and have ignored a court summons aggressive : some posters declared ' class war ' and ' the working class strikes back ' ' we have a wide range of people here - chefs , caterers , law and politics students , and even an aspiring model - with an age range from about 18 to 60
' dominic claimed the building 's link with mr tony blair was one reason the squatters moved in
' we just saw it was empty and decided to take it , ' he said
' it is a massive building to be empty , and we could see that plaque through the door - the building was opened by tony blair who is a war criminal and has blood on his hands , so we decided to take it
' some of the posters in the window proclaim an apparently violent message - one has a picture of ed miliband , david cameron and nick clegg 's heads on spike , with the words : ' the only cuts we want to see
' another shows a picture of a cemetery captioned ' we have found new homes for the rich
' defiance : one poster made a reference to the late anti-war protester brian haw , who lived in parliament square contraband : a police hat appeared to be hanging from a coathook in the office building celebration : a squatter draped in the irish flag in an apparent homage to st patrick 's day the squatters say they will stay ' as long as possible ' , but do not yet know how long they will be able to remain
' we took it on friday and already by sunday we had a notice asking us to go to court , but i do n't think anybody went , ' dominic said
although the property still has electricity and running water , the squatters insist they are not stealing the utilities
a spokesman for the institute of directors , which represents the interests of company directors , said that the institute has had no link to the property since moving out
he added : ' we do n't mind a good strong , serious , debate - even if we do n't agree with the squatters with a lot of things - and they are entitled to their opinion
' we vacated this building six months ago , but there âs a chance there are some old hayek or adam smith books left behind
who knows , perhaps they âll learn something
' the metropolitan police said they were unable to act unless they received a complaint from the landlord
a spokesman for cluttons did not respond to a request for comment .
