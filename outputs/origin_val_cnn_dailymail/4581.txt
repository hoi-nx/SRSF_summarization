danny welbeck may have scored the goal that put his former club out of the fa cup , but he was not the only former old trafford star who was on target on monday night
on an evening where manchester united lacked creativity and firepower , three players they have let go in recent years scored around europe to win their side crucial matches
to add to arsenal striker danny welbeck 's triumphant old trafford return , on loan winger nani - deemed surplus to requirements by louis van gaal - and frenchman midfielder paul pogba scored for their clubs
danny welbeck slots home the winning goal after rounding david de gea at old trafford on monday danny welbeck celebrated passionately after scoring the goal that knocked manchester united out of the fa cup danny welbeck was one of three former manchester united players who netted vital goals on the same evening paul pogba , who was allowed to leave manchester united by sir alex ferguson in 2012 after failing to sign a contract with the club , scored a stunning volley from the edge of the box to give juventus a 1 - 0 win over sassuolo
the 82nd - minute goal put the ' old lady ' 11 points clear at the top of serie a , and keeps them on course for a fourth straight title
in portuguese it was nani - still technically a manchester united player - who popped up for the winning goal for sporting lisbon in their 3 - 2 win over panafiel
paul pogba unleashes a superb 82nd minute volley which won juventus the game against sassuolo the frenchman used to be at manchester united , but was allowed to leave after playing just three league games paul pogba has become a vital part of a juventus side on course to win yet another italian title this season van gaal has reportedly not spoken to the portuguese winger since he was allowed to leave old trafford , but nani showed he still has the quality to make the difference when it matters
down to ten men , sporting lisbon had let a two - goal lead slip before nani arrived to score a diving header and secure all three points against the portuguese league 's bottom side
the win keeps nani 's side in the hunt to qualify for next season 's champions league , something van gaal 's manchester united look increasingly unlikely to do
but none of those will hurt as much as danny welbeck 's strike on monday night , which was not only another winner from an ex-united player , but also against his former club
nani celebrates after scoring the winner for 10 - man sporting lisbon in a 3 - 2 win over penafiel the portuguese winger was allowed to leave on loan after louis van gaal decided he was not needed unlike the frenchman pogba or the portuguese nani , danny welbeck is a product of manchester united 's academy
but after van gaal deemed him not good enough for old trafford - preferring expensive flop radamel falcao to warm the subs bench - the 24 - year - old proved he can still score at the old trafford
on monday , manchester united could have done with the composure , bravery and quality shown by danny welbeck , nani and paul pogba - but all three had been allowed to leave
all three players were allowed to leave old trafford , and have done well elsewhere since moving
