in november 2014 , plasma physicist dr brandenburg revealed his theory that an ancient civilisation on mars was massacred in a nuclear attack
now , he âs back , and he âs going to be presenting new evidence for his theory at a nasa - sponsored conference today
he claims there is no other explanation for his proposal that a â weapon âs signature â remains from the attack on mars
dr brandenburg is to present his theory in houston , texas today
he says an ancient mars civilisation was wiped out by a nuclear bomb
a thin layer of radioactive substances including uranium , thorium ( shown in graphic ) and radioactive potassium on the surface supposedly provide evidence for this theory dr brandenburg will be presenting his theory at the 46th lunar and planetary science conference in houston , texas at the town center exhibit area this evening
if you missed the story first time around , be mindful that there âs quite a lot to take in
he says that ancient martians known as cydonians and utopians were wiped out by a nuclear attack from another alien race
although he does not go into much detail about the alien races , he points to a number of â artifacts â on the surface that he says are remnants of an intelligent society
aside from this outlandish theories , dr brandenburg has led a rather more normal , and prestigious , career
he has a phd in theoretical plasma physics from the university of california at davis
currently he works as a plasma physicist at orbital technologies in madison wisconsin
he has worked on a variety of propulsion technologies and previously was an independent consultant on space missile defense and directed energy weapons
dr brandenburg has authored a number of books with his latest being death on mars : the discovery of a planetary nuclear massacre
and he warned we should also be fearful of an attack from this supposedly hostile alien race that wiped out the martians
a thin layer of radioactive substances including uranium , thorium and radioactive potassium on the surface provide evidence for this theory
and nuclear isotopes in the atmosphere apparently resemble hydrogen bomb tests - which he says occurred in two places on mars , cydonia mensa and galaxias chaos
â we have now found evidence of the nuclear melt - glass trinitite ( formed on earth at the site of nuclear weapon air - bursts ) at both sites of the hypothesised explosions and this will be presented at the conference , â dr brandenburg revealed to mailonline ahead of his talk
â this strongly supports my hypothesis of massive nuclear airbursts
â â so far no scientist has offered any other explanation for this body of data
â dr brandenburg will be presenting his theory at the 46th lunar and planetary science conference in houston , texas at the town center exhibit area this evening
nuclear isotopes in the atmosphere apparently resemble hydrogen bomb tests - which he says occurred in two places on mars , cydonia mensa and galaxias chaos back in 2011 the scientist first postulated that the red colour on mars ( pictured ) could have been due to a naturally occurring thermonuclear explosion - but now he thinks it was caused by an intelligent alien race however , at the conference dr brandenburg said he would not be talking about his belief in the ancient civilisation
â the earlier result of a nuclear massacre stands , ' he said
â however , for this conference paper i chose to focus on the most important part of the hypothesis , the enormous nuclear explosions , which is the most extraordinary new evidence of past intelligent activity on mars
â my goal is establish the reality of the explosions to the scientific community , and their non-natural origin , and then focus on their targets
â rest assured the whole hypothesis will be discussed tomorrow
i will be waving around copies of my book : death on mars
â dr brandenburg also claims he came up with the hypothesis that mars was once covered in an ocean , which nasa recently announced
â this is a fine old blood feud on mars , â he added
he also says there is no natural explanation for his theory , as they were â fast neutron â midair explosions of about a billion megatons that turned large areas of mars into glass
shown is a ground level view of a nuclear device in nevada , us on 15 april 1955 dr brandenburg also claims he came up with the hypothesis that mars was once covered in an ocean , which nasa recently announced
the agency said they now had evidence that 3.7 billion years ago the planet had more water ( shown in illustration ) than than the arctic ocean does today on the reaction he is expecting , dr brandenburg said : â i expect the paper to be controversial , with perhaps statements to the effect that " this theory is so ludicrous i am not going to comment on its abundant evidences ! " by pundits
â but he said this would be â followed by private conversations by other scientists saying , in hushed tones : " oh my god ! who do you think did it ? " and " do you think they could come back here ? " he also says there is no natural explanation for his theory , as they were â fast neutron â midair explosions of about a billion megatons that turned large areas of mars into glass
â this can not be asteroid explosions , as that would have created large craters , and as at hiroshima and nagasaki no craters were created , â he said
â this is a weapon 's signature
â dr brandenburg will also be presenting another of his theories at the conference , that mars once has a â biologically stabilised greenhouse
â he says that the planet once had earth - like temperatures and atmospheric pressures , and was abundant with life and an oxygen - rich atmosphere
and he says these would have been ideal conditions for life to form .
