motorists in los angels were stunned after a second world war - era bomber flew low over the highway as it approached van nuys airport in california
the b-29 is the same type of aircraft which bombed hiroshima and nagasaki to force japanese into surrendering , the aircraft , which was built in 1945 , did not take part in the war , and despite the b-29 seeing service in korea , the aircraft , dubbed fifi , was not involved in that conflict either
the aircraft flew into los angels as part of a publicity tour where fans have the ability to gent onboard the historic aircraft and even buy tickets for a short spin
a seat in the cockpit costs $ 1,045 while guests pay $ 575 for a seat further back in the aircraft
the bombadier 's seat in the nose of the aircraft is the most expensive at $ 1,595
the aircraft is owned by the commemorative air force after their members found it at the us navy 's proving ground in chine lake , california
the plan was being used as a target for naval gunnery
amazingly it was not destroyed
for more than 30 years the aircraft was powered by its original engines , but they required replacing in 2006
the owners commissioned a specialist company to supply and fit some custom built engines allowing the aircraft to remain in the air
boeing began developing the b-29 in 1939 as a long - range heavy bomber with four engines
the b-29 was the first bomber to have a pressurised cabin and it was also equipped with remote control guns the aircraft was revolutionary as it was pressurised , meaning the crew did not have to use oxygen masks while on a mission
it was also the heaviest production aircraft at the time
according to boeing , the aircraft also had remote control guns
most of the b - 29 fleet was involved in the war against japanese , with 1,000 bomber raids targeting tokyo
however , the enola gay delivered the first atomic bomb to hiroshima , while the bockscar bombed nagasaki three days later
after the japanese surrender , the b - 29 saw service in korea and was used for anti-submarine patrols , weather reconnaissance and rescue duty
it was eventually retired in 1960
meanwhile , the duxford in duxford has built a scale model of the b-29 as part of its american air museum
the model was constructed by local schoolchildren .
