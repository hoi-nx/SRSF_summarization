millionaire durst was illegally arrested on charges that he murdered a woman in california , as well as drug and weapons charges filed in new orleans , attorneys said in court papers friday
in the papers filed at the state criminal district court in new orleans , william gibbens and dick deguerin asked a magistrate judge to schedule a preliminary hearing so that they can prove that there is no probable cause to keep durst jailed
they say he should be released
' i think he 's an easy target and everybody 's piling on
... they 're gon na find nothing , " dick deguerin , the lead attorney on durst 's team , told ktrk-tv
' i think louisiana and their elected officials want a piece of the publicity pie
the attorneys also asked the judge to order that evidence be preserved from the hotel where durst was arrested
they are seeking any and all records related to durst and everett ward , the pseudonym durst used to check into the hotel
the documents blasted the arrest , which the attorneys say was orchestrated ' to coincide with the final episode of the hbo docudrama the jinx
the six - part documentary concluded sunday
durst , a member of a wealthy new york real estate family , was charged with murder in california for the december 2000 shooting death of berman
durst 's arrest came shortly before the hbo finale about his links to three killings â that of his first wife , who disappeared in new york in 1982 ; berman , the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared ; and a 71 - year - old neighbor in texas whose dismembered body was found floating in galveston bay in 2001
frail : durst is on suicide watch at a louisiana detention center
he is expected to appear in court monday durst has only ever been tried for the texas killing , and he was acquitted of murder
durst waived extradition in new orleans but is being held there on charges that he was a felon in possession of a gun and with illegally carrying a weapon with a controlled substance
court documents say investigators found nearly $ 43,000 in cash , a gun and a rubber mask that could cover his head and neck in his hotel room when he was arrested
authorities have also said marijuana was found in the room
however , durst 's attorneys say his previous convictions are not serious enough to merit the gun charge
in the case , prosecutors could seek to play portions from the jinx that concluded with the eccentric millionaire off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live
he has been charged in los angeles with first - degree murder in the 2000 killing berman , the daughter of a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared in new york in 1982
durst , 71 , who is estranged from a family that has a real estate empire worth an estimated $ 4 billion , has long denied killing berman and kathleen durst , who was declared dead even though her body was never found
investigators had reopened that case and planned to speak with berman when she was shot once in the back of her head at her home near beverly hills
after the killing , durst disguised himself as a mute woman and moved into a cheap galveston bay , texas , boarding house where he killed an elderly neighbor in 2001
he claimed self - defense and was acquitted of murder but was convicted of unlawfully disposing of the man 's body , which was found chopped up and floating in galveston bay
while legal experts said durst 's remarks off - camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible , prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing
' i would see this moment of unguarded truth as worth a lot of those denials , ' said george fisher , a former prosecutor and professor at stanford law school
' the flat out meaning of the statement is very clear on its face
' in the case of blake , prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with barbara walters because it contradicted other evidence
the defense then successfully pushed to bring in the rest of the interview
' it did a great deal both to humanize him and so he was n't just seen as a celebrity , ' said m. gerald schwartzbach , who won blake 's acquittal on a murder charge involving the killing of his wife
' there was an image projected that a lot of people had about durst as a difficult person
in this video , he came across as a very sympathetic person
' prosecutors are not commenting on the berman case while durst is still held in louisiana , where he also faces firearms charges .
