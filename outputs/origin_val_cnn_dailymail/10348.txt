david luiz will be back , raising one of the biggest cheers of the night , and , unlike last year , ibrahimovich will take centre stage , but when chelsea take on psg at stamford bridge on wednesday night , the stakes will go beyond merely contesting the right to play in the champions league quarter finals laurent blanc âs future as manager at psg will hang in the balance , as will the competing philosophies at the respective clubs
in a battle of old money versus new money it âs not often roman abramovich âs chelsea are consigned to the former category , the frugal , traditional team taking on the gaudy spendthrifts
laurent blanc 's position as psg manager is under threat despite domestic dominance in france branislav ivanovic 's crucial away goal has given chelsea the edge in the tie ahead of wednesday 's game but with chelsea having grown out of their own age of extravagance , it is qatari - backed psg who have fallen foul of europe âs new ffp rules
when jose mourinho makes his barbed comments about clubs which â think they can over-ride what ffp says â he has psg in his sights as much as manchester city
and perhaps understandably so ; despite being fined , like manchester city , Â£ 49 million for breaching the ffp rules , told by europe to break even by 2016 , to not increase their wage bill and to limit transfers , the club managed to spend Â£ 43m on david luiz
and , according to reports in france , the club âs provisional budget for turnover next season has risen again to Â£ 350million after increased sponsorship deals with nike , emirates , nivea , huawei , pure essential and mumm â all in addition to the disputed Â£ 150m four - year deal they have with the qatar tourist authority , which europe refused to accept was a fair market price for a secondary sponsor
jose mourinho has complained about the paris club 's extensive spending , but ffp has had little impact former france defender blance knows his bosses expect the team to progress beyond the last 16 psg captain thiago silva has spoken of his desire for the club to challenge europe 's major powers all of which leads the club to believe that their dream of winning the champions league within the next few years can be achieved
â i do not think the project here is stalling at all , it was always going to be a big project , â said thiago silva , captain and david luiz âs defensive partner
â the owners aim is to have us on the same level as real madrid and bayern
we know that we have the players to be able to win the champions league , and even with the very difficult game against chelsea - we have to believe that this year can be our year
â that goal appeared a distinct possibility when carlo ancelotti âs side ran barcelona close in the champions league quarter finals in 2013 , being knocked out on away goals
and when they beat chelsea 3 - 1 at parc des princes in the first leg of the quarter final meeting last year , they appeared to be continuing their growth
but a 2 - 0 defeat at stamford bridge saw them ejected from the competition and they are now are in danger of exiting in the last 16
thiago silva praised the professionalism of his team - mate , and former chelsea defender , david luiz ( right ) david luiz was on the other side when the teams met in the quarter final last year , when chelsea progressed psg will take heart from the first leg in parc des princes , where chelsea were hanging on to the 1 - 1 draw by the end and the fact that last year psg were missing an injured ibrahimovich at stamford bridge
â we are better equipped than last year to beat chelsea , â said thiago silva
â even if you look at the game in paris , we were the better team no doubt
if it was not for an unbelievable performance from their goalkeeper we would have won the game and would be travelling to london with the lead , we must take heart from that
â david luiz is very excited to go back to chelsea
he had great memories there , he helped them to win the champions league - so i would be very surprised if the chelsea fans gave him anything other than a fantastic reception
javier pastore looked to have given psg a winning lead in the first leg last season , but chelsea hit back demba ba 's last - gasp goal put chelsea through , but psg are confident they can win this time around lionel messi scores against psg in 2013 , when it looked like the french side were on the brink of europe 's elite ' he is a winner though , yes he has good memories of chelsea , but his only objective will be to knock them out - and for us to progress
â laurent blanc âs future remains uncertain
though form has improved since the embarrassing 4 - 2 defeat at bastia at the turn of the year and despite thrashing lens on saturday , lyon will overtake them if they win at montpellier on sunday
they knocked monaco out of the domestic cup last week to reach the semi-finals and are in the french league cup final â but give that their budget is more than three times the size of lyon , even a domestic treble may not save laurent blanc
with diego simeone looking likely to sign a new deal with atletico madrid , rafa benitez and jurgen klopp look the most likely candidates to take over form laurent blanc for next season
and should psg âs european dream die on wednesday in london , europe âs leading coaches can expect to be fielding fresh inquiries from the qatari owners .
