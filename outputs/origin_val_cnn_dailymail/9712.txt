and now australians women are shelling out up to $ 3000 to learn how to do it
the kardashians have turned the art of contouring , a technique that involves highlighting and shadowing the face , from a make up insider secret to something many women - and some men - have tried to master
the demand to learn the secret to a flawless face is so high in australians that one hollywood make up artist is in the country this week to teach sold - out workshops in sydney and melbourne
the 30 - year - old was flown here to teach the the techniques used by kim k and jennifer lopez 's ' glam squads ' to groups of women who have shelled out up to $ 3000 each for a three - day master class
lilit caradanian spoke to dma during her sydney workshop , which will be followed this week by more sold - out classes in melbourne
eager to learn : australians women are embracing the trend , and some have shelled out up to $ 3000 for a master class this week to learn from a top hollywood make up artist tricks of the trade : make up artist lilit caradanian ( pictured ) says that ' 90 per cent ' of her students and clients request contouring ' contouring is really popular over here , ' she says
' i always ask what the class wants to learn and right now contouring is 90 per cent of the feedback i get
' my students who are make up artists tell me their clients come to them asking about contouring
the average consumer knows about contouring , but does nât have the knowledge to do it themselves
' while the kardashians are largely responsible for alerting the masses to the magic of contouring , lilit caradanian credits jennifer lopez with pioneering the trend - even if her fans did n't know she was doing it at the time
' jlo â it started with her
scott barnes , her former make up artist , created and then became a master of contouring , ' lilit caradanian says
' and then he became kim k âs make up artist , and she started carrying that look as well
' makeover : lilit caradanian shares her contouring technique with dma before and after : the contouring technique can give the illusion of a different face shape , sculpted jawline and cheekbones 1
start with applying your foundation as normal 2
next take a peach - hued concealer , approximately two shades lighter than your skin and apply under the eyes to highlight , blending as you go 3
use the same concealer on the straight bridge of the nose , middle of the forehead and centre of the chin ( think everywhere the light catches ) and blend , blend , blend 4
next , take a contouring cream two shades darker than your foundation sculpt the face : concealers , highlighters and contouring creams are used 5
swirl some of the contouring cream onto a brush and start by outlining around the hairline
this should look like you are â framing â the face
blend the contouring â in â ( starting from the outside of the face and blending inwards ) 6
finish the â frame â by sweeping the colour under the jawline
trace the contour cream below the cheekbones , creating a triangle of colour that points to the corner of the lips 8
take some more colour and contour on either side of the bridge of the nose and also in the crease of the eyelid 9
the final step is to blend , blend , blend using a foundation brush to ensure there are no firm lines illusion : contouring can be used to slim a face , hide a double chin , and highlight cheek bones so , what is contouring exactly ? ' it âs not just drawing lines on your face
it âs about bringing out certain features we want and receding features we do nât want to show so much , ' lilit caradanian tells dma
' if you have a double chin , you can contour it to make you look a little bit slimmer â it âs an illusion
you âre sculpting your features
' ' the ideal shaped face is the oval shape , so if you do nât have that , you can contour your face in certain areas to create the illusion of the oval shape , and to bring out the features
' lilit 's clients have become savvy about contouring
' a few years ago , when i âd ask my clients what they want to do with their make up , they would say they wanted a smoky eye , some liner , lashes
now it âs just about contour
they do nât care what you do with their eyes or lips , as long as they have contour
pioneer : jennifer lopez was an early adopter of contouring ' the bridal industry has taken this turn where the bride wants to feel like a celebrity the day of her wedding - all eyes on them
they want to feel like a kim k , they want to feel perfect
' celebrities have embraced the art of contouring because it helps them photograph flawlessly
but how does it translate to real life ? with heavy duty contouring taking up to an hour , lilit caradanian says there are a few short cut methods that can be adapted for everyday
' a woman should nât spend longer than 15 minutes getting ready in the morning
you do nât need to highlight and contour every day
' a simpler technique is with a powder bronzer , which you can use in the same way as a contour , it âs easier , on the go , and you do nât need to sit there and blend it for an hour
all you really need is some good base â tinted moisturiser or foundation , some bronzer so you do nât look pale , blush , and you âre good to go
in demand : professional make up artist lilit caradanian has over 840,000 instagram followers and celebrity clients there are a few different contouring methods , says lilit caradanian
' you can use heavier creams , which are great for photo shoots but not if you want your make up to last all day
there are also thinner , more liquid creams , which have more staying power
' and for australians 's humid climate , where woman are regularly victims to their carefully applied make up slipping off in the heat , lilit recommends a powder base
' for people with oily skin or if you live in a humid climate , you want to go with powder contouring versus cream contouring , ' she advises
' you âre still going to get the same look , but with a lighter texture and feel on the skin
