a failure in lapd handwriting analysis 14 years ago meant that durst was free to kill again , according to a search warrant
durst , a member of a wealthy new york real estate family , was arrested in new orleans over the weekend and charged with murder for the shooting of susan berman in december 2000
police focused on durst 's handwriting 14 years ago , after a note in an envelope tipped them off to susan berman 's death
but a document examiner wrongly concluded that the handwriting did not match durst 's
he escaped police attention for years , partially due to a failed handwriting analysis 14 years ago writing on the note and envelope , which was written in block lettering , misspelled ' beverley hills police ' and included the word ' cadaver ' along with susan berman 's beverly hills address
in 2001 , lapd document examiner leaver concluded it was ' highly probable ' that it was written by nyle brenner , susan berman 's manager and friend
the assessment was ' rubber stamped ' by leaver 's supervisor , who told detectives in september that she had not backed the findings up with an independent technical review
investigators had initially failed to analyze examples of durst 's handwriting , and it was n't until eight months later that a comparison was made
leaver said ' similarities ' were enough to request more writing samples , which police eventually obtained
in june 2003 , leaver revised his assessment to conclude that the handwriting was likely durst 's
the conflicting analyses meant that valuable time lost
by then , durst had been charged in texas with the murder and dismemberment of morris black
investigation : law enforcement officers stand outside the durst 's houston home forensic : durst himself may have implicated the property in a recording made while talking to himself after a tense interview for the hbo series eventually , the envelope , letter and writing samples were sent to the california department of justice and an investigator concluded that durst was ' probably the author of the cadaver letter and note '
the los angeles case went dormant , and was n't revived until 2012 , when law enforcement learned of a six - part hbo series about his links to three killings entitled the jinx : the life and deaths of durst
he is suspected of killing his first wife , who disappeared in new york in 1982 ; susan berman , the daughter of a mobster , who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared ; and a 71 - year - old neighbor in texas , whose dismembered body was found floating in galveston bay in 2001
the filmmakers say they shared tape with police months ago of interviews with durst , including his reactions to handwriting analysis and what appears to be a confession to susan berman 's killing
in october and november , the lapd had two independent examiners analyzed the documents and both concluded that durst was the author
durst was arrested earlier this month , shortly before the finale of the hbo documentary
he has only ever been tried for the texas killing , and he was acquitted of murder
authorities on tuesday searched durst 's houston home , and the warrant released wednesday details the timeline of the susan berman case
the lapd has declined comment until durst is in its custody
he is currently being held in louisiana on gun charges
durst 's attorney , dick deguerin , said the conflicting determinations on the handwriting ' shows you what junk science really is
' he also questioned what evidence police expected to find in durst 's houston home
but durst himself may have implicated the property in a recording made while talking to himself after a tense interview for the hbo series , which concluded sunday
just before saying he ' killed them all , ' he says , ' i do n't know what 's in the house '
the search warrant affidavit showed that authorities were concerned durst , who has an estimated net worth of $ 100 million , might be preparing to flee the country
he had withdrawn large sums of money from multiple bank accounts , including daily amounts of $ 9,000 , for 35 days starting in october
durst was under fbi surveillance
agents arrested him in a new orleans hotel under the name ' everette ward , ' finding nearly $ 43,000 in cash , a gun and a rubber mask that could cover his head and neck in his room , the affidavit says
a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation said that it was a kind of ' old man mask ' , and investigators were looking at whether he had been using it to travel anonymously
durst could face the death penalty if convicted of killing susan berman .
