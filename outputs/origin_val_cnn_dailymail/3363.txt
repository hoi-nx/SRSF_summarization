after decades in the doldrums , eggs appear to have a cracking future
consumption rose by 2.4 per cent in 2014 , which equates to an extra 700,000 that are boiled , scrambled and fried every day of the week
it is a remarkable resurgence for the egg , which has suffered from a series of health scares and changes in food fashion since the 1950s when the nation was happy to â go to work on an egg â
the revival is being attributed to the fact they form a central part of protein - rich diets such at atkins and paleo , which promise weight loss and even a longer life
consumption of eggs rose by 2.4 per cent in 2014 , the equivalent of 700,000 extra a day
experts are crediting the revival with the rise of protein - rich diets including atkins and paleo as a result , egg sales are now finally back to the levels seen in the 1980s when the former tory health minister edwina currie infamously labelled them a health threat because of salmonella contamination
that attack fuelled existing concerns about eggs , which were also being demonised by doctors for containing high levels of cholesterol , which was wrongly assumed to fur up the arteries
however , the egg has become healthier following a change in the diet of the hens , with the result the cholesterol level is down by some 13 per cent to some 100g , which is a third of the recommended daily limit
at the same time , vitamin d , which is vital for healthy bones , is up by 64 per cent compared to a decade ago
the net result is that eggs are now being actively promoted as a health food given they are also full of the protein , vitamins , minerals and essential fatty acids that are vital to a healthy body
until 2009 , uk were warned against eating more than three eggs a week because of the worries about cholesterol â but this warning has now been junked
research by experts at university of surrey found overweight people given two eggs a day as part of a reduced calorie diet lost weight and saw no increase in blood cholesterol levels

a compound found in eggs makes people much more generous , new research suggests
scientists say that tryptophan , an amino acid found in some foods , can change our behaviour
in experiments they found that consuming a small portion of tryptophan - the equivalent of that found in three eggs - doubled the sum volunteers gave to charity
eggs and other foods such as fish and milk are rich in tryptophan , an amino acid that is converted in the body into the feel - good chemical serotonin
and the us dietary guidelines advisory committee has recently recommended that limitations on consumption of cholesterol found in eggs should be removed from official health guidelines
it stated : â cholesterol is not considered a nutrient of concern for overconsumption
â a spokesman for the british egg industry council said : â health professionals â recognition of their health benefits , and the end of the confusion over their effect on cholesterol , mean eggs are now being widely recommended as part of a healthy diet
â they are also included in all major slimming plans , from established groups such as weight watchers and slimming world , to more recent trends such as the atkins and paleo diets
â egg consumption has also been boosted by the trend to eat breakfast at dinner under the rise of the â brinner â â a trend that has been imported from america
in total , 32 million eggs were eaten every day in the uk in 2014 , equivalent to 11.7 billion throughout the whole year
â consumption from retail purchases exceeded six billion for the first time in 2014 , having grown 16 per cent in the past five years , â said the spokesman , adding that consumption had returned to levels last seen before the salmonella crisis of the late 1980s
the details were reported by farmers weekly , which said sales have also been helped by supermarket promotions and price cuts

the egg has become healthier following a change in the diet of the hens , with the result the cholesterol level is down by some 13 per cent to some 100g , which is a third of the recommended daily limit however , the supermarket price cuts meant the actual value of these sales fell by a significant 4.8 per cent to Â£ 768m
andrew joret , chairman of the british egg industry council , said he anticipated another year of rising consumption in 2015 , pointing to the sector âs first tv advertising in 10 years , as well as a new main meals in minutes recipe campaign fronted by fitness entrepreneur and celebrity lucy mecklenburgh
a fan of the brinner trend , she said : â i âll often eat eggs for dinner when i get home from a work out in the evening
they are quick , nutritious and not to mention tasty
