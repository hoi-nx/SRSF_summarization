ajax manager frank de boer wants to emulate the way arsenal play as the dutch club bid to reach the uefa europa league quarter - finals
de boer was impressed by arsenal 's performance in the 2 - 0 uefa champions league win against monaco on tuesday night - though the gunners were knocked out on away goals - and wants ajax to follow suit
de boer said : ' the way they played against monaco is the way we would like to play as well
high pressure , get the ball back very quickly
i really love the way arsenal play
when i look at their goals , it sometimes looks like futsal
passing , moving and always at a high tempo

de boer said : ' i expect dnipro to sit back and wait for us to attack
you could see that in the first match as well
we have to be patient , we ca n't afford to make mistakes
' i hope this is not the " game of the year " for us , because i want to go through and play in another " game of the year "

he said : ' we 've practised penalties
from the 19 we took , we only missed about three or four
jasper cillessen saved two and one or two went over the bar
' you can always train the way you kick the ball , but it 's hard to simulate the atmosphere
when you saw bayer leverkusen last night , it looked like they did n't know that they had to take a penalty
