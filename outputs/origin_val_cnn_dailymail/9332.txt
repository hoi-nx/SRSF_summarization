former new england patriots player hernandez can be seen on surveillance video walking through his home with a gun less than 10 minutes after prosecutors say he killed a man , according to testimony wednesday by an employee of firearms manufacturer glock
it was the most conclusive testimony to date in the monthlong trial that puts a weapon in hernandez 's hand around the time of the slaying
hernandez is charged with murder in the killing of lloyd , who was dating the sister of hernandez 's fiancee
lloyd was shot to death early on june 17 , 2013 , in an industrial park near hernandez 's home in north attleborough , sending his last text message at 3:23am , and two witnesses have testified they heard loud bangs around that time
the murder weapon has never been found
the semiautomatic handgun uses .45 - caliber bullets , and prosecutors have argued that based on ballistics evidence , a glock was the murder weapon
as kyle aspinwall testified , prosecutor patrick bomberg played clips of video recorded by hernandez 's extensive home surveillance system june 17 , as well as still photos taken from the videos
at several points in the video , hernandez can be seen carrying a black object in his hand , an object his defense team has said could have been a tv remote or another electronic device
but kyle aspinwall said his opinion was based on various characteristics of the weapon , including the curvature of back strap , the magazine well and trigger guard
' in my opinion , the firearm shown in the video stills is a glock pistol , ' he said
the earliest clip played wednesday was taken at around 12:45am before hernandez leaves the house with co-defendants ortiz and wallace in a rental car
prosecutors have said the three picked up lloyd in boston , then drove him back to north attleborough
ortiz and wallace are also charged with murder and have pleaded not guilty
they will be tried at a later date

later , after hernandez , ortiz and wallace return to the home at around 3:30am , hernandez can be seen outside the door to his basement as he faces the camera a few feet away while holding the object in front of him
' this is a picture of the defendant holding what appears to be a handgun in his left hand in a reverse grip , ' kyle aspinwall said
at various points in his testimony , kyle aspinwall stood and used his glock to demonstrate how hernandez was holding the weapon
at around 2:30pm , less than 12 hours after the killing , other video shows hernandez and wallace hanging out by the pool before hernandez gets a black object out of the rental car
kyle aspinwall testified that the object appears to be the magazine of a gun .
