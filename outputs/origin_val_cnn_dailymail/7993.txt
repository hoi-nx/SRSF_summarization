he plans to travel the world with his wife , he said ' and tamar out of the blue said " hey , why do n't we just keep on going " , ' he wrote
' " let 's explore africa , and then turn east to make our way to india , it 's just next door , and we 're here already
' " then , we keep going ; the himalayas , everest , go to bali , the great barrier reef ... antarctica , let 's go see antarctica ! ? " ' he told her : ' it 's not time yet , there is still so much to do at google , with my career , so many people counting on me / us - boards , non profits , etc , ' he wrote
' but then she asked the killer question : so when is it going to be time ? our time ? my time ? the questions just hung there in the cold morning africa air
' a few weeks later , i was happy back at work , but could not shake away the question : when is it time for us to just keep going ? ' he explained that this is the right time to step down , as two of their children are away at college and the third is working for a start - up in africa
family : patrick pichette said it is time to retire because his three children are no longer living at home

in that entire time , it has been ' non-stop work ' for him
' she deserves more , ' he wrote
' patrick pichette explained that he would be staying with google , where it has been a ' privilege ' to work , until the company finds a replacement and he will be remain there throughout the transition
he concluded : ' in the end , life is wonderful , but nonetheless a series of trade offs , especially between business / professional endeavours and family / community
