rating : the pub - with - rooms phenomena continues apace in london - and this is a classic of the genre , executed with style and panache by a couple of twentysomethings who met at leeds university
this is their third artist residence ( brighton and penzance are up and running ) , in what used to be a traditional boozer in pimlico , a short walk from victoria station
if the bones of a building are important , here they 're as good as they get
a bright splash of colour on the canvas : artist residence has brought a dash of flair to an old pub built by thomas cubitt in 1852 , the grand , stuccoed house is on four floors - five if you count the basement , where there 's a dimly lit bar and sitting room for hotel guests
i feel good the moment i walk in
there is no fuss at reception and , unlike the orange nearby , there is a separate entrance for those staying the night , so you do n't have to shout your name at the bar or get handed a packet of crisps rather than your room key
i 've booked a small plus room , but am upgraded to the loft because not many of the ten rooms are occupied
everything about the loft is charming : the wooden floors and panelled walls , bare brick , white paint
the bedhead is a gate and the lights ( all on dimmers ) are industrial , with sixties anglepoise lamps on the bedside tables
the cupboard must have been reclaimed from an office
in fact , reclamation seems to be a theme
' the countryside comes to town ' is another
the bathroom is part of the bedroom , with a separate shower and enclosed loo
two sturdy sash windows look terrific and , hallelujah , you can open them
the restaurant is called 64 degrees
the idea is that the chefs are part of the eating experience , especially if you sit at the bar , as i do
small plates of this and that are the order of the day under three sections : veg , fish and meat , with four options for each
haddock gyoza , pear and fennel has me leaning over the bar and asking one of the chefs for an explanation
there are no side dishes of any description - and no carbs as far as i can see
dr atkins would feel at home
there 's a bubbly , unpretentious atmosphere , though i would expect proper napkins rather than paper jobbies at these prices
frankly , that 's about the only criticism i can muster
