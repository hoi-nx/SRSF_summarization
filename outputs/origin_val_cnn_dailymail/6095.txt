above , a family photograph taken in the years before their death in the days before his death the father of two from penistone , south yorkshire , sent letters to a bank telling them he ' would not be alive ' to pay his mortgage
on october 22 , when the three were killed in the fire , he sent a text message to a handful of friends saying ' he was going to be at peace '
concluding that the carpet estimator had intended to take his own life , sheffield coroner dorries said : ' the whole business is absolutely terrible
following a police statement which described the ongoing custody battle between mr darren sykes and his estranged wife claire , he added : ' he may have taken the view he would have less access
' on the morning of his death mr darren sykes spent Â£ 800 on a model railway track before sending text messages to both his sons asking them to visit him at his house that day
before luring them into the attic he sprayed four cans of petrol across the ground floor of the house and barricaded doors with furniture
he had also tied the front and back garden gates with cord to prevent anyone from accessing the property

a coroner told of how he may have been worried about his access rights to the children after family court liaisons met with police officers jack , left , spent five days in hospital fighting for his life while younger brother paul ( right ) was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital neighbours described seeing a flash come from the property moments after mr darren sykes sent text messages to friends saying he would be ' at peace '
police and firefighters arrived to find the 44 - year - old 's body in the loft police were forced to smash a window to gain access to the property
right , neighbours leave tributes to the family following the tragedy ' the door to the stairs had been wedged to stop anyone coming down and there were chairs behind the front door as if to prevent people coming in , ' said special fire investigator michael mason
evidence suggested mr darren sykes 's eldest son jack made a desperate attempt to escape as flames ravaged the floors beneath them
' at some point during the fire the loft hatch was closed and then opened during the fire which allowed a plume of smoke with gases to enter the loft
' it was a natural reaction to try to get out
' explaining how investigators knew it was jack rather than his father of young brother who tried to escape , he added : ' opening the hatch made the position untenable
' recording a verdict of suicide , coroner dorries said it was ' abundantly clear ' mr darren sykes had set the fire which killed him and his two sons
' all three were inside the loft with the hatch closed when the fire took hold
' there is no evidence that it was set by anyone else other than mr darren sykes
he intended to take his own life
' an inquest into the boys â deaths will be held later this week .
