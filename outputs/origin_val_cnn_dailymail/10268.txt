farage this morning rejected claims he has been â sent by god â to save britain from the eu â insisting : â i âm not the messiah , i âm a very naughty boy
â the ukip leader âs remarks , echoing one of the most famous lines from monty python 's life of brian , came after he was played a clip of a documentary aired this week featuring one of his more obsessive fans
former nurse jill said mr farage â probably did nât realise it â but had been â sent to protect us against the eu â
she said mr farage , 50 , was britain âs only hope
' god says when an enemy comes against you like a massive flood , i 'll send someone to give you some protection
' jill added : ' i think farage is sent to protect us against the eu , he wants to bring england back to the england people and stop this foreign invasion of our borders
' ' what farage will do by getting us out of the eu is to stop their plans to microchip our people
' the eu already has the equipment set up and they have death vans like they have in china , equipped with guillotines
' they will be sent to houses and work places basically saying receive the microchip or be killed
so off with your head and that 's when things start getting unpleasant
' played the clip on lbc this morning mr farage insisted he was not placed on earth to save britain from brussels
in monty python 's life of brian , the hapless brian , played by graham chapman ( right ) , is hailed the messiah - but his mother , played by terry jones ( left ) tells his followers : ' he 's not the messiah , he 's a very naughty boy ' the cult 1979 film follows the rise of monty python 's life of brian , who was born on the same day as jesus and is mistaken as the messiah he said : â jill , i âm sure , is an absolutely delightful woman , but i have to disappoint her
jill , i âm not the messiah , i âm a very naughty boy
â jill - who says she once saw an angel in tesco express - does n't just think farage will save the nation with his foreign policies
she also believes ukip is helping brits become more liberated in the bedroom
she 's a fan of bondage herself and says she has met many ukip supporters who share her fondness for s&m
she said : ' i would love a cabinet position as head of bondage
it 's my hobby and i do enjoy it , it 's all role - play and froth , it 's a natural england phenomenon to like it
' sometimes i like to be submissive and other times dominant
i have met a lot of ukip supporters who are into bdsm
they do seem to have a natural bent towards bondage
' i do think that farage has bought a new era and openess to england where we can be more open about our needs to have our bottoms spanked
' jill , pictured left at her home in poole , believes ukip leader farage has been sent from god to save us from a foreign invasion jill is pictured demonstrating her hobby and is grateful brits can now be more open about their sex lives the bondage enthusiast also believes ukip can enhance the nhs by giving free cosmetic surgery to women who want it , like herself
' i have been a nurse most of my life , i have my views about the nhs
i think people who need big breasts , who need their nose done , should receive help from the state , ' jill said
' i think farage should look into this
i have seen my surgeon and i am going to have implants
' i think i should get them on the nhs
farage could get a higher women 's vote by bringing that into play
