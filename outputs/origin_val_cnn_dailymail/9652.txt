these 170 - year - old images reveal what life was like in the world âs most famous canal city before it was mobbed by hordes of gondola - riding tourists
some of the earliest photos of venice â snapped in the 1840s and 1850s â show an empty piazza in front of st. mark 's basilica , the ca â dâoro palace under restoration , and a grand canal with very little boat traffic
the tranquil scenes are a far cry from modern - day venice , which is visited by an estimated 10 million tourists a year
the â lost photographs â were taken mostly by ruskin , who died in 1900 at the age of 80 , while he was working on his three - volume treatise on venetian art and architecture
they include the largest collection of daguerreotypes of venice and possibly the earliest surviving photos of the french and swiss alps
the photos have been preserved and identified by collectors and historians ken and jenny jacobson , who have co-authored a book that documents ruskin âs photography
a small group of people gathers at the piazza in front of st. mark 's basilica in venice in 1845 ; today the square is teeming with tourists these photos show animal heads ( left ) and noah 's vine carved into pillars at ducal palace , which is now a museum ruskin snapped or collected the images while he was working on his three - volume treatise on venetian art and architecture based on their suspicion that the images belonged to ruskin , the essex couple acquired the lot at an auction in cumbria , where ruskin lived
a bidding war with another collector raised the price to Â£ 75,000 from an original estimate of just Â£ 80
ken jacobson , who has been collecting historic photos with his wife for almost 45 years , said : â the discovery of 188 previously unknown ruskin daguerreotypes has been the most exciting of our career
this photo shows palazzo gritti-badoer with laundry hang drying on lines outside ( circa 1846 - 1852 ) ducal palace was a popular photography spot ; this image shows a south - facing window looking out towards a lagoon ( circa 1849 - 1852 ) this photo from ruskin 's collection shows moored boats in the harbour at arona , italy on a summer day in july 1858 â the propitious circumstances of this find were truly magnified many times over by the fascinating discoveries we made during our research and the generosity , intelligence and friendship we shared with other scholars and our conservators
â we feel that the quality and unorthodox style of many of ruskin âs daguerreotypes will come as a major surprise to both photographic historians and those in the field of ruskin scholarship
â it is an astonishing accomplishment for a polymath better known for his achievements in so many other disciplines
ruskin âs daguerreotypes would be a sensational new revelation in the history of photography even if he were completely unknown
we hope the work will be as intriguing to others as it has been to us
