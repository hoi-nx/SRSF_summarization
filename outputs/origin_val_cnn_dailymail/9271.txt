a schoolgirl spent six months with four inflated balloons lodged under her scalp to grow new skin to allow doctors to cover her birthmark
jessica was born with a mole covering half her head
specialists warned her parents if it was left untreated , it could ultimately turn cancerous
medics did not want to leave the nine - year - old with a bald patch , by using a skin graft from elsewhere on her body
and so they decided to grow more skin on her scalp , during two complex operations
in what is thought to be a uk first , surgeons put four balloons under her scalp in a ' mohawk '
jessica , nine , from lincoln was born with a huge mole covering a large part of her head
doctors warned her parents if left untreated , it could become cancerous
and so , they inserted four balloons under her scalp , inflating them to grow excess skin to cover the mole they then spent six months gently inflating the balloons with more than a pint and a half of saline solution , to stretch jessica 's skin
when enough excess skin had been created , the balloons were removed
meanwhile surgeons also removed the mole
then , the team were able to stretch the new skin over the gap , creating a normal scalp
jessica coped with her unusual ' hairstyle ' by drawing inspiration from her short - haired hero jessie j and did n't complain once throughout the tough ordeal
her proud mother becky , 34 , said : ' she was really so brave - it just did n't bother her
' she looked like she had buns on her head , and people used to comment on how they liked her " hairstyle "
' it was a long process but jessica showed us the strength with how brave she has been and her courage
' she wore a hat but then sometimes she would go out without it
' everyone is so proud of her
she just embraced what she has been through
she 's ever so brave
doctors spent six months inflating the balloons , three at first , to create extra skin
they then removed the mole , and used the new scalp to cover the birthmark jessica coped with her unusual ' hairstyle ' by drawing inspiration from her short - haired hero jessie j and did n't complain once throughout the tough ordeal , her mother said ' it 's nice now to think that it 's all over for her
she looks as perfect as she did before and it 's as if it never happened
' in june 2013 , three balloons were inserted underneath jessica 's scalp by plastic surgeon rauf at leicester royal infirmary
gradually over the course of six months he injected saline into the balloons , every two weeks
as the balloons gently expanded they stretched jessica 's scalp
once they reached a certain size , with almost one and a half pints of saline inside , surgeons operated on jessica
they removed the balloons and then cut out the mole
using the excess skin created by the balloons , they were able to cover almost all of jessica 's birthmark
but the excess skin was n't quite large enough and so doctors inserted a final balloon in october last year
her parents inflated the balloon at home until it was big enough to create enough new skin to cover the last 10 per cent of jessica 's mole
in january mr rauf removed the last part of the birthmark and covered the gap with the remaining new skin
jessica , from lincoln , was born with the birthmark - a pigmented melanocytic nevus - which was partially visible under her hair on the left hand side
the condition affects just one per cent of the population and appears on the head or neck in just 15 per cent of cases
the bubbly youngster was n't phased by the mark , but doctors said it should be removed as soon as she was old enough to avoid it becoming cancerous
' if it turned cancerous they would n't be able to remove it quickly enough because it 's such a large area and it takes such a long process , ' said mrs jessica , who runs a data cabling company with husband james , 37
jessica drew inspiration from her idol jessie j when she was forced to shave all her hair off
she had the first three silicone balloons inserted in a line down the centre of her scalp in june 2013
plastic surgery specialist rauf at leicester royal infirmary filled them with saline every two weeks using a syringe
three months later - when the ' lumps ' contained almost one and a half pints - surgeons removed the skin with a mole on , and the balloons , and used her newly stretched scalp to cover it up
but the skin was n't quite big enough , and she had to have her head shaved again and a final balloon inserted in october last year , with her parents inflating it at home
a first operation to use the excess skin created by three balloons , did n't quite cover the entire mole , and so doctors inserted a fourth balloon in october last year in january after her final operation jessica was left with a full head of hair once more
it is thought the procedure has never been carried out in the uk , and has only once been used in the america the final 10 per cent of the mole - along with the balloon on the side of her head - was removed in january , and now jessica has a perfect head of growing hair
' although jessica has scars , they are quickly fading and she is looking forward to growing her hair out again , ' said her mother
' she 's been amazing throughout this whole journey , taking it all in her stride with a huge smile on her face
' it is believed the procedure has never been done on the scalp in the uk before , and only once before , in america
mr rauf of leicester royal infirmary , said : ' the successful outcome of jessica 's procedure is due to help of a wonderful team of anaesthetists , trainee surgeons , paediatric nurses , plastic surgery specialist nurses , play specialist and occupational therapists who help me make the surgical journey for the patients and their families smooth and enjoyable
' jessica and her parents were exemplary with way how they complied with all the instructions and kept smiling throughout this difficult time
