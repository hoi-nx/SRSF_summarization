a british clairvoyant warned lincoln that his life was in danger weeks before he was assassinated , a historian claims
it is thought charles colchester , a medium who was close to the first lady , told the president of the threat in the early months of 1865
lincoln was shot dead by actor booth as he watched a play in a private box at ford 's theatre , washington dc , on the night of april 14 that year

clairvoyant colchester had become close to first lady lincoln , pictured centre but while colchester may have been passing on the information as a mystic warning , it is likely the information came directly from the assassin - who was also his drinking companion
colchester 's relationship with the president has been well - document , but until now historians have not connected him with booth , professor terry alford writes in fortune 's fool , a new biography of the assassin , according to the times
the medium became known to the lincoln family after he was summoned by first lady lincoln when she was looking to communicate with her dead 11 - year - old son , willie
colchester , the illegitimate son of a duke , impressed mrs lincoln and was invited to hold a number of seances at the white house and the soldiers ' home , the president 's summer retreat
warning : lincoln , was told his life was in danger weeks before his death , it is claimed but while he became important to the first lady , it appears he was unable to convince the president of his powers , writes professor terry alford
on one occasion the president asked henry , of the smithsonian institute , to investigate how colchester was able to summon noises in different parts of a room - evidence , he claimed , of his ability to communicate with spirits
mr henry was forced to report that he was unable to find an explanation
( it was later discovered colchester had an electrical noise - maker strapped to his bicep )
his close relationship to the first lady allowed colchester to become part of the washington dc social scene
it was there he met booth and the two men became friends , writes professor terry alford
' they would go out and get drunk together , ' he told the times
in the weeks before the assassination , booth was staying at the national hotel - less than six blocks from ford 's theatre
colchester visited him there often , writes terry alford
in early 1865 booth abandoned his plan to kidnap lincoln and decided instead to assassinate him
he shared his plot with a number of trusted friends in washington dc , but it is not clear whether booth was one of them
what is known is that , in april 1865 - the month of the assassination - another friend urged the president to be mindful of his personal safety , lincoln replied : ' colchester has been telling me that '
colchester fled washington dc after being confronted by a member of the president 's inner circle following a blackmail attempt on the first lady
he died in iowa a few years later
fortune 's fool : the life of booth , will be published in british by oxford university press on may 28 .
