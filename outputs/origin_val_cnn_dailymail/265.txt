the fa will wait on referee mike dean 's report before deciding whether to take action against bruce or poyet for their touchline spat on tuesday night
mike dean 's report is due in to the fa on wednesday , meaning if action is taken against the hull city and sunderland managers it will be announced on thursday at the earliest
sunderland boss poyet has refused to apologise for the behaviour which saw him sent off during the 1 - 1 draw at the kc stadium
hull city boss bruce ( left ) and sunderland 's poyet ( right ) will find out if they will be charged this week bruce is held back by the assistant referee during his clash with poyet on the touchline things turned sour when bruce and poyet began a slanging match and had to be pulled apart poyet was dismissed for kicking over a cooler box before clashing on the touchline with bruce
the rival bosses were only kept apart by the assistant referee and both could face further sanction should the fa investigate the clash which was sparked when poyet sarcastically applauded in bruce âs face
but the uruguayan blamed mike dean for his reaction after he booked rodwell for diving
poyet said : â kicking a bottle of water is nothing serious
â i was not happy with paul mcshane ( hull city defender ) dancing like he was in the theatre , or like he âd been shot , and won a free - kick before that
â rodwell then dived and got a free - kick against him , i just want fairness
â i have no regrets whatsoever
i now have to convince the officials not to put buckets of drinks around me
â rodwell appeals for a foul but is booked for diving , a decision that led to poyet 's reaction the two managers are restrained by match officials who try desperately to keep them away from each other as the pair locked horns bruce makes sure he gets his point across by bellowing in poyet 's direction poyet 's side were lucky to escape with a point and will be fined Â£ 25,000 by the fa after six of their players were booked , including lee cattermole who picked up a two - game ban following his 10th yellow of the season
bruce , meanwhile , did not reveal what poyet had said to provoke his furious reaction
but he admitted it had been unsavoury
â i think it âs right that i keep what he said to myself , â he said
â but it was nât very pleasant
it was nât â have a nice evening , bruce â
â but i do nât know why i reacted like that
we all do stupid things but it was handbags
â i thank the assistant referee for stepping in
i âll have to buy him a beer
â i just think poyet had seen it differently about rodwell diving
but the referee got it right
â all i said to his assistant was that rodwell had dived
â these things happen in the heat of the moment
grown men acting like a couple of children
they happen in big games
let âs forget about it and go and have a glass of wine
â poyet was sent to the stands for his antics and could face further punishment after the game the 47 - year - old watches on with interest as his side searched for the equaliser at the kc stadium the result moves hull city five points clear of the relegation zone with sunderland a point behind
and bruce said : â we âre making a fist of it and i would say that is a point gained
we âre six clear of the relegation zone now if you take into account our goal difference
â we have to remember it âs our second season in the league
for sunderland they âve been there for eight
â dame nâdoye opened the scoring in the first half before rodwell levelled late on , although the ball appeared to go in via his arm
bruce said : â i did nât see it to be honest , but if rodwell has said he handled it then i suppose he did
