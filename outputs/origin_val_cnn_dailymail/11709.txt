manchester united are fourth in the table just two points behind second - placed city
they face their neighbours and defending champions on april 12 during a crucial four game spell that sees them take on aston villa , chelsea and everton
however , the manner of their victories against tottenham and liverpool in recent weeks has been ominous
robson has hailed herrera as one of the key figures in manchester united 's revival this year herrera celebrates after scoring the opening goal during their fa cup third round match with yeovil town former manchester united captain robson recognises that mata has been winning the bulk of the plaudits but admires the qualities herrera is showing
' herrera started off the season well and he âs got a lot of energy , ' robson told manutd.com
' he is always on the move , trying to close people down really quickly
he has got a lot of qualities really , it âs just getting them out of him on a consistent basis
but he has got that in his locker , maybe it âs just taken him and a few of the new signings time to adapt to the premier league
' herrera set up mata 's first goal against liverpool with an inch - perfect pass and the 25 - year - old acquisition from athletic bilbao has shown signs of being able to provide a greater tempo to manchester united 's play
' he is quite good defensively and , when i watch him , i can see he has a lot of energy and he does like to get involved ' added robson
' what i like about him is that , when people are on the ball , he is always on the move to try and receive the pass
