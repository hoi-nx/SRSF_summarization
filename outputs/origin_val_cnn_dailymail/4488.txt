oldham chairman corney believes scholes will manage the league one club ' one day ' , but admits it will be ' difficult ' to tempt him to take the vacancy at the moment
the former england and manchester united midfielder , 40 , was immediately linked with his boyhood outfit when the football league 's third youngest manager lee johnson exited sportsdirect.com park last week to join league one rivals barnsley
the romantic notion that scholes would take his first managerial position with latics appears fanciful but corney does think he could take the helm one day
oldham supporter scholes will manage the latics in the future according to corney however , oldham chairman corney was doubful scholes could commit considering his current media duties speaking on a bbc radio manchester phone - in alongside director anthony gee , who suggested that the oldham job ' may interest ' scholes ' at some point ' , corney said : ' we speak on a regular basis and scholes occasionally comes down and does training sessions
' he 's a friend of the club
we know what scholes 's all about , he 's very low key , he does n't make a big deal about things
he turns up at the games - never turns up at the directors ' box - he turns up with his two lads , flat cap down and you would n't even know he was there
' i 'd love to have him on board , ( but ) it 's difficult
again , you have to ask would oldham be the right club for somebody like scholes ? it 's not just about us wanting scholes , it 's also would it be the right thing for him ? ' i think anthony gee 's right that one day he will come and manage the club but it 's all about timing with him
' anthony gee also confirmed scholes , who now has media commitments with the likes of bt sport , had not applied for the position but that they did intend to hold talks with him in the near future
the two oldham board members also touched on the club 's controversial move to attempt to sign convicted rapist evans in january , a signing they eventually pulled out of in the face of overwhelming pressure from sponsors promising to withdraw their support , while staff members were also subjected to abusive threats
since his retirement from football the former manchester united star has taken up a role with bt sport latics had originally indicated they had no desire to acquire evans back in december , but anthony gee revealed they returned to the possibility in the new year when lee johnson told the board of directors he had had a change of heart
' we did a hell of a lot of due diligence , ' added anthony gee
' we met with the player on two or three occasions and if you remember when we were first linked with him , the manager actually said to us that he 'd rather pass
we pulled our interest immediately
' it was when the manager came to us the second time and said , ' actually , maybe i 'll go and have a chat with him ' , that we rekindled our interest which led to all the scenes that you remember in january
' if i was put on the spot and asked would i do the same thing again ? i think the truth of the matter is i probably would
' i 'm also a firm believer in the rule of law
if we do n't have the rule of law and we do n't have rehabilitation in society then i do n't know what sort of society we have
' whilst his crime was very serious there are other people out there playing football who have killed people
we 've had a similar case at oldham with lee hughes
' if i 'm asked whether i regret it ? no. do i understand how difficult it was for the fans and the community ? yes
it was hard for us as directors as well
' we always had the best interests of the club at heart , even if it 's hard to believe
