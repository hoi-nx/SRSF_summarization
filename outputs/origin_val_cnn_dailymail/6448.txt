with three international series games scheduled for the second season in succession , 2016 may see a further increase , according to the 56 - year - old nfl commissioner
speaking to king of themmqb.com on the eve of the league 's owners meeting in pheonix , goodell said : ' yeah , we âre looking at more games
' the nfl wanted to host more games in england this year , but were hampered by the rugby world cup , which sees pennyhill park - a favourite haunt of visiting nfl teams - booked up by england and wembley hosting two games during rugby union 's showpiece event
