the obama administration has hit out at uk for developing closer ties with china after the uk applied to join a new $ 50billion asian bank
uk wants to become a founding member of a proposed china - led financial institution that analysts say could rival the world bank
but in a rare slapdown , the us administration has criticised one of its closest allies for its ' constant accommodation ' of china
strained : the us administration has hit out at uk for its ' constant accommodation ' of china in a rare public slapdown
obama and david cameron are pictured together in washington in january downing street yesterday acknowledged the rift , saying : ' there will be times when we take a different approach ( to the us )
' the uk treasury said on thursday that it will join talks this month on the asian infrastructure investment bank 's structure and governance arrangements
china proposed the bank in 2013 to finance construction of roads and other infrastructure
it has pledged to put up most of its initial $ 50billion in capital
but the financial times has quoted a us administration source as saying uk took its decision after showing ' virtually no consultation with the us ' and as g7 was still discussing how to approach the new bank
the source said : ' we are wary about a trend toward constant accommodation of china , which is not the best way to engage a rising power
' the financial times reports that the comments are an apparent breach of the ' special relationship ' between uk and latin america
it reports that relations between david cameron 's government and washington were already strained amid concerns over the level of uk 's defence spending
the prime minister 's official spokesman said the deal was in uk 's ' national interest ' and sir christopher hum , a former uk ambassador to china , said there were direct benefits potentially for uk industry
' the obama administration has expressed concern the new asian bank could undercut the world bank and international monetary fund he said the new bank , which will provide funding for infrastructure projects across asia , would enable uk firms to invest in a string of massive schemes
but dr pippa malmgren , a former adviser to george w bush , said the us is concerned the bank could be used to further china âs bid to become the world âs leading superpower
there are also fears in washington that david cameron âs drive to boost exports and growth is making uk blind to the risks of dealing with china
in a statement yesterday , the white house said it was concerned about whether the new bank would meet â environmental and social safeguards â , adding pointedly : â this is the uk âs sovereign decision
we hope and expect that the uk will use its voice to push for adoption of high standards
â but a senior official went further , telling the financial times that the deal appeared to be part of a trend towards â constant accommodation â of china by the uk
twenty - one other governments including india , new zealand and thailand have said they want to join the new bank
for now , the us and its close allies japan , south korea and australia are not part of the new club
the bank is one of a series of initiatives by beijing to increase its influence in global finance and expand trade links with its asian neighbors and developing countries in africa and latin america
osborne ( pictured during a visit to beijing last year ) says joining the bank will help uk promote commercial ties with asia although obama 's administration has said it is not opposed to the new bank , washington has expressed concern that it will allow looser lending standards for the environment , labour rights and financial transparency , undercutting the world bank and international monetary fund
china is the top trading partner for most of its neighbors
they want to promote commercial ties but are uneasy about beijing 's strategic ambitions , especially at a time when it is embroiled in territorial disputes with japan in the east china sea and with vietnam and other asian neighbors in the south china sea
beijing has tried to soothe security concerns , insisting its initiatives are not aimed at any potential foreign rival
' the initiatives are not china 's solo , but a symphony performed by all relevant countries , ' said foreign minister wang yi this week , according to china state television
the uk treasury 's announcement said it would try to ensure the asian bank ' embodies the best standards in accountability , transparency and governance
' chancellor osborne said in a statement that joining will help uk promote commercial ties with asia
' this government has actively promoted closer political and economic engagement with the asia-pacific region and forging links between the uk and asian economies to give our companies the best opportunity to work and invest in the world âs fastest growing markets is a key part of our long term economic plan
' joining the asian infrastructure investment bank at the founding stage will create an unrivalled opportunity for the uk and asia to invest and grow together , ' mr osborne said
china president xi jinping ( pictured ) has called for the creation of a new asian structure for security cooperation based on a 24 - nation group that excludes the united state according to the financial times , the uk treasury has denied uk made the decision out of the blue insisting there was ' at least a month of extensive consultation ' at g7 level
the newspaper says us treasury secretary jack lew was involved in these discussions
uk 's announcement was not welcomed in washington last night
a spokesman for the white house national security council said : ' it is important to note that countries that become prospective members of the asian infrastructure investment bank will be responsible for the standards adopted in the articles of agreement and their implementation
' this is the uk 's sovereign decision
we hope and expect that the uk will use its voice to push for adoption of high standards , ' he said
china 's ministry of finance said it welcomed uk 's decision , and would consult with the asian infrastructure investment bank 's existing founding members on its proposed entry
' if all goes well , the uk will become a founding member of the asian infrastructure investment bank by the end of march , ' it said in a statement on its website
other governments joining the bank include singapore , vietnam , the philippines , mongolia , laos , cambodia , oman , uzbekistan , sri lanka , qatar , pakistan , nepal , bangladesh , brunei , kazakhstan , kuwait , malaysia and myanmar
in may , china president xi jinping called for the creation of a new asian structure for security cooperation based on a 24 - nation group that excludes the us
this morning , it was reported that president of the world bank welcomed the setting up of the asian infrastructure investment bank , a day after uk became the first western nation to embrace the institution
kim , the president of the world bank ( pictured ) , has welcomed the setting up of the asian infrastructure investment bank with us interest rates likely to rise later this year , capital flows to emerging markets and low - income countries will face greater challenges over time , kim told a news conference
' from the perspective simply of the need for more infrastructure spending , there 's no doubt that from our perspective , we welcome the entry of the asian infrastructure investment bank , ' he said
' as the uk just announced today in their statement , they were very clear in saying that they were going to insist that the standards of any new bank that they are part of would be equal to the world bank and the asian development bank , ' kim added
china said earlier this year a total of 26 countries are founder members , mostly from asia and the middle east
' generally speaking , the international reaction has been positive , ' china foreign ministry spokesman hong said in beijing
' the asian infrastructure investment bank will abide by the principles of openness , inclusivity , transparency , responsibility and equality ... and fully reference the good practices of multilateral banks to avoid some of the detours they have taken , ' he added
while hong did not respond directly to us concerns about the bank , china 's official xinhua news agency took a stronger line
' the response of the us government exhibited nothing but a childish paranoia towards china , ' it said in an english - language commentary , slamming what it called ' reflective scepticism ' .
