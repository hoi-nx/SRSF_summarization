suzanne evans is to delay publishing its manifesto for as long as possible , party leader farage revealed today
the party âs detailed pitch to voters had been expected to be set out at its spring conference in margate this weekend
but mr farage today insisted he wants to release it as â late as practicably possible â in the election campaign , which would give voters less time to challenge the party on its contents
it included pledges to improve britain by painting trains in traditional colours , deploying soldiers on the street and enforcing a dress code for taxi drivers and theatregoers
since then , the party has enjoyed a surge in support , topping the polls in the parliament elections and securing two elected mps who defected from the tories
as a result , suzanne evans has faced closer scrutiny of its policies , with splits emerging over key areas of tax , spending and social policy
now it has emerged mr farage plans to keep the party âs policy pitch to voters secret for as long as he can
he told bbc one âs sunday politics : â my view on our release of the manifesto is we should do it as late as practicably possible because i think by then people will want to see something fresh , new and positive
â bizarrely , he said he did not want to release his manifesto yet because the â general election campaign has already gone on for far too long as far as most of the public are concerned â
he added : â people are getting bored to death
every day there are all sorts of pronouncements being made by labour and the conservatives to appease all sorts of special interest groups
i think most of what âs being said is already going in one ear and out of the other

the idea we would publish a manifesto so long before a general election
â but miss suzanne evans made clear in january : â ' i relish the task of putting together the final details and presenting a sensible , radical and fully costed manifesto at our spring conference in margate
