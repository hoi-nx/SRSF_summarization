' get ready for a lot of long nights where you think you are useless , ' he said
and you have to deal with that
there are a lot of players who i worked with who are now managers who phone me up
' now i know what howard wilkinson ( his former boss at leeds ) felt like
i used to phone him a lot when i was in trouble
' as a matter of fact , every time he picked up the phone he used to say ' what 's up now ? ' ' so we are always there to give advice and we are the only people who can give advice to managers because nobody else knows what it feels like

' but i do n't know ( if it is a particularly good bunch )
' you can only be called a good manager or a great manager , like sir alex ferguson and those people , if you can hang in there for a long , long time
' but it is a good way to learn
the best way to learn is being a manager and making mistakes

' people are telling me they are all tired , people are telling me they have played 40 games and they are running about non-stop
' you actually have to stop the training because if you let them go on they would continue on another half hour
' i was asking players if they wanted to step out but no , they are not having it
' if we can take what we had this morning into tomorrow , then i will be more than happy

there will be an intensity to the game
