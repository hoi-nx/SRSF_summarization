gordon strachan would like the scotland fans to buy into his patient approach to their european championship qualifier against gibraltar - but he knows that is unlikely to happen
the scotland boss recognises the tartan army will turn up expecting plenty of goals - and quickly - against uefa 's newest members
however , gordon strachan has confidence that his players will cope with those expectations and produce a mature display against the team from the british overseas territory

speaking just before taking his players for a training session at a wet and windy hampden park , gordon strachan said : ' we do n't want to be panicking and rush into things
we will look forward and try to play forward at every occasion , but that ca n't happen all the time
' there are areas where we will have space to go and attack , there are areas where it might be harder
we will have to be patient to get the areas where we think we can work at being successful
' when asked whether he had a message for supporters to replicate that patience , the former celtic boss said : ' that would be handy if they could
' but fans come along to lose their inhibitions , shout and scream
they want to see goals
' if the weather was scorching hot , they would maybe be more patient but i do n't think it 's going to be like that
i think the fans will be wanting something to warm them up right away
' but we ca n't be sucked into trying to score a goal with the first touch of the ball
we have done a lot of work and you might at times think we are not going anywhere , but we have to be patient and try to find the weaknesses

' it was n't an easy ride , that 's for sure , ' gordon strachan said
' i have taken a lot of penalties in big games but that one was really pressurised because i did n't want to be remembered as the guy that missed a penalty against san marino
' we had some good players playing in that team and it took a corner - kick and a penalty
' gordon strachan 's side have made a positive start to the group with a draw in poland and victory over the republic of ireland putting them in a decent position , although their two main rivals for second spot - assuming germany will win group d - previously stole a march by taking points off the world champions
gordon strachan believes gibraltar , who pick their team from a population of about 30,000 , are a more difficult challenge than when they began their competitive international campaign

they have already secured their first friendly win , against malta , and also drew in estonia last year
gordon strachan said : ' in the first couple of games of the championship , the excitement was so great , but you could see in the germany game there was a bit of reality about it
the world champions only scored four goals
' four goals is definitely enough to win a game of football , that 's for sure , but that 's the improvement we have seen from the first couple of games
you get over that initial excitement of just being there and then you want to be hard to beat , and i think that 's the stage gibraltar will be at
' hull 's allan mcgregor was not present at training , although gordon strachan said earlier that he could pick any one of his three goalkeepers and ' not lose any sleep ' .
