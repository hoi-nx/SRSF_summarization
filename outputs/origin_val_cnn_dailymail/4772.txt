mr sobelman said : ' we are known for our bloody marys and so i decided to put a slider on the side
' after more than a decade at the helm , he is an expert in the burger trade and tweaked the bloody mary combination to perfect it

' the best way is to put a slice of cheese on each side of the burger which sticks everything together
' it is not the only bar to experiment with food - filled cocktails though
