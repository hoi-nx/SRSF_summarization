the bedford county sheriff 's office said monday that additional leads prompted another dig on taylor 's mountain in bedford county , but officials did n't provide details
the operation is expected to take several days
an earlier dig was conducted on the mountain in january
the sheriff 's office , the virginia state police and the montgomery police department in maryland are conducting the search for the remains of ten - year - old katherine lyon and 12 - year - old sheila lyon
12 - year - old sheila lyon ( left ) and ten - year - old katharine lyon ( right ) went missing on march 25 , 1975 , after walking to get some pizza at the wheaton in maryland and to look at the easter decorations the lyon sisters never came home after walking to the mall together in 1975
a massive search turned up nothing the girls went missing on march 25 , 1975 , after walking to get some pizza at the wheaton in maryland and to look at the easter decorations
the lyon sisters never came home , and a massive search turned up nothing
parents john and mary lyon have never been able to find out what happened to their daughters
over four decades , police have pursued numerous leads and periodically identified potential suspects
but they never charged anyone
authorities have , however , named richard allen welch sr. and his nephew , welch , as persons of interest in the case
neither man has been charged
in february it was revealed that welch , a sex offender , told investigators that he left a maryland shopping mall with two young sisters who disappeared in 1975 and later saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the girls , according to police affidavits
the washington post reported that montgomery county police , citing the ongoing investigation , declined to comment on the affidavits or how credible they find 58 - year - old lloyd welch 's recent statements
a week after the girls vanished the then - 18 - year - old welch went to wheaton ( pictured , 1975 ) and told a security guard that he had seen the sisters leave with a man in a car though volunteers searched for the sisters , they came up with nothing
detectives never found evidence of what happened to katherine lyon and sheila lyon or who was responsible ' our department and our partners in virginia remain committed to determining what happened to katherine lyon and sheila lyon , ' montgomery county police chief tom manger said in february
' we believe that there are people , including family members of dick and lloyd welch , who have information that would further this investigation
' richard welch 's wife , patricia , was charged with perjury after testifying before the grand jury in december
the affidavits released in february did not say whether any incriminating evidence has been found on taylor 's mountain in virginia
investigators have found bones on a property near taylor 's mountain that used to belong to the family of welch , according to court papers
but that may not mean much because the land contains an old cemetery with more than 30 unmarked graves
at one point during the search , detectives wrote that a dog trained to sniff decomposition ' alerted ' to areas away from the cemetery
on the day they vanished , the girls ' older brother reported seeing them at the mall , and a friend claimed to have seen them talking to an older man who was carrying a microphone and a briefcase
lloyd welch told investigators he left a maryland shopping mall with two young sisters who disappeared in 1975 and later saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the girls , according to police affidavits unsealed in febrary authorities have been searching for the remains of 12 - year - old sheila lyon and 10 - year - old katharine lyon on a remote mountain in bedford county , virginia , some 200 miles from their montgomery county , maryland , home , since september a sketch of that man , who had long hair and a mustache , was created and circulated , but it did n't lead to any arrests
one person who provided details to a police artist said the man had been ' fixated ' on the girls
welch , who worked at a traveling carnival with his then girlfriend helen craver , had been at the mall and was seen paying attention to the lyon girls , police chief thomas manger said
the filings detail for the first time how lloyd welch surfaced in the case
a week after the girls vanished the then - 18 - year - old welch went to wheaton and told a security guard that he had seen the sisters leave with a man in a car
police gave him a polygraph test which showed he was lying , according to the affidavits , which did not say whether authorities continued to look into welch
the detectives on the case in 2013 set out to learn more about welch , who had been arrested in 1977 in montgomery county in a burglary case
his mug shot from that arrest strongly resembled a sketch in the lyon sisters case that had been drawn based on a witness 's description of a man at wheaton who was staring at the girls and following them , according to the affidavits
their disappearance profoundly changed the lyon family
the girls ' father , lyon , became a victims ' advocate in montgomery county and help counsel other families who had lost loved ones police searched property in virginia ( pictured ) once owned by the family of drifter and convicted child rapist welch in 1994 , he had pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a ten - year - old girl in south carolina

the affidavits say lloyd welch told police richard welch was involved in kidnapping the girls
lloyd welch said he was dropped off near his home , and the next day he went to richard welch 's home where he saw the uncle sexually abusing one of the sisters
he said he left and never saw the girls again
shelia and katherine lyon were on spring break when they disappeared
they left their home at 11am and their mother mary lyon told them to be home by 4pm
mrs sheila lyon later said that in the quiet washington , d.c. , suburb , it was common to let children go to the shopping center alone
as the montgomery county gazette put it years later - it was a simpler time when everyone looked out for everyone else 's children
the massive investigation that followed the girls ' disappearance brought in countless tips and widespread national and local media coverage
potential clues were found , but later discounted
people were brought in for questioning , but later released without charge
