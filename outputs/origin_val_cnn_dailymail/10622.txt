arsene wenger has insisted there is no european crisis for english clubs despite a second year out of three with no representatives in the last eight of the champions league â but he does believe it is time to change the away - goals rule
arsenal and chelsea both crashed out of the competition on away goals in the first knockout stage , beaten by monaco and paris saint-germain respectively
arsene wenger , however , has long championed a change to the rule
arsenal crashed out of the champions league on away goals despite beating monaco on tuesday monaco scored three away goals at the emirates which proved to be the difference in the tie if at the end of two - legged tie the score is level , the team that has scored the most goals away from home is declared the winner
for example , monaco beat arsenal 3 - 1 away from home before losing 2 - 0 in monte carlo
with the score tied at 3 - 3 , monaco progressed courtesy of having scored on more goal on their travels
' that 's a rule that 's outdated now and should be changed , ' the arsenal boss said
' it should count maybe after extra-time
it was created in the 1960s to get teams to attack away from home
' since then football has changed and the weight of the away goals is too big today
maybe count it after extra-time like in the league cup in english
' i think the quality of premier league is high and physical demands are extreme but i 'm not in the mood to analyse too much what 's wrong with english football
i do n't think there 's a lot wrong
' arsene wenger must pick up his players ahead of saturday 's game at newcastle as the battle for a top - four finish in the premier league continues
he added : ' the mood is down and we are disappointed
the tie lasted 180 minutes and we were not cautious enough in the first 90
we know why we went out , it 's down to a dreadful defensive performance in the first leg
arsenal boss arsene wenger wants the away - goals rule changed in european competition manchester city were the third english club to be knocked out at the last - 16 stage after they lost to barcelona ' we must focus on next targets and we have to continue to improve
we are better today than four months ago
' let 's keep that attitude
there 's a fantastic spirit and great quality
let 's rectify what we did n't do well in first game and continue to improve
' we 've won 13 of the last 15 and that 's down to quality and improvement
we are not in a transfer period
ninety - five per cent of the players will still be here next season and what is important is their attitude and improvement
we are in the semi-finals of the fa cup , and in a strong fight in the premier league
we can do that straight away on saturday
' we 're on a good run
we won the game in monaco
we 're frustrated and disappointed to go out but that 's down to our home performance especially on the defensive front
we were a bit unlucky as well
if you look at shots on target by monaco in the two games they 've been quite efficient
