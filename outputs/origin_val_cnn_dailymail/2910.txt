it was only a small - sided game at the end of a session at arsenal âs london training ground , but heads were turned when teenage striker akpom , called over to join them , cut in from the left flank and curled the ball , side - footed , around the goalkeeper to score
the move echoed a former time and a former forward , as if the ghost of henry was still haunting the centre âs pitches with his trademark dribble and finish
sanchez came running over to akpom , leaping around excitedly and shouting â henry , henry , henry , henry ! â arsenal 's teenage striker akpom has been compared to club legend henry henry was akpom 's idol growing up and the youngster is keen to emulate his success akpom ( left ) , walks to training with arsenal team - mates theo walcott , olivier giroud and danny welbeck there is still a long , long way to go until the 19 - year - old gets anywhere near close to his idol henry , but nicknames tend to stick around
â one day in training with the first team i scored an henry - type goal , cutting inside and finishing , â akpom tells sportsmail
â i could see sanchez jumping , he â s an enthusiastic guy at the best of times and he âs going : â henry , henry , henry , henry ! â â the next morning he came to me and said â henry
â ' then the next morning he came to me and said â henry
â i asked : ' hold on is this my new nickname ? ' that âs how it came about and it âs stuck since then
â now the lads just call me henry or henry - i âll take that
it âs not a bad comparison to have
â he was my idol growing up
playing for the academy and watching arsenal âs first team i used to see players like henry scoring every week and it really inspired me

even if the henry comparisons are premature , there is no denying akpom is beginning to make his mark where it matters
â i âm with the senior team now in the changing room and on the training ground , â he adds
â it âs all about getting familiar with the environment and the players and getting as much game time as i can
â a lot of them are international players , a lot are england players ; calum chambers , jack wilshere , alex oxlade-chamberlain , theo walcott , danny welbeck , kieran gibbs
i look up to them
' they âve made it into the england senior team
it âs good to be around them and get good advice
â akpom is a right - footed front man but likes to drop out wide to the left flank to torment full - backs
sound familiar ? his is quick and skilful with a sharp finish
most importantly , he scores goal
for arsenal youth teams and england under 15 to under 20 level , bucketfuls of them

â he cites one of the game âs greatest goal - scorers , the brazilian ronaldo , as another idol and closer to home is aiming at the top
but , unlike the lightning runs down the left wing , he understands all of that will come slowly
â wayne rooney is another player i look up to , â he explains
â he âs the captain of the national team and that âs something i would like to try to do
â i âd love to be a captain - of england and arsenal
leading by example off the pitch and on it
it would be a dream
