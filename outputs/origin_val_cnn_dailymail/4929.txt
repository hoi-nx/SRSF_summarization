ramsey took permanent charge of qpr in february following harry redknapp 's departure qpr have lost six out of seven games since the appointment which leaves them four points adrift of safety ' no regrets at all because i know what a great coach he is , ' les ferdinand told sky sports
' it 's a gamble , any manager coming in would have been a gamble
' there 's no guarantees that anyone would have kept us in the division or anyone would have done any better than ramsey âs doing at the moment , so i âve got no regrets whatsoever
' most people say when a manager comes in you need to give him time to build his own team â ramsey has n't had that
he 's come in and done us a favour but he 's doing a job with someone else 's hand
