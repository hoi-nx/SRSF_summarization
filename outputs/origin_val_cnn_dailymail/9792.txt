putting on silly voices is just one of the things adults do to bring a smile to a baby âs face
and what âs better than helium for distorting your voice to make you sound like a friendly chipmunk ? well , for baby lincoln , the answer appears to be anything
filmed sitting on what seems to be his mother âs lap , lincoln , who appears to be from america , is joined by his uncle uncle , who holds a purple balloon
after inhaling the helium , uncle says : â lincoln , how are you ? â in a sinister high - pitched voice while looking at his nephew
reacting in shock to the sudden change in his uncle âs voice , lincoln immediately looks stunned and his bottom lip begins to tremble
as his uncle starts giggling like a chipmunk it all becomes too much for baby lincoln and he bursts into tears
so far so good : lincoln sits on what appears to be his mother 's lap while his uncle inhales helium from a purple balloon responding sympathetically , the youngster âs uncle says : â oh no , no , â but his high - pitched voice only makes things worse
eventually , lincoln is lifted away from his uncle , who laughs apologetically
helium makes your voice sound high - pitched because it is lighter than air and sound waves can travel through it faster
when inhaling helium , the type of gas molecules in the vocal tract change and increase the voice âs speed of the sound , making it squeaky
not impressed : uncle speaks to his nephew in a high - pitched voice that makes the youngster 's bottom lip tremble oh dear : baby lincoln starts crying and is swiftly lifted away from his uncle who laughs apologetically
