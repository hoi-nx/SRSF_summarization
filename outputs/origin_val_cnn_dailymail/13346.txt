two china men have been jailed for selling military intelligence , including hundreds of photos of china 's first aircraft carrier , to foreign spies , state media reported
according to the dalian daily , the two men , surnamed han and zhang , were sentenced to eight and six years in prison respectively earlier this year
the report said that han , 30 , was approached by a person claiming to be a journalist via the instant messaging app wechat
the " reporter " assigned han to work in a military base , taking photos of " sensitive areas " of a major military project with his phone in the name of news gathering
last summer , he traveled to beijing and liaoning , in china 's northeast , to take photos , including images of exhibits at a national defense technology promotion show
he later passed recordings and photos to his " employer , " the report said
" although the enemies ' tricks are cunning , they are totally preventable , " the paper said
when contacted by cnn , dalian 's public security bureau confirmed the media report was correct but declined to give further details
the other man , zhang , 23 , had sent more than 500 pictures of the liaoning aircraft carrier , named after the province where it was refitted , to a person who claimed to be an editor with a foreign magazine before being detained last august
two months earlier , zhang had quit his original job for this better - paid side job , the paper said
the paper published photographs of their " spying equipment " -- iphones , computers and cables
some internet users questioned whether it was really espionage to take photos of china 's aircraft carrier -- even former u.s. defense secretary chuck hagel visited the vessel in 2014
" i have photos of the aircraft carrier , too , " one person with the handle @ gablio posted on weibo , china 's equivalent to twitter
" when i flew from dalian to beijing two years ago , i saw the vessel clearly on the plane
countless people have photographed it
