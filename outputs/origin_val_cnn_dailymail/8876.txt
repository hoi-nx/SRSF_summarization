having won the toss south africa chose to bat first and the continued rotation of their side saw vernon philander replace the heretofore - impressive kyle abbott

as de villier âs came to the crease he was once again required to provide a rescue mission but was almost dismissed on his first delivery as he nearly gloved the ball onto the stumps

williamson committed the cardinal sin of dropping the south african captain and new zealand were made to pay as the next three balls were dispatched to the boundary rope

although martin guptill - fresh from hitting a record 237 against the west indies in fourth quarter - final - was looking uncomfortable , his captain was in full flow at the other end and reached his half - century off just 22 balls
south africa âs pace bowlers were bleeding runs so de villiers turned to his energetic spinner imran tahir and a tight first over applied a bit of pressure on the batsmen
and , brendon mccullum ( 59 ) succumbed attempting to resume clearing the ropes in the next over as he came dancing down the wicket to morkel and having failed to connect properly could only pick out steyn at mid-on
williamson then lasted just 11 balls before he bottom - edged a short morkel delivery and shattered his stumps on six
new zealand were faltering and taylor was guilty for calling for a single and selling martin guptill short as he found himself run - out for a scratchy 34

the match continued to ebb and flow with neither side taking full control of the game before the game changing moment occurred in the 32nd over
as grant elliott pushed the ball to point , corey anderson called for a run and as he was sent back de villiers missed a golden opportunity to run - out the stranded batsmen , hitting the stumps with his hand instead of the ball
a superb 103 - run fifth - wicket partnership between grant elliott and corey anderson looked to have taken new zealand to the brink of victory
however , corey anderson skied a morkel delivery to du plessis at square - leg for 58 and ronchi holed - out in the deep for eight as the tension out in the middle and in the stands stepped up another notch

morkel âs final delivery was again pulled high into the air by grant elliott but just as farhaan behardien looked set to catch it duminy ran across him as the ball dropped to the ground
steyn , battling injury , was brought on for the final over with new zealand requiring 12
and eden park erupted in euphoria as grant elliott ( 84 not out ) hit the penultimate ball for a maximum as the south african players collapsed to the ground in despair
