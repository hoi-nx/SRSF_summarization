' foiled : the year 6 pupil , pictured with her father wayne and brother kaylan ( right ) , unwittingly limped into class at st john 's c of e primary school in sandbach , cheshire , citing that she had a bad leg olivia then discovered her pe kit had already been dropped off at reception after her scaffolder father wayne , 34 , had secretly given it to a classmate 's mother who was taking them to school that day
ms olivia said : ' unfortunately she did n't have to do the extra laps but she actually really enjoyed pe and had a good lesson
but she was n't speaking to me at all - not for the rest of the night
' when she got picked up by wayne she had a face like thunder
she did n't speak to him
it was parents evening that night and all the teachers thought it was hilarious
' it was like an episode of absolutely fabulous , i call her saffy because she is so clever and sensible
when she came home she said , " mum i do not know why you think it 's so funny " which made it all the more amusing
' we could n't stop giggling when we wrote the letter
we had to search the house top to bottom for an envelope to keep the plan secret
' ms olivia , who also has a three - year - old son called kaylan , said she and her husband played the prank after olivia came downstairs no fewer than a dozen times to nag her about writing the fake letter
harsh lesson : olivia 's mother said : ' there 's no chance she 'll be doing it again in a hurry
it 's a lesson to her that she ca n't get out of things she does n't like ' she said : ' she has tried every trick in the book to get out of pe
in the run up to this she has left her kit at home , only taken one shoe to lessons , has a tummy ache , her foot hurts - the teachers know her very well
' ' she does n't like to move at all
she 'd rather sit on her i - pad or games console
it was about 10.30 pm and she was up and down the stairs , saying " please write me a note , i 'll do anything , i 'll make you a brew , i 'll clean , i 'll look after kaylan "
' i kept saying , ' you are not having a note ' and sent her back to bed
in the end when she came down again i shouted , " get me a pen and paper then "
she added : " i said ' so what 's wrong with you ? " and she told me to write she that had a bad leg
she just did n't want to move and said it was too cold
' she said that upon agreeing to say that she had a sore leg , olivia 's face lit up before she tottered off to bed none the wiser
played th part : olivia , pictured with her little brother kaylan , even walked into class with a limp so that teachers would believe her made - up injury the mother added : ' she thought she was a winner
wayne and i were literally sat there wetting ourselves writing this letter
' then i realised we 'd need an envelope so she could n't read it
it was 11pm and we were running around the house looking for an envelope
it was like we were the kids
' ms olivia then took to facebook to disclose to a few of her friends what she had done , posting a picture of the note before it went viral
she added : ' everyone was saying i was terrible and could n't believe i was going to send her with it
i ca n't believe how many people have shared it but i thought it was absolutely hilarious
' ' there 's no chance she 'll be doing it again in a hurry
it 's a lesson to her that she ca n't get out of things she does n't like
