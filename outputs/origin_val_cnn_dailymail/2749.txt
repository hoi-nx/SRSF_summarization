children who are are older when they start school may do well academically and socially in the short - term - but are more likely to abandon their studies and commit crimes as teenagers
a team of us researchers studied the impact that starting kindergarten has on children born 60 days before , and 60 days after the cut - off start date
and they found these negative outcomes are significantly more likely for children from disadvantaged backgrounds
children who are are older when they start kindergarten ( a stock image is shown ) are more likely to do well academically and socially in the short - term , but are also more likely to abandon their studies and commit crimes when they are teenagers , a new study has claimed cook , a professor in duke university âs sanford school of public policy and lead author of the study , said : â this research provides the first compelling evidence of a causal link between dropout and crime
â it supports the view that crime outcomes should be considered in evaluating school reforms
â dropouts are greatly over-represented in prison , so we know there is a strong association between dropping out and crime
â but to establish causation requires an experiment
my analysis takes advantage of nature 's experiment associated with birth date
â professor cook and songman kang of hanyang university in seoul , south korea carried out the research , published in american economic journal - applied economics
it is said to be the first study to link dropping out of school , and crime
the study compared north carolina public school students born 60 days before , and 60 days after the school cut - off date
at the time of the study , children in the state had to turn five by october 16 to be eligible to enter kindergarten that year
old - for - grade students are more likely to be convicted of a crime before age 20 , the study said
a stock image of a young drink driver is shown children typically attend kindergarten when they are five or six year 's old
previous studies have established that children born just after the school - entry cut - off date and are â old for grade , â perform better academically than their younger classmates
this has led to some parents trying to gain an academic advantage for children whose birthdays fall shortly before the cut - off date , by enrolling them later
in addition to performing better academically , professor cook 's study found old - for - grade students were one - third less likely to engage in delinquent behaviour while still in school
â up until the 16th birthday , it is all positive , â he said
â they are doing better , relative to their classmates , by every measure
' it makes sense , because they are more mature
â however , after the age of 16 , the picture shifts
the old - for - grade students are more likely to drop out and be convicted of a crime before age 20 , the study said
the explanation for the behavioural change lies in the age at which students may legally withdraw from school , which is 16 in north carolina
â if they were born before the cut - off date , they have just 19 months between their 16th birthday and graduation to be tempted to drop out , â he said
â if they were born just after and enter school later , they have 31 months , and for some of them , it is an irresistible temptation
â â it 's human nature , ' professor cook said
â for a lot of adolescents , high school is a drag
â among the old - for - grade students , the likelihood of dropping out and being convicted of a serious crime is almost three - and - half times greater for those born to an unwed mother and just over two - and - a - half times greater for those whose mothers were high school dropouts .
