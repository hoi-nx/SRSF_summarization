it was a deeply disturbing homecoming for shreya singhal , then 21
she had returned to indians from her astrophysics course at the uk âs bristol university in 2012 , when news of a series of netizens â arrests spurred by powerful politicians started making headlines
behind these arrests lurked a relatively young dark law : section 66a of the information technology act
shreya singhal decided to file a public interest litigation
a little over two years later , justice rohinton nariman of the supreme court got up from his chair after announcing , â section 66a of the information technology act ( it ) act , 2000 , is hereby struck down in its entirety
â petitioner shreya singhal and her mother manali singhal were thrilled with the ruling a packed courtroom noisily greeted the landmark judgment upholding online freedom of speech and expression
the two - judge bench headed by the son of legendary jurist fali s. nariman had struck down as â unconstitutional â and â vague â the draconian provision which gave â sweeping and unbridled power â to the police to arrest anyone for offensive posts on social networking websites or sending messages through mobile phones and tablets
for shreya singhal , daughter of supreme court lawyer manali singhal and granddaughter of delhi high court judge sunanda bhandare , a long battle against the might of the state had just ended
shock and anger â i was shocked by the arrests , including of a jadavpur university professor , for circulating a picture spoofing west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee and her party colleague mukul roy ; imprisonment of puducherry businessman ravi srinivasan for allegedly posting offensive messages on twitter about congress leader p. chidambaram âs son karti chidambaram , â she said
but the trigger for her pil was the arrest of two girls in mumbai for a critical online post about the shut - down in the city for bal thackarey âs funeral
â i got really angry
the law was blatantly being misused
the provision was extremely vague in its definition of what should go on the internet , â she said
shreya singhal âs petition raised an avalanche
eight other petitioners , including writer taslima nasreen , joined her after a year
section 66a , brought about by a defensive upa which was increasingly getting cornered and badgered on the social media , surprisingly found a friend in the incumbent government , which defended it in supreme court
no definition the court found merit in shreya singhal âs argument that the language used in section 66a is so vague that the accused would not know what the offence was , and nor would the authorities be clear on the charges
it prescribed a three - year jail term for posts which are â grossly offensive â or had a â menacing character â or e-mails which caused â annoyance â or â inconvenience â to the recipient
what is worse is that none of these expressions had been defined
this went against the principles of criminal law which require each and every term to be well - defined , leaving no scope for misinterpretation and possible misuse
â you ca nât jail anyone just like that
i am not saying you should defame anyone
but one should not be scared to post anything now as long as public order is respected , â said shreya singhal
the court noted that the vagueness could be misused by governments with an agenda
in a last ditch effort to save the provision , additional solicitor general tushar mehta had submitted that the centre was ready to amend the law and fervently pleaded against scrapping it
he said it was meant to deter people from uploading grossly offensive material which can lead to lawlessness by inciting public anger and violence
he had also assured it would be administered in a reasonable manner and would not be misused
but the court was not impressed
freedom â the section has a chilling effect on the freedom of speech and expression
the right of viewers is also infringed as it would not give them the benefit of the many shades of grey in terms of various points of view that could be viewed over the internet , â the bench said in its 122 - page judgment
shreya singhal is still in her third year of law at the delhi university , with an accomplishment even those with 30 years in practice would cherish .
