wattel chipped in for par on the 15th after duffing his fourth shot just a few feet and birdied the 17th to get within one of richie ramsay , but was unable to chip in for another birdie on the 18th to force a play - off
six players shared third place on eight under , including south african george coetzee , who had needed to win to move into the world 's top 50 and qualify for the masters
england 's tommy fleetwood could also have secured a trip to augusta with victory , but finished joint 17th after a closing 69

' my brother has supported me since i was so young
this one 's for him and angela
i know they are all back home and probably going crazy at the moment
' i 've gone through some tough times with injury but kept believing and they were at my back and said just go out there and play golf and that 's what i did today
it was so much fun out there
' asked about his triple bogey on the eighth , the former us amateur champion added : ' i just did n't execute the shot exactly as i wanted to
hit a poor chip , rolled back into a divot , did n't come out , hit it back on , two putts , easy six
it 's one of those courses that has so many holes like that
' i knew i was still in the mix and walking down nine i was still level par for my round and i knew the back nine was very scoreable
i made great putts on nine and 10 just to keep the momentum going and then i stood over a putt on the 12th and felt my putter feels absolutely great
' i said to myself just got for it , this is your time and pretty much took it by the scruff of the neck the next two holes
