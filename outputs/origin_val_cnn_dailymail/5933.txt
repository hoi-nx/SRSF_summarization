the family of an autistic boy are at loggerheads with their local school district in sherwood , oregon , which is refusing to provide a handler to oversee their son 's service dog
for the past three months john mcdonald , 6 , has attended class at middleton elementary without his autism service dog , kai , because of the impasse between the family and sherwood school district
parents jennifer and scott mcdonald 's raised $ 13,500 to purchase kai to help their son who is nonverbal and has a tendency to run away when he gets anxious
the school originally welcomed the idea of allowing a service dog in class
they replaced carpet with bare floors and paid for the autism service dogs of america to train staff to work with kai
then the district told the mcdonalds that they required a dog handler be to present at all times and that under the americans with disabilities act they would have to pay
' i guess i was naive
i thought - it 's a service dog , he 's allowed to go in public places
he 's mandated that he can go with john anywhere , ' john mcdonald told kgw
' it never occurred to me that it would come up to something like this the family does n't believe a handler is necessary and say the district is misinterpreting the regulations
they filed a federal discrimination complaint with the department of justice in december
the family 's attorneys also point to a recent court case in florida where a judge ruled that a service dog is no different than helping a blind child deploy a cane , reports the oregonian
instead jeremiah patterson principal jeremiah patterson told jennifer that the district is standing by its decision that the family must provide a dog 's handler for kai john mcdonald , 6 , has autism and so his parent 's raised $ 13,500 to train kai , a service dog who helps him to remain calm and safe jennifer mcdonald says her son is being discriminated against and that the americans with disabilities act states that the school should pay for a dig handler because it is they who claim it is necessary the judge ruled , ' the ( florida ) district 's failure to provide an employee to assist the child with the dog 's routine care amounted to a failure to accommodate
' the americans department of justice also issued a statement in the case , saying the school district 's failure to make reasonable accommodations to facilities and practices was discriminatory
the family are waiting for a legal verdict , but said that time is also critical as the longer the boy and dog are apart , the more their bond deteriorates
on wednesday morning , jennifer mcdonald took her son and kai to class in the hope that school staff would take kai 's leash and lead them inside
instead jeremiah patterson principal jeremiah patterson told jennifer that the district is standing by its decision that the family must provide the dog 's handler
' the district communicated to the parents that , under the provisions of the americans with disabilities act , the dog is welcome in the classroom as long as either a parent or someone the parents arrange is in the classroom to supervise and care for the dog , ' said the school in a statement on wednesday
' however , the request of the parents that the district provide supervision and care for the dog involves expenditure of public funds and the assignment of additional staff
these are of great concern to the district , acting as a steward of public funds
