everyone from kim kardashian and margot robbie to rosamund pike and cheryl fernandez-versini have chopped off their long locks recently , making shorter hair a bona fide trend
but the rise in these shorter haircuts is n't just down to their flattering face - framing effects
according to the sunday times , the growing popularity of shorter haircuts is also sign of economic recovery , since they require more frequent trips to the salon and are therefore more pricey to maintain
shorter haircuts , like cheryl fernandez-versini 's new bob ( right ) , are an indication that the economy is in recovery rosamund pike wore a longer style in gone girl ( left ) but recently she went for the chop ( right , in february ) celebrity hairdresser phillips , whose clients have included serena williams and jamie oliver , told the newspaper that he believes shorter hairdos are a sure sign that the economy is bouncing back
he said : ' products are flying off the shelf , more than they used to even a few months ago
' and it 's not just the fact that shorter styles require more sprays and gels
the upkeep of a lob ( long bob ) or pixie crop is also time - consuming , with some women having to visit the salon every four to six weeks to maintain the look
margot robbie went from one dramatic hairstyle ( left , in march 2014 ) to another ( right , in february 2015 ) jourdan dunn ( left , in july 2014 ) made waves when she got her chin - length lob ( right , in february 2015 ) kristen stewart transformed her long auburn locks ( left , in may 2014 ) to an equally daring short style ( right , in february 2015 ) by contrast , women with longer hair can leave it a few months before going in to top up their trims
' with short hair you need to keep it in shape , ' explained mr phillips
' with long hair , a lot of women tend to leave it months on end
' cheryl fernandez-versini , who is the face of l'oreal , debuted her new layered bob just last week on the graham norton show
and aussie actress margot robbie chose the oscars to show off her new shorter blonde look
a-list trends may not be the best indication of a pattern in the real world , but according to hairdresser foster , who owns foster hair & beauty in london 's shoreditch neighbourhood , non-famous women are also following suit
sienna miller traded in her hippie - chic long waves ( left , in march 2014 ) for a side - swept lob ( right , in january ) scarlett johansson had longer locks in march 2014 ( left )
but now , she has a very edgy pixie cut ( right , february ) ' girls are going shorter , ' he told the mailonline , adding that his salon charges about Â£ 48 for a bob , with women tending to come in every six weeks to maintain the style
but mr foster feels that the trend is more a sign of modernity than of economic change , since women visit salons even during a recession because they see it as a way of treating themselves
in any case , he says he 's definitely a fan of the new it - style
he said : ' it used to be that girls had long hair and men had short
' finally it 's 2015 and things have shifted - and i think that 's very exciting
' it 's not just hair that gets shorter during a recovery - rising hemlines are also an indication that the economy is on the up
and judging by this year 's london fashion week shows , where labels including topshop , julien macdonald and giles showcased leg - baring a-line minis , it 's a trend that is here to stay .
