loncar , 55 , won a long legal battle against being returned to croatia to serve four years in prison for attempted murder a man who shot his dying wife 14 times as she was hanging from a noose can continue to live freely in uk â after judges refused to extradite him
loncar , 55 , has won a long legal battle against being returned to croatia to serve four years in prison for attempted murder , despite committing further crimes , including an assault , while living in london
he earlier won asylum after complaining he had to flee croatia because of anti-serb discrimination â and his lawyers argued locals would persecute him over the shooting
last week âs high court ruling is a sharp reminder that while the government talks of ejecting foreign criminals , in practice the criminals routinely win the right to stay here
loncar , who has been on benefits and had a drink problem since arriving in uk with his two sons in 1999 , made the extraordinary defence that he was not aiming at his wife when he fired repeatedly from a few yards away
in any case , his lawyers claimed , she died as a result of hanging herself , not because of the 14 bullets he â accidentally â fired into her defenceless body
a croatia court which heard the case in his absence rejected his defence , sentenced him to four years in prison , and ten years ago the country formally issued an international arrest warrant and requested his extradition from uk
his lawyers first successfully fought against the extradition on human rights grounds , arguing that he had a new serbian â partner â in uk â who actually lives a hundred miles away â and that he now had grandchildren in london
and last week uk judges finished off the extradition bid for ever , giving loncar the right to remain free here , after ruling it â oppressive â to send him back to prison in croatia after so long
he was also commended for raising his children alone after shooting his wife
speaking in broken england to the daily mail last night at his housing association flat close to fashionable camden in london , loncar said he had every right to remain in uk , adding : â croatia is dangerous â they still want me there
â the case began in 1994 , amid the chaos of the balkan wars , when loncar , an ethnic serbian and former soldier in the yugoslavian army , lived with his wife mirjana and two sons in the village of ostrovo
the area was declared part of a serbian republic but was also claimed by croatia
uk court documents note : â after a quarrel with his wife mirjana , she went out of the house , stood on a ladder , took a rope and indicated she intended to kill herself
as she stood from the ladder and the noose tightened around her neck and rendered her unconscious , the defendant fired a number of bullets into her body
â the cause of death was determined to be by strangulation but was accelerated by the injuries inflicted from the defendant âs gun
the defendant was charged with murder
â the subsequent trial â by a serbian court â heard that loncar had fired 14 shots from his handgun â causing a number of injuries â
last week , uk judges finished off the extradition bid for ever , giving loncar the right to remain free in the uk , by ruling in the high court ( pictured ) that it would be â oppressive â to send him back to prison in croatia he told the court â that when he saw that his wife had jumped off the ladder , he took the gun and ammunition out of the holster he had under his arm and fired the gun from three to four metres away , but did not know in which direction
â after a single pathologist claimed mrs loncar had already died of strangulation before being shot , he was initially cleared of murder
in 1999 he then flew to england with his children and successfully claimed asylum , saying that his ethnic serbian children were discriminated against by croatia at school â but also complaining of â local antipathy resulting from the death of his wife â
while he began a life on benefits here , croatia âs supreme court in 2000 ordered a retrial , with loncar âs village now a part of croatia , and the following year he was convicted in his absence of attempted murder
four doctors said mrs loncar was still alive when her husband shot her
he was given a four - year prison sentence on the grounds that he â had an intention to kill â
croatia , a member of the european union , some years later sought loncar âs extradition , and in 2006 uk police arrested him
a uk court swiftly rejected the request , noting with sympathy that he had to bring up his children alone after shooting his wife
but in 2014 he was arrested again , and although he was immediately freed on bail the case was sent to the high court in london
last week âs high court judgment in loncar âs favour , by judges lord justice aiken and mrs justice popplewell , the conclusion of the long legal battle , noted : â the offence for which the extradition of mr loncar is sought is undoubtedly a very serious one
moreover , mr loncar has not led a blameless life as a uk citizen
â he has a caution for theft in 2012 and a conviction for common assault in 2013
nevertheless we have reached the firm conclusion that it would be oppressive to extradite mr loncar by reason of the passage of time
â the ruling was also sharply critical of the croatia legal system , and observed that he had served a year in prison before being initially cleared almost 20 years ago
and in reference to the human rights act âs â right to a family life â clause , judges said loncar had â been in a relationship with the same partner since prior to 2006 , although they do not live together â
far from living together , the daily mail has discovered that â partner â helping provide him with a â family life â to maintain here is an ethnic serbian born in uk and living 100 miles from him in leicester .
