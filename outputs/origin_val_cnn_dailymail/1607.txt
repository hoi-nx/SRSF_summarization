an indiana lawmaker has admitted he had ' poor judgement ' after he was named as the author of graphic texts to weiner 's former sexting partner carlos danger under the name ' b * * * h boy '
rep moed issued an apology after allegedly sending nude photographs of himself and gifts to leathers , who was tied to a 2013 sexting scandal involving the former new york congressman and mayoral candidate
moed , 31 , is believed to have communicated under the twitter account b * tchboy4you , which got in touch with the adult film actress who said she was looking for a ' slave ' to ' financially dominate '
the website shows the alleged moed account sending a picture of a naked man and saying he had sex with him several times
content from conversations reported on the website has not been verified
moed kept his communication with leathers anonymous by never using his actual email , but his identity was revealed when his name appeared on a gift he sent leathers from his amazon account - a fetish fantasy series pink leash & collar
another receipt also shows a purchase for steve madden heels for the evansville , indiana , resident
the alleged private twitter conversations between moed and leathers show the democrat referencing weiner 's scandal , saying it got the actress ' a lot of attention probably good and bad
' messages also show the man thought to be moed offering to put his sexting partner up in the ' nicest hotel downtown ' in indianapolis , where the cheapest rooms start at $ 200 a night
moed pictured with his fiancee rachel , who he met at butler university
the pair are set to marry in september in a statement to the media yesterday , moed said he was ' truly sorry i have hurt the ones i love most with my poor judgment
i am committed to rebuilding trust with my family and my community
... i apologize to my constituents and to everyone i have let down
' it comes as he is set to be married this september
moed did not directly address the sexting allegations , though his apology followed thedirty.com report that identified him as the sexting partner of leathers
the same site released more alleged graphic sexts they claim came from moed late tuesday night
in an interview with the post last week , leathers spoke about moed , who had not yet been named
' is he displaying poor judgment by sexting me of all people ? obviously , ' she said
she said that the lawmaker was ' into some really freaky stuff
he wanted to be forced to wear a french maid outfit and clean my house while i degraded him
he wanted to be tied up and left in a closet to watch me have sex with my boyfriend
' the pair never met in person despite conversations that seem to be arranging meet ups , according to the post
leathers said that the politician was displaying ' poor judgement ' by sexting her , a phrase later echoed by moed himself other alleged leaked conversations show the alleged moed account hoping to paint the porn star 's toenails on valentine 's day or texting leather when he was on his way to a funeral
the b * tch boy twitter account is no longer visible on the social media site
indiana republican house speaker brian bosma was briefed by staff on the reports tuesday and called the matter ' an unfortunate situation ' according to a house spokeswoman , the indianapolis star reported
moed is serving his second term in the house and is a former house staffer
according to his official site , he is ' a graduate of butler university and homeowner in garfield park , moed was first elected to the house on nov. 6 , 2012 , with a goal of putting people and solutions first
' the lawmaker could not be reached for comment beyond what was in his statement
a spokesman for house democrats declined to comment
leathers also has yet to comment following moed 's statement
in december she posted a message she replied to a question from moed 's alleged twitter account ' who 's your next politician to seduce ? ' with the answer ' all of them '
weiner 's sexting scandal in 2013 is thought to have sunk his bid for new york city mayor
he resigned from congress after a similar incident in 2011
