a new app has been developed by u.s. customs and border protection that will enable users to skip the long lines at passport control when they return from traveling abroad
the mobile passport app for ios and android devices allows travelers to enter and submit their passport and customs declaration information using their smartphone or tablet instead of filling out traditional paper forms
on tuesday miami international airport became the second airport in the country to offer the new customs mobile app after an earlier successful trial at hartsfield â jackson atlanta international airport
after downloading the app , qualified travelers are prompted to set up a profile using information contained in their passport
the app also allows families traveling together to create multiple profiles
once the profile is complete , travelers can use mobile passport to answer standard customs declaration questions , submit their information electronically upon landing , and take advantage of dedicated lanes for mobile passport users
