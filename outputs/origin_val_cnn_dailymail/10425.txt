motorists in essex have been left bemused by ' britain 's most pointless lane ' - a bizarre road layout which is not even long enough for the buses it was built for
residents in north stifford , essex , say the ' pointless ' bus lane on high road - which at 50ft long is not big enough for a double - decker - should never have been built
the quirk in the road means cars and vans are forced off a stretch of straight road and onto a narrow ' chicane - like ' bend in order to avoid breaking the law
residents in north stifford , essex , are asking why the ' pointless ' bus lane on high road ( pictured ) which is just 50ft long and is not long enough for a double - decker bus , was built
they claim it is a ' hazard ' every week thousands of drivers have to make the awkward manoeuvre despite only a handful of buses being timetabled to come along the route each day
following a series of accidents , the lane has now been branded a ' hazard ' with motorists questioning what its purpose is
taylor , 24 , a hairdresser from nearby grays , spotted the strange road layout when she was driving at the weekend
she said : ' it really is bizarre
i drove through it on the way to my mum 's house
' i found it so strange that i actually had to turn back and have another look to make sure i was not seeing things
the quirk in the road means cars are forced onto a narrow ' chicane - like ' bend in order to avoid the lane ' the bus lane is so short that it is pointless and i nearly bashed the alloys on my audi when i went around the traffic islands
' people living near to road say there have been a series of accidents which they believe have been caused by cars struggling to get through the narrow layout as they avoid the bus lane
miss taylor added : ' i understand why we need bus lanes and i think they are a good idea normally but this has to be the most pointless one in the country
following a series of accidents the lane has been branded a ' hazard ' by motorists who use it every day ' i have shown pictures of it to my friends and they were all laughing and wondering what on earth its there for
' another driver , who asked not to be named , said : ' there is no obvious reason why it is here
' it 's very narrow so i assume the highways bosses think it is slowing cars down but it 's on a 30mph stretch of road here so it 's not as if motorists are driving fast along here
' i think it 's more likely to cause accidents rather than prevent them
' the bus drivers must find it very amusing as well
' a thurrock council spokesman said : ' at the time the bus lane was put in â in 2007 â the north stifford village was suffering from hgvs using high road as a short cut to and from the nearby a13 and especially when the queen elizabeth ii bridge and m25 southbound was jammed
' high road had and still has safety speed restricting tables across the road width and it also has a number of aging houses close to the road , this lead to residents suffering noise , dirt and major vibration problems
' the installation of a bus gate of this type has effectively reduced hgv traffic while still allowing public transport access to and through the village
' the council has received no complaints from villagers about this bus gate in recent years
' thousands of drivers have to make the awkward manoeuvre despite only a handful of buses being timetabled
