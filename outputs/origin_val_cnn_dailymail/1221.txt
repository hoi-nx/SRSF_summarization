have i said too much ? by carole does carole âs name sound vaguely familiar ? it is probably because you saw her in the model agency , channel 4 âs 2011 fly - on - the - wall documentary series about premier , which she founded in 1981
her colleagues â affectionate nickname for her was â the witch â
fag in hand , with a voice like a corncrake , a vocabulary that would make a navvy blush and a skin tanned to the texture of a prada handbag , she made ab fab âs patsy and edina look like maiden aunts
and her new autobiography confirms that the real world of high fashion is more outrageous than any tv drama
supermodel , linda evangelista ( pictured ) , was one of the internationally renowned models on premier 's books in the eighties as a teenager in the swinging sixties , carol had a brief career as a lucie clayton model , but gave it up because she felt self - conscious in front of the camera
at 19 , she took up with an unsuitable boyfriend ( she admits to a weakness for handsome bad boys ) and became pregnant with her daughter simone
having met a more suitable chap , she married him and landed her dream job as a booker at her former model agency , lucie clayton
the marriage did nât last , but the job did
leaving her daughter in kent with her parents ( â i did nât get to see much of my poor little simone at that time â ) , carole flung herself into a bohemian world of models , rock stars and endless wild parties
just before christmas 1981 , bobtons , the king âs road agency where she had been working , went bust , leaving â about 20 worry - faced models currently without representation â
ten days later , with Â£ 10,000 loaned by her brothers , carole signed up the bobtons girls and premier was born
a week after that , eileen ford , the tough doyennne of the new york modelling world , swept into the office to take a look at the new upstart agency , and suggested they do business
â it was like meeting maggie thatcher â , carole recalls
â her hair was honey - blonde and stiff and she was very straight - talking
we were officially on our way
â the eighties saw the rise of the supermodel , and , with linda evangelista and naomi campbell on its books , premier was â really rocking â
in 1990 , after evangelista , christy turlington , naomi campbell , cindy crawford and tatjana patitz appeared together on the cover of british vogue , premier brokered the deal for the models to appear in george michael âs â freedom â video , in which they lip - synched the lyrics
it was nât all glamour , though
â those top girls could be difficult â , carole recalls
â they liked to test people to see if they could magic up whatever crazy request they might have that day / hour / second
i saw it as a challenge
â the list of â challenges â posed by her supermodels ranged from the truly bizarre , including peremptory demands for sex toys , llama curry and an urgent supply of â special green candles from tibet that were something to do with a witch doctor that had special energy â , to the mundane : persuading them to get out of bed , or trying to ensure they were no more than three hours late for their auditions
the more you read , the more nightmarish the task of dealing with these highly - strung freaks of beauty sounds
but even after so many years , carole still seems captivated by the excitement of finding the next new face
â when they âre really special
they âre like thoroughbred horses , â she writes
â they sort of quiver
â she claims not to believe in regret : â but i âd say turning down kate moss was probably the closest i came to one
â the future supermodel came to the premier offices â and i stupidly said : â no , she âs too short for me , â and off she trotted
i know , shoot me now ! â she is unrepentant about the hedonistic excesses of the nineties when , as she puts it , â the industry was full of nutters â , remarking cheerily that â it âs a very good job camera - phones were nât around â
and her views on the size zero debate are trenchant : â why does modelling have such a bad rep ? i think
it âs probably because there are so many overweight people in this country
it âs like we want to mollycoddle anyone who is nât thin
â have i said too much ? is nât an easy read â and not just because of carole âs abrasive views and attention - deficit prose style , which reads as though she had dictated her book in 30 - second bursts between phone calls
still , in a world of elaborate artifice , there is something rather refreshing about someone who simply does nât care that her nickname is â the witch â
you might not like her by the end of this book , but you ca nât help admiring her â just a bit .
