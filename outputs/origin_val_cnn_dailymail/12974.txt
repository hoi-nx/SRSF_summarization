they 're some of the toughest athletes on the planet , saying goodbye to loved ones for almost a year , as they traverse the globe 's oceans
hardened volvo ocean race sailors must sleep in four - hour shifts , and survive on little more than freeze dried food and chocolate bars , if they hope to win the event
the prestigious competition kicked off from alicante , spain , in october last year , and will finish nine months later in gothenberg , sweden
abu dhabi ocean racing skipper ian walker , spoke about the journey so far
this is the 45 - year - old briton 's third volvo ocean race
" as the leading offshore race -- and the one that is most vulnerable to nature and synonymous with danger -- it could be described as the ' everest of sailing
' " " we trained for six months , covering 16,000 sea miles
as a team , we usually do three weeks on the boat , one week off
when not offshore , we train six - days - a - week in the gym
" " everybody has four hours on deck , followed by four hours off when you eat and sleep
on the off - watch , you still have to get on deck and help for any sail changes , so it is quite disturbed
" " mainly freeze dried food with some savory and sweet treats like beef jerky , dried fruits , one chocolate bar per day , and nuts
" " i 'm the skipper , so overall in charge of safety and performance
i 'm involved with all strategic decisions with my navigator , simon fisher , and i run one of the watches when on deck
onshore , i 'm also busy with media duties and management of our 15 shore team members
" " it can be an emotional roller coaster and it can be tough not to take things personally if they do n't go well
at sea , emotions can range from frustration , boredom , elation , being scared , loneliness ... it is important to try to keep a level head at all times -- especially if you are the skipper ! " " i have great respect for the ocean
it will always win in the end so you must respect it
i am also saddened by all the man - made debris we see in the ocean as we sail round the world
" " a professional sailor with a fierce determination to win
someone who is prepared to put the needs of the team above his own , and who is prepared to commit over 12 months of his life to being away from normal life
