you would be pressed to find a designer who appealed to the imagination as much as mcqueen
a favorite with a-listers and fashion editors alike , he was renowned for his gothic sensibilities , innovative textiles ( think shells , horns and hair ) and highly conceptual runway shows , as well as his bad boy antics behind the scenes
( along with the usual drinks , drugs and parties , he once claimed to have stitched profanities into the lining of a jacket for prince charles
) five years after his death , interest in the designer has n't waned , least of all in his home town of london , where , starting this month , he 's being commemorated with an extensive , expensive retrospective at the v&a
mcqueen : savage beauty , a re-staging of the 2011 exhibition at new york 's met , summarizes and contextualizes mcqueen 's 18 - year career through an elaborate display of 244 garments and accessories
" savage beauty at the v&a is the largest and most ambitious fashion exhibition the museum has ever staged , " said curator claire wilcox at a press preview
the v&a has already sold 70,000 advanced tickets , and extended the exhibition by two weeks to meet demand
at the met , savage beauty attracted over 660,000 visitors by the end of its four - month run , making it one of the museum 's top 10 exhibitions of all time , up there with a king tut stop in 1978 and a mona lisa loan in 1963
bringing savage beauty to london can be seen as a " homecoming , " as it was described by v&a director roth at the press preview , if not an act of repatriation
the son of cab driver and a school teacher , mcqueen grew up in london 's east end
after dropping out of school at 16 , he honed his tailoring skills on savile row , graduated with an ma in fashion design from the city 's prestigious central saint martins college , and used the v&a 's archives to research his collections
he once said of london : " it 's where my heart is , and where i get my inspiration
" that love was largely reciprocated
in 2011 , thousands of british devotees petitioned to have savage beauty brought to london after its spectacular new york debut
fashion journalist melanie rickey was one of the most vocal proponents
a longtime fan , she has coauthored the upcoming release inferno : mcqueen ( laurence king ) , a coffee table book of interviews and images from photographer kent baker , which documents march 1996 collection dante
" i was agitated because ( savage beauty ) really is meant to be in his hometown , " rickey says
" everything about him is london , so to not have it in london would have been a crime
" along with hounding the brand 's corporate honchos and the v&a itself , rickey started an online petition to have the exhibition brought to the city , and instigated the twitter hashtag # bringmcqueenexhibitionhome
" it 's like the ( elgin ) marbles : they 're probably a lot more powerful in greece than they are sitting in the british museum
" ultimately , such advocacy may have been unnecessary
according to bethune , senior exhibition research assistant for savage beauty , it had been roth 's ambition to bring the exhibition to london since he assumed the directorship in september 2011
the v&a exhibition , which was announced last april , even begins with a newly added london gallery dedicated to mcqueen 's roots in the city and his early shows
curators called on sam gainsbury , who produced all of mcqueen 's shows from 1996 on , to act as the exhibition 's creative director and bring mcqueen 's pieces to life
" a lot of ( mcqueen 's ) colleagues say he started his collections with the concept of a show , " bethune says
" he always wanted people to have a strong reaction to what he was going
" the most theatrical highlights include the romantic primitivism gallery , covered with fake bones like an ossuary , and a blacked - out room where a kate moss hologram floats in a diaphanous dress , trapped in a glass pyramid
the room - sized cabinet of curiosities has 27 screens showing moments of his most imaginative runway shows : women walk on water , a model 's gown is spray - painted by robotic arms , a church is converted into a catwalk
but bethune believes the real draw will be the groundbreaking pieces made from unconventional materials , which blur the line between fashion and art. fairytale gowns feature throughout and there 's a whole section dedicated to mcqueen 's tailoring skills , but it 's the garments made from razor clam shells , pheasant feathers , and synthetic hair ; or embellished with impala horns and baby crocodile heads that really standout
the accessories -- extravagant headpieces , swarovski mesh chain mail , impossible shoes -- seem like sculptures
" mcqueen was an artist whose medium of expression was fashion , " she says
" he absolutely changed the way we look at fashion
" mcqueen : savage beauty runs from march 14 - august 2 , 2015 at the v&a in london
