a pair of cheetah cubs were taught a lesson on how to catch a quick lunch as they watched their mother stalk and take down an antelope in just 15 seconds
the mother was leading her children through the masai mara national park in southern kenya when she spotted an isolated impala in the distance
the cheetah , which can accelerate to speeds of 60mph in mere seconds , got itself into position before bursting into action and giving chase
the chase is on : the cheetah , which can accelerate to speeds of 60mph in just seconds , got itself into position before bursting into action fight to the death : a cheetah locks on to the next of an isolated impala as she tried to catch dinner for her and her two cubs on the prowl : the mother cheetah hides in the savannah as it prepares to strike , picking the best moment to charge at its prey stalking : the cheetah got its two cubs to hang back as she approached the impale in the masai mara national park in kenya the impala stood no chance , with the big cat catching the animal in just 15 seconds - barely enough time for the cheetah cubs to realise what they were watching
predator and prey were seen grappling with each other for around three minutes , but before long the impala stopped putting up a fight and collapsed
the cubs had hidden out of sight as their mother went hunting but were called out shortly after the brutal battle came to a close so the family could tuck into dinner together
the small cheetahs may appear cute but they are actually particularly ferocious , as was seen as they tore apart the carcass of the impala while their mother rested following her fight
the stunning pictures were taken by photographer massimo mei , 53 , who was on a trip to the african country
big cat : the impala stood no chance , with the cheetah catching the animal in just 15 seconds as the cubs watched intently death grip : the impala uses up what energy it has left in a desperate attempt to escape the clutches of the cheetag predator and prey : the cheetah and impala do battle as the antelope tries to wriggle free from the big cat 's vice grip gotcha : but the antelope can not put up enough of a fight and it is soon dragged to the ground with fatal injuries dinner time ! after killing the impala , the mother cheetah calls over her cubs so the family can tuck into their dinner together italian mr massimo mei , from rome , said : ' when the impala was caught we moved fast - closer to the action and found the cheetah clamping it
' it was like a dance of death time moved slowly keeping with the breath of the impala getting slower and slower
' the chase went on for just 15 seconds but took about three minutes for the impala to give up its struggle
' the mother of four cubs is well known in the park - her name is malaika , or ' angel ' in swahili
' malaika tried to pull the impala into the shadows but it was too heavy , so decided to prepare the meal for the cubs where it was
' when ready she called the cubs over
when they arrived and began feeding it made me forget the agony of the scene i witnessed
' thanks mum : one of the cute but ferocious cubs licks its lips while the other devours the impala 's carcass tucking in : as their mother rests after the short but strenuous battle , the young cheetah cubs get their fill feast : after getting her breath back , the cubs ' mother returns to get her dinner , dragging the impala 's body away from her child family dinner : the stunning pictures were taken by photographer massimo mei , 53 , who was on a trip to the african country full up : a pair of cheetah cubs got a lesson in how to catch their lunch from their mother who stalked and took down an antelope in just 15 seconds
