the year was 1902 and the rich of london lived in peace and prosperity in a city which was the financial centre of the world
but just yards from where the upper classes of the capital resided in opulence , the poor scratched an existence in chronic misery in east end slums
disguised as a stranded sailor , american journalist jack london took to the streets of whitechapel to document the struggles of london 's destitute , in what is believed to be the earliest contemporary account of life on the city âs streets
he wrote people of the abyss ( 1903 ) based on his first - hand account of living in the east end for several months the previous year , sometimes staying in workhouses or sleeping on the streets
in eighty - six days he gathered an enormous amount of material , read hundreds of books and thousands of pamphlets , newpapers , and parliamentary reports , composed his book , typed it all out , took two - thirds of the photographs with his own camera
the conditions he experienced and wrote about were the same as those endured by an estimated 500,000 of the contemporary london poor
now the seminal work has been republished as handbound box set

i had had nothing to eat all night , and i was weak and faint , while the smell of the soiled clothes and unwashed bodies , steaming from pent animal heat , and blocked solidly about me , nearly turned my stomach
so tightly were we packed , that a number of the men took advantage of the opportunity and went soundly asleep standing up ' the salvations army barracks near the surrey theatre
london said : this is the breakfast : two slices of bread , one small piece of bread with raisins in it and called â cake , â a wafer of cheese , and a mug of â water bewitched
â numbers of the men had been waiting since five oâclock for it , while all of us had waited at least four hours ; and in addition , we had been herded like swine , packed like sardines , and treated like curs , and been preached at , and sung to , and prayed for ' ' a tow-relay system lodging ' : ' there are many kinds of doss - houses , but in one thing they are all alike , from the filthy little ones to the monster big ones paying five per cent
and blatantly lauded by smug middle - class men who know but one thing about them , and that one thing is their uninhabitablenes ' , london writes ' the municipal dwellings ' : ' i stood , yesterday , in a room in one of the â municipal dwellings , â not far from leman street
