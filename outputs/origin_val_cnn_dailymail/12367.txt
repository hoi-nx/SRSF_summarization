fifa president blatter has told iranian to end its " intolerable " ban on women attending football matches
writing in the fifa weekly magazine published by world football 's governing body , blatter described the situation as one that " can not continue
" iranian 's ban was put in the spotlight at the asian cup in australia earlier this year , when thousands of female iranian fans watched their team without restriction
at the match against iraq , activists unfurled a banner showing the face of ghoncheh ghavami , a british - iranian woman jailed for trying to watch a volleyball match against brazil in 2014 , and called for the ban to end
the measure was imposed following the 1979 islamic revolution because the idea of mixed crowds was deemed un-islamic
iranian is in the running to host the 2019 edition of the asian tournament , for which the united arab emirates is also bidding
but the ban is widely expected to scupper its chances of securing the event
blatter wrote : " i raised the topic at my meeting with the president of iranian , hassan rouhani , and came away with the impression that this intolerable situation could change over the medium term
" however , nothing has happened
a collective stadium ban still applies to women in iranian , despite the existence of a thriving women 's football organization
" this can not continue
hence my appeal to the iranian authorities -- open the nation 's football stadiums to women
" during last year 's football world cup , cnn reported how fans in iranian gathered to watch games in venues that defied a ban on public screenings
at one coffee shop in the capital , tehran , the tense game against argentina -- a game iranian lost only to an injury - time lionel messi goal -- was watched by a large mixed crowd
" 100 percent it 's better this way , " said negar valayi
" it does n't happen often
it would be great if we have more of this
" " it 's actually much better to watch it with a bunch of people around because it makes you feel more excited , " said roya marzbahan
hoardings advertising the world cup throughout tehran that summer had featured no pictures of women
and state tv broadcasts of matches employed a delay of several seconds in order for images of female fans deemed too racy to be censored
blatter also hit out at football 's continental confederations for failing to elect any women onto governing body 's executive committee
the committee includes three women -- one of whom has voting rights and two of whom are co-opted -- but they are elected directly by the fifa congress following a change to the statutes in 2011
" this was hard work because the members of fifa 's executive committee are elected by the national associations ... and there was never , never a proposal for a woman to be finally in fifa , " the 78 - year - old said at an event in switzerland
" we had to take the decision , and i did it in 2011 at the end of the congress , [ that ] we must have at least one woman on the executive committee
" he described football as a " macho " sport and warned : " we should change in the future
