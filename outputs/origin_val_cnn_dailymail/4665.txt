in a genetic first , scientists have sequenced the largest ever set of human genomes from a single population
the epic undertaking involved sequencing the dna of 2,636 icelandic and comparing them with the partial sequences of another 104,000
among several key finds , the data set suggests that the ' father of humanity ' - our most recent common male ancestor - lived between 174,000 and 321,000 years ago
the epic undertaking involved sequencing the dna of 2,636 icelandic and comparing them with the partial sequences of another 104,000 revealing insights into human evolution scientists see icelandic as a goldmine for doing genetics research
the country was founded by a small group of settlers from europe arriving about 1,100 years ago and it remained isolated for the next thousand years
because the population in icelandic has very little genetic diversity , scientists can find genetic variants that raise the chance of disease more easily
icelandic also has strong genealogical record , as a result of well - preserved historical documents
this date range , based on a calculation of human mutation rates , contradicts earlier findings that claim the father of all humans lived around 340,000 years ago
scientists now estimate his age to be 239,000 years old â a date closer to humanity 's most common female ancestor who is believed to have lived 200,000 years ago
as well as evolutionary insights , scientists say the dataset will help them discover ' mutant genes ' that naturally protect a rare group of people from certain diseases
so far , the work has provided promising results helping identify 20 million genetic variants among the icelandic population
among these variations , scientists at reykjavik - based decode have already found genes that increase the risks of alzheimer 's disease , liver and thyroid problems
' this work is a demonstration of the unique power sequencing gives us , ' said stefansson , founder of decode , who led the research
' this is very much more than a molecular national selfie , ' he added
' we 're contributing to important tools for making more accurate diagnostics for rare diseases
' stefansson 's team today published four papers online in nature genetics , all of which used the icelandic data
among several key finds , the data set suggests that the ' father of humanity ' would have lived between 174,000 and 321,000 years ago
this date range , based on a calculation of human mutation rates ( pictured ) , contradicts earlier findings that claims the father of all humans live around 340,000 years ago they detail mutations in the abca7 gene that are associated with an increased risk of alzheimer 's disease
six of the eight mutations in abca7 were also found to be present in other populations of europe ancestry , including the us , indicating that the results are not specific to the icelandic population
they also identify a variant of the gene abcb4 that is significantly associated with the risk of developing liver disease
gilian mcvean , a geneticist at the university of oxford who was not involved in the study told new york times that discovering a rare association this way ' is a bit of a holy grail ' for geneticists
' large scale whole - genome sequencing of the icelandic population ' this study demonstrates how decode is able to use national genealogies to infer rare genetic mutations throughout the population
' identification of a large set of rare complete human knockouts ' the scale and detail of the data was used to identify more than a thousand knocked out genes in the population
the study found nearly eight per cent of the 104,000 people studied having at least one gene that do n't work
' the y - chromosome point mutation rate in humans ' the data set suggests that the ' father of humanity ' - our most recent common male ancestor - would have lived between 174,000 and 321,000 years ago
this date range , based on a calculation of human mutation rates , contradicts earlier findings that claims the father of all humans live around 340,000 years ago ' loss - of - function variants in abca7 confer risk of alzheimer 's disease ' this study details mutations in the abca7 gene that are associated with an increased risk of alzheimer 's disease
six of the eight mutations in abca7 were also found to be present in other populations of europe ancestry , including the us , indicating that the results are not specific to the icelandic population
a separate study reveals that 8,000 icelandic â around 7.7 per cent of the population - have a least one gene of their 21,000 genes that does n't function at all
the most common genes that were muted were those associated with a person 's sense of smell , and overall , the researchers found 1,171 different genes that had been silenced
the scientists now intend to recall those icelandic with knock - out genes as part of a new study to try to identify any physical differences or diseases that have caused the silenced genes
the work was funded by amgen , a california - based biotechnology company that paid $ 415 million for reykjavik , icelandic - based decode two years ago
it is now basing its research projects against decode 's database to make sure its medications are aimed at the right people
but some experts are wary of the results
they say the icelandic population has a unusual demographic history because the country is isolated , with only around 320,000 inhabitants
a separate study reveals that 8,000 icelandic â around 7.7 per cent of the population - have a least one gene of their 21,000 genes that does n't function at all
overall , the researchers found 1,171 different genes that had been silenced andrew allen , a geneticist at duke university who did n't take part in the studies told the verge said this means that the ' sample studied is not exactly healthy , is somewhat opportunistic , and probably does n't correspond to any ' real ' population
' but stefansson says that the results should still be representative of people in other areas because the icelandic population does n't meet any of the requirements for interbreeding
the scientists are now trying to decide whether they will provide the study participants with information their genetic risk for various diseases
stefansson 's own view is that ' it would be a crime ' not to let them know

stefansson says look at the genetics databases from the top down , rather than from the bottom up , could result in some breakthroughs in medicine
' i 'm 100 percent sure that we will find more protective mutations , ' he told bloomberg news
' i 'm absolutely convinced these protective mutations are going to be important when it comes to pointing us toward good drug targets
