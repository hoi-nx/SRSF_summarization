hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered in cities across brazil this weekend , incensed by serious economic woes and a massive scandal involving the country 's oil company
the demonstrators have called for president rousseff to be impeached
cnn correspondent shasta darlington , who lives in sao paulo , explains who the demonstrators are , why they 're mad and what could be in store for the president and the country
what do the protesters want ? they 're angry about the country 's economy being in shambles at a time when political corruption at the highest levels of government is alleged
if it were just one of those things , maybe we would n't be seeing this kind of turnout because brazil have lived with corruption for decades and the economy was not doing well before the presidential election in october
but it 's all come to a head
political corruption -- let 's break that down
what 's the scandal about ? petrobras is the national oil company
it 's one of the most powerful , richest companies in the country -- and has been counted among the largest in the world
rousseff , who won election in october by a slim margin , was -- before becoming president -- the chairwoman of petrobras ' board of directors
she was chairwoman during much of the time that former oil company executives have told investigators that bribes were paid to petrabras executives and politicians in order to secure contracts from petrobras
in early march , the country 's highest court authorized the investigation which involves about 40 politicians , many of them from the president 's ruling workers ' party and the speakers of the house and senate
but rousseff has n't been accused of anything , right ? right
she 's not being investigated
protesters ' call for impeachment -- the formal process of accusing , because she 's not been accused of anything -- looks very unlikely
but , the public perception is that even if she did n't personally profit for this scheme , she was still the chairwoman at a time when it was supposedly happening and she should be held accountable
has she responded to the protesters ? she has
what she says is that she will not stand for corruption and she 's rooting it out
as proof , she contends , she 's given her attorney general free rein to investigate who is stealing from the state oil company
it 's important to know that the petrobras scandal has been known publicly for at least a year and during rousseff 's election campaign , she said over and over that she would root out corruption
it 's also interesting that she is n't lashing out at protesters
she is saying she wo n't put up with violence -- and so far the protests have n't gotten violent
but she says that brazil is a democratic country and people have the right to protest
she comes from a left - wing background so that approach is fitting
you brought up that she is from the left - wing workers ' party
how is that significant ? the protests were mostly organized by the right - wing party that opposes rousseff ... organized by people who did n't vote for her
there are n't people out today protesting
the next demonstrations are scheduled for april 12
i guess that goes to how organized these demonstrations really are -- setting an advance date like that
yes , well , that 's brazil
it 's so the word can get out on social media
if she 's not accused of anything and the protests are politically motivated , will the protests affect her presidency ? rousseff has four years ahead of her , it could end up being very hard for her govern
she won a little over half the vote in october and the people who did n't vote for her are still making their voices heard
and this petrobras scandal is a problem
why was the election so close ? you have to bring it back to the economy
it had been slowing down , and traditionally the wealthier parts of the country like sao paulo have n't voted for rousseff 's party , the workers ' party
the country is at 7.5 % inflation
the april 12 protest is ahead but three or four months down the road , what might happen ? the senate and house speakers are rousseff 's allies and they are among those implicated in the petrobras scheme
what if she is n't able to get badly needed legislation ? what will she do ? what will be party do ? these questions are hard to answer now
