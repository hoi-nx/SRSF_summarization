a phoenix woman who left her two young sons alone in a hot car during a job interview pleaded guilty monday to a felony child abuse charge in a deal that lets her avoid jail time
the plea agreement calls for taylor to serve 10 years of probation , undergo parenting classes and pay an unspecified amount of restitution
her children remain in her custody
taylor attracted sympathy around the nation after her tear - stained mug shot went viral on the internet
her story of trying to get a job but not being able to find child care resonated with the public , and she received more than $ 114,000 in donations through an online site
in court monday , taylor provided one - word answers to a court commissioner 's questions and , unlike her earlier court appearances , avoided tv cameras outside the courthouse by leaving through a side exit
her lawyer tried unsuccessfully to bar a tv camera from recording the hearing
as part of the plea , defense attorney valeria llewellyn said her client , by leaving the children in the car , put them in a situation where they could have been hurt
court commissioner jeffrey rueter asked taylor whether her attorney 's statement was correct
' yes , ' taylor answered
taylor was arrested nearly a year ago after leaving her two young boys in her car for about 45 minutes while she interviewed for a job with a scottsdale insurance company
authorities said the temperature inside the car exceeded 100 degrees
a witness found the infant crying hysterically and sweating profusely
taylor told investigators she did n't have anyone to watch her then - 2 - year - old and 8 - month - old sons
deal : monday 's plea marks the second time taylor has struck a deal with prosecutors to resolve her case
an agreement last summer allowed taylor to avoid charges as long as she set up a $ 60,000 trust fund for her children with the donated money broken arrangement : taylor ( seen here last year ) broke the 2014 deal by missing a deadline for putting money in the trusts , even after the amount of her payments was lowered to $ 40,000 monday 's plea marks the second time taylor has struck a deal with prosecutors to resolve her case
an agreement last summer allowed taylor to avoid charges as long as she set up a $ 60,000 trust fund for her children with the donated money
but she broke that agreement by missing a deadline for putting money in the trusts , even after the amount of her payments was lowered to $ 40,000
taylor has said she did n't fund the trusts because her children wo n't get the money if they decided not to attend college
prosecutors had said the mother of three had spent about $ 4,100 per month , including more than $ 1,000 in non-essential items such as cable tv , clothing and dining
taylor had countered that she does n't live an extravagant lifestyle
the breach prompted prosecutors to then push the case against taylor
the restitution requirement in monday 's deal does n't apply to the contributions taylor was given .
