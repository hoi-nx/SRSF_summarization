on his bike ? clarkson went on a cycle ride today as he prepares to find out of he is sacked by the bbc over a ' fracas ' with a top gear producer over a steak petrolhead clarkson appeared to be preparing for life after top gear today by shunning his car and choosing to go for a bike ride instead
the star , 54 , decided to cycle on the streets around his west london home this morning on the eve of an bbc internal report that will help decide whether he is sacked
he smiled and waved to photographers but his future at the bbc looks increasingly bleak after a series of top gear live tour dates worth Â£ 1million to the corporation were axed
the four roadshows scheduled for norway next weekend were scrapped
tickets for the postponed shows cost between Â£ 42 and Â£ 100 , meaning the decision could cost the bbc more than Â£ 1million in lost revenue if clarkson is sacked and the shows are not rescheduled
speculation that the bbc was desperate to find a way of keeping clarkson â and the lucrative top gear brand â had been supported by the fact that the norway tour was not cancelled despite the frontman âs recent suspension
but last night a spokesman for the live shows , due to be attended by almost 20,000 people , announced the march 27 and 28 dates were being â postponed â
â top gear live regrets to inform ticket holders for next week âs shows in stavanger that we will be postponing all four performances , â he said , adding that new dates would be announced at a later time
the corporation 's commercial arm rakes in an estimated Â£ 50million a year from selling the rights to top gear overseas , with the show watched in 214 countries around the world
the motoring programme is also set to make around Â£ 7.35million in sales of tickets to its 14 live shows in the uk this year
the conservative estimate is based on 15,000 tickets sold for each show at the cheapest price of Â£ 35 each , however with more expensive tickets and vip packages available , this figure could be far higher
car manufacturers are also thought to pay to have their cars featured on the stadium tours
organisers confirmed that this weekend âs shows had been scrapped , but insisted they were not privy to the outcome of the inquiry into clarkson
big decision : sacking clarkson could mean the end of top gear , which makes the bbc millions every year a source said : â this is an independent decision we have to make
it is no indication of what is to come
one of top gear live âs main presenters remains on suspension by the bbc and the expected timeline on the conclusion of that investigation does not give us enough confidence that we can deliver the show expected by fans [ and ] ticket holders
â it emerged today that a report into clarkson 's behaviour was commissioned by bbc head of tv danny cohen after a series of other scandals last year
top gear caused an international incident after driving through argentina with a number plate allegedly linked to the falklands war and used the word ' slope ' describe an asian man
a report into the cases apparently concluded that top gear should have a new producer role to act as a go - between the show 's team and the bbc 's management to help deal with any future crisis
the bbc today refused to comment on the report or its conclusions
clarkson was suspended by the bbc two weeks ago , following allegations of a â fracas â with producer oisin tymon over hot food
his fate now hangs on an internal report by ken macquarrie , head of bbc scotland , which is expected to be handed over today
a source said : â the bbc wants to keep clarkson if it can find a respectable way to do it
â a senior executive added : â the bbc will do everything it can to keep him if it was just a bit of a dust - up , but if he is found to have punched him , then i think it âs gone too far
â insiders suggested clarkson and mr oisin tymon had given â quite different â versions of events
sources close to mr oisin tymon say he was punched and left with a split lip , while clarkson has admitted some â handbags and pushing â but is understood to have denied anything worse
clarkson , pictured with co ho - hosts james may and richard hammond at a top gear live show in prague , will not be performing at the four events in norway as they have been cancelled the four roadshows scheduled for norway next weekend were scrapped , on the eve of an internal report into clarkson âs fate clarkson was suspended by the bbc two weeks ago , following allegations of a â fracas â with producer oisin tymon ( left ) over hot food the bbc is set to lose as much as Â£ 67million a year if top gear presenter clarkson is sacked over claims he punched a producer
the corporation 's commercial arm rakes in an estimated Â£ 50million a year from selling the rights to top gear overseas , with the show watched in 214 countries around the world
on top of that , bbc worldwide makes millions more from top gear magazine and live shows in the uk and abroad , as well as sales of dvds
the bbc could lose tens of millions of pounds in annual profit if they do give clarkson his marching orders , with the sale of the show overseas making Â£ 50million
top gear magazine has a global circulation of 1.7m , bringing in another estimated Â£ 7.4million - not including profit from advertising , as well as the costs of producing and shipping the magazine
the motoring programme is also set to make around Â£ 7.35million in sales of tickets to its 14 live shows in the uk this year
there is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take top gear â worth Â£ 50million a year to bbc coffers â off the air while the investigation was under way
â the programme could and should have carried on during clarkson âs suspension , â said an insider
â clarkson wants to stay with the programme and one possible way of him doing that would be if he could face up to his own shortcomings
â he has a great deal of public support ... but he does need to rest and sort himself out
â the stakes were raised further yesterday as the 54 - year - old reportedly promised to sue the bbc if he was sacked from top gear
it comes amid suggestions that the corporation is filming a pilot for a new motoring show called the getaway car , which will see contestants travel abroad to take part in driving challenges
a source told the sunday mirror : â if clarkson is fired it wo nât be the end of it
â writing in the sunday times , clarkson also laughed off a foul - mouthed rant at bbc bosses filmed at a charity auction last week , claiming he only used the language â in jest â to raise money for good causes
a petition to have clarkson re-instated on top gear has gathered around one million signatures and was delivered to the bbc in london on friday
a decision about his future is expected this week , after the corporation âs director - general has considered the findings of macquarrie âs investigation .
