liverpool travel away from anfield for a game that will shape the destiny of their season and rodgers ' confidence is telling
' if we beat them , they can not do it , ' rodgers proclaims ahead of a trip to old trafford
he had just been asked what the consequences would be if manchester united , who were trying desperately to keep pace in the race for the champions league , lost to liverpool
his words are backed up by a swaggering display , full of devilment , wit and counter-attacking menace
manchester united are left punch - drunk by a 3 - 0 defeat that could have been even heavier , as steven gerrard â with two pressure penalties â and luis suarez ran amok
steven gerrard scored two penalties as liverpool won 3 - 0 at manchester united on march 16 , 2014 luis suarez ( bottom ) was also on the scoresheet as liverpool built a 14 - point gap over their arch - rivals liverpool headed home that afternoon with a 14 - point gap over their rivals in the premier league and had effectively destroyed any lingering hope that david moyes had of commandeering a top four spot
it was a day when rodgers saw his players make a massive statement of intent , a day that suggested there was a shift in the balance of power of this rivalry ; leaving old trafford then , you felt it would be a long time before the deficit would be clawed back
fast forward to march 16 , 2015
again liverpool were away from anfield for a vital fixture and again rodgers ' confidence in the build - up was telling but , this time , there was no performance of verve and invention to back up his pre-game message
there was , however , doggedness , determination and the result was just as crucial
henderson 's freak goal , coming after they had spent much of a rain - sodden night in south wales riding their luck and defending for their lives , has set them up for another afternoon of destiny with their most bitter foe
henderson scored a second - half winner for liverpool as they won 1 - 0 at swansea on monday night henderson runs off to celebrate his winner that moved liverpool within two points of the top four henderson 's ( right ) shot was deflected over the top of swansea goalkeeper lukasz fabianski and into the net the goal was henderson 's ( right ) third in the last three premier league games for liverpool no trophy will be presented at anfield next sunday but there is the sense that the winner of liverpool and manchester united 's latest showdown will take all in relation to the final spot in next year 's champions league
it is going to be another day of reckoning
do not underestimate how much liverpool needed this result at the liberty stadium
they have stylishly worked their way into contention for the top four with a long unbeaten run but manchester united 's victory over tottenham had threatened to alter the landscape
what if a loss in wales and had then be follow up with a defeat at anfield ? such a scenario would have left bleak consequences for liverpool
those result would have left them with an eight - point deficit and not enough time to claw it back , especially with some tricky assignments looming
as it is , they go into english football 's clasico brimming with confidence , two points behind manchester united but ready to leapfrog louis van gaal 's men
they will need to step up on what they produced against swansea to topple manchester united but rodgers has a glint in his eye and faith in his team
liverpool striker daniel sturridge ( centre ) tries to wriggle away from a challenge from swansea 's jack cork liverpool might not have last year 's electric swagger but they certainly know how to fight and , in some ways , the results they have put together since losing at old trafford on december 14 have been just as impressive as their unexpected title - charge
nobody proved that determination more than henderson , who emerged from a difficult first 45 minutes to keep on running and score the decisive goal , his challenge on jordi amat looping over lukasz fabianski 's head to leave rodgers ' punching the air
henderson keeps on producing these important moments
for all the noise that is being created around raheem sterling and his contract stand - off , the most pressing contractual issue liverpool have is with their vice-captain
he has scored in each of his last three premier league games and has led the team with distinction in steven gerrard 's absence
young , hungry , talented english players like him are not ten - a - penny and it would be folly to let this drift
liverpool should really get this business concluded
