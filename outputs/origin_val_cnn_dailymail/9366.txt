as news of sturridge âs latest injury setback emerged , those four words will have swirled around rodgers â mind
liverpool âs manager has become accustomed to picking teams that do not contain sturridge â he went from august 31 to january 31 without him , remember â but , as the campaign reaches its defining moment , this is not something he will relish
it was bad enough to lose his captain steven gerrard to a three - match suspension last sunday , and the fa âs decision to give martin skrtel , liverpool âs best defender , the same ban for stamping on david de gea exacerbated the problem
sturridge will be out of action for around a month after picking up a hip injury the new setback is another blow in a season that has been ruined by injury for the liverpool striker sturridge injured his thigh on england duty last september and did n't play for liverpool again in 2014 barclays premier league goals for sturridge since his debut in jan 2013 â from that date until he left for barca last summer , former strike partner luis suarez scored 41 immediately after the international break is over , no team in the barclays premier league has more at stake than liverpool , who have a lunchtime trip to arsenal next saturday followed by an fa cup quarter - final replay at blackburn four days later
steven gerrard and martin skrtel would have had big contributions to make to those fixtures and , without them , there is absolutely no doubt liverpool âs chances of success have been compromised
taking sturridge away has an even greater impact
lose at the emirates stadium and ewood park and the campaign that liverpool have fought hard to resurrect since rodgers changed his system to 3 - 4 - 3 will effectively be over
that is what is on the line
that is why rodgers needs sturridge fit
at this point , it should be noted sturridge has not set the world alight since he returned as a substitute against west ham at the end of january
there have been some flashes of star quality but , in a lot of games , his performances could kindly be described as â enigmatic â
the thing with sturridge , however , is that he scores
â he is an absolute nightmare for a defender when he is on it , â steven gerrard once observed
even when he is playing poorly â like last sunday against united â you can not discount him for a moment
he has poise and awareness in the penalty area and it is why rodgers believe he can become one of europe âs top strikers
sturridge scores for liverpool in their fa cup fifth round victory at crystal palace steven gerrard was hit with a three - match ban after he was sent off against united note the words â can become â : something is holding sturridge back from fulfilling his potential
can his body stand up to the rigours of football at the highest level ? or is it more psychological than physical ? â if sturridge had wayne âs mentality , he âd be almost unstoppable , â jamie carragher wrote in these pages during the world cup last summer
â wayne will play through the pain barrier and wo nât let a niggle keep him out of the action
â luis suarez is another who stays away from the treatment room at all costs
with sturridge , however , there was a feeling that everything had to be right for him to train or play
if a knock was playing on his mind , he would want it assessed to be sure he could play at the weekend
â sturridge âs latest ailment concerns his hip
he damaged it against united and , after a scan at st george âs park following a recovery session on monday , it was left to england manager roy hodgson to report that he has suffered â a small tear â to his flexor muscles
given all that has happened this season , with his initial calf problem being sustained on september 5 , it left the 25 - year - old â absolutely devastated â that he could not figure in the euro 2016 qualifier against lithuania
martin skrtel was handed the same ban after he stamped on united goalkeeper david de gea the question now , however , concerns how quickly he will be able to recover
it has been mooted that he could be out for up to a month and while that prognosis may seem overly pessimistic , history has shown it is not prudent to give definitive timescales when sturridge is being treated
you would think , then , given what is at stake , he will now be redoubling his efforts to be ready for the trip to arsenal
rodgers will certainly hope so as mario balotelli is the only other recognised striker to score for liverpool since january 31
â winning games and scoring goals is the motto , â sturridge posted on instagram last october
â do nât think people realise how hard it is mentally being injured
i âve had a lot of time to reflect
ca nât wait to be back ! ! best feeling is to be playing football and i take it for granted when you âre fit
â much to his dismay , sturridge has had a lot of time to think this season
his manager will be hoping he gets a lot of time to score
a champions league place and the fa cup are at stake .
