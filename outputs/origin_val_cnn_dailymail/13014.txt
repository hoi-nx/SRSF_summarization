rome italy 's highest court friday will consider whether to uphold the 2009 murder conviction of united states amanda marie knox , according to judge gennaro marasca
the high court judge will either uphold the murder convictions of knox and her italy ex-boyfriend , or send the case back for another appeal , or potentially on to a different section of the court
knox , a 27 - year - old seattle native , and raffaele sollecito were convicted of the 2007 killing of knox 's british roommate , meredith kercher
knox and kercher lived together in italy at the time of kercher 's death
raffaele sollecito and knox were acquitted in 2011 on appeal , and then knox returned to the united states
however , italy 's supreme court overturned the acquittals in 2013 , and they were convicted last year after a retrial
if a new trial is ordered , knox and raffaele sollecito will buy a little time before a final decision is reached
but if the court upholds the conviction , the case will be closed for good -- and what happens to knox next is uncertain
conventional wisdom dictates that knox will eventually face an extradition hearing or reach a deal with the italian justice ministry to serve her 28 - year sentence , but that could take years
the statute of limitations is double the sentence , meaning the italy have 57 years to bring her back to the country
knox , however , would benefit from the united states ' extradition treaty with italy -- under which the united states will not extradite a person who has been acquitted -- and from the united states constitution 's protection against double jeopardy
raffaele sollecito , on the other hand , still lives in italy , and has a lot more to lose than knox does , at least in the short term
he would be scooped up immediately and hauled off to prison to start a 25 - year sentence
all of his options will have been exhausted and he will have no choice but to go to directly to jail
raffaele sollecito earlier said he would be in court on wednesday to face the judge
" i 've been living this for eight years , " he told the italy crime tv program " quarto grado
" not appearing in court would be like hiding in the corner during a tsunami -- it will take you away anyway
" meredith kercher , from the ivory coast , was convicted separately in a fast - track trial and is midway through a 16 - year sentence for kercher 's murder
his case was confirmed by italy 's high court in 2010
many commentators in the united states have reasoned that italy may not ask the united states for knox 's extradition because it would cause a diplomatic rift between the two nations
but there could be a greater rift if it appears that knox gets away with murder and her italy ex-boyfriend pays for the crime
if raffaele sollecito is languishing in prison and knox is sipping frappuccino in a seattle starbucks , italy will not be pleased , says capponi , an italy journalist for corriere della sera who has been covering the case since kercher was killed in 2007
" it will be seen as an injustice , " capponi told cnn
" you may not see people out on the streets , but if you ask 10 people what they think , those 10 people will tell you they see it as a complete injustice that only the italy and the african are in prison
the italy will say that the united states gets away with murder and it wo n't be the first time
" this is not the first time italy and the united states have butted heads on matters involving united states suspects accused of crimes in italy
in 1998 , an american marine aircraft sliced through a ski lift cable in the dolomites , sending 20 people plummeting to their death
even after admitting to destroying the videotape of the deadly flight , only two of the four marines were charged and convicted
only one served jail time -- just over four months of a six - month sentence
in 2012 , italy 's highest court upheld the convictions of 23 united states ( 22 cia agents and an air force pilot ) for the kidnapping of egyptian cleric abu omar , a suspeced terrorist , from a street in milan
they were sentenced to between five and eight years in prison , but italy has not yet asked for extradition
" our relationship with the united states is full of these diplomatic tensions , " said capponi
" this will just be added to the list
" knox 's case has been divisive from the start , and her supporters have come down hard on the italy judicial system
raffaele sollecito has never had the luxury of that attitude , knowing full well that he is in the hands of the system whether he likes it or not , so vocally criticizing it would n't be in his best interest
in fact , he has long suffered the impact of knox 's ardent campaigners who have mostly criticized italy from the other side of the atlantic
by almost any italy precedent , raffaele sollecito should not have had to be in prison during his initial trial -- but because knox was deemed a flight risk , she had to stay in jail
because raffaele sollecito was her co-defendant , he did too , even though he had no ties to anyone abroad
" knox could still beat the system , but raffaele sollecito 's game is up if the convictions are upheld , " nicola canestrini , an italy extradition lawyer familiar with both legal systems , told cnn
" he has no wiggle room and it could be that he serves the time for both of them , which will likely cause deep resentment here in italy
" perhaps a little too late , raffaele sollecito 's defense team has been slowly inching away from knox , especially since the latest conviction
last summer , he held a press conference when his lawyers filed their appeal to the high court , in which his lawyer bongiorno pointed out " certain anomalies " in knox 's testimony that have nothing to do with raffaele sollecito
" we ask that the court to not extend the anomalies of amanda marie knox 's testimony to raffaele sollecito , " bongiorno said at the time
whether that is enough to get the high court to give raffaele sollecito another , independent chance is yet to be seen
" i am not a crazy person
i am not a criminal
i am innocent , " raffaele sollecito told reporters last summer at the press conference
" but my name is raffaele sollecito , not amanda marie knox
" now it is up to the judge to determine whether that makes any difference
