fans of the uk boozer are concerned that pubs could become a thing of the past as thousands close each year due to spiralling production costs
but a new machine could help landlords feeling the pinch , because it can produce pints that cost just 35 pence ( 53 cents ) each
the truebrew technobrewery can make 280 pints of beer in just two hours at the touch of a button
revolutionary ? the truebrew technobrewery ( pictured ) may look unassuming , but it could save ailing pubs and bars by making 280 pints of beer in just two hours , costing just 35 pence ( 53 cents ) each a similar size to an industrial oven , the machine is intended for business use and will cost around Â£ 25,000 ( $ 38,000 )
the machine allows landlords to brew their own beer for a quarter of the price of buying it in from a brewery
the british beer & pub association refused to comment on how much it typically costs larger breweries to brew a pint ' for competition reasons
' but dave bailey , the founder of hardknott brewery in cumbria told the guardian in 2011 that it cost 90p to make a pint of beer , including 3p for malt , 2p for hops , 20p for labour and 20p for duty and 12p for transport
cheap and unique : the machine allows people to brew their own beer for a fraction of the price of buying it in and they can create their own unique brews to impress friends and attract customers a serious business : a similar size to an industrial oven , the machine ( pictured ) is not intended to be stored in the kitchen and costs around Â£ 25,000 ( $ 38,000 ) regularly drinking beer could help slow dementia , research suggests
scientists have discovered an ingredient in hops which they think could slow the progression of degenerative diseases such as alzheimer 's and parkinson 's
in laboratory experiments they found that the chemical , called xanthohumol or xn , could help protect brain cells from oxidative damage associated with dementia
the research , published in december in the journal of agricultural and food chemistry , suggested that people who regularly drink beer might be better able to ward off the progression of neurological diseases
taking inflation into account - but not any increases in duties - this means that a pint costs just over Â£ 1 to make
pubs brewing their own beer was an age - old tradition until the mid- 1800 âs when the introduction of duty killed it off , but now that tradition is being revived with bars launching their own microbreweries
beer industry experts mclauchlan and graham steele have spent the last 10 years developing the truebrew technobrewery
the machine is filled it with water , and then ingredients including hops are placed inside
it 's then switched on for two hours
the machine is self - cleaning and the beer is ready to drink seven days later
after fermentation , it can be put into casks or bottles and sold directly from a pub , which the company says guarantees its freshness and wipes out transportation costs
while it costs a considerable amount , the new machine is estimated to cost a quarter of price of setting up a regular Â£ 100,000 ( $ 152,000 ) microbrewery
some drinkers may be worried that beer brewed on site is not as uniform as that made at huge breweries , but mclauchlan , director of brewers world , told mailonline that the beer is controlled by computer software
' for the novice brewer we supply ready made ingredients to enable them to ensure repeatability
' unlike large scale breweries the measurements are far more accurate , both for ingredients and for the quantity of water
' the system is sealed and so is free from risk of infection
brews are fresh and so no additives , colouring agents or preservatives are required

instructions and readings such as the temperature are shown on an attached tablet ( pictured ) inventor mr mclauchlan , 67 , from stratford-upon-avon , warkwickshire , said : â craft ale is the story of the moment and major brands are being shunned by consumers who now seek interesting and really good beers with local provenance
â pubs can benefit enormously from this by brewing their own beer and that âs where truebrew technobrewery comes in
â landlords can create unique beers to attract customers
â and because they brew the beer onsite , pubs can guarantee it is fresh and there is no need for chemicals or preservatives or other additives that the public have no idea about , â mr mclauchlan said
the machine has just gone on general sale in the uk and will launch in the us in ' the next couple of months ' .
