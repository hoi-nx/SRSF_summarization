maintaining defence spending at the minimum demanded by nato is now only a ' target ' , top tory cabinet minister hammond suggested this morning
the foreign secretary refused 10 times to guarantee that the tories would protect the military from further cuts after the election
mr hammond said the final decision on whether or not to ring - fence military spending would not be made until after the election
the failure to protect military spending â while guaranteeing cash for foreign aid â has sparked fury on the tory backbenches
up to 30 conservative mps are thought to be backing a bid by john baron , mp for basildon and billericay , to force a protest vote against defence cuts in the commons this week
mps claim that if the chancellor george osborne gets his way british 's military spending will fall below 2 per cent of gdp â despite the prime minister using a nato summit in wales to publicly shame other countries into hitting that target
mr david cameron fears it will damage relations with us president barack obama , who urged him last month not to set a bad example to other nato nations by cutting spending
military top brass fear the treasury will raid another Â£ 1billion a year from mod coffers to try to balance the nation 's books
mr hammond said the government would not set out its defence spending plans until after the next election at ' the beginning of the next parliament ' military spending will stay above 2 per cent of gdp until 2015/16
david cameron has pledge an annual 1 per cent real terms increase in spending on defence equipment after the election
the prime minister has also pledged not to cut the size of the army below the level it is now
he also remains committed to growing the army reserves to 35,000
but defence spending in the british is forecast to drop to 1.7 per cent by 2020 defence spending in the british is forecast to drop to 1.7 per cent by 2020 , even without further cuts
mr hammond , speaking this morning on the bbc 's marr show , was asked if british could afford to cut defence spending with the growing threat posed by vladimir putin and isis in the middle east
it came after he admitted british 's relations with russian could be ' prickly ' for many years - and described the country as an ' adversary '
he said it was clear british was ' not going to fight the russian in ukraine ' , but insisted there was a ' hard red line ' protecting nato 's baltic members from russian incursions
mr hammond added : ' we 're the second largest defence spender in nato , we 've got a huge equipment programme modernising our armed forces
' ' we led the charge encouraging our nato partners to make this commitment
many of them are far , far away from two per cent
' but he said the government would not set out its defence spending plans until after the next election at ' the beginning of the next parliament '
he said : ' there are two things i ca n't do today
i ca n't tell you what will be in the conservative manifesto but you 'll find out soon enough , and i ca n't prejudge the outcome of the security and defence review and the spending review that will take place after the next election
' but david cameron led the charge on the nato two per cent commitment at the summit in wales last year
' he is passionate about our armed forces , he has always been absolutely clear that he is not prepared to preside over any further cuts in our regular armed forces
so he knows where he wants to go
' but we 've got very difficult decisions to make in delivering our long - term economic plan to get british out of deficit and staring to pay down instead
' we 've got to make those difficult balanced decisions , but we will protect the integrity and the strength of our armed forces
' marr tried 10 times to get the foreign secretary to guarantee military spending marr : â we have russian submarines testing our waters and russian jets buzzing our airspace , and at the same time we are not committing ourselves to maintaining the nato minimum defence spending
where do you stand on that ? â hammond : â well , clearly i was defence secretary for nearly three years , i âm a passionate supporter of the armed forces and of maintaining british âs military strength
and we are spending two per cent of our gdp
â marr : â you âre not committing the party to doing that at the next election
â hammond : â well , we âre the second largest defence spender in nato , we âve got a huge equipment programme modernising our armed forces
â we âre building the two largest aircraft carriers the royal navy has ever had
we âre equipping them with the world âs most advanced fighter aircraft , we âre launching a submarine
â marr : â but you do nât commit to two per cent going ahead
â hammond : â well , we led the charge at the nato summit
â marr : â we âre going to look damn silly if we do nât do it ourselves
â hammond : â we led the charge encouraging our nato partners to make this commitment
many of them are far , far away from two per cent
â marr : â so we want it too then do nât we ? â hammond : â we will have a strategic defence and security review at the beginning of the next parliament and a spending review and we will set out our future plans then
but we are committed to the two per cent target
â marr : â through the course of the next parliament ? â hammond : â we will set out the defence spending
â marr : â i âm sorry , but a lot of people want to know whether the country can trust the conservatives over defence and the two per cent target is crucial to this
â there âs an argument going on about it , we all understand that , inside the cabinet
as foreign secretary surely you can commit yourself personally to the two per cent
hammond : â there are two things i ca nât do today
i ca nât tell you what will be in the conservative manifesto but you âll find out soon enough , and i ca nât prejudge the outcome of the security and defence review and the spending review that will take place after the next election
â marr : â can you at least therefore â¦ â hammond : â david cameron led the charge on the nato two per cent commitment at the summit in wales last year
â marr : â and therefore you could at least commit yourself to agreeing with david davis that he would look pretty damn silly if he did nât then commit himself to two per cent for this country ? â hammond : â look , i worked closely with the prime minister on this subject when i was defence secretary for three years
he is passionate about our armed forces , he has always been absolutely clear that he is not prepared to preside over any further cuts in our regular armed forces
so he knows where he wants to go
â but we âve got very difficult decisions to make in delivering our long - term economic plan to get british out of deficit and staring to pay down instead
we âve got to make those difficult balanced decisions , but we will protect the integrity and the strength of our armed forces
â marr : â so no cuts to the british army â no further cuts to the british army
no ifs , no buts , that âs an absolutely clear policy ? â hammond : â the prime minister has been very clear that he is not prepared to see further cuts in the size of the regular armed forces
