i 'm quite friendly with people in the area
' he was even helpful with the trolley
i left him sitting on the wall and started fiddling with my key
then he was behind me
he told me he had come to visit someone on the second floor
my wallet was in the front pocket of my trousers
then suddenly whoosh , he came straight at me
he grabbed my wallet , pushed me over and i fell on my side and he ran out
' when you fall over at my age every bit of your body hits the ground , i was flailing like a seal
it 's almost impossible to pick yourself up
