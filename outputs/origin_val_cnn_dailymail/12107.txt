wisconsin gov. walker tops likely republicans voters ' 2016 lists for second week in row
a handful of flubs and a flip - flop that were heavily covered by the media do n't seem to have slowed down the second - term governor 's momentum in the invisible presidential primary , and in a national quinnipiac poll released on thursday walker came in first with 18 percent
former florida gov. jeb bush , previously considered the republicans front - runner , was right behind him at 16 percent
wisconsin governor walker addresses the american conservative union 's conservative political action conference ( cpac ) at national harbor , maryland , last week
walker did n't win the cpac straw poll , but he has topped national 2016 polls for the last two weeks just two weeks ago it was jeb bush who was leading walker by an average of two points in early primary states
but by the time the right - wing of the party made its annual pilgrimage to the washington , d.c. metropolitan area for the conservative political action conference last weekend , it was walker who was carrying the republicans 's torch
a public policy polling survey released a day before the soft start of the convention found that 25 percent of the republicans had coalesced around wisconsin 's chief executive
retired neurosurgeon carson , who earlier this week became the first republicans to launch a presidential exploratory committee , made a surprise second showing in that poll , taking 18 percent of the vote , as jeb bush slipped to third place
this week jeb bush was back on walker 's heels , though , as the wisconsin governor took flak over comments he made about president obama 's patriotism and religion , protesters in his state and illegal immigration
as pollsters for quinnipiac began their survey , walker was asked by the the associated press if believes that obama loves his country
the question was related to remarks former new york mayor giuliani made at a new york dinner honoring walker during which the failed presidential candidate suggested the commander in chief does n't have the same level of deference to america as the rest of his countrymen
' you should ask the president what he thinks about america , ' walker told the associated press when he was approached about giuliani 's comments during a washington , d.c. meeting of the nation 's governors
' i 've never asked him so i do n't know
' that same weekend walker told the washington post he could n't possibly know whether obama is a christian or not
' i 've never asked him that , ' walker said
' you 've asked me to make statements about people that i have n't had a conversation with about that
how [ could ] i say if i know either of you are a christian ? ' jeb bush shakes cpac attendees ' hands at last weekend 's convention
jeb bush , previously considered the republicans front - runner , was right behind walker in this week 's presidential survey , taking 16 percent to walker 's 18 percent from there , his week did n't get much better
asked at cpac what qualifies him to take on terrorists , walker brought up his 2012 fight with public sector unions
democrats in wisconsin tried to recall him over measures , however walker won statewide election again , with an even wider margin of victory that he did the first time
' if i can do that with 100,000 protesters , i can do the same across the world , ' he said
the comments were interpreted by some reporters as a comparison between his home state critics an savages in the middle east - something his political action committee told daily mail online in an email that was neither fair nor true
then , on sunday , he walked back his position on immigration , saying he no longer believes in a pathway to citizenship for illegal residents
' i do n't believe in amnesty , ' walker told fox news sunday
' my view has changed
i 'm flat out saying it
' still , other republicans whose names were tested by quinnipiac attracted less than half as much support as walker did in the recent poll
tied for third were new jersey gov. chris christie and former arkansas gov. mike huckabee with eight percent each
carson took 7 percent of the mock vote , and a trio of senators who are expected to run - paul of kentucky , ted cruz of texas and marco rubio of florida - received between five and six percent of republicans ' support
paul 's showings in surveys throughout the last month have n't been as strong as some of his likely competitors ' , walker and jeb bush included , but at cpac it was the freshman lawmaker who claimed victory as his team showed off its organizing prowess and secured him his third straw poll win in three years
straw poll winners rarely go on to wrap up the nomination
paul 's unique ability to turn out his supporters will prove beneficial in caucus states like iowa , however .
