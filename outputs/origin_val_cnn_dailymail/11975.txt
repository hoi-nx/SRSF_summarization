even fernando torres was nât relegated to the reserves
but for Â£ 250,000 - per - week falcao â perhaps the most handsomely - rewarded second - string striker in history â this was the ultimate indignity
does he feel an injustice , angry with louis van gaal for such a degrading demotion ? or is there an acceptance that his powers have faded ? in fact , they âve gone out like a light
radamal falcao has scored just four goals since arriving at manchester united his latest run out was for the under 21s as they faced spurs on tuesday night at least with fellow Â£ 50million flop torres his decline was something of a slow burn , occasionally illuminated by a flicker of glories past
sadly , for falcao , there is no sign of him emerging from the darkness at old trafford
an unused substitute as manchester united struggled for a goal ( falcao has scored more than 200 in his career ) during their 2 - 1 defeat by arsenal in monday âs fa cup quarter - final , the colombian was back at the theatre of nightmares 24 hours later for an under 21 fixture against spurs
he was nât there to cheer on the club âs next generation , he was lining up alongside them
manchester united insist it was a fitness exercise
but fitness is allied to form , and falcao certainly does n't boast the latter right now
falcao fluffed his lines and missed several chances during a win over qpr back in january the striker has spent plenty of time warming the bench at old trafford louis van gaal must decide whether to take up the option to buy falcao at the end of his loan spell he failed to score against spurs , fluffed one chance and was then withdrawn â a synopsis which could well be applied to the majority of his outings since his Â£ 6m loan move from monaco
the beauty of that arrangement â and it âs something of an ugly truth â is that manchester united are not committed to making his stay permanent and there is zero chance of them doing so after his failure to impact , four goals from 19 appearances his sorry return
compare that with the 70 strikes from 91 matches for atletico and his demise is given some numerical context
falcao drew a blank against league one preston in the fa cup last month he also struggled against cambridge from league two in the previous round celebrations have been few and far between for falcao , pictured here after scoring against leicester river plate 2005 - 06 - games 11 goals 7 2006 - 07 - games 20 goals 3 2007 - 08 games 39 goals 19 2008 - 09 games 35 goals 16 porto 2009 - 10 games 43 goals 34 2010 - 11 games 42 goals 38 2011 - 12 games 2 goals 0 atletico 2011 - 12 games 50 goals 36 2012 - 13 games 41 goals 34 monaco 2013 - 14 games 19 goals 11 2014 - 15 games 3 goals 2 manchester united 2014 - 15 games 19 goals 4 it was , of course , in the colours of atletico that falcao smashed a devastating hat - trick past chelsea in the european super cup of 2012
every tribute in the wake of that demolition job determined that falcao was ready - made for the premier league â pace , power , potency , he had the lot
even his pre-madrid existence supported the assertion that he was the continent âs most feared goal - getter
there were 72 goals from just 87 games at porto , winning with them a portuguese title , cup and europa league , a prize he defended the following season in spain
his spells at porto and atletico were bookended by river plate and monaco , where again his ratio was as good as one - in - two
but it was that move to monaco which proved fateful in the loss of europe âs finest front man
with a transfer fee of Â£ 52m and salary of around Â£ 15m , there were obvious accusations â defended by falcao â behind his motivation
however , it was the knee injury suffered in january of last year which robbed him of a place at the world cup and , on the evidence of this season , a whole lot more than a mere ticket to brazil
falcao was on holiday during the world cup as he missed out following a long injury lay - off falcao scored goals for fun during his days as an atletico player he won the europa league with porto in 2011 and again with atletico the following year falcao is still a monaco player having signed for manchester united on a season - long loan gone are the razor - sharp reactions of body and mind
gone is the swagger , the confidence , the belief that he is the best
sound familiar ? over four , long years at chelsea we witnessed the regression of fernando torres
in the end he left having scored just 20 league goals in 110 games
falcao will be lucky if he leaves manchester united with 20 league appearances , let alone goals
fernando torres , of course , now resides back at atletico , his connection with the club affording him a second chance
at 29 and with his best days very much behind him , perhaps a similar fate awaits falcao .
