bernie ecclestone has suggested next year 's german grand prix could also fall by the wayside just days after this season 's race was officially dropped from the formula one calendar
as per their contract , hockenheim is scheduled to host the event in 2016 , but at this early stage formula one supremo bernie ecclestone is uncertain whether it will go ahead
asked whether he could confirm it would take place , bernie ecclestone , speaking to a select media group in the paddock at the malaysian grand prix , replied : ' no. ' bernie ecclestone ( left ) says german grand prix may miss out on the formula one calendar next year informed that hockenheim has a contract for 2016 and 2018 , bernie ecclestone added : ' it does n't make a difference
a lot of people have a contract
' bernie ecclestone intimated if german was unable to afford the race this year , then it will struggle to pay the hosting fee next season
the nurburgring was scheduled to host the race in july , but due to numerous financial difficulties behind the scenes was ultimately forced to withdraw
bernie ecclestone then turned to hockenheim to step in and fill the void , but negotiations broke down and time ran out as circuit officials believed they did not have ample time to promote and sell tickets
hockenheim and nurburgring have hosted the german grand prix for the past seven years ' the trouble in german was the nurburgring spent an awful lot of money which they borrowed , ' added bernie ecclestone
' they did n't need to spend what they spent , and therefore did n't need to borrow the amount they borrowed
' they forgot to pay it back , and that caused a few ripples
it sent a bad message
' bernie ecclestone did n't confirm if hockenheim would host next year 's race despite having a contract in place historic europe races are now fast falling away with france , san marino and now german losing their place on the calendar in recent times
italy is another that will struggle to pay its way beyond the expiry of its current contract in 2016 unless national government steps in to assist , or bernie ecclestone reduces his fees
asked whether he was prepared to see formula one 's europe heartland wither away , bernie ecclestone said : ' there are lots of things we all would like , but we do n't have them because we ca n't afford them
' suggested to bernie ecclestone ' if monza goes , it goes ' , he said : ' whatever goes , goes
' the formula one supremo said hockenheim having a contract in place ' does n't make a difference ' bernie ecclestone did concede , however , ' it would be terrible ' if europe did lose all its races , particularly as the series would no longer become a world championship
many people believe bernie ecclestone 's hosting fees are too steep , which in turn prompts promoters to charge extortionate ticket prices , leading to reduced numbers through the turnstiles
hockenheim , for instance , saw its audience plummet from more than 100,000 in 2012 to just 60,000 in 2014 , despite sebastian vettel being a four - time world champion at that stage and mercedes dominating last year
' probably right , ' said bernie ecclestone , regarding comments about over-charging
' but the teams get 62 per cent of whatever profit the company ( cvc , who run the sport ) makes , so if we make less money , the teams make less money
' the german grand prix has alternated between hockenheim and nurburgring since 2007
