i was in florida last year when i got a call asking me to pose for a calendar
what ? a calendar ? as in sports illustrated swimsuit ? victoria 's secret angels ? cover girls
i agreed , and now i am ms. december
but it is n't quite what you think
the caller on the other end that day was tripathi
she was an anchor at cnn headline news at a time when there were few india - america women in high - profile media jobs
tripathi has her own media company now , but more recently she launched a nonprofit called saris to suits
she was asking me to help
she began by telling me her story
she was 12 when her family immigrated to the america
india parents often have to save a lot of money to ensure a good marriage for their daughter
tripathi said that was a big reason why her family left
we spoke about similar experiences as india teenagers in america
she was not allowed to go to the prom or wear shorts , except to play tennis
she had an 8 p.m. curfew and her father expected she would be married soon after college
tripathi felt like a burden
she did everything she could to stand on her own
my father was not as stern but he had a hard time watching his little girl become " americanized
" i , too , longed to be independent , far more so than was expected of a bengali girl in the 1970s
at an all - girls convent school in kolkata , i used to climb up three flights of stairs to reach my classroom
on every landing were oversized portraits of national leaders , most of them india
hundreds of girls in white uniforms made the stampede - like dash up the stairwell
it was impossible to stop but i always looked up when i arrived at indira gandhi
there she was , in her trademark white sari and what i thought was a cruella de vil slice in her hair
in a nation that valued boys more than girls , i was in awe that we had a female prime minister
gandhi 's political career turned out to be less than stellar , but it was 1971 and i was not yet 9 years old
i wanted to grow up to be just like her
and most of all , in control of my destiny
i know so many other india girls felt the same
we wanted to be someone , do something rewarding with our lives
yet for so many girls in india , dreams are vanquished by nightmare life scenarios
they are denied education and married off within months of their first period
i have met women who were abducted and forced into prostitution or lived with physically and mentally abusive men
those problems are not limited to india or the rest of south asian
they exist in the immigrant communities in the america , in which abuse and crimes are underreported because of the stigma that still exists
women are often ashamed to talk about these things
as an india - america journalist , i have told stories with hopes of casting light on the world inhabited by many south asian women
i have mentored girls in my hometown of kolkata
and always wondered : what else can i do ? some of that desire stems from my own circumstances in life
as a newborn , i was left on the steps of an orphanage in north kolkata
it happened to be run by an america missionary , helen benedict , who happened to meet my adoptive mother at the indo-american society
my mother was honing her english speaking skills there
that was in 1962 and my parents were childless after 10 years of marriage
it 's not hard to guess the rest of the story
instead of growing up in harsh surroundings , i was raised in a professor 's house
and , instead of a future that might have been filled with darkness , i faced one that was bright
i had loving parents , attended good schools and traveled around the world
there is not a day that goes by when i do n't think about the life i might have led had it not been for that fateful meeting between an america missionary and a bengali woman pining to become a mother
i shared my story with tripathi and told her i would help
tripathi put together saris to suits as an empowerment tool
she wanted to raise money to help south asian women
she also wanted to inspire them , she said
they needed strong role models
they needed to know that they could break out of the molds that were cast for them
she was putting together the 2015 saris to suits calendar and wanted to feature south asian women who had found success in america
they were doctors , lawyers , corporate leaders
one was a weightlifter from pakistan who struggled with balancing her sport and her muslim attire
i felt honored to be in such fine company
i would be the only journalist in the calendar
it would most certainly be my only chance in life to pretend i was a glamour girl
some of the women opted to wear saris , the traditional dress of india
some wore salwar kameez , a long tunic and pants
and some of us were in suits or our work attire
the 2014 calendar , the first one tripathi published , raised money for various organizations that help south asian women
one of them was raksha ( which means protection )
based in atlanta , raksha provides support for the south asian community in a number of ways
most of its clients are women who are dealing with abusive marriages , divorce and issues with their children
raksha 's executive director , aparna bhattacharyya , told me why the calendar was important
" i think it is a reminder that there are women overcoming obstacles and that they have the potential to achieve their own goals for themselves , " she said
" i think it is powerful for young south asian women to see role models that look like themselves -- role models who are making change and following their dreams
" her words took me back to my school in kolkata where i gazed upward at indira gandhi 's face
in it , i found strength
i am of course , a far cry from the likes of gandhi , but perhaps i can inspire a teenager out there to be the architect of her future
maybe a young woman in a sari will be able to put on a suit for the first time in her life
besides , it 's kind of cool to be in a calendar .
