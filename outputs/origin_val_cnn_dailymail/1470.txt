oxbridge has been branded â institutionally racist â and a â finishing school for the private school system â by one of its own academics
the devastating criticism was delivered by professor diane reay , who accused the universities of â accentuating elitism â among the privileged
she added that black and white working class students were still small in number and marginalized , despite drives to attract more youngsters from poorer backgrounds
oxbridge has been branded â institutionally racist â and a â finishing school for the private school system â by a cambridge ( pictured ) academic the professor of education at cambridge called for further measures to ensure more students from disadvantaged backgrounds were admitted
in a report by the race relations think tank the runnymede , professor diane reay said working class students at cambridge saw the university as a â a white , middle class bubble â
she said her research suggested that â positive discrimination â was at work in oxbridge , bestowing advantage on the already advantaged
figures released last year showed oxford has the lowest proportion of state school pupil entrants â 57.4 per cent â of any university in england , once small and specialist higher education institutions are excluded
at cambridge , 63 per cent of undergraduates admitted were from state schools
in the runnymede report , aiming higher : race , inequality and diversity in the academy , professor diane reay suggested varying success rates of different applicant groups demonstrated â institutional racism â
policies such as rarely accepting candidates with less traditional qualifications , not catering for part - time students and not allowing undergraduates to work during term time effectively rule out the majority of working class and particularly black and ethnic minority candidates , she said
in 2013 , 25.4 per cent of white students applying to oxford won a place
the success rate of bangladeshi and pakistani students was under seven per cent , while black caribbean students had a 14.3 per cent conversion rate and african students a 13 per cent success rate
the devastating criticism was delivered by professor diane reay , who accused the universities of â accentuating elitism â among the privileged ( file picture of oxford ) at cambridge , black caribbean applicants had a 24.3 per cent chance of success compared to 29 per cent for white applicants
the figure for black african students was 9.2 per cent , and bangladeshi and pakistani students 13.8 and 13.6 per cent respectively
she said : â oxbridge remains the equivalent of a finishing school for the private school system , polishing , refining and accentuating the elitism and sense of superiority acquired in earlier schooling
â the academic suggested that affirmative action , such as quotas for certain groups , were needed to counteract â the growing class and race inequalities that are pervasive across the higher education sector â
both universities said they â strongly rejected â the professor âs allegations and outlined the millions of pounds they spend on encouraging students from poor and ethnic backgrounds to apply and on supporting them once they were there
a cambridge spokesman said extensive efforts were made to encourage more applications from black and minority ethnic backgrounds and that such students represented 16 per cent of the intake , which is in line with national population trends
â success rates are influenced by prior school attainment , our entry requirements and the combinations of subjects studied by applicants , â he said
â data shows that ethnic minority admissions to cambridge reflect national trends once prior school attainment has been factored in
choices relating to subject of study and location of university also have a substantial bearing on entry rates by ethnic group
our commitment to improving access to the cambridge is longstanding and unwavering
â a spokesman for oxford said : â we reject in the strongest terms any allegations of institutional bias or discrimination
such claims are unsubstantiated , and we are concerned that unfounded allegations could undermine our efforts to attract and admit black and minority ethnic students
just under a quarter of all oxford students of known ethnicity are from black and minority ethnic backgrounds
