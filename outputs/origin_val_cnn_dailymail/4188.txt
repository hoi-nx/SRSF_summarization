with gale - force winds and torrential rain greeting england on their first visit to the devon city in 26 years , it took both sides some time to get into their stride
gradually john swift , the chelsea midfielder currently on loan at swindon town in league one , began to take control of the midfield and he forced a fingertip save from usa goalkeeper jeff caldwell
the states were happy to play on the counter-attack and sunderland goalkeeper jordan pickford had to be alert to deny maki tall
most of the crowd thought england had taken the lead when leeds united 's alex mowatt sent a left - footed shot towards goal , but it had actually found the side - netting

taking one touch to control , he fired past caldwell to split the teams at half - time
the young lions continued to boss the game after the break and alex mowatt went close again , firing over when norwich city defender harry toffolo found him well - placed inside the box
