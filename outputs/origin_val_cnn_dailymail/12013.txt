the answer to life âs questions may not lie at the bottom of a bottle of whisky , but a smart label on its side could offer some words of ' wisdom '
soon smart labels could grace the sides of johnnie walker whisky bottles , which would send advertising messages to consumers who scan them with their phones
the labels can also detect when the bottle is sealed and when it is opened
a prototype bottle has gone on show at mobile world congress in barcelona the prototype â smart bottle â has gone on show at mobile world congress in barcelona
it is the brainchild of drinks giant diageo and thinfilm , which develops printed electronics
the bottle has sensor tags using thinfilm 's opensense technology on its labels that allow the transmission of adverts either when consumers are looking to buy whisky , or afterwards
it uses a smartphone âs near field communication ( nfc ) capabilities so that a handset can be hovered over the label to unlock its digital secrets
the bottle has sensor tags using thinfilm 's opensense technology on its label that allows the transmission of adverts either when consumers are looking to buy whisky , or afterwards
it also tells a user that the bottle was properly sealed and when it is open ( illustrated by the prototype ) scanning the label could , for example , give consumers special offers , cocktail recipes or film content
the technology could also be useful for the london - based drinks firm in tracking the movement of drinks from shops to homes
the sensor tags will remain readable after the factory seal has been broken so that they provide â an additional layer of security in protecting the authenticity of the product , â diageo says
this is because unlike static qr codes , which are easy to copy and do nât include sensors , the new labels will be permanently encoded in the factory do they ca nât be copied or electronically modified
scanning the label ( pictured ) with a phone could , for example , give consumers special offers , cocktail recipes or film content
the technology could also be useful for the london - based drinks firm in tracking the movement of drinks from shops to homes the cloud - based software behind the integration is powered by a company called evrything , which is delivering the mobile experience activated through the product label
â mobile technology is changing the way we live and as a consumer brands company we want to embrace its power to deliver amazing new consumer experiences in the future , â said helen michels , global innovation driver , at diageo
â our collaboration with thin film electronics allows us to explore all the amazing new possibilities enabled by smart - bottles for consumers , retailers and our own business and it sets the bar for technology innovation in the drinks industry
â davor sutija , ceo of thin film electronics , said : â today 's conventional nfc mobile marketing solutions are not technologically advanced enough to create immersive or customisable consumer experiences
â but he says that the â smart bottle â technology will provide diageo with intelligence as well as creating â engaging experiences for its customers â
rare , vintage bottles of whisky can cost anywhere up to $ 1.4 million ( Â£ 874,150 ) and can be aged in oak barrels stored in cellars for years
but there 's a wooden tool that saves time and money called â whiskey element , â which claims to be able to make cheap liquor taste expensive in just 24 hours
the oak sticks are specially designed to â age â the drink by filtering out impurities and infusing the whisky with a more woody flavour similar to pricier tipples
whiskey element claims to make cheap alcohol taste like expensive whiskey by infusing it with a woody flavour when placed in a decanter ( pictured ) the sticks have lots of grooves cut in them to increase the overall - surface area touching the liquid
they are intended to be placed in a bottle or decanter of cheap whisky to replicate the taste of a more expensive tipple
they do this via â accelerated transpiration through capillary action , â according to the portland , oregon - based company âs kickstarter page , which means the liquid travels through tiny tubes in the wood
peniche explained that wood barrels are used for containing whisky because the wood is cut vertically so that capillaries are not exposed to the liquid , meaning that it does n't slowly seep out of the sides of the wood
the sticks are made by cutting the wood horizontally to provide a â shorter distance for whisky to travel through its repetitive exposure to the capillaries , so it matures much faster and becomes of a much higher quality
â to test the product , the inventors put their sticks through their paces in the lab , where they compared top shelf whiskey costing over $ 100 a bottle that had been aged for over 10 years , with cheaper versions treated with a whiskey element
they analysed the chemicals found in expensive and cheap whisky
researchers found that the cheap bottles contained high levels of methoxy-phenyl-oxime â found in pig and mouse faeces â and acetaldehyde , a compound blamed for hangovers
in comparison , the expensive aged bottles contained almost none of either
the researchers then added the oak sticks to the cheap liquor and waited 24 hours before testing them again
mr peniche said : â the results were amazing
they showed characteristics found in top - shelf aged whiskeys with notably higher levels of the chemicals responsible for good flavours and smells , as well as a significant reduction in methoxy-phenyl-oxime and acetaldehyde
â a two pack of the sticks cost $ 12 ( Â£ 7.50 ) .
