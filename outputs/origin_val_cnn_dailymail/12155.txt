hong kong general xu has died of bladder cancer , chinese state media has reported
xu , who passed away at a hospital on sunday , became one of the highest - profile figures in chinese 's military to be caught up in president xi 's war on corruption last year , when the government launched an investigation into him on the back of bribery allegations
the court decided not to prosecute xu due to his illness , but said his illegal income , including the bribes he was determined to have accepted would be handled in accordance with the law
formerly a vice-chairman of chinese 's central military commission , the body which runs the two - million strong pla , xu was also expelled from the chinese communist party and had his rank of general revoked , according to a statement from the state - run xinhua news agency
a seven - month investigation , which began in march last year , found that xu took advantage of his position to assist the promotion of other people
he confessed to accepting bribes personally and through his family
he was also found to have sought profits for others in exchange for bribes taken through his family members
the amount he received was " extremely huge , " the statement added
in chinese president xi 's annual new year speech , he reiterated chinese 's " zero - tolerance " stance towards corruption , vowing to keep " waving high the sword against corruption " and " fastening the cage of regulations
" 2014 saw xi take down two top officials in chinese 's fight against corruption , in addition to xu
he took down former domestic security czar zhou yongkang , likely soon to become the most senior chinese official ever to face corruption charges , and ling jihua , a top aide to ex-president hu jintao
state media have touted the trio as the three biggest " tigers " caught in xi 's now - two year old anti-graft campaign , which has a stated goal of targeting both " tigers and flies " -- high - and low - ranking officials .
