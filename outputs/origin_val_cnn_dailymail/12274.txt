if azealia banks is asked to leave the american , that will probably be ok with her
" i hate everything about this country , " the rapper told playboy interviewer rob tannenbaum
" like , i hate fat white american
all the people who are crunched into the middle of american , the real fat and meat of american , are these racist conservative white people who live on their farms
those little teenage girls who work at kmart and have a racist grandma -- that 's really american
" those comments were preceded by remarks about race and racism , topics she frequently addresses on her no - holds - barred twitter feed
" it 's always about race
lorde can run her mouth and talk sh * t about all these other b * * * hes , but y'all are n't saying she 's angry
if i have something to say , i get pushed into the corner , " she said
" really , the generational effects of jim crow and poverty linger on
as long as i have my money , i 'm getting the f * * k out of here and i 'm gon na leave y'all to your own devices
" her comments were n't limited to issues
banks also lashed out at fellow artists pharrell , kendrick lamar and kanye west
" in american society , the game is to be a nonthreatening black person , " she said
" that 's why you have pharrell or kendrick lamar saying , ' how can we expect people to respect us if we do n't respect ourselves ? ' he 's playing that nonthreatening black man sh * t , and that gets all the white soccer moms going , ' we love him
' " even kanye west plays a little bit of that game , " she added
she did approve of jay z , noting that " has n't played any of those games
