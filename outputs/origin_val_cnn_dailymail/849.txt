british holidaymakers face three more years of being ripped off by extortionate mobile phone ' roaming charges ' after brussels failed to scrap them as promised
eu governments agreed that the roaming charges for mobile phone users abroad should stay in place until at least until the end of 2018
the decision comes despite meps voting for an end to the charges which they said were too high
the european parliament had said roaming charges should be scrapped by the end of 2015
british holidaymakers face three more years of being ripped off by extortionate ' roaming charges ' for using their mobile phones abroad but at a meeting in brussels , eu governments tonight agreed to allow large mobile phone firms to continue levying extra charges on travellers for at least another three years , when the situation could be reviewed
governments said consumers should be given a small roaming allowance to use outside their home country from the middle of next year , but any usage above it should still be subject to further charges
the decision is a major blow to british tourists travelling to europe
a recent study showed that the average british person spends an extra Â£ 120 on their mobile phone on each trip abroad
the issue of scrapping roaming charges has seen the eu come head - to - head with the telecoms industry , who argue it will affect their revenues
tonight 's decision comes despite the european parliament 's decision to scrap roaming charges by the end of 2015 some members of the parliament immediately criticised the decision
the alliance of liberals and democrats said : ' the only winners from it are national telecoms operators themselves
member states should hang their heads in shame
' europe consumer groups , speaking through an umbrella organisation , the beuc , condemned the plan as ' outrageous '
' roaming is not justifiable in a single market , ' they said
the member states must now agree a common position with both the european parliament and commission before changes take effect , so negotiations in the coming months are likely to be hard - fought
