they quickly discovered it was a hoax and only contained hair dye and blue tissue paper , nottingham crown court was told
the 26 - year - old , who worked in a boots warehouse at the time , admitted dispatching a parcel with the intention of inducing a belief that it was likely to explode or ignite and cause personal injury or damage to property
he was sentenced to 12 months in prison , suspended for 18 months , and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work
