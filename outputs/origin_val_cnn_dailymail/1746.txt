mayfair on the monopoly board may be worth only Â£ 400 , but with soaring house prices the reality today is eye - wateringly different
a four - storey townhouse in the exclusive london area now sells for Â£ 40million , while even a flat in the cheapest monopoly area of whitechapel has gone for nearly Â£ 5million
in light of such ludicrous prices , one estate agent has now re-imagined the classic board game â set in desirable english market towns
the new mayfair is picturesque beaconsfield in buckinghamshire , where homes go for more than Â£ 872,000 on average
petworth , in the south downs national park in west sussex , is the second most exclusive town on the board , taking the place of park lane
old kent road and whitechapel road â both worth Â£ 60 and often seen as the game âs dud streets unless you can build a hotel on them â have been replaced by morpeth and wooler in northumberland , where average houses sell for about Â£ 220,000
upmarket estate agent savills has also reinvented bond street , regent street and oxford street as harpenden , berkhamsted , and bushey , all in hertfordshire , where family homes routinely sell for more than Â£ 500,000
piccadilly , leicester square and coventry street , priced at between Â£ 260 and Â£ 280 , become salcombe in devon , and chipping campden and northleach in the cotswolds
at the slightly cheaper end , ilkley in west yorkshire becomes the new northumberland avenue , nearby wetherby replaces pall mall , and poynton in cheshire is Â£ 120 pentonville road
lucian cook , of savills , said : â we looked for towns with the highest average value across different regions of the british
â the current version of monopoly was printed by parker brothers in 1935 , although earlier versions date back to 1904 .
