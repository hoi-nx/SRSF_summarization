two particularly hungry , exotic termite species have apparently found love halfway around the world , causing concern for scientists
asian and formosan subterranean termites , two of the most destructive termite species on the planet , are could be mating in florida
they are producing hybrid colonies of ' super termites ' that are growing at twice the normal rate
asian ( pictured ) and formosan subterranean termites , two of the most destructive termite species on the planet , are could be mating in south florida.they are producing hybrid colonies of ' super termites ' that are growing at twice the normal rate together , asian and formosan subterranean termites , are responsible for much of the estimated $ 40 billion in economic losses attributed to termites annually
the formosan termites originated in china but now are established throughout the southeast and blamed for roughly $ 300m in property damage each year in new orleans alone
asian termites normally found in tropical south - eastern asian have spread to brazil , the caribbean and south florida
asian termites are not expected to spread farther north in the us than south florida because they do not tolerate colder weather / however , a hybrid might be able to thrive in a greater range than either species alone
their habitat ranges overlap in lush south florida , already home to a daunting number of invasive plant and animal species thriving where they should not
each termite invaded florida several decades ago , but experts believed the colonies did n't mingle because their above ground mating swarms launched in different months
that is , until university of florida researcher chouvenc noticed something unusual about the termite swarms in his fort lauderdale neighbourhood two years ago
the two species were flying around looking for mates at the same time â and they were giving each other that look
the research is preliminary and leaves many questions unanswered , but the idea of a hybrid termite carrying the destructive capabilities of two invasive species worries experts
' that 's big news , ' said messenger , an entomologist at the us department of agriculture
' they 're two bad ones , too
' chouvenc is the lead author of a study published this week i the journal plos one detailing observations of asian and formosan termite swarms in downtown fort lauderdale
in the field , including chouvenc 's own yard , researchers documented the two species swarming at the same time and in the same places
the same behaviour was documented again last year , and chouvenc said he is seeing again this spring
' what we did n't expect to see was when they 're in the same place at the same time , we saw the male asian subterranean termites looking for the female formosan termites in the field , ' chouvenc said
together , asian and formosan ( pictured ) subterranean termites , are responsible for much of the estimated $ 40 billion in economic losses attributed to termites annually ' when we put them in vials and brought them back to the lab , to our biggest surprise they started laying eggs and the eggs started growing
' the resulting ' hybrid ' colony in the lab grew more vigorously than colonies produced by either species alone , researchers said
genetic analysis confirmed they were looking at a hybrid species
similar hybridisation has been documented in invasive bee and fire ant species , but not in termites
the two termite species also are found together on the island of oahu in hawaii and in taiwan , but the simultaneous swarms and hybridisation found in florida appear to be a new phenomenon
it is still unknown whether a hybrid colony has survived in the wild in fort lauderdale , or whether the hybrids bred in the lab can reproduce
it is still unknown whether a hybrid colony has survived in the wild in fort lauderdale in the south of florida female termites can lay millions of eggs , but it takes five to eight years for a colony to produce the mature adults that fly in the mating swarms
' let 's keep our fingers crossed that they 're not able [ to reproduce ] and that they 're donkey termites , ' said messenger , who reviewed the data but did not participate in the university of florida study
even if hybrid termites can not reproduce , they could cause damage over many years
alone , each species is a challenge to control
their below - ground colonies are bigger than those of native termites and can be hard to find
liquid insecticides injected into the soil or baited traps are effective ways for homeowners to fight back against asian and formosan termites , and those methods should work against any hybrid , messenger said
