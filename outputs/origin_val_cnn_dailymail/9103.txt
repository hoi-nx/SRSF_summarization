former tv weatherman talbot has been jailed for five years for sex attacks on young boys tv weatherman talbot has been jailed for five years for indecently assaulting two schoolboys when he was a teacher
talbot , 65 , a regular on the floating weather map in liverpool 's albert dock for itv 's this morning show , was described as a ' chancer ' who used his ' extrovert personality ' to gain the trust of his victims
talbot , who was cleared of assaulting three other boys , was sentenced by judge mort at manchester minshull street crown court today
the judge told him : ' you deliberately and indecently assaulted the two of them for your own gratification
' talbot , who sat in the dock wearing glasses and a purple jumper over a shirt and grey trousers , showed no emotion as he was jailed
he appeared relaxed as he entered the dock and acknowledged people in the packed courtroom
suzanne goddard qc , defending , said there was little that could be said in mitigation
she said talbot had lost a stone in weight during his time in custody but was ' accustoming himself ' to life in jail
ms goddard said : ' he knows he must now receive a custodial sentence
he has come to terms with that
' the jury at last month 's trial heard that talbot was ' obsessed ' with teenage boys throughout his teaching career and ' could not help himself ' around them when under the influence of drink
among the prosecution witnesses at the trial were the stone roses ' singer ian brown who said talbot gave masturbation practice as homework
talbot , of bowdon , greater manchester , was convicted of two counts of indecent assault in relation to two victims and cleared of eight counts of indecent assault in relation to three other complainants
talbot rose to fame when he presented weather forecasts from his floating map on itv 's this morning four of the complainants were teenage pupils at altrincham grammar school , where talbot taught biology , while the other attended a high school in gateshead , where the defendant was at teacher training college
the former science teacher denied anything sexual or even inappropriate occurred between himself and the altrincham grammar school pupils , while he said sexual activity with the gateshead complainant only happened when the boy had turned 16
both of talbot 's victims were assaulted on school canal barge trips in the cheshire area in the mid 1970s
the first victim , who thought he was 14 at the time , said the teacher abused him after a mock naked orgy involving up to 10 boys and talbot
talbot told him to share a bed with him as there were not enough bunk beds to go round and performed a sex act on him
it emerged that he had previously reported the weatherman to police on four separate occasions dating back to 1992 but no action had been taken
the second victim , who also thought he may have been aged 14 at the time , was abused on another barge trip in similar circumstances
talbot sat in the dock wearing a purple jumper and grey trousers and was unemotional when sentenced he said that boys would take turns to sleep in talbot 's bed during the trip and when it was his turn the defendant ' started talking to me about sexual stuff ' before indecently assaulting him
the complainant said when he was aged in his late 20s he wrote to itv granada to tell them talbot had abused him
the court heard that talbot 's teaching career came to ' an abrupt end ' in may 1984 following an indecent proposal he made to two pupils at his home
he offered his bed for the night to the 15 - year - old boys and said to them : ' make sure you leave room for me in the middle
' following the verdicts , it can be reported that a number of similar complaints against talbot about offences said to have been committed in scotland have been passed by police to the procurator fiscal
the offences took place when talbot was working as a teacher in altrincham , greater manchester edinburgh - born talbot moved at the age of seven to sale , greater manchester , and later studied a-levels at sale grammar school
after a spell at teacher training college in the newcastle area he joined altrincham grammar school in 1974
he resigned in disgrace in 1984 and went into television a short time later , with one of his first jobs on a saturday morning children 's show
the investigation was triggered in december 2012 following publicity into a separate historic abuse inquiry at another altrincham school , st ambrose college , which led to a nine - year jail term for ex-teacher alan morris
judge mort told talbot : ' you are a man of 65 with no previous convictions
you have been convicted by a jury from clear evidence of indecently assaulting two boys when you were a teacher
' the judge outlined the offences and talbot 's background as a teacher
he said talbot 's approach to teaching was ' different ' and ' less formal ' than other staff members at the school and described him as a ' popular ' teacher
he said he may have taken pupils on as many as 38 trips and told talbot the offences he had been convicted of were not isolated incidents
judge mort said : ' you had , on other occasions , abused your position to offend
' the judge said both victims had been affected by the abuse by talbot , with one suffering from mental health issues since the incident
one of the victims made repeated complaints about talbot to police before he was charged
judge mort said aggravating features included the degree of planning of the offences , the use of alcohol on the victims and the abuse of trust
he said : ' you calculated the boys would be too confused , guilt - ridden or embarrassed to disclose what happened
' judge mort sentenced talbot to two and a half years for each offence , to run consecutively
he said he would serve half his sentence before being considered for release on licence
ian brown , the former singer with band the stone roses , gave evidence against talbot during the trial investigating officer detective chief inspector graham brock from greater manchester police said after the hearing : ' while working as a science teacher talbot organised many trips with pupils
' it was during these trips that he plied boys with drink and orchestrated situations to be alone with his victims in order to indecently assault them to feed his own sexual desires
' you can imagine the excitement of a teenage boy setting off on a canal trip with friends and a teacher , who he should expect to look after him , only to return with his childhood destroyed
' put simply , these offences reflect an abhorrent abuse of trust by a man who has proven to have no regard for the innocence of youth he was employed to nurture
' had these offences occurred today , they would be considered child sexual exploitation and tackling this heinous crime is the absolute priority for greater manchester police and our partners under project phoenix
' protecting children is everyone 's responsibility and it is crucial that we work together to identify individuals who prey on vulnerable children
