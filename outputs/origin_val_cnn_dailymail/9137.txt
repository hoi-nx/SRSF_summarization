if roy of the rovers made a comeback as a defender , he would be an all - action brazilian with electric hair , have 6.5million instagram followers and call them all â geezers â
the new comic book star would score a magnificent booming header against his former team , celebrate with a screaming knee slide , scrap with the evil baddie of the opposition ( diego costa ) and finish the struggle victorious , shaking hands with the ground staff before exiting for his next adventure
the problem for the script writers , if they were to copy the life and times of luiz , is that they would have no idea what luiz was going to do next , so what chance do the opposition â or his team - mates â have ? luiz jumps for joy after his bullet header forced the game in to extra-time on wednesday night luiz celebrates victory with team - mates thiago motta ( right ) and maxwell at the final whistle when you expect luiz to be heading it clear , he âs chasing the glory , when you expect him to be chasing the glory , he appears from nowhere to head it clear
losing 7 - 0 in a world cup semi-final , he still thinks he can get a goal back
who knows ? a hat - trick
on that occasion it finished 7 - 1 and the one - man reconnaissance mission broke down , leaving gaps behind him for the german team to exploit
would it change his approach ? of course not
even on wednesday night , with psg drawing 2 - 2 at chelsea with minutes remaining and set to go through with 10 men on away goals , he turned up on the right wing to collect the ball and retain possession
luiz looks on in disgust as germany celebrate one of their seven goals in last summer 's world cup semi-final he âs a defender who sees defending as a part - time job
so concerned was laurent blanc , a world cup - winning centre back with 97 caps , which suggests he knows a bit about defending , that he played luiz in midfield in the first leg , with two centre backs behind him for cover
he was back in the back four for the second leg and , when it works , it works spectacularly
who else could have got them through when their talisman , zlatan ibrahimovic , had been sent off ? luiz could have been sent off too for his feuding with diego costa , but instead he rose majestically in the land of the giants that is chelsea âs penalty area to send a thunderball of a header into the roof of the net
the defender stumble backwards after one of many confrontations with diego costa on wednesday night to get ahead of terry , cahill or his marker branislav ivanovic takes great skill , movement and courage but to meet the ball with such ferocity â¦ maybe there âs more to luiz than his sideshow bob nickname and carefree style
not just a former player quietly enjoying the moment against the club that sold him , but a full - pelt emotional surge of joy
he said he would nât celebrate on his first return to stamford bridge , but who can blame him for loving the moment ? it was a goal worth celebrating
chelsea sold him because they thought the deal was too good to refuse and , presumably , because they thought terry and cahill could do the job better
few can argue with that â terry , especially , has been magnificent as a defender this season but can he hit a dipping , swerving free kick , cristiano ronaldo style , from more than 30 yards , as luiz did on wednesday night ? mourinho has a word with luiz on the touchline as psg manager laurent blanc watches on luiz rises to beat branislav ivanovic to thiago motta 's corner and head home psg 's equaliser not everyone is a luiz fan â jamie redknapp wrote on this website that â whoever struck the deal to sell luiz for Â£ 50m deserves a knighthood â
and , as chief sports writer samuel reported , mourinho thought luiz was too much of an optimist as a defender
samuel wrote : â mourinho wanted miseries at the back
he wanted players who feared the roof was about to fall in , the move was going to break down , a counter attack was only a stray pass away
luiz was nât like that
he roamed , he left gaps , he charged upfield and if that break went wrong he thought it would nât matter
he did nât check for danger , he was rarely alarmed
luiz was too much of an optimist to defend properly
â the optimist will make mistakes
he will raid upfield when he should be focussing on shutting the door , but he had a lot of fun at stamford bridge on wednesday night and he âs still in the champions league
luiz has a moment of reflection as psg progress to the quarter - finals of the champions league
