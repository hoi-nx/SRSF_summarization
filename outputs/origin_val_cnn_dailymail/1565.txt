the final decision is up to the judge
authorities claimed the 49 - year - old woman forced savannah to run and carry wood for hours as punishment for a lie about candy
savannah eventually had a seizure and died three days later in a hospital
the defense denied the woman meant the girl any harm , but jurors rejected that claim
garrard had testified she only made the girl pick up sticks in her yard as punishment the day of her collapse
garrard testified that the girl did run , but only as practice for races at school
prosecutors contended that garrard refused to let savannah stop running even after the girl was vomiting and begging for an end to the exercise
in court , they cited a school bus surveillance video that captured garrard saying she would run the girl and teach her a lesson
garrard walks to the etowah county judicial building on friday to prepare for a hearing
she now faces the death penalty or life without parole assistant district attorney carol griffith said garrard killed the child intentionally by berating her and making her run around the yard picking up sticks ' she was tortured , ' griffith said
defense attorney richard rhea had portrayed his client as a devoted grandmother who was helping to look after 9 - year - old savannah while the girl 's father was overseas working as a contractor for the u.s. state department
some witnesses who testified about seeing garrard force savannah to run seemed more upset in recalling the scene from the stand than garrard appeared to be , griffith said
but rhea urged jurors to ask why none of the witnesses intervened if they thought the abuse was so awful that day
the 49 - year - old walks in handcuffs around her feet , waist and arms , accompanied by two officers he said , ' i think we have all had the thought : " if it was that bad , why did n't they do something ? '' he said witnesses did n't notify police about their concerns until days later , after they heard girl was on life support
' then it becomes " oh yeah , i witnessed boot camp
i witnessed the drill sergeant from hell " , ' he said
garrard was the final witness to testify on wednesday and attorneys for both sides concluded their closing arguments friday afternoon
garrard has been in jail awaiting trial for three years , and that time typically would be applied to any potential sentence
savannah 's stepmother jessica mae hardin has also been charged with her murder , which carries a life sentence
the girl was in the care of her stepmother and grandmother while her father was away
savannah hardin , who is awaiting trial , gave birth while in custody in february 2012
a 911 operator told the court garrard asked ' for a smoke ' while the girl was unconscious outside their home
