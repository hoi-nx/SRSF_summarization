a tour guide in the scottish highlands has captured the amazing moment a meteor burned up in the atmosphere in a stunning image
his long - exposure shot of loch ness shows the shooting star streaking across the sky
and the event is so bright that it casts its light across the water
his 30 - second long exposure shot ( shown ) was taken with a sony rx100
he said that it was just â sheer dumb luck ' that he managed to get the photo the photographer was john alasdair macdonald , a tour guide in the scottish highlands from drumnadrochit on the west shore of loch ness , who runs the website called the hebridean explorer
mr john alasdair macdonald captured the 30 - second long image using a sony rx100 compact camera at about 9pm on sunday
and he said that it was just â sheer dumb luck â that he managed to get the photo
an asteroid is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions or the early solar system
most are located between mars and jupiter in the main belt
a comet is a rock covered in ice , methane and other compounds
their orbits take them much further out of the solar system
a meteor is what we call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up
this debris itself is known as a meteoroid
most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere
if any of this meteoroid makes it to earth , it is called a meteorite
meteors , meteoroids and meteorites normally originate from asteroids and comets
for example , if earth passes through the detail of a comet , much of the debris burns up in the atmosphere , forming a meteor shower
mr john alasdair macdonald , 42 , wanted to take pictures of the night to advertise the area for his business
the father - of - three , who lives in drumnadrochit , near inverness , said : â i âve never seen a shooting star before , i could nât believe it
i quickly checked to see if my camera had picked it up , and it had
my wife called it sheer dumb luck
â i was nât out looking for it , it was completely unexpected
it was a total fluke
â howes , a professional astronomer , told mailonline that automatic triggering systems can be used to detect the bright motion of a meteor and â start the cameras rolling â if others want to attempt to replicate the photo
â this one is , however , very aesthetically pleasing , â he added
also of interest are the colours in the water in the photo , which are likely due to the particular scattering of light
eagle - eyed viewers might notice the colours of the irish flag in the water , very apt considering it is st patrick âs day tomorrow

hundreds of meteors enter earth 's atmosphere every day ( illustration shown ) a meteor like this is unlikely to very large , but the speed at which they enter the atmosphere produces the amazing shooting star
â in terms of size , it âs hard to tell with no scale reference , but a fireball this size could typically come from an object about the size of a baseball to basketball , â said mr howes
hundreds of meteors enter earth âs atmosphere every day , but very few - if any - make it to the surface as meteorites
however , some experts have warned that we need to make more of an effort to track incoming asteroids , as they can cause damage - such as the chelyabinsk meteor in russia on 15 february 2013 , which seemingly came out of nowhere but injured hundreds when it exploded near the ground .
