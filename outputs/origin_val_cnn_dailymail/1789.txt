the lavishly gifted exeter threequarter has already overcome more hurdles than many encounter in a lifetime
stand his ground with troubled foster children ? naturally
ignore advice from coaches that he was too small for rugby as a teenager ? absolutely
battle type 1 diabetes to forge a burgeoning professional rugby career ? no problem.outshine jonny wilkinson on his first european appearance ? by a distance.be included as the wild card in stuart lancaster 's world cup squad ? just maybe
exeter playmaker slade ( right ) is being touted as a potential wildcard for england 's world cup squad the 22 - year - old has been in superb form for exeter this season and could slot in nicely in the england set - up for his many talents , slade , 22 , named aviva premiership player of the month for march , remains humble , grounded and reluctant to talk up his world cup prospects
but his consistently high - quality displays in the exeter midfield are making his case hard to ignore
the only player name - checked by stuart lancaster as a possible world cup bolter after impressing on attachment to the squad during the six nations , the lithe left - footer from plymouth has been told he will definitely feature in england 's pre-world cup camp where he can stake a claim for inclusion
many believe he could yet prove england 's missing midfield link as a physically robust , footballing 12 of enormous potential
' it 's nice to have that knowledge that i 'll be there and have a chance to stake my claim , ' he said
' everyone likes to feel they 're ready for that next step
i feel i 'm capable but it 's not up to me
it does n't get any bigger than a home world cup and of course i 'd love to be involved
who would n't ? but i realise i 'm still some way down the pecking order and have plenty to do
' slade 's humility is evident as we sit and talk in sandy park 's main stand enjoying the milky devonian spring sunshine
on the field , he has more of a strut ; confident in his skills and sure of his intent
a first international cap is a matter of when , not if
but just like the exeter club he joined as a teenager , slade refuses to get carried away by success
he is wise beyond his years , having lived with diabetes since a chance diagnosis at the age of 18
standing up for his younger brothers when his parents took on foster children also opened his eyes to a world beyond the rugby field
' mum used to own a hairdressing salon but sold it when she had kids and became a respite foster carer instead , ' he said
' it puts things in perspective seeing kids my age who 'd had such difficult upbringings or had been taken away from their parents because they were n't fit to look after them
' when they started kicking off you 'd have to stop them but i 'd always try to take a minute to sit back and think , ' bloody hell , they 've had it tough ' and think about why they 'd be reacting in that way
it was a pretty good life experience
' slade has overcome many challenges in his career , including diagnosis with type 1 diabetes aged 18 a less welcome experience has been the daily injections of insulin and regular blood tests required to check his blood sugar is not at dangerous levels
typically , slade considers his glass half full , not half empty
' getting the diagnosis at 18 was pretty tough to take , ' he said
' my dad had it as well so i knew how it would affect my life and how organised i was going to have to be
still , while the other lads get their supplements and beetroot shakes before a match i get a nice big cup of jelly babies , so it 's not all bad
' thriving under the tutelage of director of rugby rob baxter at the upwardly mobile aviva premiership club , slade is making a name for himself by stepping up to every challenge put in front of him
he first made the headlines as a 20 - year - old in 2012 with an outrageously composed display against jonny wilkinson and his toulon team - mates after being called on as a first - half replacement for gareth steenson
five years earlier , he would have been excused for giving up the game
' i went for a county under 15s trial and was told i was too small , ' he said
' i was devastated but it made me work harder the following year
hitting my growth spurt probably helped too
' now standing 6ft 2in and weighing in excess of 14st , slade has proved his defensive mettle countless times this season , most notably against leicester early in the season when he proved a match for his hulking opposite man manu tuilagi on a string of occasions
similar in style to wallaby maestro matt giteau , slade has taken heart from the performances of fellow ' lightweights ' jj and george ford during england 's six nations campaign
' i obviously understand and respect that winning collisions is a massive part of rugby but there still has to be space for players like george ford and jj , ' he said
slade kicks a penalty during the aviva premiership match between exeter and bath at twickenham ' jj is not the biggest of players but his footwork and the way he beats defenders is top class
it 's the same scenario as we had here with me and sam hill in the centre
two different styles who can play to each other 's strengths and cover every base
it 's the beauty of having a ball player and a physical , trucking - up type centre
' comfortable at fly - half or centre and an outstanding left - footed goal - kicker , slade would be a more than useful squad player
if he can make the cut , indications are he has the temperament for international rugby
' i 've always relished the challenge and found the bigger the occasion the more excited i get by it and the more i enjoy it , ' he added
so , what money slade at no12 when england play fiji at twickenham on september 18 ? it is still a long shot , but he has already made a habit of defying the odds
