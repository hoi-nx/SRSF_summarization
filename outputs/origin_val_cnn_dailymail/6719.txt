china officials have taken an unusual step in the fight against scrap metal thieves by starting to fit their manholes with gps tracking devices
councils across the country are rushing to snap up the new high - tech manhole covers as they try to curb the theft of the old , low - tech versions , according to the people 's daily online
the seemingly drastic measure was taken after previous anti-theft measures - chaining the manhole covers to street lamps - left officials red - faced , turning for sale in various places around the world
high tech : the new manhole covers are fitted with tracking devices to help authorities find the thieves problem : more than 240,000 manholes were stolen in beijing over a 10 year period , thanks to metal values the chains also proved unpopular , with many pointing out they could easily be cut , and were dangerous for people walking along the street
one man has even demanded compensation after falling flat on his face , thanks to the chain
it is hoped these new covers , which were developed by a china tech company , will not only put would - be thieves off stealing the items , but also help track those who do give into temptation
the covers , along with drain grills , can fetch high prices on the black market , as the price of scrap metal has spiraled in recent years
it has been estimated that more than 240,000 manhole covers were stolen from beijing 's streets in the 10 years to 2013 alone
measures : previous attempts at curbing thefts - like tying the manholes to lamp posts - have not worked the new covers , designed to have shock absorption and noise reduction features , are made out of a metal with a far lower value , as a further deterrent
a test batch of 100 smart manhole covers will be placed on streets in the city of hangzhou this month , and - if it is a success - they will be added throughout the city
but it is not just about the money
officials have revealed there is a safety concern motivating their purchases as well , as people could trip on an upturned manhole
tao xiaomin , of hangzhou urban management office , explained : ' when a cover is moved and the tilt angle is greater than 15 degrees , the tag will send an alarm signal to us
