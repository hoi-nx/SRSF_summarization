emilio butragueno believes a miss by bale was a turning point in the el clasico defeat to barcelona and the madrid director does not include the wales star among the players he believes can revive the club 's title hopes
bale skewed a shot wide after the ball fell to him unmarked in the penalty area from a corner in the 43rd minute
madrid were in the ascendancy at the time but were punished for not making their dominance pay in the second half , as luis suarez struck in the 56th minute to decide the encounter at the nou camp and send barcelona four points clear of madrid atop la liga
bale has been criticised by fans , spanish media and a madrid director for his el clasico display emilio butragueno ( left ) believes bale 's miss at the end of the first half was a crucial moment in el clasico bale ( right ) sent a shot wide after getting the ball from a corner in the 43rd minute with the scores level emilio butragueno believes had bale converted the opportunity , madrid would have gone on to win the game and replace barcelona at the summit of the spanish league
' in big games like this , everyone has their moments , but we did n't take ours
we missed some clear chances , ' emilio butragueno said
' we had some very clear chances , particularly bale 's following a corner
we lacked that little bit of luck to get the second
' if we had scored , i think we 'd have given much more
' we 're saddened by the result because in the first half we dominated them , created chances and played really well
' emilio butragueno , a striker who won la liga six times at the santiago bernabeu during his playing career from 1984 - 1995 , believes madrid have the calibre of squad to overturn the four - point deficit that separates madrid and barcelona after the result
but tellingly , he did not list bale in the players he believes will be key to any upturn from carlo ancelotti 's team
' there are 10 games to go
we must continue getting our injured players back , ' emilio butragueno explained
' ( luka ) luka modric had a great game , giving us security in midfield , while james ( rodriguez ) will soon be back with us
bale ( right ) had a goal ruled out in the first half as ronaldo was offside in the build - up play emilio butragueno praised the performances of ronaldo ( left ) and luka modric ( right ) in el clasico bale ( left ) takes on neymar ( centre ) and jordi alba as madrid lost 2 - 1 to barcelona at the nou camp ' ( ronaldo ) ronaldo was also very good and , in the first half , karim benzema was fantastic
' there are still many challenges ahead and this team has enormous potential
' since the turn of the year , bale has struggled to reach the form that coerced madrid to pay tottenham Â£ 86million for his signature in 2013
the attacker , who had a goal disallowed because ronaldo was offside when he headed the ball into bale 's path , appeared to be targeted by madrid supporters after defeat to their fierce rivals
the wales international was confronted by two men in his car as he departed the team 's valdebebas training headquarters late sunday
one smacked his hand on bale 's white bentley and the other kicked out as he sped away
but fan hostility was not the zenith of bale 's woes
bale 's performance was not deemed worthy of a rating by spanish newspaper as on monday bale has struggled to reach top form for madrid this year and has been regularly criticised madrid supporters were seen appearing to vent their anger at bale late on sunday after madrid 's defeat the madrid man would have awoken on monday to find his performance panned by the spanish press
as did not deem his display worthy of a rating in their el clasico coverage , where as marca wrote ' it 's obvious [ president florentino ] perez has paid â¬ 100m for someone worth â¬ 20m
' bale will now link up with the wales side for their euro 2016 qualifier away to israel and the world 's most expensive player would be forgiven for being glad for a break from the pressure currently surrounding madrid
their next game is at home to granada on april 5 , where bale will look to prove emilio butragueno wrong by leading madrid to a return to winning ways .
