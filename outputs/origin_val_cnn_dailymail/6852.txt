uh-oh : this is the moment a four - year - old girl is caught red - faced - literally - after delving into her mother 's make - up bag innocent until proven guilty : but instead of lipstick , little emma meaux from abbeville , louisiana , claims the red stain all over her lips is actually chapstick knowing that she 's been busted , emma meaux admits that she did delve into ' mommy 's make up '
' and did mommy tell you not to play in the make - up ? ' her elder replies
emma meaux responds with a nod ' yes '
she then proceeds to rub her lips together in embarrassment and asks her mother to remove the stain
she says that she does n't like the deep plum color
it 's not the first time emma meaux has been caught getting up to mischief
last summer , she was filmed as she denied eating a chocolate donut and blamed the missing treat on her twin brother ben
however , the chocolate frosting all over her lips served as proof her guilt
doting parents : mandy and her husband brody struggled for years to conceive emma meaux and her twin brother ben , the siblings were born eight weeks premature and spent a month in the neonatal intensive care unit the youngster 's mother mandy previously spoke to dailymail.com about the twins , and unexpectedly revealed that ben is usually the trouble - maker
' ben is definitely the more mischievous of the two , which is why the video was funny to my friends and family , ' she explains
' it was completely out of character for emma meaux
' mandy and her husband brody struggled for seven years to conceive the twins , who were born eight weeks premature and spent a month in the neonatal intensive care unit
' that experience is the reason we try to enjoy all the moments , the good and the bad , ' mandy says
amusing as the videos are , mandy says that instilling good morals in her children is definitely something she takes seriously
' but we also waited a very long time to become parents and because of that we try to enjoy the moments that are funny as well , ' she explains
' we do correct them every time we see them doing something wrong
but that does n't mean that we do n't laugh when they are n't looking
