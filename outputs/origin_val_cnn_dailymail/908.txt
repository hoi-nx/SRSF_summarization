you may think you âre making a healthy decision when opting for a bowl of cereal over a bacon sandwich but a new survey has uncovered the staggering amount of sugar in some of the most popular australian brands

it âs â healthy â counterparts in the cereal aisle such as nutri grain contain eight teaspoons of sugar , while sultana bran and be natural apple and raisin cereal both boast five and a half
in fact , the average sugar content of all 20 cereals analysed by the obesity policy coalition was 19.8g per 100g â that âs almost 20 per cent sugar , about five teaspoons of the dangerous ingredient

while fruit loops boasts nine and a half teaspoons of sugar , despite being labelled promisingly as â no artificial flavours , no artificial colours â

the system helps consumers better understand a product âs overall health rating so they can make informed choices , but our research has revealed very few cereals , as yet , carry the star label , â ms martin said
