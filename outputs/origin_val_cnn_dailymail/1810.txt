rooney said : â with italian defenders , they âre clever defenders
they do anything to try and stop you and you have to be aware of that , and not be frustrated
â they âre a passionate country who love their football and they âre probably the closest in europe to south american teams
they âll do anything to stop you
they âre tough to play against , organised , make it as difficult to play against as possible
they âre the best in europe at doing that
â harry kane âs taking the ball and running at the defenders and getting shots at goal
â that âs all he has to do , â insisted rooney , who hopes to match tommy lawton âs record of scoring in six successive england games , set in 1938 - 39
â i âm sure if he does that the way he has , he âll be fine

roy hodgson said : â it âs great to see people like harry kane come on the scene and it âs a fairytale for him at the moment
he âs got the magic touch
within 80 seconds got a goal on his debut
it does nât get much better
this will be a tougher test , but he will start and hopefully play a large part in it
â our system will be slightly different because we had a lot of forwards available for lithuania , but we lost raheem sterling and danny welbeck , which has changed my thinking
â we still have what i consider to be a very offensive line - up
it âll be hard work for the front six , who have a hard job on their hands
