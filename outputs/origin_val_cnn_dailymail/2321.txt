back on form , back on top and no need for the bournemouth bean counters to worry about the cost of their goal rush
as their manager , howe , put it : â we do nât pay goal bonuses
â on nights like this , that will make for a healthy saving
across the course of this remarkable season , in which their tally of 74 goals is more than any other side in the top four divisions , it must be worth a fortune
bournemouth midfielder matt ritchie hit two as the cherries romped to an easy victory over fulham striker brett pitman celebrates scoring his second goal of the game at craven cottage steve cook ( second left ) is congratulated by his team - mates after rifling home the cherries ' fifth goal cherries manager howe has guided bournemouth back to the summit of the champions table fulham ( 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 ) : bettinelli , hoogland , shaun hutchinson , bodurov , fernando amorebieta , scott parker , ryan tunnicliffe , kavanagh ( fofana , 72 ) , bryan ruiz ( stafylidis , 72 ) , hugo rodallega ( matt smith , 45 ) , ross mccormack

can they do it ? really ? with their 12,000 - capacity ground and 125 - year history of never coming close ? the assumption has long been that this club will slip away quietly
but it is nât quite working out that way
they had their blip in the past few weeks , at one stage going five without a win
but with two straight wins , it is looking increasingly possible that howe will be a top - flight manager next season
for most observers of this bright , english coach , that status has only ever been a matter of time in the coming
he has taken bournemouth to this point from league two and last night led an annihilation of a side not afraid to spend
brett pitman and matt ritchie shared four goals between them and steve cook scored a fifth but , truthfully , the rout could have been greater
suddenly , howe has to manage expectations of automatic promotion
he said : â the ( championship ) lead has changed so many times
it is almost the tag no one wants
â our best finish is 10th in 130 - odd years of football , so to say it âs a failure if we do nât make top two , i do nât buy that
â bournemouth defender tommy elphick is late to slide in as fulham frontman ross mccormack shoots bryan ruiz controls the ball and holds off the challenge of bournemouth midfielder harry arter for symons , the only consolation was that matt smith briefly brought the score back to 3 - 1
the rest of the game , like fulham âs season , was a misery
he said : â no one is under any illusions
look at the table - we know where we are
â symons added : â we never got going here
they were a different level all over the pitch from start to finish
three games in a week against three top sides affected us
we got up for the first two but we could nât get going in this one
it looked top against bottom
â fulham have an eight - point cushion on the relegation zone , but symons said : â until we are mathematically safe we have to be conscious of what is below and behind us
â they were struggling from the start here
within nine minutes , bournemouth âs marc pugh saw a shot nudged over and moments later ryan tunnicliffe cleared brett pitman âs effort off the line
from there , it only got worse for fulham , a side that might well find itself two divisions removed from bournemouth in a few months
they were woeful , a disjointed mess of a team that was summed up early on when hugo rodallega flicked the ball and realised no team - mate was anywhere nearby
fulham defender tim hoogland and bournemouth frontman callum wilson tussle for the ball callum wilson evades fulham 's bodurov before racing forward with the ball during bournemouth 's victory they have won one in 11 in all competitions and that form really is no great mystery
they fell behind after 29 minutes here when brett pitman was given too much space by bodurov and buried a charlie daniels cross
luck was against fulham seven minutes later when matt ritchie âs deflected in off bodurov
brett pitman scored a brilliant third shortly after the hour mark , taking possession in his own half before embarrassing shaun hutchinson and scott parker and nailing the finish
matt smith pulled a goal back for fulham but fernando amorebieta âs red card for tripping callum wilson in the 70th minute killed the home side
matt ritchie was teed up from the resulting free - kick and scored bournemouth âs fourth from the edge of the area
steve cook then rocketed bournemouth âs 74th goal of the season for good measure .
