karachi , pakistani suicide bombers attacked a christian community in eastern pakistani on sunday , setting off two blasts that killed at least 14 people and wounded dozens more , officials said
the pakistani taliban claimed responsibility for the deadly attack and warned of more to come
the explosions , which struck the nishtar colony area in the city of lahore , wounded at least 78 people , said dr. muhammed saeed sohbin , medical superintendent at lahore general hospital
video from the scene aired by cnn affiliate geo news showed twisted metal , shattered glass and panicked residents outside a church compound
ambulance and security personnel were seen moving in
later footage showed water cannons arriving to disperse the crowd
ehsanullah ehsan , a spokesman for the pakistani taliban , said by telephone that his group was responsible for the suicide bombings , declaring that such attacks would continue until sharia law is implemented in pakistani
after a period of disunity , the terrorist group 's three major splinter groups announced last week that they were joining forces again under the name taliban , or taliban
the pakistani military has been waging a campaign against the militant group in north waziristan , one of the loosely governed tribal areas bordering afghanistan
pakistani prime minister sharif , whose government held unsuccessful peace talks with the taliban last year , strongly condemned sunday 's attack , according to a statement from his office
sharif asked provincial governments to tighten security and " take all possible measures " to protect people and property , the statement said
the last major attack on pakistani 's christian community took place in 2013 , when suicide bombers struck a church in the northwestern city of peshawar , killing more than 80 people
more recently , a christian couple were burned to death in november by mob that accused them of blasphemy
" the christian community is a soft target for militant outfits in pakistani , " said rabia mehmood , a researcher at the jinnah institute , a pakistani think tank
" but generally christians and other religious minorities are under a constant threat by the extremist elements in the society and rampant religious intolerance
" on sunday , pope said he learned of the attacks " with pain , with much pain
" he called for peace in pakistani and said that persecution of christians does n't get the attention it deserves
the pope prayed that " this persecution against christians , which the world tries to hide , might end , and that there be peace
" other minorities in the predominantly sunni muslim nation have also been targeted this year
last month , an attack on a shiite mosque in peshawar killed at least 19 worshipers and injured dozens of others
the pakistani taliban reportedly claimed responsibility for that attack , too
