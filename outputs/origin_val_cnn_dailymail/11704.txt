as prime minister cameron knows he can not please all of the people , all of the time
but he could have been forgiven for thinking he could depend on his wife 's vote when asked to name her favourite david
apparently ignoring her husband 's claim to the title , samantha confessed that little britain star walliams had won her over as the ' the funniest man she 'd ever met '
cameron revealed he has lost out to comedian walliams in the battle to be samantha cameron 's favourite david mr cameron hosted a reception in downing street last night to mark st david 's day , the national day of welsh
he told 100 guests in number 10 how he had been left hurt by his wife 's apparent lack of loyalty
among those attending the event were business leaders , sports stars , politicians and television personalities attended the event
they included former paralympic athlete baroness tanni grey thompson , songs of praise presenter aled jones , stage star connie fisher and gabby logan , whose father terry yorath managed and played for welsh 's national football team
mr cameron said he was ' delighted ' that staff from welsh newspaper the western mail were among the guests after asking their readers to name their favourite david in a survey by principality building society
' i do n't know how i 'm getting on , ' he said
' all i know is that samantha admitted to me the other day that her favourite david is walliams , which i thought was slightly disappointing as she 's married to me
' she sat next to him at a charity function and said he was the funniest man she 'd ever met so i 'm going to have to learn to live with that
' mr walliams and mrs samantha cameron , pictured at a burberry fashion show in 2010 , also met at a charity function where he proved himself to be ' the funniest man she 'd ever met ' mr walliams has been a frequent visitor to downing street
in march 2012 the comic , writer and little britain 's got talent judge posed on the steps of number 10 with his supermodel wife lara stone
and in 2013 he led a unicef campaign with 100 schoolchildren , when he could not resist the temptation to touch the prime minister 's hair
mr walliams said later : ' because i 'm taller than him , i offered to stand on a lower step so we would n't look odd together - he 's a tall man but i 'm ridiculously tall
' he 's the prime minister so he should be the one who is most powerful - looking
he told me not to flick my hair like my character sebastian in , who flirted with the pm relentlessly
' and , of course , i immediately did it
it 's almost like i 've got tourette 's
when i 'm told not to do something , i have to do it
' when mr walliams met mr cameron in 2013 ( left ) he could not resit flicking his hair like his character sebastian , an aide to the pm in little britain at last night 's reception mr cameron said he had been researching his family history and his maternal grandmother 's name was llewellyn llewellyn and her grandfather was a tin plate maker from glamorgan called llewellyn llewellyn
' i think that 's real welsh heritage , ' he said .
