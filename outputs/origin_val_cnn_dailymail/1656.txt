humans started dominating the planet causing irreversible damage around the year 1610 , scientists claim
experts have been divided on when mankind caused a lasting impact on the earth 's geology with some suggesting 1964 when the fallout from atomic testing became apparent
but british researchers have now pinpointed 1610 because of the impact felt by an irreversible transfer of crops and species between the old worlds
british researchers have now pinpointed 1610 because of the impact felt by an irreversible transfer of crops and species between the old worlds and old worlds the anthropocene is the name of a proposed geological epoch that may soon enter the official geologic time scale
it refers to a time in which human permanently changed the planet
according to the iugs ( iugs ) , we are officially in the holocene epoch , which began 11,700 years ago after the last major ice age
some experts argue we should now change the name to ' anthropocene '
this is from from anthropo , for ' man , ' and cene , for ' new '
but up until now , experts have been divided on when mankind caused a lasting impact on the earth 's geology with some suggesting 1964 when the fallout from atomic testing became apparent
researchers at ucl said that 1610 - when shakespeare 's cymbeline was first performed - marked the start of the human - dominated geological epoch known as the anthropocene
previous epochs began and ended due meteorite strikes , sustained volcanic eruptions and the shifting of the continents
the study , published in nature , said human actions are now changing the planet producing a new geological epoch
but to define an epoch scientists must pinpoint and date a global environmental change that has been captured in natural material , such as rocks , ancient ice or sediment from the ocean floor
such a marker - like the chemical signature left by the meteorite strike that wiped out the dinosaurs - is called a golden spike
comparing the major environmental impacts of human activity over the past 50,000 years against these two formal requirements just two dates were in the running - 1610 when the impact of the discovery of the americas began to be felt and 1964
scientists said the 1492 arrival of europeans in the americas , and subsequent global trade , moved species to new continents and oceans on an unprecedented level , resulting in a global re-ordering of life on earth
they also found a golden spike that can be dated to the same time - a pronounced dip in atmospheric carbon dioxide centred on 1610 and captured in antarctic ice - core records
geologists have named the 1610 dip in carbon dioxide the ' orbis spike '
they chose the latin word for ' world ' because this golden spike was caused by once - disconnected peoples becoming globally linked
according to the iugs ( iugs ) , we are officially in the holocene epoch , which began 11,700 years ago after the last major ice age humans started dominating the planet causing irreversible changes during the reign of king james i ( right ) and the era of shakespeare ( left ) , scientists claim dr simon lewis said : ' in a hundred thousand years scientists will look at the environmental record and know something remarkable happened in the second half of the second millennium
' they will be in no doubt that these global changes to earth were caused by their own species
' today we can say when those changes began and why
' the anthropocene probably began when species jumped continents , starting when the old world met the new
' we humans are now a geological power in our own right - as earth - changing as a meteorite strike
' historically , the collision of the old and new worlds marks the beginning of the modern world
' many historians regard agricultural imports into europeans from the vast new lands of the americas , alongside the availability of coal , as the two essential precursors of the industrial revolution , which in turn unleashed further waves of global environmental changes
' geologically , this boundary also marks earth 's last globally synchronous cool moment before the onset of the long - term global warmth of the anthropocene
' he added while 1964 saw a peak in radioactive fallout following nuclear weapons testing , it was not - in geological terms - an earth - changing event
an official decision on whether to formally recognise the anthropocene , including when it began , will be triggered by a recommendation of the anthropocene working group of the subcommission of quaternary stratigraphy , due in 2016
scientists said the 1492 arrival of europeans in the americas ( pictured ) , and global trade , moved species to new continents and oceans on an unprecedented level , resulting in a global re-ordering of life on earth
