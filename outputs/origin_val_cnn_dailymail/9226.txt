it has been one of the most frustrating paradoxes of modern science - that light exists both as a wave and particle at the same time but can never be seen in both states simultaneously
albert einstein was the first person to describe this apparent dual state of light in 1905 in an attempt to explain some of the apparently contradictory behaviour it displays
yet when scientists attempt to observe these states , it has only ever been able to see light behave as photon particle or as an electromagnetic wave
the bottom ' slice ' of the image shows the particles , while the top image shows light as a wave but now researchers based at the swiss federal institute of technology in lausanne ( epfl ) , have captured the first ever snapshot of light behaving as both a wave and particle
the work shows that albert einstein was right when he proposed that electromagnetic radiation could behave as both a wave and a particle at the same time
scientists have developed a camera system that lets users see round corners using laser light
the system takes advantage of the way light is reflected and refracted to reconstruct the shape of objects outside the field of view
researchers at the university of bonn and the university of british columbia in vancouver , used a laser to scatter light on a surface
is shone on a surface in a demonstration , a laser was shone on a white wall , while a camera watches the scene
all it can see initially through the lens is a â spot â of light
a computer records the image and the data is processed so the outlines of an object behind the screen gradually appear
the technique for capturing the image could be used to help open up new areas of superfast computers that exploit the quantum states of materials
he said : ' this experiment demonstrates that , for the first time ever , we can film quantum mechanics - and its paradoxical nature - directly
' being able to image and control quantum phenomena at the nanometer scale like this opens up a new route towards quantum computing
' the wave - like behaviour of light can be seen clearly when sunlight is refracted through a prism and splits into the different colours according to the wavelengths of the light
however , it can also be seen behaving like a particle - like photons hurled out as radiation by materials like uranium or when gas high in the atmosphere is battered by the solar wind to produce the aurora over the poles
in a paper published in the journal nature communications , the research team conducted an experiment and then used electrons to image the light
by firing a pulse of laser light at a tiny metal wire suspended on graphene , this added energy to the particle wire and caused them to vibrate
the aurora borealis ( shown above ) is caused by photons particles thrown out by gas atoms high in the earth 's atmosphere as they collide with high energy charged particles carried by the solar wind from the sun white light splitting into different colours through a prism ( above ) shows how it behaves like a wave light then traveled along the wire in two possible directions
when the waves travelling in opposite directions meet each other they form a new ' standing wave ' of light
by then firing a stream of electrons close to the nanowire , they were able to image this wave in an ultrafast microscope due to the way the electrons sped up or slowed down
dr carbone said that the resulting image produces a fingerprint of the wave - nature of light while also simultaneously demonstrating that it is a particle too
the electrons pass close to the standing wave of light , they hit the photons it contains , again affecting the resulting image .
