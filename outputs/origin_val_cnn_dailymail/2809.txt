women are grossly underrepresented in professional football , both in terms of tv coverage of female games and in the number of women working in the male section of the sport
those that do venture into men 's football are often subjected to regular abuse - according to the campaign group women in football , two thirds of females working in the industry have been on the receiving end of sexual harassment
so a female lineswoman who was filmed talking back to the preta footballer biro biro during the campeonato paulista match on sunday has been heralded a hero by fellow members of her sex
but biro biro is not happy with the decision and heads over to tatiane to give her a dressing down
unimpressed with the attack , tatiane takes it upon herself to follow biro biro back down the pitch , arguing back furiously
shocked by the comeback , biro biro then walks off with a wave of his hand , so tatiane heads back to her post with a fuming backwards glance
the clip has since been shared hundreds of times on social network sites

' tatiane is furious as she follows biro biro up the pitch as biro biro is shocked into heading back onto the pitch , tatiane heads back to her post , shooting a glowering look back at her opponent it is n't the first time in recent years that a lineswoman has been headline news
in january 2011 , tv commentators gray and keys , who apparently believed their microphones were switched off , were recorded making disparaging remarks about massey , 25 , before liverpool âs premiership clash with wolves
commenting on ms massey , mr keys said : â somebody better get down there and explain offside to her
â mr gray , a former scottish international footballer , replied : â can you believe that ? a female linesman
women do nât know the offside rule
â mr keys replied : â course they do nât
i can guarantee you there will be a big one today
' kenny ( liverpool manager kenny dalglish ) will go potty
this is nât the first time , is it ? did nât we have one before ? â gray âs contract was immediately terminated by sky sports ' managing director barney francis for unacceptable behaviour , while keys resigned soon after
