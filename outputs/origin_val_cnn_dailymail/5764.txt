a cafÃ© owner was forced to shut up shop for three days after bungling council officials erected a fairground ride just inches from his window
meakin , 31 , turned up to work on monday to find the huge structure blocking the entrance to his family - run cafe in grantham , lincs
workers had positioned the carousel - style attraction so close to the front door that it could not even be fully opened
taken for a ride : a cafÃ© owner in grantham , lincs , was forced to shut up shop for three days after the local council put up a fairground carousel ride just inches from his shop window sandwiched in : workers had positioned the carousel - style attraction so close to the front door of cafe leo that it could not even be fully opened and even though the council apparently agreed the positioning was rather inconvenient , officials said it would be impossible to move - because it had already been set up for the event
mr meakin now has to wait until tomorrow , the end of the local mid-lent fair , to re-open the cafe
he said : ' what customer wants to sit having a coffee and look out the window at the back end of a giant fairground ride
it was just really inconsiderate to say the least
' everybody thought we were closed anyway
you could n't get anywhere near the shop really
' it was literally 3ft away from the window
who could ever think that was a good idea ? ' mr meakin , who runs the cafe with wife jessica , said the ' barmy ' decision forced him to close the cafe , a move which he said cost his business at least Â£ 1,000
clear view : mr meakin could barely see out of the window after the ride was put up directly outside the cafe prettier sight : the area where mr meakin usually puts tables and chairs ( pictured ) for al fresco diners was also completely taken over he claimed the ride had so badly obstructed the view that the entire premises was plunged into darkness
and the area where mr meakin usually puts tables and chairs for al fresco diners was also completely taken over by the attraction
he added : ' i had no choice but to close on health and safety grounds
takings are down over a Â£ 1,000 at least
' my worry was if we had to evacuate a hoard of people would just have been blocked off by a ride and a lamppost
' the council just do n't seem to consider small local businesses here
it was a barmy decision
' baffled : meakin , 31 , pictured with his wife and business partner jessica , said he had to close the business for most of the week , a move which cost him around Â£ 1,000 in profit mr meakin was forced to close the cafÃ© early on monday afternoon
it remained closed all day tuesday , wednesday and today
he is due to reopen tomorrow , once the fair has ended
he said : ' the ride position was just not acceptable so we left it until the council came back and had a proper look
' when somebody from the council came they agreed and said it 's unacceptable so i do n't know how someone could have said it was before
' i used to get nervous about the fair coming but because the past few years it 's been the same ride it did n't cause me any concern
even though south kesteven district council agreed the ride ( pictured in use at the fair ) had been positioned incorrectly , mr meakin said officials said it would be impossible to move - because it had already been set up ' in terms of compensation the council said they would just look into it
' we asked to see copies of the risk assessments so we knew we were n't liable if anything happened but they said they could n't provide them
' he added : ' we have been here for four years and it 's been the same ride every year but it 's been in a sensible place
regular customer frank rhimes , 66 , said : ' somebody at the council needs their heads examining
' i could n't believe it when i turned up for my daily coffee and saw this massive ride looming over the shop
it just makes you wonder who makes these kind of decisions
' a south kesteven district council spokeswoman said : ' we are facilitating a solution between the showman responsible for the ride and the cafe owner
