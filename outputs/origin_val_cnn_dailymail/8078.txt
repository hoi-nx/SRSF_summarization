six months after a machete was carved into his thigh , brook finds himself in a situation where he has to walk like he talks
the fact that he is walking at all is a measure of progress , considering the damage caused during the vicious assault he suffered on holiday in tenerife last september
but the greater question , and one that has lingered since his condition was no longer deemed life - threatening , centres on what kind of fighter will return to the ring
the answer will finally come on saturday , when the 28 - year - old faces jo jo dan , a tough romanian who is mandatory challenger for the ibf welterweight world title brook brilliantly won weeks before he was assaulted
brook is ready to return to the ring against jo jo dan just six months after he suffered a machete attack brook showed off the scar on his thigh from the attack ( left ) before putting in more hours ahead of his return brook feared on the night of the attack that he would die , or that he would be unable to walk ever again ' i went from being on top of the world to the bottom of the ocean , ' was how brook put it in an interview with sportsmail last september , his first since the attack
then , like now , brook 's outlook was dominated by fighting talk and attempts at positive thinking
on thursday , he says physical testing at his gym in sheffield shows he is ' getting the same , if not better results , than for the shawn porter fight ' in which he won the belt
but boxing is a hype industry
and one memory from that initial conversation in his parents ' living room is of a subdued fighter revealing that a doctor had recently told him the numbness in his left thigh â pieced together by 38 staples â might never fully go away
jo jo dan has earned his shot at brook after becoming the mandatory challenger for his ibf world title until he steps into the ring in front of sky 's cameras , only brook himself truly knows if there is any residual physical consequence of the attack , after which he left a trail of blood across a holiday resort before collapsing unconscious and being rushed to hospital for emergency surgery
' i do n't have any problems , ' he said ahead of friday 's weigh - in
' i look down and see a scar and that 's about it , really
but i remember , when i woke up in hospital in tenerife , no - one had come to see me yet and i was looking down at the leg
there were drips in each arm
i just thought , ' two weeks ago i was top of the world and now i am in a hospital bed after major surgery '
i can remember thinking , ' this is horrific '
there were all these staples in it holding it together and i thought it was like a shark attack
i was lucky to be alive
' i could n't even walk up the stairs to get on the plane back to england
' brook at home shortly after he was stabbed ( left ) and showing his scar ( right ) on the week of his fight it 's a fascinating junction in brook 's career
sportsmail understands that his promoter hearn has kept open the possibility of using wembley stadium on june 13 should he finally succeed in luring amir khan into a huge domestic fight
but amir khan is apparently uninterested in hearn 's offer of a Â£ 4million payday despite a recent encouraging meeting between camps in blackpool
brook said : ' i think the amir khan fight is gone for this year
i 'm the world champion and i will fight some other massive name
' in the long term , hearn 's ambitious hope is to stage an autumn fight against the winner of manny pacquiao and floyd mayweather â a bout that would unify the division 's titles
but there is a long , unpredictable queue to either of those mammoth names , who are considered likely to hold a september rematch depending on the outcome of their may 2 meeting
the attack left brook needing 32 metal staples in his left thigh after blood was ' spurting everywhere ' out of it hearn has so far held productive talks with the representatives of legendary mexican juan manuel marquez , as well as former lightweight world champion brandon rios , over a summer bout
brook said : ' i was born to do this
i have a second chance at it after everything that 's happened
i believe it is my destiny to go out there and keep winning
' i always believed it was my destiny to become world champion and i did
i keep telling myself that i wo n't stop , not just winning one world title but i want to do it at different weights
brook seemed in good spirits as he got back into the ring at the workout on tuesday afternoon ' it 's been horrible going through everything since the attack , all the rehab and everything else but now i am the fittest i have ever been and ca n't wait to get back in the ring again
' when he does , it will become clearer how much walking one of britain 's most talented fighters can still do .
