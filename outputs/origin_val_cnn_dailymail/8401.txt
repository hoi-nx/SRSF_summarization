cocaine use in uk has trebled in two decades , with a new ' phenomenon ' of rising drugs consumption among people in their forties and fifties
a new government report launched amid concern that cocaine is seen as safe found it is no longer ' the preserve of wealthy bankers and celebrities '
its authors found the drug is now ' firmly embedded in uk society ' , and warned launching an anti-cocaine campaign could encourage more people to take it
cocaine use has traditionally been highest among people in their twenties and late teens , but there have been significant increases among people in their forties and fifties the advisory council on the misuse of drugs said the drug has spread throughout all areas of society since the mid- 1990s
it follows the emergence of a market in cheap , low - purity powdered cocaine that operates alongside a more expensive and far higher purity version of the drug
a line of the cheaper version can now be bought for just Â£ 2 â less than the price of a coffee
cocaine use has traditionally been highest among people in their twenties and late teens but while usage among younger age groups has fluctuated in recent years , figures from the office for national statistics show the percentage of over- 35s taking cocaine at least once in the past year increased from 0.8 per cent in 2001/2 to 1.5 per cent in 2013/14 â the equivalent of about 188,000 men and women
over the same period , use among adults described as â comfortably off â rose from 1.5 per cent to 1.9 per cent
overall just over 810,000 men and women aged 16 to 59 in england and wales used the drug at least once last year â 2.4 per cent of the population
it is the highest rate in europe
use among older adults has been less common , particularly among 45 - 54 year olds
in 2013 - 14 , 1.8 per cent of people aged 34 - 44 took cocaine up from 1.3 per cent a decade earlier
among 45 - 54 - year - olds the figure doubled from 0.3 per cent to 0.6 per cent
but the report said : ' it is notable that there have been statistically significant increases ( 1996 to 2013 - 14 ) across all age groups up to the age of 54 years ; a phenomenon that has not been observed in respect of other drug types
' it could be that more people are taking up cocaine later in life , but the data suggests it is the result of ' continued use among an ageing user cohort ' , suggesting age does not lead to people giving the drug up
the access to cheap cocaine - often mixed with harmful cutting agents - is ' highly likely ' to have driven the rise in the number of users from ' hard pressed ' or low income backgrounds , as well as the ' comfortably off ' , living outside cities where drug use was traditionally uncommon
the report , addressed to home secretary theresa may and health secretary jeremy hunt , is the first of its kind to investigate powdered cocaine use and was launched in response to fears of a perception that the drug is safe as use increased
cocaine use has trebled in two decades , although the proportion of people saying they have used drugs in the last year has fallen sharply professor iversen , chair of the advisory council on the misuse of drugs , an independent body which advises the government , said : ' consumption of powdered cocaine in the uk has changed radically over the last two decades
' once characterised as the preserve of wealthy bankers and celebrities , the research highlighted in this report shows a cheaper , low - purity version of the drug has permeated society far more widely
cocaine use has now become ' firmly embedded ' in uk society ' given the clear health risks associated with even infrequent cocaine use , and associated issues such as dependency and crime , this development has posed a huge challenge to health professionals , law enforcement , educators and academics
' he added : ' i believe the drug is firmly embedded in uk society
' using data from the crime survey for england and wales , the report said 0.6 per cent of 16 - 59 year - olds took powdered cocaine in 1996 , compared to a peak of 3 per cent - or 885,000 people - in 2008 - 09
while the report said a slight fall in use since 2009 - to 743,000 people in 2013/2014 - could be a sign of a general decline in the uk , mr iversen said it is not yet significant
despite the rise tim miller , one of the authors of the report , said only a small minority of people use cocaine and warned against launching an anti-cocaine education campaign
' i think we need to tread carefully around drugs education and prevention because it can backfire , ' he said
' one of my worries is that if people think everyone is doing it then they might think it 's ok to do it
' the drug can cause significant harm even in first - time or occasional users , including strokes , heart attacks , over-heating of body temperature to life threatening levels and psychiatric problems
health problems are also caused by cutting agents used to make the drug more profitable - including levamisole used to worm sheep - which can lower blood cell numbers and phenacetin which can cause kidney problems
the report also found in the last year cocaine use was also found to be more than twice as popular among gays and bisexuals compared to heterosexuals
a home office spokesman said the department ' continues to be concerned about the harms caused by cocaine use , which is why it is a class a drug '
' there are positive signs our approach to this drug is working : the use of powder cocaine has fallen since a peak in 2008/2009 and there is a long - term downward trend in overall drug use , ' he said
' law enforcement continues to tackle the supply of cocaine at home and abroad and the coalition government has introduced new powers to combat the trade in cutting agents , which are mixed with drugs by criminals to boost their profits
' we are grateful to the advisory council on the misuse of drugs for its review and recommendations on the use , prevalence and harms associated with powder cocaine
we will consider its advice carefully and respond in due course
' dr niall campbell , consultant psychiatrist at the priory hospital in roehampton , south-west london , said : â people want an instant antidepressant , and they think cocaine is it , but it absolutely is nât
we see lives totally wrecked by it
â a multi-millionaire businessman âs 40 - year marriage was destroyed by his Â£ 6,000 - a - week cocaine addiction which started in middle age , a high court judge said yesterday
the 62 - year - old grandfather , who has not been named , is likely to die if he does not kick his habit , mr justice moor warned during a divorce settlement hearing
the judge described how the man , worth Â£ 25million , risked throwing everything away after being introduced to the class a drug eight years ago , as his addiction led to â reckless and wanton â spending on cocaine and prostitutes
after leaving school without qualifications the man built his property maintenance company from scratch , which now has a turnover of Â£ 24million a year , and lived with his wife in a Â£ 2.3million home with an indoor swimming pool
the couple own two villas on the costa del sol , a fleet of luxury cars including two bentleys , two porsche cayennes and a mercedes , and enjoyed Â£ 60,000 holidays in dubai
but the childhood sweethearts , who married in 1972 and have four children and several grandchildren , finally separated in may 2012 because of his drug abuse
the husband has spent Â£ 230,000 on rehab in the us and portugal but each time he relapsed after returning to the uk , the court heard
mr justice moor said : â there is no doubt that the effect has been disastrous both for his health and for the state of his otherwise entirely happy marriage
â the judge added : â whoever introduced him to cocaine in his early 50s deserves a very long prison sentence as that person has destroyed a 40 - year marriage
the husband has not been able to act on the advice of his treating professionals
if he does not , it will probably kill him
at the very least , it will cause his family yet more turmoil
