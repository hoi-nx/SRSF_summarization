obesity rates in south los angeles grew by 12per cent despite a much - hailed three - year ban on stand - alone fast - food restaurants , a new study has found the failed fast food ruling targeted a 32 - square - mile area south of interstate 10 that struggles with high obesity rates and other health problems
the law , believed to be the first effort of its kind by a major city to improve public health , did not ban new eateries in strip malls

' it had no meaningful effect , ' rand senior economist roland sturm said

rand researchers reviewed permits issued by the los angeles county department of public health , which inspects food outlets
there were no licenses for stand - alone fast - food restaurants , but chains opened 17 new outlets in strip shopping centers and food courts in south los angeles from 2008 to 2012
almost half of the new food permits were for convenience stores that sell soda and junk food , the study found
researchers also compared obesity rates in south los angeles and other parts of the county using surveys that asked residents to report their weight and eating habits

they acknowledged it will take some time to see health gains but noted that the area has seen farmers markets and community gardens in recent years
' we never said this ordinance was the silver bullet ' to solving the obesity problem , said gwen flynn of the community health councils
