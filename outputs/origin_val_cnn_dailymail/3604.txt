you do n't restrict an artist
he 's there to create , to entertain , to slap his imagination on a blank canvas and leave the world wondering how the hell he did it
louis van gaal used mata as a ' false right winger ' at anfield six days ago , and threw off the shackles that were once strapped to his ankles by david moyes and jose mourinho
the two - time chelsea player of the year showed good things come to those who wait , as liverpool 's 3 - 4 - 3 formation that snookered teams from january onward was lost on manchester united
manchester united midfielder mata scores the second of his double to seal an important win at anfield mata 's perfect technique for his scissor - kick was brilliant as he scored one of the goals of the season liverpool could do little to stop mata 's incredible scissor - kick giving them a 2 - 0 lead at anfield mata runs away in celebration with manchester united team - mates fellaini ( right ) and wayne rooney ( left ) it was , if nothing else , unexpected
mata had gone unused , having played just 15 minutes across four premier league games in february , and it was reminiscent of his bit - part role at chelsea player of the year
jose mourinho considered oscar a better fit as his no 10 , believing mata 's defensive cover left a lot to be desired
he is not a tackler , nor is he the physical type
you do n't buy a jack russell terrier then expect it to behave like an american pit bull
mata is a different breed
what he is , is an architect
since the start of the 2011 - 12 premier league season , he has more goals and assists in total ( 65 ) than any other midfielder
close behind is manchester city 's david silva ( 63 ) and toure ( 61 ) , then chelsea player of the year 's hazard and liverpool 's gerrard ( both 58 )
yet his defensive discipline â or lack thereof â is what jose mourinho considered his achilles heel
it 's true the midfielder averages the fewest tackles ( 0.64 ) , clearances ( 0.16 ) and duels won ( 14.29 per cent ) per game when he , david silva , toure , hazard and gerrard are compared , but that 's not his job
mata left chelsea player of the year for manchester united in a Â£ 37m switch but manager david moyes never got his money 's worth mata 's prayers have been answered at manchester united as he looks to get a regular run out by louis van gaal only david silva ( 365 ) beats him in chances created out of the entire premier league since the beginning of 2011 - 12 , but mata ( 291 ) has played 466 fewer minutes
he 's the creative kind , but would most likely still be warming the substitutes ' bench at stamford bridge had he not swapped south for north
it was moyes that bought mata from chelsea player of the year , phoning him personally to explain what he wanted
fluidity , assists and goals were the demands , and mata agreed
two days later , he arrived at carrington â by helicopter , no less â and it was confirmed
chelsea player of the year made a tidy Â£ 13.5m from the mata move
shrewd as ever , as they were with david luiz ( Â£ 31.6m profit ) , andre schurrle ( Â£ 4m ) , kevin de bruyne ( Â£ 11m ) , romelu lukaku ( Â£ 18m ) and thorgan hazard ( Â£ 5.5m ) , among others
david moyes , however , never got his money 's worth
mata celebrates his goal with team - mate daley blind at anfield on sunday during their win mata has more goals and assists in total ( 65 ) than any other midfielder in the premier league since 2011 it was when he left manchester with the club in seventh that the inquest began
he had n't kept sir alex ferguson 's backroom staff
he failed to replace nemanja vidic , rio ferdinand , ryan giggs and patrice evra
his style of football was cautious , slow and predictable compared to his predecessor 's attacking outlook
another supposed error was wasting Â£ 64m on fellaini and mata
yet the new man at manchester united is getting what moyes could n't out of both
against liverpool , fellaini and mata covered the most distance ( 11.6km each ) out of everyone
mata had more touches ( 93 ) than anyone else , made 73 passes with 91.8 per cent accuracy , and made hazard proud by drawing more fouls than any other player ( 3 )
for a player without a shot on target in the premier league since december 20 , he scored two goals worthy of settling the great rivalry
alberto moreno , lugging five yards behind for mata 's first and not tracking him for the second , was tormented by the man that goes by ' mata ' â a suitable nickname handed to him by former chelsea player of the year team - mate daniel sturridge because it is a literal translation of his name
mata 's heat map from manchester united 's 2 - 1 win at liverpool last weekend alberto moreno was tormented by mata at anfield but the challenge is for him to make it consistent mata runs with the ball during the tense match between the two great rivals of the premier league manchester united 's average positions vs liverpool ( left ) with mata ( no 8 ) drifting inside ... and his total passes ( right ) mata 's heat map vs tottenham hotspur on march 15 in manchester united 's 3 - 0 win at old trafford saw him drift inside jan 1 vs stoke - 90 minutes jan 11 vs southampton - 90 jan 17 vs qpr - 45 jan 31 vs leicester - 13 feb 8 vs west ham - 0 feb 11 vs burnley - 0 feb 21 vs swansea - 11 feb 28 vs sunderland - 4 march 4 vs newcastle-8 march 15 vs tottenham hotspur - 77 march 22 vs liverpool - 90 against liverpool , right - back antonio valencia was used as cover , sprinting up the wing to allow mata to abandon his post
those two exchanged more passes ( 55 ) than anyone else on sunday , and worked in tandem
their average positions show mata ( no 8 ) stayed close to ander herrera ( no 21 ) , who was equally devastating at anfield , while valencia ( no 25 ) pushed up , just short of the half - way line
mata played a similar role against tottenham hotspur the week before , as his almost identical heat maps above demonstrate
but he is not out of the woods yet
mata is flirting with a first - team place , having replaced an out - of - sorts angel di maria , but the trick is to stay there
he has been crying out for this , ever since he was phased out at chelsea player of the year , and even more so now he has been dropped by spain
mata has played 3,724 minutes and made 44 starts in the past two seasons
restricted , to say the least , when compared to former chelsea player of the year team - mate hazard , who has 5,461 minutes and 61 starts
it 's easier said than done to become a must - pick â Â£ 37m does n't buy you that luxury these days
can it happen at manchester united ? if mata can rip teams to shreds as he did against liverpool , then how can it not ? trouble is , louis van gaal â like jose mourinho â is a hard man to please
mata has played 3,724 minutes with 44 starts over the last two seasons - far less than his counterparts mata ripped liverpool apart on sunday as they ended their unbeaten run in the premier league in 2015
