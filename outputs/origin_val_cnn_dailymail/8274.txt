brittany maynard 's widower has described their final moments together in an interview with oprah
dan diaz was lying in the bed beside his 29 - year - old wife when she drank medication to end her life last month
having been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer just six months before , maynard became the face of americans 's right to die campaign after moving from california to oregon and setting a date for her own death
now , her widower is continuing that battle calling for all states to approve legislation that supports life - ending options for people with terminal illnesses
' the mood in the house was very peaceful , very loving , ' he said in an interview that will be screened on sunday
glassy - eyed , he said each person recited a memory to her before she said her own goodbyes
' she actually wrote on facebook a message to her friends and said " i love you " to everyone , to me
' the medication , we brought it in
' love : the couple married in california but later moved to oregon where maynard could end her life memories : dan diaz said maynard got seven friends and relatives to each tell her a memory dan diaz is continuing the campaign that maynard started as he lobbies for new legislation maynard 's two dogs were in the bed with them when she drank the lethal medicine , dan diaz said then , she drank the lethal cocktail prescribed by her doctor
' within five minutes , she fell asleep
' it comes after debbie ziegler , brittany maynard 's mom , wrote an article for dailymail.com describing the moment she watched her only daughter die
' brittany maynard , my beautiful , brave girl , had passed away purposefully and peacefully just as she planned
death had been kind , graceful even , and spared brittany maynard a great deal of physical pain and mental anguish
' it was a good death
' a mother 's tears : debbie ziegler , maynard 's mother , is also campaigning to change laws joining dan diaz in the campaign for euthanasia , she added : ' but what does a good death look like in americans : the land of death phobia ? americans do not like to talk about death
some say a good death is a natural death , but they often mean dying â in their sleep
â ' modern medicine has made death seem like a medical failure instead of the natural end of life
the death of a 29 - year - old is unthinkable
all of life looms ahead , full of promise
' we found ourselves as a family : choosing between no more treatment and death â or a treatment plan that felt like torture and then death anyway only a few months later
' oregon voters approved the death with dignity act in 1994 , but opponents persuaded a federal judge to issue an injunction temporarily blocking the law
