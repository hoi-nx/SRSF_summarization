i bend down as they start to wake

' ( infinity love , january 2015 ) one look , one look is all it took , for obsession to begin , making you want to kill yourself , to him , killing is no sin , brutally snatches mortals at night , they scream , they flail , but he takes off in flight , to him you ca nât be faithful , he is a fallen angel
' ( angels in the mirrors , january 2015 ) ' bloodstains in my fingerprints , screams inside my head , memories of imagination , i âm dancing with the dead , whispers in the shadows , death waits upon the eve , i âve come to love the darkness , the night is when i feed
' ( my shadow , january 2015 ) ' i âm sitting in this empty room all alone , i can hear nothing , but their screaming souls , souls of madness but , not like me , i can see their innocence , unlike the monster i am , that no one can see , and what i have become , what i have done to some , someone like me , that no one can see , a psychopath in the dark , my mind is full of twisted things , but my eyes are full of sparkles , hoping that these walls will fall apart , so that my killing can start

i tightly bind them to a low table
' ( unworthy , march 2015 ) ' i need to hurt somebody
make someone feel how i do
the river is beautiful , my gun is loaded , my tools are cleaned , and my toy is all tied up and ready
she looks at me in fear , she ca nât very well scream with the gag in her mouth
so i take it out , i want to hear how she asks
" what did i ever do to you ? why me ? â she looks at me terrified as i take out my first tool , just an ordinary pair of scissors
