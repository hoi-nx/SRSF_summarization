flip - flops ? check
twenty - four degree heat ? check
now all i need is a fruity cocktail and i could be in mauritius
except i âm not on holiday
i âm in a basement in central london , moments from the frenzy of oxford street
outside , it âs a typical day â cold and damp , with a sky as grey and heavy as old army boots
it âs estimated that two million britons suffer from sad ( sad ) , which is caused by a lack of sunlight - and up to three times more women than men appear to be affected down here , amid the lemon trees and pink , plastic bougainvillea , it âs so tropical that i half expect barry manilow to cha - cha - cha past singing the copacabana
welcome to the cheapest winter sunspot in britons
this is a â real sunlight â clinic , where anyone can drop in for a burst of cheering warmth
but you do nât have to face the airport , and it wo nât cost you thousands of pounds
at the flick of a switch , you can flit between mauritius , miami and bali â or , at least , their sunshine equivalents
dr daya ( pictured ) originally bought the equipment for her own use , having grown sick of britons winter as holidays go , it âs pretty convenient : no passport , no packing and the weather is guaranteed
it âs estimated that 2 million britons suffer from sad ( sad ) , caused by a lack of sunlight , with up to three times more women than men affected
symptoms include low - level depression , lack of energy and a loss of enthusiasm for life
the syndrome is so widespread , the nhs has set up a web page giving advice on how to tackle it â which includes artificial sun. in the past , if you were down in the dumps during winter , the advice would be to buck up or buy a ticket somewhere hot
but what if you ca nât afford to ? what if you âre trapped on this cold , damp isle until the spring , whenever that may be ? it was only when a colleague cheerfully announced that he was off to goa , in india , for a fortnight that i thought , hang on , i need some sunshine , too ! which is how i found myself slipping on my flip - flops at dr daya âs wholistic medical centre on that monday afternoon
dr daya is the sort of gp you find a lot of around harley street
a private practitioner , she âs open to alternative medicine , â taking a holistic approach , looking at the whole body and lifestyle , not just one part of it â
hers is the only clinic in britons to offer a â real sunshine â room to the public
it opened in 2009 , though she has just moved premises and spruced it up
it âs a normal - sized sitting room , done up to feel like a tropical holiday
the walls are papered with verdant scenes and artificial grass , jaunty pot plants hang off wooden screens , soothing music plays in the background
in a corner , above your head , beams the â artificial sun â
it looks like a row of wall - mounted security lights â three square boxes , the sort you might get at a football stadium
dr daya 's wholistic medical centre ( pictured ) in central london where you can experience the miami sun the equipment comes from sweden and cost dr daya Â£ 25,000 to install , which seems a lot given that you can buy a desktop light box â which beams out an assimilation of natural light â for Â£ 50
â light boxes do work , â says dr daya , â but this is out of this world
this is the full spectrum â infra - red , uva , uvb and you get the heat , whereas with sad boxes , you just get visible light
â the inventor of the equipment , ingemar nilsson , stumbled upon his creation by mistake in 1997
commissioned to create a sunlight tunnel for sweden car manufacturer saab to test the effects of the sun âs rays on different paints , he noticed that the factory workers liked to congregate under the sun lamps during their breaks
he realised people could get benefits from sitting under the artificial sunlight he âd created
so he spent some years adapting his equipment to make it 100 per cent safe for human use , and ten years later had created the technology he sells now
initially , the biggest demand for sunlight rooms came from the elderly and nursing homes
the first private sunlight room was created in sweden , and there have now been 150 installations worldwide
in britons , 11 have been installed in care homes and there are three belonging to private individuals
â some people really go to town with replicating a holiday feel for their sunlight rooms , â says karl emanuelsson , the britons company representative
â people put sand on the floor , surround sound systems to replicate the sea , the smell of coconut wafting through to create a truly multi-sensory experience
â dr daya originally bought the equipment for her own use , having grown sick of britons winters
â i was born in africa and i really need the sun , â she says
â i do nât think you need to have been born in africa to feel you âre missing the sun here , but that was my excuse
â when i was 13 , i was sent from tanzania to boarding school here , and i still ca nât get over how long the winters are
â a woman looks at a ' light lounge ' - a treatment aimed at sad sufferers ( sad ) back in tanzania , which lies on the equator , there is an average of 2,836 hours of sun per year , out of a possible 4,383
in britons , the average is typically less than half that , ranging from 1,364 per year in birmingham to 1,888 in eastbourne
dr daya had heard of sunlight simulators in spas and health clinics , and decided to buy one for herself
â i thought it was a bit extravagant , and that i should really share it with other people , so i opened the sun room , â she says
she charges Â£ 50 for a one - hour session , which seems a lot to spend on an hour under a hot lamp â but , on the other hand , it âs less than the cost of a holiday and , as soon as you flick the switch , you âre hit in the face with that lovely , warm feeling , as if you âve just stepped off a plane in the caribbean
there are three settings : an hour of â bali â is the mildest , equivalent to a long sunset , while â miami â , dr daya âs favourite , is 45 minutes of full whack , then 15 minutes of winding down
she finds â mauritius â is the most popular , as it âs the strongest , so that âs what i plump for
and , boy , do those lamps give off light
not just light , but heat
in seconds , the room is toasty warm , and i âm breaking into a sweat
you can wear what you like â dr daya likes to spend an hour here after work , in her underwear , catching up with reading
some visit as couples , while others pop in for a solitary hour in their lunch break
but what are the actual health benefits ? we know we get a large part of our vitamin d intake â important for the promotion of calcium and healthy bones â from the sun. some of our intake also comes from food such as oily fish
but from october to april , 90 per cent of the britons lies too far north to have enough uvb rays in sunlight necessary to make vitamin d in the skin
so , if they âre not eating enough oily fish and are spending too much time indoors , many are at risk of being vitamin d deficient
which is where a burst in a sunny room could be just the ticket
but just a burst â and no more
there âs a risk of getting skin cancer if you spend too much time in the room
â the recommended dose is no more than one hour a day , which is completely safe , â says dr daya
â but if you did three hours every day , we could nât vouch for the effects
' it âs like anything â it âs important not to overdo it
â dr daya claims her time in the sun room makes her sleep better and feel more energetic during the day
and one elderly user of a nursing home sunlight room says it helps alleviate aches and pains , especially joints , and has a positive effect on his brain power â it helps him tackle the crossword much quicker
after leaving dr daya âs clinic , i do feel more cheerful and friends say i have a rosy complexion , compared with my normal pasty , winter face
i ask dr daya if she still feels the need to go on holiday
â who wants to go on holiday when you can have one every day in your office ? â she replies
even so , i could still do with a week in mauritius
the equipment comes from sweden and cost dr daya Â£ 25,000 to install , which seems a lot given that you can buy a desktop light box , which beams out an assimilation of natural light , like this one , the lumie zip for Â£ 150
