rape and murder : holland was convicted of killing munoz in august 1983 in a shock twist , david holland was also arrested , after his dna linked him to the 2001 rape of an 81 - year - old woman , according to reports
david holland was convicted in that case and is now serving out a sentence in state prison , the the chronicle reported
holland was arrested in 2007
he was found hiding in the closet of a san jose apartment
his trial started in january
holland 's lawyers tried to argue that he and munoz had consensual sex , and that a robber must have killed her after he left
however the prosecution said munoz was too devoted to her boyfriend to cheat on him , and brought in several women who were former sex partners of holland to testify
the women - four total - all said holland used a knife and choked them during unreported rapes
the behavior was similar to the injuries and abuse that munoz had suffered , the court heard
' munoz 's family has waited 31 years to find justice for her cruel and senseless death , ' christopher walsh , santa clara county deputy district attorney , told the chronicle in a statement
' today a jury held holland accountable for her murder and ( has ) hopefully given munoz 's loved ones some measure of peace

holland is yet to stand trail on those charges
he refused to be present in court as the verdict was handed down
' he 's scared to death , ' his lawyer michael ogul , said , according to the san jose mercury news
' he ca n't handle being out here
