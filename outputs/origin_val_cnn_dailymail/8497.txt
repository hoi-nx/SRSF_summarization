not the sweetest strike you âll see
not the sweetest strike of the game , in fact
but loic remy âs tentative prod which squirmed past goalkeeper allan mcgregor and trickled into the net was like a shot of nectar for chelsea
mourinho may one day reflect on this late contribution from a striker he has rarely used as the moment when self - doubt was allayed and the premier league title was secured
having been 2 - 0 up inside nine minutes at hull city , courtesy of eden hazard and diego costa , chelsea had to prove they could banish this habit of throwing away the lead
but their not - so - reliable - anymore defence wobbled and creaked

it was still 2 - 2 as the clock ticked towards 77 minutes and cesc fabregas rolled a pass to willian on the chelsea right
willian found loic remy and the substitute , only on for a few seconds after replacing the injured diego costa , jabbed it towards allan mcgregor , who was clearly expecting something else entirely because he was wrong - footed , unable to recover , and the ball slithered over the line
a thrilling game was settled by a scruffy goal and chelsea âs cushion at the top of the table was plumped
â i âm pretty confident , â said mourinho
â we got what we deserved
we have a six - point lead , one match in hand and eight matches to go for our opponents
they can make 24 points
i believe in my players
â mourinho looks disgruntled on the bench after watching his premier leaders throw away a two - goal lead in the first half ahmed elmohamady netted hull city 's first goal to give them a route back into the match at the kc stadium the egyptian wing - back runs back to the halfway line and is congratulated by his team - mates after his strike eden hazard put chelsea in front with a fine strike from outside the box within two minutes on sunday afternoon hazard jumps for joy after his fine strike put mourinho 's side into the lead in hull city they had made such a brilliant start at the kc stadium , where eden hazard lashed in a beauty after only 78 seconds
collecting a lay - off from diego costa , he drove diagonally across the pitch before firing the ball back across goal with his left foot
from outside the penalty area , it sailed beyond allan mcgregor âs dive
even early on chelsea âs frailties were in evidence
abel hernandez was through and ought to have equalised
played onside by ivanovic , he collected a flick from dame nâdoye , but could not beat thibaut courtois who blocked with his body
when diego costa made it 2 - 0 , the contest seemed to be settled
again , it was a splendid goal , lashed past poor allan mcgregor from an angle
for the Â£ 32million chelsea striker , it was his 20th of the season
the goal - rate has slowed since the turn of the year , and his temper simmered , as ever
there was a confrontation with alex bruce , when diego costa accused the hull city manager âs son of swiping his legs away , and a flashpoint when jake livermore claimed to have been elbowed in his face
referee michael oliver did not see the â elbow â , as he had not seen diego costa âs stamp on emre can during the capital one cup semi-final
the pair have history going back to diego costa âs first game in english football when the same referee booked him for a dive at burnley
hull city reacted after a tactical switch from manager bruce , who started with three at the back and moved to a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation after going two down
the change did not stop left back andy robertson charging forward to create the first with a low cross , bundled in by ahmed elmohamady
within two minutes , the home team were level and panic descended on chelsea at the back as they struggled to cope with a mixture of high balls and intense pressing
thibaut courtois made a poor decision to take a touch on a back - pass from ivanovic
the goalkeeper twisted past gaston ramirez , who was closing in , but his touch was too heavy , the ball rolled to abel hernandez for a simple finish
diego costa doubled the visitor 's advantage with a fine curing effort past hull city goalkeeper allan mcgregor into the corner diego costa is embraced by team - mates nemanja matic and filipe luis after his strike at the kc stadium the spanish international striker looks bemused by the corner flag after a decision does n't go his way on sunday diego costa endured a frustrating game after his goal and was eventually substituted eventual goalscorer loic remy came on for diego costa in the second half as chelsea pressed for a winner after the break , chelsea were brighter
mourinho tweaked his midfield shape , sent on oscar and controlled possession but hull city defended well and limited the visitors to long - range efforts
thibaut courtois then produced his incredible triple save to thwart elmohamday , livermore and gaston ramirez , each flying stop better than the one before , and perhaps it energised his team to search for the winner
even when diego costa headed down the tunnel with the medics , chelsea kept probing
loic remy restored the lead and this time they did not surrender it
it was loic remy âs sixth goal since an Â£ 8.5million move from queens park rangers
â he probably deserves more than i gave him , â said mourinho
â there are not many times when a coach can feel he owes something to a player but with loic remy that âs the case
every time he plays he gives us a lot and he has never complained
