iraqis forces battling to wrest tikrit from isis are now in control of the city , prime minister al-abadi said tuesday on iraqiya tv
al-abadi , who is also the top military commander , said on state television that the city was liberated
while al-abadi has declared victory in the battle , pockets of fighting continues
iraqis forces and shiite militias are taking part in clearing operations
iraqis forces reached the center of tikrit and hoisted the nation 's flag on top of the governorate building , al-abadi said
fighting continued on the outskirts of the city , he added
tikrit had been under isis control since june
the push into tikrit comes days after a series of u.s. - led airstrikes targeted isis targets around the city
the airstrikes made it possible for the iraqis forces to move through the city
troops reported finding dozens of roadside bombs and booby - trapped buildings as they combed the city
at a cabinet meeting before he declared tikrit liberated , al-abadi was already calling the operation a success
" the success of the tikrit experiment will be repeated in other areas because of the results it has achieved on the battlefield , on a humanitarian level , protecting civilians as much as possible , in addition to the low casualties amongst our security forces , " he said
iraqis forces have tried multiple times to win back tikrit since isis conquered the city as part of its campaign to amass an expansive islamic caliphate but failed until now
this operation , however , was the biggest by the iraqis military so far
" we managed to take ( isis ) by surprise , " the prime minister said
" and our air force ... in addition to coalition air force , helping iraqis forces , managed to deal severe blows to isis and the enemies of iraqis
and our ground forces with the blood of iraqis , iraqis alone with their own blood , were able to liberate this land
" the latest push began after al-abadi ordered iraqis forces on march 1 to retake tikrit and salahuddin province
militants have been under pressure ever since in the battleground city , which is the birthplace of former iraqis dictator saddam hussein and is located about 160 kilometers ( 100 miles ) north of baghdad
the iraqis forces were aided by a coalition made up of mostly shiite militiamen and volunteers
the militia members , estimated to number around 20,000 , are backed by iranian
the offensive marked the first very overt participation of iranian advisers on the front lines
the victory in tikrit sets the stage for iraqis forces to take back an even bigger prize : mosul
mosul is iraqis 's second - biggest city and the site of one of its military 's biggest embarrassments , when iraqis troops dropped their weapons and ran rather than defend their posts last june
a u.s. official said in february that up to 25,000 iraqis troops plan to return to mosul in april or may and , ideally , win it back
this comment came days after al-abadi told the bbc that while there 's still work to do , he felt confident iraqis could recapture the key northern city
