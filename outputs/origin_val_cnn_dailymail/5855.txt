it was the generation of dodgy haircuts , questionable tracksuits ... and , yes , vhs dating
a new video , highlighting the cringe - factor of the video dating adverts , which were once deemed a good way to meet a potential partner in the eighties , has found its way online
now , it 's being used in a canadian advert , and is chock full of cheesy pick - up lines , talk of ' working out at the gym , ' and explanations as to why one woman does n't like men who ' when they laugh '
star of the show : donny explains how his work in the gym and on the arm wrestling circuit earned him the name ' big d ' entitled â date night , â the hilarious commercial channels the world of vhs dating in all its glory , perhaps making modern - day daters grateful for websites and apps
among the characters there is donny , who is referred to as â big d â in the gym and on the arm wrestling circuit , apparently
and connie who does nât like it when men grunt and snort while laughing
sporting a pair of over-sized glasses and a moustache , one man says : â if you do nât believe in love at first sight , let me reintroduce myself , â before giving a little smirk
while a hipster - looking type stares down the camera and says : â i once made love in the sewers of new york city
â complementing the characters are some wonderfully coloured backdrops and some state - of - the - art fades between shots
looking for love : connie explains that she does not like it when a man grunts or snorts when laughing the commercial concludes with donny stating : â when i start nibbling on this sucker , â while stroking his earlobe , â it âs game over , â as the introductory music returns
according to cbc news nova scotia , the company were going to use real footage from the 80s but instead used actors to deliver the lines
the original video , which has gained much attention , has been viewed over 120,000 times on youtube and people have commented such things as : â halifax . well played , halifax . well played , â in appreciation
oversized glasses , terrible hair and creepy moustaches feature throughout the advert to give it an authentic 80s feel and according to downtown halifax business commission , the advert has been a commercial success too
commenting on their site , they wrote : â our date night packages are sold out ! but that does n't mean you ca n't have a great night on the town in downtown halifax
â who knows , maybe you 'll run into big d or connie
and they have great taste
