apparently , there exists a huge disconnect between parents and teens when it comes to who is expected to fund college
according to a new survey conducted by junior achievement usa and the allstate foundation , nearly half of teens questioned ( 48 per cent ) think their parents will help pay for college , but only 16 per cent of their parents reported planning to
of the 800 parents polled , more than a third said they do nât speak to their children about money at all , stating they want to ' let kids be kids '
thanks for nothing , dad : the study , conducted by junior achievement usa and the allstate foundation , found a huge disconnect between parents and teens when it comes to who is expected to fund college ' it is obvious that parents and teens need to have honest conversations about money management , including paying for college , ' said jack e. kosakowski , president and chief executive officer of junior achievement usa
' together as a family , it is important to develop a plan for life after high school â whatever that looks like for your family
' even when parents do talk to their teens about money , it appears that girls are often side - lined
around 40 per cent of girls said their parents did n't talk to them enough about finances , compared to just 24 per cent of boys
according to the college board , the average annual cost of tuition and fees for the 2014 â 2015 school year was as follows : furthermore , females - teens and their parents - both have lower expectations about their potential earning power
moms are significantly more likely than dads to say their child will earn $ 15k or less at their first job after graduation ( 26 per cent compared with 17 per cent respectively )
similarly , when asked about their future earning power , 24 per cent of teen girls say they âll make $ 15k or less at their first job , compared to only 16 per cent of boys who feel the same
it appears things are n't improving either
the overall number of teens who think their parents do nât spend enough time talking to them about money matters is up by 11 per cent over last year 's findings .
