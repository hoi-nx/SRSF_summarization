all cigarettes in uk will be sold in plain packets bearing gruesome health warnings under a landmark new law backed by mps today
the legislation , which will come into force from may next year , easily cleared the commons by 367 votes to 113
it follows the example of follows australia , which became the first country in the world to introduce the public health law two years ago to deter a new generation of young smokers
uk is to become the second country in the world to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes powers to introduce standardised packaging were in passed the children and families act 2014 , but mps must vote on bringing them into force
more than 100 mostly - tory mps opposed the move in a free vote this afternoon , but it passed into law with the support of labour and the lib dems
critics said the idea will not prevent people smoking , could confuse consumers and fuel illegal imports
but public health minister jane ellison insisted the plan would bring the country ' one step closer to our first smoke - free generation '
she said she recognised concerns that standardised packaging for cigarettes could be a ' slippery slope ' towards a similar approach to other products such as junk food and alcohol
but she told mps : ' the government has no intention to extend standardised packaging to any other product than tobacco
' tobacco is a uniquely harmful consumer good and as such it 's been treated uniquely in regulatory terms for many years
' ahead of the vote deborah arnott , chief executive of health charity ash , said she was confident that mps will vote for the standardised packaging ' by a large majority '
' there is strong support amongst parliamentarians from right across the political spectrum for this important public health measure to protect children and save lives , ' she added
public health minister jane ellison insists the plan would bring the country ' one step closer to our first smoke - free generation ' cancer research uk 's alison cox said : ' the public health community has been united in calling for the introduction of plain , standardised packaging of tobacco products across the uk
' the growing weight of peer - reviewed evidence that standard packs reduce the appeal of smoking to children has crushed the tobacco company counter claims
' dr jenny hatchard , from university of bath 's tobacco control research group , said : ' tobacco companies have undertaken an unremitting three year opposition campaign , in which they hid behind third parties as they tried to dissuade politicians from acting in the interests of children 's health
' the vote indicates that the strong evidence that this measure is likely to reduce the appeal of smoking and bring health benefits for young people for generations to come has finally won out
' however , pro-smoking groups said the public did not support the plan
simon clark , director of the smokers ' group forest which runs the hands off our packs campaign , said voters did not see it as a priority
' the public wants parliament to prioritise tackling immigration and terrorism , not plain packaging of cigarettes
' plain packaging legislation is an ill - judged sideshow and a distraction from the real challenges the government faces before the end of this parliament
' in december 2012 , follows australia became the first country in the world to insist all tobacco products are sold in standardised packs
cigarettes there have to be in a drab olive - coloured packaging , and the brand name is in a uniform typeface
the packets are also adorned with graphic images of the effects of lung cancer
in may 2013 it emerged that the uk government had dropped plans to follow suit , to focus on economic growth , tackling immigration and reforming welfare
but pressure from health campaigners mounted , and in january this year ministers confirmed the law would go ahead .
