mata has a habit of delivering when you least expect it
while at stamford bridge the little spaniard with the big heart turned up at the office of a chelsea supporter to deliver him his new club shirt , and had to persuade the receptionist to let him in
earlier this year , at a primary school in the impoverished wythenshawe area of manchester , he stunned schoolchildren by arriving unannounced armed with dozens of toys
mata celebrates after scoring a double against liverpool at anfield , when man united needed him mata 's second goal in particular was superb , and showed why man united spent so much money on him the little spaniard put man united ahead in the first half with a tidy finish following an ander herrera pass but man united fans have had to wait until now , 14 months after david moyes paid chelsea Â£ 37m for his services , for him to deliver on the pitch
why has it taken so long ? there is mitigation
mata 's joyous arrival coincided with the miserable final throes of david moyes regime
when the ship is sinking it is hard to dance the tango in the ballroom
then came louis van gaal and a rigid pragmatism the playmaker presumably thought he had escaped when he said farewell to mourinho
a free spirit , mata has not been the only one at old trafford to take time to digest the platter the dutchman demands
van gaal was quick to take praise following what feels like a seismic 2 - 1 win in liverpool , proudly stating that he had now found a position for a man who will never be anything other than a number 10 in a number eight shirt
mata is beginning to repay the faith shown by man united 's fans , who have stuck by him louis van gaal claimed a tactical masterstroke , but he was really only playing mata in his obvious position when he arrived at david moyes ' united , mata was trying to bring momentum to a losing team the playmaker was allowed to leave chelsea because mourinho did n't rate his defensive contributions but a look at van gaal 's record would suggest that , given time , he gets it right
now the same can be said of mata , although 14 goals in his last 32 appearances would suggest not much was wrong with the 26 - year - old in the first place
the statistics show that his talents have ever been in doubt
since his arrival at chelsea in 2011 , no midfielder has a better joint total of goals and assists in the premier league
mata has 65 ( 31 goals and 34 assists ) , ahead of compatriot david silva who has 61 ( 26 and 35 ) for man united 's cross-town rivals despite having played a season more in england
majestic in the 3 - 0 romp over tottenham , mata was at it again at anfield
his first was provided by another new arrival with a point to prove
ander herrera , much to the annoyance of many of the stretford end faithful , has been absent for long periods of the season
mata has been excellent in recent weeks , dominating against tottenham before scoring twice on sunday the spaniard watches his wonderful volley fly into the top corner , as he announced his arrival at anfield the man from the basque country has basked in the limelight of the first team and his defence - splitting pass for mata illustrated what man united have been missing
mata , showing a surprising turn of pace , finished clinically into the bottom corner - but the moment man united fans will forever remember came when he contorted his tiny frame to rifle a mark hughes-esque scissor - volley from angel di maria 's pass past a helpless simon mignolet
forget the helicopter landing at carrington , mata had finally arrived
in the away end there was delirium
scoring any kind of goal against the old enemy can provoke that kind of response from the most sober of man united fan
in the commentary box there wee gasps
thierry henry , a man who knows all about the sublime , hailed the strike as ridiculous
many will not have seen it coming but plenty of those who did needed no reminder of his talents
in a wetherspoon 's close to the kc stadium , where chelsea were playing hull city , there were groans from visiting supporters watching on television as mata volleyed in man united 's second
those supping cut - price ale in the admiral of the humber will no doubt know all about the importance of good deals but many watching events unfold from the other end of the m62 voiced their opinion that mourinho was wrong to let the playmaker go , despite the hefty fee the dainty man delivered
since arriving in england , mata has more goals and assists combined than any other premier league player manchester city star david silva is behind mata statistically , despite having been in the league a year longer chelsea fans were upset to lose their creative spark , and could now do with some of his quality in midfield some think that mata 's old club , despite running away with the premier league , lack creativity in his absence and can only dream of a world in which he creates chances for diego costa
they bemoan their portugese manager 's insistence of only selecting prototypes , those who will race back and do their part in the mourinho masterplan to stifle the opposition
their loss , it would finally appear , looks set to be man united 's gain .
