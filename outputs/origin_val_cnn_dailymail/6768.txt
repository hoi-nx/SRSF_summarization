uk yesterday came under an extraordinary attack for failing to pay compensation to france for the migrant chaos in calais
the port âs mayor natacha bouchart launched into a rant at the government for refusing to fully engage in the european project
senior tories said her remarks , made public by the supposedly impartial council of europe , amounted to meddling in the general election campaign
but mrs natacha bouchart , a long - standing critic of the uk , refused to take any blame
she said : â we are suffering the consequences of the british government âs actions , which takes from european the things that suit it , but does nât want to get fully involved in the european project
â a country can not remain both in and out of european , creating problems but providing no compensation and no support to local authorities , such as mine and others , which are left alone to assume huge responsibilities
â the interview was circulated by the council of europe under the heading : â calais mayor slams the uk over migrants
â it had been given to the council âs â journal â programme , in which an interviewer asked mrs natacha bouchart a series of questions inviting criticism of the government
criticism : the mayor of calais has attacked uk for ' not getting fully involved in the european project ' violence : mass brawls between rival gangs left more than 70 people injured during july and august a transcript and video of the rant were released yesterday as david cameron was visiting the queen to fire the starting gun on the election campaign
the council , made up of 47 member states , has repeatedly clashed with the tory - led coalition
it is the body that oversees the european court of human rights , which has ordered ministers to give the vote to prisoners
the tory have threatened to withdraw from the council âs jurisdiction if it does not stop interfering in uk affairs
mrs natacha bouchart has previously made a string of attacks on the uk
in october , she said uk was an â el dorado â for thousands of migrants flocking to calais because of generous state handouts
tory candidate michael ellis , who was a member of the home affairs committee , said : â the council is brazenly trying to interfere in our election and using the mayor of calais , who has a history of anti-british political posturing , to do so
â the illegal migrant problem in calais is entirely of france âs own making
they signed up to open borders , we did not
they have been making it worse by building new facilities for illegal migrants
â peter bone , standing for the tories in wellingborough , said : â the mayor of calais does not seem to realise that the problems are france , and they should be dealing with it
she needs to get a grip
â in the interview , mrs natacha bouchart repeated her attack on the uk for being a supposed soft touch for illegal immigrants
she said : â they want to go to english because they can expect better conditions on arrival there than anywhere else in european or even internationally
chaos : the calais mayor said , with as many as 3,000 migrants in the port , she could not handle the situation camp : calais is to open the jules ferry camp to immigrants , a former children 's holiday camp , which will become an immigrant centre - the first stage of which begins as a feeding centre â there are no id cards
they can easily find work outside the formal economy , which is not really controlled
they can get social welfare support that does nât exist in other countries
â but tory candidate jacob rees-mogg said : â the problems at calais did not materialise because the uk is a honeypot but because the eu has the schengen agreement which means it is quite incapable of controlling its own borders
â until the time of queen mary i , calais was the last bit of france to be english
it would perhaps be better run if it were given back
