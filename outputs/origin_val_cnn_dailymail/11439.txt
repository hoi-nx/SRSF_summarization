madonna may have decided to abandon her own undergraduate education in favor of focusing on her then - burgeoning music career , but that has n't stopped her from offering some sage advice to her lourdes , who is currently a college freshman
during an interview with the today show 's carson , the 56 - year - old singer , whose daughter is currently enrolled at the university of michigan , madonna 's alma mater , revealed that she gave the teenager three key pieces of advice , before she started at college
' try to do everything in moderation , ' she said of the wisdom she imparted to lourdes , 18 , ' try not to kill all your brain cells
and try to go to class
' i 'm very , you know , worried , ' she told father - of - three carson
' [ i always ask her ] : " are you ok ? are you getting enough sleep ? are you eating right ? " ' you know , i set up a humidifier in her room with eucalyptus oil
i was worried about the fact that she did n't have enough towels , q - tips , you know
' but , despite her constant worries about her teenage daughter , who is following in her mother 's footsteps by studying performing arts , it does n't look like madonna will be allowed anywhere near the campus in the near future - at least if lourdes has anything to do with it
colleagues : madonna and lourdes have worked together in the past , collaborating on their material girl clothing line , which is a joint venture up and comer : lourdes , now 18 , pictured in february 2008 ( l ) and december 2009 ( r ) , is used to sharing the spotlight with her famous mother , and often attends events alongside the popstar family ties : madonna now has four children ( from left to right ) - david , nine , lourdes , mercy , nine , and rocco , 14 ' i 'm not allowed at [ football ] games , â she admitted
' you think my daughter wants me at a game ? ' luckily , the chart - topper is n't short of activities to help her take her mind off her daughter 's college activities
the mother - of - four will release her 13th studio album , rebel heart , tomorrow , three months after someone leaked early versions of more than a dozen of the songs online
and although she is looking forward to the release - explaining that she is both ' excited ' and ' nervous ' - madonna admitted that she is still ' frustrated ' by the whole incident
' i mean , it 's a process , ' she said
' music is really personal to me
a lot of the stuff is out there that i had no intention of ever finishing
they 're , like , scribbles on a pad
you know what i mean ? it 's unspeakably embarrassing
