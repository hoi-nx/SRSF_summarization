rugby world cup organisers are urging fans trying to buy tickets to remain patient amid mounting anger about endless delays on the official website
there was huge demand when general sales resumed on tuesday and by the evening , there were tickets still available for 17 matches in the tournament - being held in this country in september and october
all seats on sale at this stage for the opener , england v fiji , had been snapped up , but two of wales â matches , against fiji and uruguay in cardiff , remained up for grabs
rugby world cup organisers have asked fans to be patient amid anger about delays on the official website - sales for millennium stadium fixtures continued to lag behind other venues the total number of tickets available when they first went on sale in september last year
sales for fixtures at the millennium stadium continued to lag behind other venues , with a further three matches there still showing availability , although the remaining tickets for france v ireland had been bought
the latest allocations for new zealand v argentina at wembley and scotland v south africa at st james â park had also been rapidly claimed
however , it was a day when many supporters were left incensed by the process of trying to buy tickets online
with vast numbers attempting to the access the official website , delays of several hours and various technical glitches were reported by many of those trying to buy
social media was awash with tales of angst as the system struggled to cope with the traffic
recently departed chief executive debbie jevans had insisted before she resigned that the website would cope with demand
â the capacity we âve built into the system means we are confident it will stand up , â she predicted
but the experiences posted on twitter by frustrated would - be spectators told a different story
former head of the organising committee debbie jevans insisted the website would cope with demand tom andrews tweeted : â i have been in online queue for rugby world cup tickets for 8hrs 45 mins , unbelievable ! ! â rupert garrett was equally fed up , posting : â been queuing since 10am for rugby world cup tickets but still having to wait ! same happened with olympics
waste of time disillusioned joke ! â it was a similar story for â littlemead â , who tweeted : â i know british people love to queue , but the rugby world cup tickets wheel of doom is something else ! # whyarewewaiting â jamie cleland added : â seems to be a consistent pattern of ticket distribution for major sporting events
you âd think best practice would now be learned
â an england rugby 2015 spokeswoman insisted on tuesday night that many thousands of tickets were sold yesterday but conceded that â there have been a lot of queues on the website and we are aware of that â
the official line is that those who managed to access the system often spent long periods browsing the options , which led to a delay for others in the queue
having begun the day with around 70,000 tickets to sell , officials were attempting to keep potential spectators informed of progress via twitter
but with an official re-sale programme now in operation , matches will not be declared official sell - outs as tickets may become available again at a later date .
