earlier this week , supermodel - turned - actress suki revealed the secret to achieving her perfectly - tousled red carpet - ready hair : washing her tresses with coke
during an interview with us weekly , the british - born 23 - year - old , who is currently busy promoting her new sci - fi thriller insurgent , admitted that she rinses her hair with the popular soda because it gives her hair the perfect amount of volume and texture , saying : ' i do n't like my hair when it 's washed - it 's fine and limp - but coke makes it tousled , like i 've gone through the amazon or something
' as someone who has always suffered from slightly limp , lifeless hair , i was overjoyed to hear that there might be such an easy - if not slightly bizarre - fix to my haircare woes and i could n't wait to give it a go
as suki was n't particularly clear about what method she prefers when it comes to rinsing her hair with fizzy soda , i did some research online to see whether there was a general consensus about the easiest and most effective way to use coke as an alternative to shampoo
i admit i was quite surprised to see that suki 's cola theory seems to have a lot of support from various outlets online ; along with advice on how to use the beverage in order to clean your windows and remove rust from metal , there were several coke - based haircare tips
and while some articles suggested using the soda as a pre-shampoo rinse , the majority claimed that using coke as your only ' haircare ' product would produce the best results , prompting me to abandon my beloved serge normant shampoo in favor of my cans of cola
sadly , my many attempts to warm up the cola cans under the warm water in the shower failed , so when it finally came around to dumping the stuff over my head , it was still fairly frosty ; certainly not the most enjoyable pre-bedtime experience
it is highly likely that i 'm also far less coordinated and graceful than suki , who boasts years of red carpet and catwalk experience , but i found the logistics of the whole coke rinse to be really quite tricky
pre-cola and post-cola : having suffered from limp , lifeless hair in the past ( l ) , charlie decided to give suki 's coke rinse a go but found it left her with very greasy roots ( r ) first of all , the soda - predictably - fizzes everywhere and i was left with several sticky brown splashes of cola in my bath which , although not a complete disaster , was just a bit of a pain
secondly , the cola did n't go exactly where i wanted to , and i actually ended up with a large amount of the first can 's contents in my eye and on my face
again , not the most pleasant of experiences
let 's just say , it was a good thing i had bought two cans because the first was , in all honesty , a total waste
however , when i finally managed to get the cola in my hair , i ca n't say it was that unpleasant a sensation ; other than the slight chill , it really did n't feel that different to washing my hair normally
it was n't nearly as sticky as i had imagined it would be , and i really could n't feel any ' fizziness ' on my head
plus , i thought the scent was really quite enjoyable
when it came to rinsing the cola out with water however , i was incredibly careful to ensure that it was all gone - call my crazy , but the idea of having sugary sweet and sticky hair just was n't too appealing , and i admit i was quite concerned about being attacked by swarms of flying insects confusing my hair for a sweet snack
after the cola rinse , and the subsequent water rinse , i left my hair alone , wanting to see exactly what the soda would do to it , without any additional styling products
i gave it a once over with the hair dryer and then headed to bed
who needs shampoo ? in place of her normal serge normant shampoo , charlie used two cans of coke to rinse her hair when i first woke up , i have to say i was quite impressed with how soft my hair felt
i had been really worried that my tresses would have transformed overnight into cola - encrusted dreadlocks and was thrilled to see that my hair still looked relatively normal
additionally , there was a bit of extra bounce to it , particularly at the roots
however , after brushing it through properly , my hair looked really rather greasy - yes there was some texture in the roots , and some added volume through the lengths , but my slick - looking style just made it look as though i had failed to wash my hair in days
granted , it was n't the worst look in the world , but it certainly did n't come anywhere near to the perfectly - tousled , textured tresses that suki was showcasing on the red carpet at the recent new york premiere of insurgent
i think perhaps from now on i 'll stick to shampoo - and perhaps invest in a good volumising hairspray .
