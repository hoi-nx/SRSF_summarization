everybody likes to believe that they will leave some kind of mark on this earth when they die , but for some , nobody will ever even know they are gone in the us , there are more than 2,000 unidentified women lying in morgues and unmarked graves across the country
artist sarah honan , 19 , from waterford , ireland , has now painted the portraits of several of these females alongside the limited details of their deaths , and any other information that is known about them in a project called blink
an ireland artist has painted a series of portraits of some of the 2,000 - plus ' janes does ' in morgues and graveyards across us who were n't identified after their deaths
now on show in waterford city , ireland , the blink exhibition hopes to build a legacy for the forgotten women ( pictured left : a victim of a ' sex party ' gone wrong was found laying dead between two parked cars in april 2004 , in new york , pictured right : a woman found naked on a street in mount vernon , new york , in 1988 explaining why she decided to do the portraits , sarah honan said : ' i decided to do the project because after originally searching for one jane doe to paint and then uncovering thousands , i realised that this was something very important
' while the information held on each woman varies greatly in detail , some clearly suffered violent deaths
one woman ( pictured above right ) , was found on 14 february 1988 , naked and lying on the street in an industrial area in mount vernon , new york
there were clear signs that she had been bound at the hands and ankles prior to her death
another ( pictured above left ) , was the victim of a ' sex party ' gone wrong , and was found laying dead between two parked cars on 27 april 2004 in new york
while some of the women portrayed died in apparently violent circumstances , others , such as this elderly woman found unresponsive outside 145 west 55th street in new york , in 2010 , are shrouded in mystery and speculation sarah honan was so touched by the stories of these women that she wanted to create a lasting memory for them on this earth , as they had been forgotten by those who knew them when they were alive
she said : ' i think that everyone deserves some form of legacy and in a way when these women died and went unidentified it was as if their slates had been wiped clean
' no name , no memories , no legacy
' i thought that once i was aware of this information it would be wrong of me to ignore it
sarah honan painted the women from their morgue photographs , which she found on the unidentified persons database
from gender based violence to the representation of women in society past and present , the blink project hopes to raise questions about the way women and their identity have been treated throughout history sarah honan believes that it is important these jane does are remembered because of the what they say about the way women are treated in society
she said : ' they had so much to say about gender based violence , the representation of women in society and lack of female identity throughout history
' these were all issues i 'd long wanted to explore and this became my way of entering the dialogue
' the woman pictured above is a typical example of the many women , who were most likely abused , that sarah honan is so keen to bestow a legacy on
