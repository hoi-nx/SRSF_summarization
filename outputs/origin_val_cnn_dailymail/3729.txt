uk families now have more cash to spend after tax than before the coalition came to power , official figures revealed this morning
the boost , just 37 days before the election , came as separate figures showed that uk 's economy grew faster than any other major rich country in the world last year
people 's confidence in their own finances also jumped to complete a ' hat trick of good news ' for david cameron and george osborne this morning
but over the whole of 2014 , the economy boomed by 2.8 per cent â faster than america , germany , france and every other country in the g7 group of rich countries
mr george osborne said the revised figures show the uk is ' clearly fastest growing major advanced economy ' in the world
separate figures released this morning revealed that in the final three months of the year , the average voter had Â£ 4,187 left over after tax , up 1.8 per cent on the previous quarter
mr george osborne said this meant that living standards were now officially higher than at the last election , when real disposable income was Â£ 4,187
the chancellor said : ' today we 've got a hat - trick of good news about the uk economy and with 37 days to go the election it 's another sign that changing course would put recovery at risk
' the chancellor george osborne , pictured at a pizza express restaurant in hove this morning , claimed the economic figures were a triple dose of good news david cameron was out campaigning at a building site at sainsbury 's head office in holborn , central london , this morning the office for national statistics said the economy grew 0.6 per cent in the last three months of the year â 0.1 per cent more than previously thought he added : ' we 've had a significant upgrade to gdp , the highest consumer confidence for over 12 years and confirmation that living standards are higher than they were at the last election
' this is good news for families and businesses across the country
' so voters now face a stark choice : do we stick with a plan which is working , delivering growth and jobs , or do we put all that at risk with ed miliband whose policies of more spending , more borrowing and higher taxes will lead to economic chaos
' gdp per head â the wealth of each briton rather than the economy as a whole â was also estimated to have increased in the last three months of the year â jumping by a healthy 0.5 per cent
lib dem treasury secretary danny alexander added : ' as we approach the general election , this upward revision in gdp is further evidence that our recovery plan is working
' but the shadow chancellor ed balls said conservatives claims that the economy was fixed would ' ring hollow with working people '
he said : ' a small upward revision today in the gdp figures does n't change that overall record
this has been a disappointing recovery and it did n't have to be this way
' if the conservatives want to go round and say ' our plan is working , look at the gdp figures ; our plan is working , look at the figures on disposable income ' then we say bring it on because the reality is that this is the toughest squeeze on people 's living standards in a parliament since the early 1920s
' he added : ' i do n't think that just crossing your fingers and hoping for the best is good enough
