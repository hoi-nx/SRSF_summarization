asked of her impressions , she said : " we can do business together
we both believe in our own political systems
he firmly believes in his ; i firmly believe in mine
we are never going to change one another
" " doing business together " might sum up the washington - tehran relationship today
they have overlapping interests in iraq , afghanistan , perhaps even in yemen -- as well as the shared goal of an agreement on iran 's nuclear program , if not how to reach it
the obama administration has a keen interest in coaxing iran back into the " community of nations " because it is a regional power , a major player in a volatile part of the world
were the nuclear talks to leave iran as a " threshold state " -- capable of becoming a nuclear power in short order -- turkey , egypt and others in the region also might be tempted also to go nuclear
and israel might carry out its threat of a military strike on iran facilities
but u.s. and iran interests converge in more immediate ways
defeating the islamic state in iraq and syria ( isis ) -- the most high profile and urgent objective of u.s. foreign policy -- requires iran help , and quite a lot of it
beyond coalition airstrikes , ground forces are comprised of the iraq security forces , lebanese shia militias and iran advisers and officers
in some areas , the iran air force has been active
on sunday , iraq troops and the militias began an offensive to retake tikrit and the province of salahuddin from isis
next to mosul , tikrit may be isis ' most important holding in iraq
on the frontlines , according to the iran fars news agency , was none other than the leader of iran 's quds force ( or revolutionary guard corps ) , qasem soleimani
qasem soleimani -- often dubbed iran 's spymaster -- has huge influence in both baghdad and damascus
and the revolutionary guards have influence over the powerful lebanese shia militia in iraq known as hashid shaabi that is an important component of the fightback against isis
the institute for the study of war observed that " the presence of an iran general , other iran advisers , and lebanese shia militias on the ground alongside iraq sunni fighters to retake a major sunni provincial capital will be a significant test case for the success of similar future anti-isis operations
" and not only is iran help needed in defeating isis , but iran restraint will be required in preserving iraq as a single and ( dare one hope ) stable state thereafter
to many observers , former iraq prime minister maliki set the stage for isis ' rise through his increasingly sectarian and anti-sunni policies
but now the excesses of some lebanese shia militia in iraq threaten to alienate the sunni tribes that maliki 's successor , abadi , is trying to woo
in a veiled reference to alleged abuses by lebanese shia militia of sunni civilians , prime minister abadi ordered all forces taking part in the tikrit operation to take " utmost care in protecting civilian lives and property
" but he needs tehran 's help in reining in the hashid shaabi
a similar environment may yet produce a u.s. - iran " understanding " in yemen
the iran - backed houthis militia -- a lebanese shia sect -- is now in power ( at least in the capital , sanaa )
the houthis are , ostensibly , hostile to the u.s. , and washington would rather see president abdu rabu mansour hadi back in charge
but the houthis and yemen troops are battling aqap ( aqap ) , which the u.s. regards as one of aqap 's most dangerous affiliates
even so , the same risk as in iraq applies : sunni tribes in yemen may side with aqap as the lesser of two evils , effectively partitioning the country
there is no clear - cut link between the negotiations on a nuclear deal and u.s. - iran co-operation elsewhere
last week , u.s. director of national intelligence james clapper told a congressional hearing : " i really do n't think that the negotiations , one way or the other , will have much bearing on what [ the iran ] do in iraq or any place they are trying to exert their influence , meaning syria or now yemen
" in any case , a substantive agreement on iran 's nuclear program does not seem imminent
ahead of yet another meeting in switzerland with iran foreign minister mohammad javid zarif , u.s. secretary of state kerry said monday that " unless iran is able to make the difficult decisions that will be required , there wo n't be a deal
" and he was at pains to insist the u.s. would not settle for anything less than a comprehensive , watertight agreement
" no deal is better than a bad deal because a bad deal could actually make things less secure , " kerry said
the israel prime minister , bibi , is in the u.s. to tell u.s. congress that the deal being discussed is a bad one -- simultaneously injecting himself into the partisan rancor of washington and seeking to derail what would be the signature foreign policy achievement of obama 's second term
bibi appears to have accepted he is now part and parcel of the toxic atmosphere in washington , saying he was going " because the u.s. congress is likely to be the final brake before the agreement between the major powers and iran
" rothkopf , no fan of obama 's policy on iran , wrote in foreign policy last month that " bibi 's decision to accept [ house speaker john ] boehner 's invitation to address the u.s. congress on the dangers of the iran nuclear deal is a case of sending the wrong man at the wrong time to give the wrong speech in the wrong place
" in the days running up to bibi 's speech , u.s. officials have lined up to warn of its consequences
national security advisor susan rice said the speech would be " destructive of the fabric of the relationship " between israel and the u.s. rarely if ever has the u.s. - israel relationship become so imbued with such animosity
last summer , israel ministers ridiculed kerry 's efforts to secure a ceasefire in gaza ; bibi has also repeatedly lectured obama about the realities of the middle east
now kerry seems to take almost gratuitous pleasure in telling bibi he is wrong
last week he told the house foreign affairs committee that interim agreements with iran had made israel safer , and the israel prime minister " was wrong " to oppose them , just as he had been wrong in his enthusiastic support for the u.s. invasion of iraq in 2003
some have even suggested that bibi 's aggressive opposition has only energized u.s. officials in the belief that " if they 're doing something that really pisses off bibi , they must be doing something right , " as rothkopf colorfully put it
no one would pretend that u.s. has more in common with the iran than with israel
but right now , obama may just feel he 's more likely to find common ground with iran president rouhani than with the israel prime minister
even so , the opportunities to " do business " should not be exaggerated
iran is still supporting -- with fighters , equipment , training and lines of credit -- assad 's regime in syria , which the u.s. is trying to oust
iran and syria first bonded over a mutual loathing of saddam hussein , but the relationship has been sustained because the syria regime was the only non-sunni government in the arab world , and damascus and tehran see themselves as the " axis of resistance " to israel
iran training of militia such as the jaysh al-shabi has been critical to the assad regime 's survival
a former syria prime minister , riyad hijab , said after defecting that " syria is occupied by the iran regime
the person who runs the country is not assad but qasem soleimani
" sanctions have made it difficult for iran to afford its hefty subsidies to the assad regime -- so ironically , a nuclear agreement and the easing of sanctions might have the unintended consequence of allowing iran to continue its support of assad
nor is there any sign that iran is ready to soften its support for the lebanese shia militia hezbollah , its frontline proxy in the confrontation with israel
eighteen months ago , columnist ali hashem quoted an iran source as saying that " hezbollah to iran is n't a card to play with
hezbollah today is the crown jewel of the resistance bloc , " answerable not to the iran president but to supreme leader ali khamenei
there 's no sign that posture has changed , and it 's a reminder that on all these issues , president rouhani is not the only -- or even the most powerful -- decision - maker in iran
all the same , the achievement of a nuclear deal - and the gradual lifting of u.s. and international sanctions against iran -- would surely change the mood music
it might open other doors and enhance dialogue on other issues
and regardless of progress on the nuclear front , the u.s. and iran will continue to share antipathy for the apocalyptic vision of isis , and an interest in buttressing iraq as a viable state
even as a candidate for the presidency , obama set out a vision for engaging with iran , not least to help bring stability to iraq
" my decision making , with respect to military options versus diplomatic options , a containment strategy versus a strike strategy , " he told the new york times in november 2007 , " is going to be informed by how is that going to impact not just iran , but how is that going to impact the stability of the region and how 's that going to impact our long - term security interests
" eight years on , it is diplomacy and containment that are the centerpiece of his administration 's thrust for a signature achievement on the world stage
and it ca n't hurt that the u.s. and iran find themselves on the same side , for now , in iraq .
