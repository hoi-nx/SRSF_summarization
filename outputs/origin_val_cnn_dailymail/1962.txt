the fbi is investigating the death of a black man in mississippi , who was found hanging from a tree thursday morning
the victim has been identified as byrd , 54 , who went missing on march 2 after his friend dropped him off at a casino in vicksburg , 30 miles north from where his body was discovered
his family reported him missing on march 8
the naacp was the first to identify byrd
officials have not yet confirmed the victim 's identity , but local authorities were searching for the missing man when they found the body
if the death is ruled a murder , the naacp 's concerns are that is has echoes of a lynching
byrd was convicted of murder in 1980 , but was then paroled in 2006
he shot dead a white woman named lucille trim as he carried out an armed robbery
he was found about 200 yards from his home
' we do n't know right now
all i can say is what i told you : it 's under investigation , ' coroner j.w. mallett said
jim walker , spokesman for the mississippi department of wildlife , fisheries and parks said the body had ' obvious signs ' of decay , suggesting it had been hanging there for at least a day

investigators are trying to determine whether byrd 's death was a homicide or suicide without a trace : the body was found in a wooded area near old rodney road in port gibson , mississippi about 200 yards from his home
the last time he was seen , a friend was dropping him off at a casino in vicksburg dark past : above , byrd 's parole board mugshot
he was released from prison in 2006 after spending 25 years in prison for a murder conviction the owner of the land , 87 - year - old johnie baker , said that the area where byrd 's body was found is covered in pecan and black walnut trees
he added that hunters sometimes hunt in the area and that there are also wild boars on the land
so far , authorities say it 's too early to determine whether the victim 's death was a homicide or a suicide
however , the naacp is petitioning to have the us department of justice involved in the investigation , fearing byrd 's death may have been a hate crime
the claiborne county sheriff 's department and mississippi bureau of investigation are also involved in the investigation
lynching was a common form of ' mob justice ' in the late 19th century , particularly in the south
a report by the equal justice initiative claims there were nearly 4,000 lynchings of african-american in the jim crow era across 12 states of the us
byrd spent 25 years in prison for the murder of lucille trim , the clarion-ledger reported according to the mississippi department of corrections
he allegedly robbed trimm of $ 101 and then killed her
he was convicted of capital murder in february 1980 and then was paroled in november 2006
