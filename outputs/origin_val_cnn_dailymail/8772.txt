the idea was that of uc berkely journalism professor william drummond , who teaches a news writing class at san quentin state prison , just north of san francisco
' i did it as a way to find out how these guys had reconciled their crimes , ' william drummond told the los angeles times
' were they able to take a critical look at what got them in trouble ? ' penning his ending : convicted murderer phoeun you sits against a fence in the exercise yard at san quentin state prison in california
he is one of several inmateswho wrote his own obituary for a class project repenting : you wrote in his obituary that , after killing someone , he would like save someone before he dies cambodian refugee phoeun you came to america when he was five - years - old
as a teenager he fell into the wrong crowd , blaming cultural differences , and soon joined an asian gang
when he was about 20 , you got into a fight outside a high school with a member of a latino gang
reeling from the fight , you went and got a gun , and set about trying to find his rivals from the fight
failing that , he opened fire at a random person on the street
' it was just a guy who looked like a gang member , ' you told the times
' he was close enough
' he killed the 17 - year - old boy , and bystanders were hit by bullets as well
you was convicted of murder and attempted murder in 1996 and could spend the rest of his life behind bars
professor william drummond told the inmates they could make up anything they wanted for their obituary and gave them free creative reign
most importantly they had to figure out how they would die
you wrote a story about a riot breaking out in san quentin state prison and how he saves the life of a teacher by stepping in front of a knife
he is stabbed to death by another inmate
you said , having killed someone himself , you would like to one day save someone
' my incarceration , the reason i 'm here , is by taking a life
when i leave this world , i would love to leave saving a life , ' he said

he paints a story of himself of being outdoorsy and enjoying camping and mountain climbing trips with his friend
padgett died ' as a result of a massive earthquake that struck san quentin state prison ' , his obituary said
they 're forces of nature , ' padgett told the times
' to take me out , it would take something like that
' emotional : troy ' kogen ' williams is serving a 70 - years - to - life sentence for armed robbery , carjacking and false imprisonment at san quentin state prison haines , who is serving 55 years for a string of bank robberies , also did not mention his crimes

but he goes on to reminisce about his childhood and the stages in his life that were positive - where things could have been different
haines includes his piece ' quotes ' from a classmate about how proactive a student he was in san diego , including being class president
' he built the treasury from just a couple of dollars , to several thousand , ' the quote said
' his biggest accomplishment was at homecoming , our float was the biggest one , and our junior class ball was held at a big fancy hotel
the seniors were somewhat jealous

' once i got derailed , that was it , ' he said
