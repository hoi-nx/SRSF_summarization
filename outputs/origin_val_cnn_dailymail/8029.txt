dundee united star paton has launched an astonishing attack on celtic as he accused the parkhead club of having a long history of â manipulating â people and situations for their own benefit
the frustrated tannadice star claimed there have been â continual injustices â across the three games between dundee united and celtic this month that have yielded six red cards - four for jackie mcnamara âs team
in the wake of the stormy 1 - 1 scottish cup draw at tannadice , celtic manager deila and his captain brown both accused dundee united kid aidan connolly of â diving â to win his side a penalty
paton ( right ) believes celtic ' manipulate people ' and have been doing so for the past few years despite deila calling on the sfa to take action , none was forthcoming but dundee united were subsequently denied a penalty when brown barged ryan dow in the league cup final , won 2 - 0 by celtic at hampden last sunday
and after the 4 - 0 scottish cup replay win at parkhead on wednesday , deila accused ryan mcgowan of endangering the career of liam henderson with a wild lunge
but the dundee united camp felt the reaction of celtic âs players may have influenced murray âs decision to send the australian off
the dundee united star and deila have previous when they clashed at tannadice in the quarter - final and ahead of the fourth and final match between dundee united and celtic at parkhead in the premiership on saturday , paton appeared to accuse celtic of heaping pressure on match officials
â deila has an opinion on everything but i do nât really read too much into what he has to say or who he puts pressure on , â said paton
â but i think celtic as a club can manipulate people more than dundee united can
that kind of thing has been happening for years
the tough tackling midfielder goes up for a header with celtic star nir biton in the cup final on sunday â we have seen injustices in the last few games we have played and that causes frustration
it feels that we do not get any decisions and that it is continual
â i saw things differently ( to deila )
i do nât think ryan mcgowan deserved to get sent off as he clearly won the ball
i do nât know if i am being biased but it is a hard tackle but he clearly won the ball
â i do nât think there was much in it ( but ) they have made a lot of it
it looked like a good tackle to me but that is only my opinion
â ryan mcgowan ( right ) was sent off for a tackle on conor henderson and angered celtic 's players paton âs sense of injustice was also stoked by the failure of referee murray to hand a second yellow to efe ambrose for a foul on nadir ciftci at 1 - 0
he continued : â i thought he was lucky to stay on the park but we have seen it in the last few meetings that we do nât seem to get things like that going for us against celtic
â how he stayed on the park i will never know
it was a clear yellow card
but when you come to places like ( parkhead ) you never seem to get these decisions
â i do nât know if it is just coincidence but you saw last weekend in the league cup final we should have had a clear penalty
paton believes efe ambrose ( centre ) should also have been sent off for a second bookable offence â then efe ambrose should have got sent off when we were on top in the game and it did not happen
small things like that change games
â paton also defended himself after celtic âs stokes yesterday accused the dundee united midfielder of catching him with a â sly elbow â
stokes was sent off for retaliation but later said on twitter : â i get a sly elbow in the face by someone that has nothing about them and get sent off , typical ! â but paton pleaded his innocence , saying : â i have ran across him and i do nât know if he thinks i have meant to hit him but he has lashed out and caught me on the side of the face
â i stepped across him and i do nât know if i have caught him with my leg or my arm
i honestly do nât know but it was certainly not intentional
â but there âs no edge between the two teams
it âs been taken out of context as there were not really any bad challenges in the game
we come back to parkhead on saturday in the league with a clean slate
