a radio dj has spoken of her nightmare being stalked by a man for 13 years - who would call her 66 times an hour and even threatened to throw acid in her face
sayles became so terrified of her stalker that she began to self - harm and was afraid to go in to work at sunrise radio , in bradford , alone
the 40 - year - old says she finally has her life back after enduring more than a decade of sickening harassment because of stalker feroz
sayles ( pictured left and right , at work at sunrise radio ) endured ' sheer hell ' thanks to a stalker who harassed her for 13 years
stalker feroz was detained indefinitely in hospital feroz , 55 , was detained in hospital indefinitely last month after judge jonathan durham hall qc ruled he posed a serious danger to the public and sunrise radio station in particular
ms sayles revealed seeing her stalker in court was only the second time she had seen him in person
but during years of what she described as ' sheer hell , ' ms sayles said authorities had refused to act because he had never physically attacked her - until last year , when he threatened her with acid attacks and vowed to put her in a wheelchair
she said : ' this man has been in my life longer than my own husband
it 's a huge weight off my shoulders as i can get on with my life
' the calls would range from between 10 to 66 calls every hour
i once had 41 calls in 30 minutes
ms sayles says she became too afraid to go in to work at sunrise radio ( pictured ) in bradford alone she added : ' i was the only white person working at the station at the time so whether he fixated on that or the fact i was the only one answering i do n't know but it was 13 years of sheer hell
' ms sayles , from bradford , says the abuse started in 2001 after a rival business to feroz 's was advertised on sunrise radio
after his business went bust , feroz appeared to blame the station - and as ms sayles was the only person answering the phones at the radio station at the time , she believes this is why he became fixated on her
' he became fixated with me , i think , because i was the only one on the phones so he constantly spoke to me when he called , ' she said
' i had a police escort one night when i attended an election count for work
i did n't want to do my job anymore
it was so emotionally draining
' feroz was jailed in 2004 for a campaign of harassment against a number of people
ms sayles was a witness in this trial , but she said he blamed his jail sentence entirely on her
the jail time failed to deter his actions and after losing his mother early last year , the abuse became more sinister
' he threatened to rape me and to kill me , ' she said
' he would ring and ask if i could hear anything then i would hear what sounded like the loading of a gun
' he even said i was a prostitute and that my boss was my pimp
it got so bad that my mum or dad had to take me to work
' in march 2014 , he told me he was going to wait for me and throw acid in my face - that was the final straw
' feroz was found to be mentally unfit to plead a charge of stalking involving fear of violence in november last year - but a jury found he had committed the acts alleged
he appeared at bradford crown court last month , where a judge ruled he be detained indefinitely in lynfield mount psychiatric hospital
feroz appeared at bradford crown court ( pictured ) last month , where a judge ruled he be detained indefinitely in lynfield mount psychiatric hospital ms sayles added : ' i would urge anyone who is suffering with harassment of any sort to seek help
' there are so many people who put up with this and feel helpless but they should n't
i stood up to my stalker and now i feel free
' ms sayles said she was supported by the suzy lamplugh trust , which helped her through ' the most difficult times '
judge durham hall told bradford crown court that feroz was not a bad man , but a ' poorly ' one
he said : ' the victim , the editor of sunrise radio , has been subjected to years of very intense unhappiness at the hands , or rather the words , of mr feroz
' there has been a life - altering , intensely frightening , series of verbal attacks
