labour insiders privately noted that they thought burley ' intervened and followed up aggressively a number of times '
at one point burley told mr ed : ' that 's a politicians answer there is n't it ? ' she also pressed him on the impact of his leadership victory over his brother david
when the labour leader said family relations had been strained , burley responded : ' your poor mum
' in a series of posts on twitter , burley took on her critics
burley took to twitter to hit back at her critics online , insisting she thought mr ed ' did brilliantly with the audience ' while mr david cameron was asked about treating the elderly with dignity and the depth of spending cuts , mr ed faced a series of aggressive questions
the tory leader 's first question from the audience was : ' what do you think are ed âs best qualities ? ' one of the few off - the - cuff questions from burley to the pm was : ' have you ever had three shredded wheat ? ' when mr ed face the audience , he was frist asked : ' you sound gloomy most of the time , are things really so bad ? ' another asked : ' do you not think that your brother would have done a better job ? he was better qualified and better positioned

surely you remember from when your were direct messaging me

channel 4 boss jay hunt described the show as ' vintage jeremy paxman '
during the q&a mr ed was challenged over why he is so gloomy , out of touch and not as good as his brother
a snap poll showed 54 per cent of people thought mr david cameron won on the night , with 46 per cent backing mr ed
in the icm poll for the guardian , mr david cameron narrowly beat mr ed on having the best arguments , seeming more convincing and having the more appealing personality
but out of those who said they may change their minds on which way to vote , 56 per cent said they could move to labour against just 30 per cent for the conservatives
the two men vying for the keys to number 10 on may 7 did not go head - to - head but instead appeared separately to be interviewed by jeremy paxman and questioned by an audience of voters

the labour leader insisted : ' am i tough enough ? hell , yes , i 'm tough enough
' jeremy paxman suggested that even labour mps considered ed a ' liability ' and that he was seen as ' a north london geek ' by many voters , who thought : ' what a shame it 's not his brother
' jeremy paxman told him how he had met a man on the tube who said the labour leader would not survive an encounter with putin
mr ed insisted : ' i do n't care
i do n't care what the newspapers say
' apparently taken aback by the onslaught , mr ed claimed he did not read bad press about himself , adding : ' it 's water off a duck 's back , honestly
' the thing i 've learnt most in this job is to be yourself
that 's what i am
people have to decide - do they want my ideas , do they want my principles when i stood up not just to president obama , but rupert murdoch , the energy companies , the banks , fighting for ordinary people , which is what i believe in and what i came into politics for ? '
