kalpana fitzpatrick , founder of mummymoneymatters.com said : ' when it comes to spending money , women may well be splashing the cash on designer or high end fashion brands , but women are also better at saving
' time and time again , studies have found that women hold the purse strings when it comes to managing the money at home and they are also better at saving and budgeting than their partners
â ' however , although the recession may be a distant memory , many households are still struggling with finances and have not yet achieved a level of comfort they were in pre-recession â so it âs important that people continue to save and budget wisely
