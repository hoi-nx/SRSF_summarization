salmond yesterday issued a chilling demand for state control of the bbc in scotland to further the nationalist cause
the former snp leader , who is standing for parliament in the election , was accused of a naked attempt to interfere with the corp âs independence after saying it had a â metropolitan bias â that works against his party âs cause
in a clear threat , he said broadcasting should be placed â under the remit of our democratically - elected parliament in scotland â
but it was his intemperate attack on the national broadcaster that raised eyebrows
during last year âs independence referendum campaign , hundreds of nationalist â yes â supporters held a protest outside bbc scotland in glasgow with a banner referring to the corp âs political editor that said : â sack nick â the liar â robinson
â mr salmond said : â what surprised me was the degree to which the bbc allowed themselves to be influenced by headlines in a biased press
i had no surprise about the written press but i was surprised and disappointed by the way [ the bbc ] allowed themselves to be â¦ by that agenda
â he added : â i do nât think the broadcasting issue ... will be properly resolved until we have broadcasting under the remit of our democratically - elected parliament in scotland
â a labour peer has hit back at cameron for calling the party âs leadership â sneering , hopeless â hampstead lefties
veteran broadcaster joan bakewell yesterday rounded on the prime minister for criticising â champagne socialists â from the fashionable london borough where she lives
mr cameron used the tory spring conference on saturday to accuse mr miliband and his supporters of displaying the â same old condescending , bossy , interfering , we - know - best attitude of the hampstead socialist down the ages â
baroness bakewell told the bbc âs andrew marr show : â he âs had a go at me and many like me : â spare us from ed âs sneering , hopeless hampstead lefties
â why ? why should we be excluded like this ? we âve got votes , we âve got interests , we âve got consciences , we care about the poor and the dispossessed , we are willing to pay our taxes
â clearly cameron is panicking
it âs just abusive , personal attacks
it âs not about policies â he just does nât like us
â mr salmond also boasted about how closely he could work with miliband as the snp unveiled its support for tax hikes.scotland âs former first minister said that the party had experience in â upsetting the apple cart â , which it would deploy at westminster
the snp will back ed balls âs controversial scheme to balance the country âs books by increasing the income tax rate from 45p to 50p for those earning over Â£ 150,000
mr miliband has claimed that he would not go into a formal coalition with the snp , but the nationalists yesterday backed a string of labour policies in the latest sign of how the parties could work together to push through a left - wing agenda snp deputy leader stewart hosie said : â in the next parliament , snp mps will support the re-introduction of the 50p tax rate for the very wealthiest
â he said he hoped the party would have a â huge group â of mps after may 7 that would also vote with labour to abolish the so - called bedroom tax
mr salmond yesterday said the tories â attempts to portray mr miliband as in his pocket were â fundamentally stupid â
he added : â in terms of skulduggery and upsetting the apple cart and various parliamentary techniques , there âs a wee bit of experience might be there in the group we have
â snp leader nicola sturgeon yesterday confirmed the party would demand an mp on each commons committee , including for devolved issues such as health and education , if it does well in the election
labour introduced the higher rate tax band , paid by those earning more than Â£ 150,000 , in 2010
the coalition then cut it to 45p in 2012 , prompting labour to accuse them of giving a â tax cut to millionaires â
first minister nicola sturgeon ( left ) hugs former first minister salmond , as she closes the snp conference at the secc in glasgow today but official figures show britain âs richest have paid more income tax since it was abolished
tory mp iain stewart said yesterday : â this is another example of labour - snp collusion
nicola sturgeon has made it absolutely clear she would prop up a minority labour government
â labour shadow scottish secretary margaret curran said : â this is a naked attempt by salmond to interfere in an institution that no political party would attempt to control
the bbc is independent of government and it should stay that way
â a bbc scotland spokesman said : â our coverage of the referendum was fair and balanced
