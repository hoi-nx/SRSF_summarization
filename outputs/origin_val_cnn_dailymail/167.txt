failure has become a formality for london welsh and relegation became a reality after they suffered their 18th consecutive aviva premiership defeat in a dire meeting with bath
this was more â sloppy sunday â than â super saturday â as torrential weather conditions dictated an arm wrestle that confirmed the end of the exiles â short - lived spell back in the top flight
for london welsh coach phillips , on his first game in charge since taking over from justin burnell , it spelt the beginning of a long and painful rebuilding process to get the oxford - based franchise back to where they want to be
â we have to learn our lessons , â said phillips
â there is honest ambition throughout the club and the mindset has to be about improving
we will have one eye on next season

â the conditions were terrible , â said bath director of rugby mike ford
â we âll put that game in the bin and next week will be a different spectacle
