the bay of fundy is known for having the highest tidal range in the world
and a time - lapse video that captures the rise and fall of the ice - capped tide at hall âs harbour in nova scotia , canada , shows the natural wonder in all its beauty
three fishing boats in the video appear to be beached as day breaks and the large sweeping shadow is replaced by sunlight
day breaks at hall âs harbour in nova scotia and the large sweeping shadow is replaced by sunlight suddenly the tide begins to rise in the distance and as water rushes through to the harbour the boats begin to rock on the surface of the bay
the surface remains frozen throughout the video , but a gap in the ice on the left shows water flooding onto the side of the bank as the level rises
before long the water has risen to be parallel with the harbour and the boats that were once grounded sit awkwardly on the top of the ice
as the tide begins to rise water rushes through to the harbour and the boats begin to rock on the surface two men can be seen shovelling snow from one of the boats as the water level begins to decrease once more
they leave for the day as nightfall approaches , and darkness soon cloaks the scene
the bay of fundy , which has contested for world tidal dominance with the leaf basin in ungava bay , canada , achieved the record for the highest water level ever at the head of minas basin on the night of the â saxby gale â on october 4 , 1869
in 1975 , the guinness book of world records declared that burntcoat head , nova scotia has the highest tides in the world
the water rises to be parallel with the harbour and the boats that were once grounded sit awkwardly on top according to oceanographers , tidal resonance resulting from a coincidence of timing is the cause for the dramatic increase in water levels
however , traditional mi'kmaq folklore attributes the high tides in the bay of fundy to a giant whale splashing in the water
tens of thousands of people flocked to beauty spots on the coasts of canada , the uk , france and the netherlands over the weekend to catch a glimpse of the â tide of the century â
as nightfall approaches , darkness cloaks the scene and the water level begins to fall once more the guinness book of world records declared that burntcoat head , nova scotia has the world 's highest tides it was the first giant tide of the millennium , with experts predicting that it could reach as high as 46ft in north - eastern france
although it is dubbed the â tide of the century â , the â supertide â phenomenon occurs once every 18 years when a rare alignment of the sun , moon and earth create a massive gravitational pull on the sea
the next â tide of the century â will take place in march 2033 .
