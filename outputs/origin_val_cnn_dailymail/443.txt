a council has been forced to issue a â complete and utter â apology for squandering over Â£ 500,000 of taxpayers â money
forest of dean district council accepted a humiliating motion criticising it for â scandalous waste â over the past eight years after an ambush by labour members
they forced through the vote , demanding an â unqualified apology â , when the ruling conservatives were left short of numbers at a meeting this week
forest of dean district council was forced to apologise for squandering over Â£ 500,000 on renovation work the council was criticised for spending nearly Â£ 400,000 on renovating a reception area at its offices and another Â£ 120,000 on demolishing a building which they failed to sell and which has lain empty for four years
it was also attacked for shutting the district âs tourism information offices and imposing charges for pest control , bulk waste and garden waste collections and car parking
the apology has already been posted on the authority âs website and in press releases
labour councillor di martin , who introduced the motion , said the tory administration , which has run the council in gloucestershire for eight years , â has failed miserably to listen to the people of the forest of dean and as a result they have been badly let down , an unqualified apology is due â
tory council leader molyneux explained his party had abstained from voting against the embarrassing motion she added : â an apology is needed for the scandalous waste of taxpayers â money on the refurbishment of the district council âs reception area [ at a cost of Â£ 383,320 ]
â the cost of refurbishment was meant to be recouped by the sale of lawnstone house , which is now to be demolished at a further cost of Â£ 120,000
â last night tory council leader molyneux explained why his party had abstained from voting against the embarrassing motion , which he dismissed as a â blatant piece of electioneering â
â we did nât take part in the debate
we were down on our numbers and we were nât sure we âd have the support to win in the chamber so we did nât vote , â he said
â we do nât regret it because it âs a stupid motion â it âs ill - founded and if anybody should hang their head in shame it is di martin
â we were voted the most - improved council in the country in 2013 and if that âs something we should apologise for , she âs completely lost the plot
â mr molyneux added that the renovation work to the council âs offices â which included Â£ 13,550 to replace a cctv system â was essential as it made the building more accessible to the disabled
â it does seem like a lot but the old block where the reception was was nât disabled friendly
if she thinks that âs a waste of money , she âs missing the plot
â independent members of the council criticised the â mud - slinging contest â between the two main parties .
