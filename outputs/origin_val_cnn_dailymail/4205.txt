a woman who tried to sue her landlord after she fell off an upstairs landing and was left paraplegic has had her case dismissed because a judge found she was ' severely intoxicated ' when she fell
hutch was having a celebratory drink at her rented townhouse in doubleview , perth , with her adult son and daughter on christmas day in 2009 after signing a lease on the property the previous day
ms hutch went upstairs at the two - storey property to find her bag , and when she could not see it in her bedroom she had a ' quick look ' over the balustrade of a landing at the top of the stairs to see if it was in the kitchen below
she lost her balance and fell over the balustrade , falling several metres onto the floor below
ms hutch suffered head and spinal injuries and is now a paraplegic
hutch tried to sue her landlord after she fell off an upstairs landing and was left paraplegic she sued her landlord ryan for damages in the district court of western australia , claiming that the balustrade was too low and she was therefore unable to stop herself once she had begun to fall
but judge felicity davis ruled that the accident was caused by ms hutch 's ' severe intoxication ' and mr ryan was therefore not liable for damages
ms hutch gave evidence that she and her son started drinking sparkling wine at 10.30am on december 25 , and said she ' probably ' drank a bottle or the equivalent of 6.5 standard drinks
the accident occurred just before 1.30pm and she was taken to hospital by ambulance
tests at hospital found she had a blood alcohol level about six times the legal driving limit
toxicologist professor david joyce gave evidence that ms hutch 's blood alcohol level suggested she had drunk between 20 and 21 standard drinks
judge felicity davis ruled that the accident was caused by ms hutch 's ' severe intoxication ' and her landlord was therefore not liable for damages ' based on her plasma and blood alcohol level and professor joyce 's evidence , i find that the plaintiff was severely intoxicated and that this influenced her behaviour when it came to matters of safety , ' judge davis said
' i find on the balance of probabilities that the reason the plaintiff leaned beyond the point of no return was because of her state of intoxication
' judge davis also found that the balustrade measured 865mm and was compliant with building codes , despite ms hutch 's expert witnesses submitting evidence suggesting it only measured 857mm
the judge said the landlord 's expert witness , builder and building surveyor darren mouchmore , ' properly measured ' the balustrade and found it to be 865mm .
