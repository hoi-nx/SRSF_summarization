dr morgan , 29 , gave the cocktail of drugs to trained huntsman steen , after inviting him and two other friends back to his home in rugby , warks , at the end of the night
the doctor , who had only met mr steen that night , gave the 23 - year - old media student class b drug mephedrone and class c drug gamma - hydroxybutyrate ( ghb ) , one of the most common date - rape drugs
jailed : dr morgan , 29 ( left ) , from rugby , warks , has been jailed for six months for supplying date - rape drugs and meow meow to 23 - year - old steen ( right ) , who died after choking on a sock ' talented ' : the trained huntsman ( pictured ) , who was president of the polo society at newcastle , had gone back to morgan 's house following a night out with him and two other friends but the court heard how the student , from poyntzpass , near newry , northern ireland , had a fetish for sniffing socks and later suffocated to death after partially swallowing one
jailing him at warkwick crown court , a judge told morgan that his career had been left in tatters for committing the ' terrible dereliction of duty '
judge sylvia de bertodano added that , as a doctor , morgan should have lived up to his ' position of authority ' - and known more than anyone that drugs ' ruin lives '
she said : ' it 's tragic cases like this which reinforce the message courts send out when they sentence for the supply of drugs , that drugs of whatever class ruin lives
' you , better than anyone , should know that
you are not only a doctor , you are an outstanding one
so as well as taking morgan 's life , you have ruined your own life
your career , which you worked so hard to build , is in jeopardy
' she added : ' as a doctor , even in a social context , you were in a position of authority
he had taken a great deal more of the class c drug than any of the other three of you
' allowing that to happen was a terrible dereliction of your duty
' the message has to go out that if someone , in particular a doctor , supplies a non-drug - user with illegal drugs and they die as a result , they must go to prison
' tragic : judge sylvia de bertodano said mr steen 's ' tragic ' death sent out the message that ' drugs or whatever class ruin lives '
she also offered her sympathies to mr steen 's family , saying : ' you are going to have to work very hard to rebuild your life - but that is something steen will never be able to do
' steen was a young man on the very threshold of life
he had everything to live for
nothing you can do , and i can do today can reconcile his family to their loss
' morgan , who worked as registrar at coventry 's university hospital , met mr steen through his partner chapman and his friend deptford
mr deptford , who played for northampton outlaws rugby club , had befriended mr steen online and stayed with him when he visited newcastle
' threshold of life ' : she added that morgan had committed a ' terrible dereliction of duty ' by allowing mr steen ( pictured ) to take drugs , despite him being a doctor ' in a position of authority ' promising : the student ( left and right ) , from poyntzpass , near newry , northern ireland , was a keen skier and was studying media , communications and cultural studies at newcastle the student , who was a keen skier , lived in newcastle while studying media , communications and cultural studies at the university
the court heard mr steen had travelled to rugby for a meal with mr deptford , mr chapman and morgan
the four men went to the steam turbine pub in the town and had a meal before moving on to another pub. prosecutor lal amarasinghe told the court they all went back to morgan 's victorian terraced home , where he got a bottle of ' poppers ' which was passed round to sniff
he said : ' mr deptford , who had been quite drunk , could not recall anything else until waking up and realising he and the other three were all naked and mr steen was lying on the floor
' everything to live for ' : the night before his death he travelled down to rugby for a meal with mr deptford - who had befriended steen online - mr chapman and morgan
the four men later went back to morgan 's home ' realising something was wrong , he pinched him to try to get a reaction , but without any response , and immediately called to morgan who examined the student
' an ambulance was called , and as they waited they tried to resuscitate mr steen but realised his airway was blocked
' mr deptford , who knew mr steen had a fetish for sniffing socks and putting them in his mouth , found he had a sock blocking his throat , and pulled it out
paramedics then arrived , but mr steen was already beyond help
' morgan was arrested in the street nearby on suspicion of murder
that was later reduced to supplying drugs
the court heard how police found traces of mephedrone , a synthetic stimulant , on a chopping board and a bottle which had contained gbl , which can be an anaesthetic and hypnotic agent , in the property
in large amounts it can cause respiratory failure
spirit : after his death , mr steen 's parents said their son had been a ' kind , caring , intelligent and very talented young man , with a generous spirit ' the court heard mr steen died of respiratory failure as a result of a blockage of his airway , although the drugs were said to be a â direct contributor â to that
christopher millington qc , defending , said : ' this was a talented student , and the consequence of his death has caused terrible grief to his family
' this case is tragic in many ways
at the heart of it is the death of a talented student , and in the dock to face the consequences is a gifted doctor
' the case is complicated by this fact : as we understand it , the cause of death was asphyxiation
' what the deceased had done was put a sock in his mouth which , according to mr deptford , he had partially swallowed
nobody knew it was there until after his death
probe : after an ambulance was called to his home , morgan was arrested in the street nearby on suspicion of murder

it was not the direct cause of death
' he added that the consequences of jailing morgan would be to deprive the public ' of the services of a gifted doctor
' he said there was a ' stand - out reference ' from dr belinda stanley , a member of the gmc 's disciplinary tribunal , who described morgan as ' among the best she has ever worked with
' mr millington added : ' the sad fact is that having devoted so many years of his life to becoming a doctor , he has put his career in jeopardy because of the irresponsibility he displayed during that social gathering
' that is something he will have to live with , together with the guilt and feeling of responsibility over the death of the deceased
' after mr steen 's death , his family described the young man as ' kind , caring and very talented '
in a statement released through police , they said : ' morgan enriched our lives , and the lives of others , in so many ways
' he was a kind , caring , intelligent and very talented young man , with a generous spirit
he touched everyone he met with his positivity and his sense of humour
' we are devastated by morgan ' untimely death , but we are comforted by knowing how much he was loved and admired by his family , friends and university colleagues
' we are immensely proud of our son , and all he achieved and the significant mark he made during his brief time on this earth
