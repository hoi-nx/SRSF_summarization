a south african woman who snatched a newborn baby and raised her as her own for nearly 18 years was today banned by a judge from any contact with the child
the 50 - year - old was ordered to live at a secret address isolated from the girl she 'd brought up and the husband she 'd deceived when she appeared in court following her arrest for kidnapping
yesterday the biological mother of zephany who was snatched from her arms in hospital in april 1997 , thanked the stranger who had brought her up for ' doing a good job ' in an exclusive interview with mailonline
today celeste and morne were forced to stand in the packed cape town as the seamstress who had stolen their three day old baby was granted bail with strict conditions
the seamstress , from a poverty - stricken suburb of cape town , looked grief - stricken but managed to smile weakly at a clutch of friends who had gathered to support her in court
outside court , judith wasserfall , a neighbour of the accused was emotional as she recalled the day her friend had brought her baby girl home from hospital in april 1997
' we were so thrilled for her , she looked so happy , ' she said
' we have watched that child grow up , what a lovely girl she is
' we helped change her nappies and she was so cute and smiley , everyone loved her , she played with my own daughters
' as a mother and child they just seemed just to fit together â like a proper family
the mother is a lovely , lovable woman , always smiling and kind and will do anything for you
' we are all just in shock , and pain
now the house is empty , and we miss them
' it was the husband who came to tell us what had happened , when she had been arrested for kidnap
my knees went weak , i felt numb when he told us
' he looked shocked , broken , he did n't know a thing
no one did , only she knew this secret and she kept it all these years
' relief : unbelievably , celeste has revealed she has already forgiven the woman who kidnapped her daughter shock : zephany ( pictured ) is coming to terms with the fact her family is not who she thought they were zephany , who was given a different name by the woman â neither of whom can be identified â is being cared for by social workers and has met her biological family three times since discovering her real identity
it is understood she has also seen the man she thought of as her father , who was in court but unable to answer any questions , only shaking his head in apparent shock
the girl , who turns 18 next month , learned she had been stolen at birth following an extraordinary twist of fate when her long lost sister , 13 - year - old cassidy , joined her school
unaware they were related , the girls struck up a close friendship , despite their age difference , and soon became inseparable
once morne , 37 , learned of his daughter 's new older friend ' who looks just like us ' , he sought her out and immediately felt an inexplicable bond with the girl
the electrical sales rep then carried out his own investigation into the 17 - year - old , scanning her facebook page for information which would help prove she was the three - day - old baby who 'd been taken from his sleeping wife 's arms
anger : there is a feeling of betrayal in the community where zephany was raised on the cape flats , with many questioning how this lie has been able to go on beneath their noses for so many years precious : the family only have a few photos of zephany taken before she was snatched
here she is with her uncle abraham nurse in hospital on april 29 , 1997 the father of four told mailonline , ' when i saw zephany for the first time the feeling was there completely
' i looked at her and i do n't know what it was , but i fell in love with my daughter when i saw her , i thought ' wow what is this feeling ? ' i do n't know how to express myself , it was confusion , attraction , confusion , it was everything all in one
' and she said later that it was the same from her
' he downloaded a picture of the woman who was raising zephany from the girl 's facebook page and sent it to a witness who had seen the woman , dressed in a nurse 's uniform , carrying the baby away from celeste as she slept , heavily medicated following a cesarean section
she confirmed that it was the kidnapper she had seen at the groote schuur hospital more than 17 years before
morne also sent a photograph of the girl to celeste , 36 , who immediately recognised her as zephany
' when he sent me the photo i burst into tears , she looked exactly like cassidy
she had the same face , ear lobes , nose , she was the same
i said ' this is my daughter '
instinct : morne ( centre , arriving at court with ex-wife celeste , left ) said he recognised his nearly 18 - year - old daughter immediately - despite not having seen her since she was just three days old appeals : the family has worked hard to make sure people do n't forget about their missing daughter over the years , including a big appeal in 2010 in the local newspaper the cape argus , but no one ever come forward once they were satisfied that they had enough evidence , they contacted police who carried out dna tests and proved they had traced their own child
during the short court hearing , the accused did not look in the direction of morne and celeste â who are now divorced
both families have lived only streets apart for all of zephany 's life and the poverty - stricken community of lavender hill , where drugs and gangs are rife , are divided over the extraordinary story
it is understood that the baby snatcher had had a still birth before she took zephany and was able to breastfeed the newborn and bring her home from hospital without raising suspicion , even from her own husband
the packed , wood - pannelled court heard that the accused is in ' precarious health ' , and is understood to suffer from diabetes and a heart condition
prosecutor bonnie currie-gamwo did not oppose the application for bail , which was set at 350 pounds
the woman will have to report to the police station near to her new address which was not revealed in court
releasing the woman on bail , mr engel ordered her to ' make no contact directly or indirectly with any witnesses in this matter , including the child '
he specified that this included ' via facebook , social media , whatsapp , or sending any messages with third parties '
she is next due to appear in court on may 29 .
