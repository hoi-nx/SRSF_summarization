apple chief executive cook is joining the roster of the very rich who are giving away their wealth
the head of the world 's largest technology corporation told fortune magazine he plans to donate his estimated $ 785million fortune to charity - after paying for his ten - year - old nephew 's college education
' you want to be the pebble in the pond that creates the ripples for change , ' cook told the magazine
he also holds restricted stock worth $ 665 million if it were to be fully vested
the 54 - year - old ceo 's revelation in fortune 's lengthy profile of him is an example of the increasingly public philanthropy of the world 's richest people
billionaire financier warren buffet is encouraging the very wealthy to give away at least half their worth in their lifetimes through the ' giving pledge , ' whose website lists such luminaries as microsoft corp 's bill gates , mark zuckerberg of facebook inc and oracle corp 's larry ellison
while cook 's largesse could not begin to approach the scale of a bill gates or mark zuckerberg - both worth billions of dollars - the apple ceo told fortune he hopes to make a difference
