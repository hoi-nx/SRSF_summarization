the previous year she was one of the inaugural recipients on the now - highly regarded park scholarships which put a premium on travel and service
within days she started work at spinelli 's coffee shop in the crocker galleria in san francisco 's financial district to help pay for a photography course she was due to start at uc berkeley the day after she vanished
on the day of her disappearance she asked a co-worker for directions to baker beach
after she went missing police dogs tracked her scent to the water 's edge at nearby land 's end beach
the last sighting of kristen was walking through the upscale mall with a blonde woman , who has never been identified

she was one of the inaugural recipients on the now - highly regarded park scholarships which put a premium on travel and service
this is not the first time that durst has been linked to kristen modafferi or to mitchell , who was 16 when she was last seen in eureka , california , five months after kristen 's disappearance
durst owned a house in san francisco at the time kristen vanished and he was known to be living in trinidad , california , some 25 miles north of eureka when karen went missing after getting into a car
a police sketch of a man driving that car bears an uncanny likeness to the troubled new york property heir
author matt birkbeck first connected durst to the two missing teens in the 2003 paperback edition of his book a deadly secret : the strange disappearance of kathie durst
the fbi checked durst out at the time but could not prove that he was connected to either woman
allison is also skeptical even now that durst , who was found not guilty of the 2001 murder of black , his neighbor in galveston , texas , despite admitting that he chopped his body up and threw it in the sea , will be charged in connection with her sister 's disappearance
' there is just not a lot of evidence , ' she told daily mail online
' the fbi looked at him a few years ago and came up with nothing
' we have had so many leads over the years that have led nowhere
' the family has never given up hope that kristen , who would now be 35 , is still alive , despite the fact there has been no trace of her for nearly half of her life
they dismiss the possibility that she might have staged her own disappearance
' we were a very close family â we still are a very close family , ' said allison
' and there are no signs that she wanted to disappear
she had n't packed her bags or withdrawn money or anything like that
' but still the family clings to the hope that she is still alive
in obituaries placed in the charlotte observer after the deaths of her grandfather tony modafferi in 2002 and his widow lillian in 2006 , the family wrote that they left ' four granddaughters , allison , kristen , lauren and meghan
' scanlon-petruski of the kristen foundation , a non-profit set up to help find missing adults , told daily mail online that the family is hoping that the durst link may finally bring some closure to their 18 - year ordeal ' of course we live with that hope , ' said allison , 38
' but it has been a very long time
' and as for the chance that she has been held captive for a dozen and a half years , she added : ' there is a part of each of us that hopes for something like that , but it is hard to imagine what the past 18 years would have been like for her if that were the case
' kristen 's parents , parents bob , an engineer and debbie , an elementary school teacher , have both now retired
last december they finally sold the five - bedroom , four - bath home in an upscale development south of charlotte , that kristen and her three sisters had grown up in , and moved to florida
in a statement , issued through family friend scanlon-petruski , parents bob and debbie modafferi pointed out that the fbi had investigated durst before
' it is possible though that the ongoing interrogation of durst by law enforcement that 's taking place right now could uncover new information that could be of value and lead to the truth about what happened to kristen , ' they added
scanlon-petruski , who runs the kristen foundation , a non-profit set up to help find missing adults , told daily mail online that the family is just hoping that the durst link may finally bring some closure to their 18 - year ordeal
' durst is crazy and he has shown he is not willing to admit anything , ' she said
' i certainly want it to be him , ' scanlon-petruski added
' then we would be able to find out at least something , but we have been disappointed so many times in the past
' but police in oakland , california say there is nothing new to link durst to kristen modafferi
' the oakland police department conducted an investigation with the assistance of the fbi regarding the 1997 disappearance of kristen modafferi
the investigation was open and active for several years
at this time we do not have any evidence that indicates durst was involved in her disappearance
' the department said in a statement .
