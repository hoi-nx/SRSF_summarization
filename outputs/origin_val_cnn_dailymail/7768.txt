liverpool host rivals manchester united on sunday as both teams look to take another step towards securing a place in next season 's champions league
here , sportsmail takes a look at three of the key battles which could decide the game at anfield
martin skrtel v marouane fellaini the 6ft 4in marouane fellaini has given manchester united a new dimension in recent weeks and has looked a better strike partner for wayne rooney than either radamel falcao or robin van persie
but if you needed the perfect warrior centre - half to combat marouane fellaini , martin skrtel would be high on your list
the shaven - headed stopper is fearless and as hard as nails
he knocked himself out making a challenge in an fa cup tie against blackburn earlier this month

jordan henderson is all about energy and mobility and scored the winner at swansea city on monday night
michael carrick âs range of passing is outstanding , he gets the other manchester united players on the ball at the right time
both are vice-captains of their club and rivals in roy hodgson âs england squad too
jordan henderson ( left ) and michael carrick both play in the centre of midfield but they have different styles daniel sturridge vs phil jones both players were tipped at one time to be the future of english football and are on the way back after injury
if daniel sturridge âs stealth and trickery win out , liverpool will fancy their chances
but phil jones is strong and will try to outmuscle the striker
both have been named by england in the squad to face lithuania and italy and will be keen to show they are back to their best
