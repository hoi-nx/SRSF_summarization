baird was met with cheers of â four more years â as he took the stage at the liberal âs state election campaign launch at the city recital hall in western sydney âs cbd on sunday
mr baird made several new policy announcements including a promise to introduce scholarships for 25,000 tafe students , new incentive payments that encourage small businesses to take on more staff and an early roll out of the national disability insurance scheme
he also promised to create 150,000 jobs for his constituents if his government is re-elected next weekend
premier baird is currently leading labor in the two - party preferred polls while the liberal outlined its plan for new south wales in the next term they also commenced an unorthodox smear campaign designed to undermined the labor âs party move to stop the privatisation of the state - owned electricity network
media and supporters were handed decks of playing cards that featured â facts â to counter the â lies â labor are purportedly spreading in an attempt to thwart the power sale
they claim new south wales consumers have been hit with â some of the highest power bills in the western world
â opposition leader luke foley features as the deck âs joker , his scathing blurb accuses him of being the â chief beneficiary â in the â campaign of deceit
â the cards claim new south wales consumers have been hit with â some of the highest power bills in the western world
â the ' poles and liars ' cards were distributed on sunday to media and supporters at the campaign launch the deck continues to mock the labor âs campaign by citing twelve labor members who allegedly support the sale , including former prime minister paul keating
kristina keneally , former new south wales premier , has also been caught up in the controversy appearing as the queen of hearts and being labelled a supporter of the sale
she was quick to hit back on twitter saying the claim was unfounded as she â never supported the sale
â in the meantime luke foley attempted to rally his supporters with claims that a win for him would be the first nail in the prime ministers coffin
luke foley was seen in burwood on sunday rallying his voters as the election draws nearer " if mr baird goes next saturday , mr abbott goes on the monday , " the labor leader told a crowd in burwood on sunday
relying on the public 's apparent disdain for mr abbott may not be enough to turn the election around for mr luke foley the polls show the coalition leading labor on a two party two - party - preferred basis
labor has vocally opposed mr baird plans to privatise the state - owned electricity network the liberal âs are tipped to get the chance to implement their $ 20 billion infrastructure program however it âs likely they 'll lose the majority power they wield
mr baird is believed to be doing well in western sydney with labor having a better chance of securing seats outside the state âs capital .
