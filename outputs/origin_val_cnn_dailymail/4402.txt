' kicking your way into the legs is nât unusual , and the waistband should be snug , if you can fit two fingers down the back that âs good , a whole hand is not , ' she said

' buy them firm but not overly tight
if you have " seam strain " down the legs , they are possibly too tight and this could damage the stretch
