monisha kaltenborn has no intention of quitting as team principal of sauber despite being mired in legal controversy this week
monisha kaltenborn 's position has been drawn into sharp focus after appearing to have signed three drivers for the new f1 season , but with naturally only two seats available
the case with reserve driver giedo van der garde is to continue at the supreme court of victoria in melbourne on saturday , just a few miles from the albert park circuit
monisha kaltenborn addresses the media in melbourne on friday with her team mired in controversy nasr takes to the albert park track during the second practice session for the australian grand prix monisha kaltenborn , a trained lawyer , was naturally unable to shed any light on the case given it remains ongoing
but asked whether she was still competent to run the team , monisha kaltenborn replied : ' i do n't see it ( the case ) having any effect
' we have a very clear view of what we did
we took action after thinking about it for a while
' for us that was very clear , but the outcome is different , and that 's all i can say to you
' pressed on whether she had considered resigning , monisha kaltenborn added : ' i 've not considered that
giedo van der garde walks through the sauber team garage as his legal dispute with the team continues lewis hamilton in action for mercedes as the champions continued where they left off by setting the pace ' this whole matter does not have any effect on the way we work , the way the team works
' monisha kaltenborn conceded , however , the past week had affected morale with the team 's name dragged through the courts
' it 's had a very negative impact on the team because the situation was , for a while , unclear , ' added monisha kaltenborn
' we now have certain actions taken against the team , and we are acting accordingly
there 's nothing much more really i can say to that
' the supreme court initially upheld a swiss arbitration panel decision that the team not deny van der garde his right to drive given the 29 - year - old has a contract for a full - time seat for this season
swedish driver marcus ericsson was also in action for sauber under the blazing sun in melbourne van der garde is now pursuing enforcement of the order allowing him to drive , otherwise sauber risk being in contempt of court

sauber 's problem is they also signed marcus ericcson and nasr towards the end of last year before cancelling van der giedo van der garde 's deal in february , according to monisha kaltenborn
with three valid contracts and only two race seats available , sauber and monisha kaltenborn have found themselves mired in controversy sauber have been forced to detail their assets to the court , whilst the worst - case scenario for monisha kaltenborn is she faces imprisonment if she fails to comply with the order
the legal argument resulted in sauber failing to take to the track for the opening practice session of the year at melbourne 's albert park
come fp2 , with lawyers for both parties back in court at the same time , it was ericsson and nasr behind the wheel , with van der garde unable to acquire in time a super licence required to drive in f1

that 's all i can say
