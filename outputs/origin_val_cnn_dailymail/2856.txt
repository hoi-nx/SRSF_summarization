officials in the northern city of mosul , which is under the control of the terror group , reported jihadists have begun destroying the archaeological site of hatra in northern iraq
it comes after fanatics went on a rampage in the assyrian city of nimrud in northern iraq , destroying the 3,000 year - old winged statues placed at the gates of the palace of ashurnasirpal
days earlier , the group targeted a museum in mosul , toppling statues , and using power drills and sledgehammers to destroy artefacts - as part of a wider plan to rid its territory of symbols they say promote idolatry

saeed mamuzini , a kurdish official from mosul , told the ap that militants had begun carrying away artifacts from hatra as early as thursday
today , they began to destroy the 2,000 - year - old city
the extent of the damage at hatra is unknown as the ministry has not yet received any pictures of the current state of the area , which was named a world heritage site in 1987

islamic state has been campaigning to purge ancient relics they say promote idolatry that violates their fundamentalist interpretation of islamic law
a week ago , militants released a video showing them smashing statues and carvings in the mosul 's museum , which is home to priceless assyrian and hellenistic artefacts dating back 3,000 years
the majority of the artifacts destroyed were from hatra
and on friday , the group looted artefacts from nimrud and bulldozed the ancient city , sparking global outrage
an isis fanatic uses a power tool to destroy a winged - bull assyrian deity at a museum in mosul last week unesco condemned the actions as ' cultural cleansing ' and united nations secretary general ban ki-moon branded the actions ' a war crime '
iraqi tourism and antiquities minister adel shirshab said that many feared hatra would suffer the same fate as nimrud
' this is not unusual ( behavior ) for daesh , ' he said , using the derogatory arabic acronym for the group
a statement on the ministry 's facebook page added the government is investigating reports of the attack on hatra , adding that the global community should hasten its response to the crisis in iraq in order to prevent these types of atrocities
hatra is located 110 kilometers ( 68 miles ) southwest of the city of mosul
it dates back 2,000 years to the seleucid empire which controlled a large part of the ancient world conquered by alexander the great
it is famous for its striking pillared temple at the centre of a sprawling archaeological site
it was a large fortified city during the parthian empire and capital of the first arab kingdom
the ancient city , a unesco world heritage site , is said to have withstood invasions by the romans in a.d. 116 and 198 thanks to its high , thick walls reinforced by towers
a temple to the shamash sun god still stands more than 1,750 years after the sassanian empire razed the mesopotamian city
the ancient trading center in hatra spanned 6 kilometers ( 4 miles ) in circumference and was supported by more than 160 towers
at its heart are a series of temples with a grand temple at the center â a structure supported by columns that once rose to 100 feet
saeed mamuzini , a spokesman for the mosul branch of the kurdish democratic party , said the militants had used explosives to blow up buildings at hatra and were also bulldozing it
the antiquities ministry said the lack of tough international response to earlier islamic state attacks on iraq 's historic sites had encouraged the group to continue its campaign
' the delay in international support for iraq has encouraged terrorists to commit another crime of stealing and demolishing the remains of the city of hatra , ' it said
last year , the militants destroyed the mosque believed to be the burial place of the prophet younis , or jonah , as well as the mosque of the prophet jirjis â both revered ancient shrines in mosul
they also threatened to destroy mosul 's 850 - year old crooked minaret , but residents surrounded the structure , preventing the militants from approaching
archaeologists compared the assault on iraq 's cultural history to the taliban 's destruction of the bamyan buddhas in 2001
but the relentless havoc wreaked by islamic state , has not been limited to ancient monuments , but also extended to rival islamic places of worship islamic state , which rules a self - declared caliphate in parts of iraq and syria , promote a fiercely purist interpretation of sunni islam , which draws its inspiration from early islamic history
they rejects religious shrines of any sort and condemn iraq 's majority shi'ite muslims as heretics
last july , militants destroyed the tomb of the prophet jonah in mosul , the largest city under their control
meanwhile , a us - led coalition has been striking islamic state since august and is preparing a large - scale operation to retake the city of mosul
but us and iraq officials have been cautious about setting a timeline for preparing iraq 's embattled military for the campaign .
