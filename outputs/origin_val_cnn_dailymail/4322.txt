a further four girls who attend the same east london school as three teenagers who travelled to syria to join isis are being monitored by detectives over fears they may seek to do the same
including the trio who succeeded in leaving britain last month , it is thought a total of seven girls at bethnal green academy were considered vulnerable to being radicalised as early as december when a fellow female pupil went to join the jihadis
after the 15 - year - old managed to board a flight to turkey the other girls were placed on a government warning list with the aim of preventing them from taking the same path

their families fear police action may have pushed them towards leaving for syria bethnal green academy , where four girls thought vulnerable to radicalisation are still being monitored begum and abase , both 15 , and 16 - year - old sultana are all thought to now be syria after last month flying to turkey and travelling on by bus
the family of ms sultana has voiced concerns that letters from counter-terrorism detectives given to the girls but meant for their parents may have prompted them to leave
the letters , in which detectives sought permission to take statements from the trio in relation to the disappearance of their classmate in december , never reached the girls ' parents as they were not passed on
the letters are thought to have been sent shortly before the teenagers themselves left for syria on february 17
fahmida aziz , a cousin of ms sultana , told vice news : ' were they feeling victimised by police ? were they feeling criminalised ? ' did they feel they had done something wrong ? my query would be , by giving this letter , how did that make the girls feel ? ' dated february 2 , the letters made clear the teenagers were ' not under any suspicion of doing something wrong '

jubeyda rauf , the 16 - year - old sister of ms sultana , said she felt like police ' just let them walk out '
there was no evidence the girls were thinking of fleeing to syria prior to their departure , scotland yard said in a statement , adding that their disappearance had ' come as a great surprise , not least to their own families '
the remaining four girls who are under scrutiny also received the letters and are continuing to attend bethnal green academy , which has been told by police there is no evidence radicalisation took place within its walls
it is understood that detectives have examined mobile phones belonging to the quartet to look at their contacts with the three other teenagers prior to february 17
one line of inquiry is believed to be the theory that the girls who travelled to syria were directly assisted by an isis facilitator based in britain .
