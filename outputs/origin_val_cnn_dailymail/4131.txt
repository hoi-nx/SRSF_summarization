there 's a new true detective in town
a texas police department has hilariously spoofed mcconaughey 's lincoln car commercials , adding their own spin to reflect a night on the squad
mcconaughey 's ads are famous for the academy award - winning actor staring pensively through his window , contemplating life 's existential mysteries or just talking about how much he loves his car
sgt. larry wise of the cedar hill police department in texas hilariously spoofed mcconaughey 's lincoln ads , adding his own spin to reflect a night on the squad mcconaughey 's ads are famous for the academy award - winning actor staring pensively through his window , contemplating life 's existential mysteries or just talking about how much he loves his car ' sometimes you got ta go back to actually move forward , and i do n't mean go back and reminisce or chase ghosts , ' he says in twisty dialogue that would make his true detective character rust cohle proud
cedar hill police put sgt. larry wise behind the wheel of a cop van for the parody , and at first larry wise repeats mcconaughey 's dialogue word for word , in the same pensive deadpan voice
but things soon veer off from their original course
while mcconaughey wonders about ' going back to where you came from ' , larry wise talks about taking ' a big step back , ' like ' from winning rookie of the year to getting a couple of reflection days off '
larry wise pretends to nod off for a second as he wonders ' who am i ? why am i still on duty ? what is this on my fingers and why wo n't it come off ? is it mystery pocket goo from that last guy i searched ? ' a prisoner makes a guest starring appearance , asking larry wise if he 's okay because he 's only going five miles an hour
larry wise 's response ? ' that 's pretty good for an explorer ' ' you do n't get into police work because it makes sense , ' larry wise then says
' you do it cause you thought it really looked cool on tv , or cause med school was out of the question
' as mcconaughey drives under the bright city lights , its gas stations and flashing sirens that reflect in larry wise 's window as he ponders yet another night on the job
' i like being in here , ' he says in the video
' driving around all night long contemplating the important questions in life like " who am i ? why am i still on duty ? what is this on my fingers and why wo n't it come off ? " ' ' is it mystery pocket goo from that last guy i searched ? ' and , in the spoof , a prisoner makes a guest starring appearance , asking larry wise if he 's okay because he 's only going five miles an hour
larry wise 's response ? ' that 's pretty good for an explorer '
the video was posted on the cedar hill police department 's facebook page to celebrate hitting 4,000 facebook likes
lt. chenault told daily mail online that he , larry wise and fellow officer kaleb hazard came up with the idea after watching jim carrey 's spoof of the ads on saturday night live
the video has more than half a million views and has been shared over 12,000 times
chenault attributes the success to the fact that the video humanizes police officers
' i think people want to laugh at us and see us as real people , ' he said
' we want people to remember this video , it sheds a light not just on our city but on other officers as well , and remember that police officers are normal people like you and me
' ' we laugh at the same things and we want people to see us as they are - we just do a different job
' both chenault and larry wise said they are happy they 've created a something that is much more positive and comedic than the recent controversial videos featuring policemen around the country
' police officers do n't like to be stereotyped either , ' said larry wise
' so when something bad happens in another city , you 're always going to have that percentage of the public , no matter what , think we 're all corrupt and ca n't do anything right
' he added that to be able to put something out to humanize policemen and prove they 're ' not all the same ' , and get such a response from the public , was ' outstanding '
