sanaa , yemen at any moment , saudi troops could march through yemen , heating up an already intense conflict that could have ramifications across the middle east
on monday , a saudi - led coalition of nine countries continued airstrikes against shiite houthis rebels , who have captured key parts of yemen and ousted that country 's president , and who could spread iran 's influence in the region
and the notion of an iran proxy power in yemen is unacceptable to many -- especially iran 's staunch rival saudi
' tricky issues ' remain in nuclear talks with iran " i think the saudi ... feel directly , physically threatened by what is happening , " said haass , president of the council on foreign relations
but if the coalition takes the fight to the ground in yemen , the consequences could be severe
houthis are battle - hardened guerrilla fighters and could cross into saudi
they 've already threatened suicide bomb attacks inside saudi
and yemen , already the home base to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , now teeters on the brink of becoming a failed state and an even more fertile breeding ground for extremism
here 's the latest on the crisis in yemen and its impact around the world : saudi - led airstrikes targeted houthis military posts and weapons depots in the capital city of sanaa on monday , two houthis commanders told cnn
yemen 's defense ministry said a saudi airstrike hit al-mazeraq refugee camp in haradh , near the saudi border , killing at least 40 internally displaced people and injuring 250
the group doctors without borders ( doctors without borders ) tweeted that one of its teams had received " 30 wounded plus 15 dead bodies following airstrike on idp camp today
" previously , airstrikes hit houthis militant groups , smashed their air defense guns and crumbled key infrastructure , a saudi official has said
egyptian warships fired on the road that runs from the yemen port town of zinjibar into the key coastal city of aden but did not fire on aden directly , according to an official with yemen 's southern movement
the road is the eastern approach to aden and is one of the three main roads into the city
the egyptian naval barrage is intended to block the houthis advance on aden and push those fighters back , the source said
egyptian warships had deployed to the bab al-mandab strait last friday , according to media reports , intent on protecting that passage that is the only access from the arabian sea to egyptian 's suez canal
the coalition 's campaign has been dubbed operation al-hazm storm
the arabic term " al-hazm " can be translated as " determinant " or " decisive
" saudi and egyptian have both talked about the possibility of putting boots on the ground
on saturday , yemen foreign minister riyadh yaseen said he expected coalition troops to be in yemen within days
saudi leaders have said that if troops do go in , they wo n't leave until they have degraded the houthis ' ability to fight
the houthis are apt guerrillas
a fight on the ground could prove bloody and lengthy
the conflict splits the region along religious lines
operation decisive storm 's largely sunni coalition includes saudi , the united arab emirates , kuwait , bahrain , qatar , jordan , morocco , egyptian and sudanese
on monday , pakistan 's government said prime minister nawaz sharif had chaired " a high - level meeting " of senior officials to review the situation in the middle east
" the meeting concluded that pakistan remains firmly committed to supporting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of saudi in accordance with the aspirations of the people of pakistan , " it said in a statement
" it was emphasized that pakistan stands committed to playing a meaningful role in arresting the deteriorating situation in the middle east
in the same context , and to facilitate early resolution of the crisis and to promote peace and unity of the muslim ummah ( community ) , the prime minister would be contacting the leadership of brotherly countries , " the statement continued
the shiite houthis are allied with iran , a majority shiite nation
saudi has accused iran of boosting the houthis ' weaponry for their offensive
iran has sharply denounced the saudi - dominated intervention in yemen
on sunday , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu accused iran of trying to use the conflict in yemen to " take over the whole middle east
" the u.s. has supported the coalition 's efforts
while it is helping the saudi - led team with logistics and locating targets , the u.s. is not participating in active battle
dozens have died in the airstrikes , houthis commanders said
the rebel commanders also said the coalition struck the houthis - controlled al anad air base , which was used as the headquarters for u.s. counterterrorism operations before houthis rebels took control of it
the houthis claimed they shot down a sudanese jet and captured the pilot on saturday
they distributed photos of a pilot and wreckage to back up the claim
the yemen crisis erupted when shiite houthis rebels , who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country , began seizing the capital and other parts of the country last fall
houthis moved into sanaa in september , sparking battles that killed hundreds of people
yemen president hadi fled the capital over a month ago
in january , houthis surrounded the presidential palace
hadi resigned and was put under house arrest
he escaped in february and went to the coastal city of aden , but declared he was still the country 's leader
last week , hadi went to sharm el-sheikh , egyptian , to attend the arab summit , where he is rallying support for operation decisive storm
even from afar , hadi had strong words for the houthis : " you violated the sovereignty ( of yemen ) , " he said , " and you bear the responsibility for what happened and what is going to happen
" that arab summit produced a notable agreement : the sharm el-sheikh declaration , which paves the way for a united arab force that would be ready to fight insurgents if a member country came under attack
egyptian president abdel fattah el-sisi actually called for a joint arab force last month to fight isis
but the agreement over the weekend carries extra significance amid the battle against houthis in yemen
egyptian : it 's time for an arab coalition against isis the logistics and details of the joint arab force have yet to be worked out
but the declaration also urges the houthis to immediately withdraw from yemen 's government institutions and to surrender their arms to " legitimate authorities
" many u.n. representatives have had to flee the chaos
and saudi naval special forces have rescued dozens of diplomats , a saudi official said
the conflict in yemen also led to the withdrawal of u.s. special forces earlier this month , seriously undermining counterterrorism efforts in a country that has been a stronghold for al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
haass , of the council on foreign relations , said what 's happening in yemen could devolve into a long , protracted religious war
" you have civil wars , you have proxy wars
you have regional wars all in one , " he said
" and these things have so many logs on the fire , to use the metaphor , that they ... burn and burn and burn for a long time
