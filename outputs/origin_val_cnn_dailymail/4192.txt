american rapper jay-z has agreed to pay half the royalties of one of his songs to a swiss jazz musician spoerri after using his music without consent
the rapper had denied copying instrumental ' lilith â on the way ' in his 2013 song ' versus '
but he has now agreed to pay 50 per cent of the royalties to the swiss pianist and saxophonist , following an 18 - month legal wrangle
the song made a staggering $ 16million for producer pharrell , thicke and rapper t.i. with the family being awarded $ 4million in damages and $ 3.4 million in profits from the song
an attorney for thicke and pharrell has said a decision in favour of gaye 's heirs could have a chilling effect on musicians who try to emulate an era or another artist 's sound
in this case , the lifted melody came from a song composed by spoerri in 1978 , with the musician rejecting an initial offer as ' too low '
out of pocket : musician jay-z , pictured here at the opening of a club , has agreed to pay swiss musician half of royalties from one of his songs the american musician and record producer only admitted using the music without attribution a few months ago , according to reports
speaking last year , the veteran jazz musician said legal proceedings could have been avoided with a phone call
' in a way i 'm flattered that a relatively young rapper takes a sample from an old man , a sample that is about 35 years old , ' he told swissinfo.ch
' on the other hand i 'm furious because it would have been so simple to clear the sample
all it would have needed was a call or an email to the company and i think it would have been relatively cheap
' mr spoerri , 79 , has worked with the likes of lee konitz , hans kennel and george gruntz in a career spanning nearly 50 years
in an illustrious career , he has directed the zurich jazz festival and music schools in zurich and lucerne .
