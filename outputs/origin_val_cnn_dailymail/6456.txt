if you 've waited until the last minute to book a holiday over easter weekend , eurozone sunspots are offering plenty of great getaway bargains this spring , a new study suggests
thanks to a strong pound , the algarve in portugal is the cheapest beach resort for a family break , according to a post office report
those who are n't sold on portugal can find similar bargains in the spanish costas , tenerife and cyprus
a meal including drinks will cost a family of four just Â£ 29.87 , which is almost Â£ 7 less than last year
the story is similar in the other eurozone resorts , with prices in the spanish costas almost as cheap as the algarve following a 15 per cent drop from 2014
although slightly more expensive , tenerife and cyprus also offer tourists exceptional bang for their buck , the study said
perhaps most important for holidaymakers , the canary islands and cyprus offer more guaranteed spring sunshine than their bargain counterparts
towns like albufeira , portugal ( pictured ) offer savings of 20 per cent from last year , the study said in the spanish costas , like costa blanca ( pictured ) , prices are almost as low as portugal 's algarve region andrew brown of post office said in a statement : ' although holidaymakers will get far more travel cash for their pounds in the eurozone , prices vary significantly between resorts , so the best advice is for canny travellers to cherry pick and book a resort where prices are cheapest
' ' it will be hard to beat portugal and spain but , as the weather warms up , greece is shaping up to be great value too
' resorts in italy and france are more expensive but the good news is that there are big savings for those who want to visit sorrento or nice
' cyprus , while more expensive than portugal or spain , does still offer substantial savings - and lots of sunshine both cyprus and tenerife ( pictured ) boast the most guaranteed spring sunshine among the eurozone but britons looking to save would be wise to stay away from the us , especially in light of a poor exchange rate
for those truly eager to head across the pond , the best value can be found in the family - favourite destination of orlando , florida , but prices are still far cheaper on this side of the atlantic
in orlando , prices for the six family items surveyed by the post office cost twice as much as the algarve - Â£ 68.39 in the home of walt disney world compared with Â£ 34.31 in the portugal coastal region .
