for much of the past four years , forrest has been damaged , both physically and mentally
deila , the celtic manager , describes him as a ' frightened ' footballer
self - belief was never an issue until a relentless series of muscle injuries began
to some , forrest is the best player celtic have
an Â£ 8million star - in - waiting
reduced to the role of a walk - on extra in each of the past four seasons , however , it âs hard to be certain
â it âs been a long time since forrest has been consistently good , â said deila
â but , touch wood , that âs six months without a pulled muscle and he is moving in the right direction
celtic winger forrest has been plagued by injuries during the last four years of his career â we have been unbelievably patient with him because we have had to build him up from the bottom
â deila might have been describing â 70s tv character steve austin , the six million dollar man , rather than a winger recently rated in an altogether higher bracket
stripped down and carefully rebuilt in a painstaking quest to get to the heart of the injuries that have rendered him a parkhead bystander at times , there is cautious optimism from deila that â this time â forrest might just be ready
a second - half substitute and the scorer of the second goal against dundee united , the winger was close to stealing the show in sunday âs league cup win
yet his efforts were not appreciated by everyone
john âs feelings on the spot - kick forrest won and missed were embarrassingly public
knocking the desk before him , however , deila welcomed signs that the physical frailties in the forrest make - up are healing
forrest missed a penalty in the league cup final after arguing with john over who should take it â it has been hard work building his self - belief back up , so that he wo nât get these injuries , â said the celtic boss
â it has been slow
i was happy for him to score on sunday and win a penalty
â but , you know , he is not even close to what he can be as a footballer
â i am happy he is going in the right direction â but we know there are still things to work on
â he has the right people around him and we know that , if we get it right , he will be a very important player for us
â arriving from stromsgodset , deila expected forrest to be one of his key players
a coach who revels in the relentless quest for physical improvement , the scotland international has become his pet project
according to deila , the balance of his body was all wrong , his running style placing strain on vulnerable muscles
celtic manager deila says he has had to be patient with forrest while he overcomes his injury hell â forrest has been worse than he is now , â he said
â he was afraid because he had been out for two of the past four years with a lot of pulled muscles
â you get frightened and we need to get his confidence back and believing in himself
it has been psychological , but it has also about getting the balance and control of his body
â he has a great attitude and is working hard
so far , we have managed to get him out of the cycle of pulled muscles â but he has had other things , as well
â when you get a sore knee or twisted ankle , it affects your way of running
â he âs in a very good place now after 30 minutes on sunday and 90 minutes last week , plus full training on monday and tuesday
â forrest is available for selection against dundee united in their scottish cup quarter - final replay
â i can see he will get better and better , â said deila , who can call again on adam matthews at right - back
â it âs about strengthening his core , getting balance to change direction at high speeds
the medical staff have been working hard at getting it right , but now he needs more time on the pitch
forrest smashes the ground in frustration after failing to score the rebound to his missed penalty â his body is not nearly where it should be
it takes him five days to recover from playing 90 minutes
â we have to be careful because , when you are tired , that âs when you get pulled muscles
â we have to build him up step by step
hopefully , in six months we will be sitting feeling excited about forrest
â his inclusion in gordon âs scotland squad to face northern ireland and gibraltar surprised some as much as did the exclusion of forrest âs new parkhead team - mates gary and stuart
â i am not surprised about scotland because they are thinking the same as us , â said deila
â they know what he is able to do and his skills are so high in certain situations , like when we want pace and touch , ability in one - on - ones
gordon will be thinking about gibraltar and he needs players who can go past defenders
â stuart and gary have just started at celtic and i think they need more consistency and performances
in the end , hopefully , they will be good enough to get into the squad
â the 23 - year - old did get his name on the score sheet however as celtic beat dundee united 2 - 0 after already playing for dundee united in the scottish cup , neither can face their former club on wednesday evening
familiarity is in danger of breeding contempt between the teams and others must wish they could also excuse themselves from a third meeting in 10 days
the three games have featured four red cards ( two rescinded ) and three penalty kicks
dundee united âs keeper rado cierzniak has saved two of them
to that end , leigh and kris will again be assigned spot - kick duties for celtic
john , who had a spectacular public strop after forrest held firm on sunday , will again be told to stand aside
â i have not said so much , â remarked deila of that episode
â we have talked about it , but it âs nothing
â we had leigh and kris to take penalties and both were off
â i do nât have any problems with john as a character
he is a funny boy
he is a striker who loves scoring goals and wants to take penalties
â they are young players and they have to learn and use these experiences to get better
â we talked about the need to put the team first
there âs no point arguing inside the team
