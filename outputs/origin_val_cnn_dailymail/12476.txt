a group of foreign medical students are thought to have traveled to syria to work in isis - controlled hospitals , a turkish lawmaker told cnn sunday
the group of 11 people includes seven british , an american , a canadian and two sudan , ediboglu said
ediboglu , an opposition turkish lawmaker , told the observer that he had spoken with the students ' families , who were convinced their loved ones wanted to work for isis and were asking him for help tracking them down in neighboring syria
" they have been cheated , brainwashed
that is what i , and their relatives , think , " ediboglu said , according to the newspaper
but he also stressed that the group did not travel with the intention of joining the battle
" let 's not forget about the fact that they are doctors , " he told the observer
" they went there to help , not to fight
" eight of the group are medical students who 've just graduated and three others are in their final year of medical school , he said
they 'd been studying in khartoum , sudan
now , at least seven of their mothers and fathers are living near the turkish - syria border , pleading for their return , according to the observer
in an interview published monday in turkish 's hã¼rriyet daily news , the group of parents said they were worried and vowed not to leave turkish without their children
dr. maumoon abdulqadir said he was sending a message to his daughter , lena , who is one of the students
" i know you want to help people and be of use
but you can do this in another way , " he told the newspaper
" there are many who need your help
but this is not the way
" british officials said they are aware of the report
" we are providing consular assistance to their families and we have informed the turkish police to try and ascertain their whereabouts , " the british foreign & commonwealth office said in a statement
officials have warned that a growing number of foreign fighters are traveling to join isis ' ranks
estimates about how many medical personnel the group has recruited are harder to come by
last year , a 19 - year - old colorado woman was arrested at denver international airport as she was about to embark on a journey to an isis camp , where she hoped to serve as a nurse
