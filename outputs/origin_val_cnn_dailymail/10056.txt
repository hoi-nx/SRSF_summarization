goalkeeper hart is determined not to let manchester city 's season end with a whimper
the england number one has made a rallying call to his team - mates in the hope of sparking a charge through the closing games of the year
manchester city 's campaign has fallen apart in 2015 with a run of three wins in 12 games costing them heavily in the premier league , fa cup and in europe
hart was in inspired form against barcelona , pictured here saving from man - of - the - moment lionel messi the manchester city and england no 1 moved to back his manager despite the team 's last - 16 exit hart arrived back to manchester with the rest of the manchester city squad on thursday afternoon manchester city now seem unlikely to retain their title having fallen six points behind chelsea , who have a game in hand , while they were ousted from the champions league by a far superior barcelona side on wednesday
but hart is not ready to concede defeat to chelsea yet and insists manchester city , who host west brom on saturday , still have a lot to play for
the 27 - year - old said : ' i will never give up , ever , and i could safely say that nobody in our dressing room will ever give up either
we will see where that takes us
' west brom is a huge game and we turn our focus to that
we have no excuse not to throw everything at the premier league now and give our all - to the fans , the owner , to everyone
' every game is a must - win now
we have no time to lick our wounds , we have to fly into that game
' we have to win every game , and that is how we will go into it , and see where it takes us
' we have had a few knocks this season , but we have proved it time and time again , and so have our fans , that we come back and we keep fighting
' manchester city 's recent form has brought heavy criticism of the team and manager manuel pellegrini , who could now be facing a fight to keep his job
but hart , who was outstanding in wednesday 's 1 - 0 loss at the nou camp , believes all the negativity coming the team 's way is only par for the course and is not overly concerned
manuel pellegrini has been beaten four times by barcelona since becoming manchester city manager ivan rakitic scored the only goal of the game as barcelona progressed at manchester city 's expense luis enrique had praise for manchester city keeper hart after watching him deny barcelona a number of times he said : ' that 's part of being at manchester city
we all get talked about
i have been the worst keeper in the world recently and vinny ( kompany ) has been the worst defender in the world
' we have all had our moment
that 's the role of being at manchester city
if we do n't win we are going to get slaughtered
' it has also been suggested the squad needs a shake - up in the summer but hart continues to back his current team - mates
he said : ' we have nine games left with his fantastically talented squad
we have a lot of tired legs but we have players to come in
they can freshen us up
i think we have what we need
