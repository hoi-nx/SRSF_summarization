oliver has re-ignited his feud with fellow celebrity chef ramsay by accusing him of being ' deeply jealous ' of his success
the 39 - year - old hit out at his scottish rival after ramsay criticised him for not attending the opening of his new restaurant - oliver 's italian - in hong kong
ramsay , 48 , who previously opened his own bread street kitchen in the asian city , said oliver could have ' at least turned up ' to unveil his new eatery
it comes after ramsay criticised oliver for not attending the hong kong opening of his restaurant oliver responded to the comments during a visit to open a new restaurant in sydney , australia , this week by claiming ramsay was simply jealous
he said : ' ramsay will do anything to try and take the p * * s out of me because he is deeply jealous and ca n't quite work out why i do what i do and why he ca n't do that
' he is too busy shouting and screaming and making our industry look like a bunch of shouters and screamers
' oliver and his wife jules have seen their fortune leap Â£ 90million to in excess of Â£ 240million with their restaurant chains , tv appearances and her childrenswear range
meanwhile ramsay 's fortune is said to be valued at more than Â£ 100million with his worldwide chain of restaurants
the pair have often made snide comments at each other , and it did n't stop this week when oliver continued to criticise his rival over their books
oliver 's 15th book , save with oliver , shot to the top of the uk bestsellers list upon its release , bringing his total number of book sales to just over 37million
in contrast , ramsay has released 21 titles which have sold an estimate three million copies in total
oliver said : ' i think that really , really annoys him
ramsay is currently in the u.s. with his wife tana and four daughters ( pictured at the kids ' choice awards ) oliver and jools oliver have an estimated combined fortune of more than Â£ 240million from their ventures ' book sales are about having a deep trusted relationship with the public
i really write my books
i do n't just turn up for the front cover
i write every word , every letter and i oversee every bit of design
' you can sell a few books by luck or a moment ... but not 15 years and 37million books
' the two celebrity chefs - who both have four children - have previously clashed over their differing styles
in 2010 , while on a promotional tour of canada , ramsay said oliver was ' just a cook ' while he proclaimed himself to be ' a chef '
a year earlier , he admitted he was not a fan of oliver , describing him as a ' one - pot wonder
' he said : ' everything kind of gets mixed in - hands in
it 's a very different style to me
he sticks it in the oven , comes back three hours later and it 's done
chefs oliver and ramsay ( pictured together in 2006 ) have often exchanged fraught words over the years oliver made the comments during an appearance in sydney , australia , to open a new restaurant this week ' we cook differently
i use basic ingredients taken up with a lot more excitement
' but competition is healthy
it 's good to have that kind of rivalry
' he also asked when he had last complained about a meal and answered : ' last time i had dinner at oliver 's restaurant
' but oliver has continued to stand his ground , and even praised the wife of ramsay 's wife tana
he said : ' if i was to choose between buying ramsay 's cookbook or tana 's , it would be tana 's every time
' in my opinion , her books are a damn sight better than his
