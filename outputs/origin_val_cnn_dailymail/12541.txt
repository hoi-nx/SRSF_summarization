london cabinet - maker michael ibsen has just put the finishing touches to a coffin ; built of highly - polished , honey - colored english oak and yew , it has been a labor of love , pondered over and painstakingly crafted
because this is n't any ordinary commission : the casket will be the final resting place of one of michael ibsen 's distant relatives , richard iii , who died more than 500 years ago
" it is a unique privilege , " says canadian - born michael ibsen , whose dna was used to establish the identity of the king , found buried beneath a car parking lot in the city of leicester in august 2012
" there 's a wonderful serendipity in a sense that someone involved in the identification of the remains should happen to be furniture maker who can do this
" when you 're working away you just focus on joining two bits of wood , but at the end of the day when you stand back and think ' i 'm building richard iii 's coffin , ' it 's incredible
" michael ibsen says he 's been on an " extraordinary journey " in the two - and - a - half years since he gave a dna swab to genetics specialist turi king on the off chance that experts searching for the burial place of his seventeen - times great - uncle might strike it lucky
back then even the man in charge of the dig , archaeologist buckley , did n't expect to find anything -- he told colleagues he 'd " eat his hat " if they turned up the long - lost king 's remains
" when we were planning the project , i never made any secret of the fact i thought it very unlikely we 'd be successful , " buckley told cnn
" the chances of hitting the right spot were very slim
" call it a fluke , or call it fate , but as it turned out they hit the right spot almost immediately : richard iii 's skeleton was found on the very first day of the dig , in the first trench dug by the team
at the time , all the experts knew was that they 'd found a set of leg bones , chopped off at the feet by building work at some point in the intervening centuries
it was n't until days later , as archaeologist jo appleby carefully exhumed the rest of the skeleton that she spotted the distinct curve of its spine , and the devastating damage medieval weapons had left on its skull
for philippa langley , founder of the " looking for richard " project , who stood watching with bated breath as the bones were uncovered , the discovery was a vindication of the years she had spent trying to get people to search for the king 's remains -- and to look again at his reputation
say the name richard iii to many people , and the image which will spring to mind is that of shakespeare 's villain , hunchbacked and murderous , who met a grisly end on the battlefield at bosworth after killing his nephews , the princes in the tower
years of research had convinced langley of two things : firstly , that his remains lay underneath a car park , in what had once been the grey friars ' monastery , and secondly , that he was much - maligned , the victim of bitter tudor propaganda after his death
two - and - a - half years on , langley believes the discovery -- which proved her first theory to be correct -- and the scientific research carried out since , have forced a rethink of richard iii 's story
" as a writer my view of richard iii has always been that he was a very complex , very conflicted , very flawed individual -- that 's the human condition : we are all flawed , complex , conflicted -- but there was something heroic about him , he was courageous on and off the battlefield , " she explains
she says dna evidence that the king was blue eyed and fair haired -- in contrast to portraits and written descriptions which painted him " as a hunchback , with a withered arm and a crippled gait , with ' evil ' dark eyes and hair " -- had " blow [ n ] the mythology out of the window
" " it makes people question , drop their preconceptions , forget their assumptions , and go back to the beginning , " she says
this weekend , richard iii 's skeleton will leave the laboratory at the university of leicester , where it has been kept since it was found , and be taken back to bosworth , scene of his death in 1485 , for a commemoration ceremony , before being returned to leicester ahead of its reburial next week
and while his body last made that trip slung unceremoniously over the back of a horse , this time the journey will be done in style : carried in the coffin made by his great - nephew
inside , the smaller bones from his hands and feet will be tucked into linen bags -- each one decorated with a rose , representing the yorkist , richard iii 's family -- sewn by children from leicester 's richard iii infant school
" i feel very proud because i 've never made a bag for a king before , " said xi chen , who helped make the pouches
" it 's like i 'm a servant doing something for a king , " added his classmate irfan sheikh
lead conservation specialist jon castleman -- who previously helped to restore the dome of the rock in jerusalem -- will be the last person to set eyes on the skeleton , as he welds the ossuary inside the casket shut
well - wishers are expected to line the route as the cortege winds through the leicestershire countryside , stopping at several churches along the way for prayers and religious services before making its way back to leicester cathedral , near the site of the archaeological dig , where a new tomb has been built for the king
historian ashdown-hill , who discovered the genealogical link between richard iii and michael ibsen , says it is important that the king 's catholic beliefs are recognized in the ceremonies
ashdown-hill , who shares richard iii 's faith , has had a rosary , featuring the white yorkist rose and a crucifix like one thought to have been owned by richard iii 's mother , made to be placed inside the coffin
for langley , the procession and celebrations are key to repairing past damage
" the ethos and aim of the project was to give richard iii what he did n't get in 1485 , " she says
" the reason we wanted to do that was to recognize what went on in the past but not repeat it , to make peace with history
