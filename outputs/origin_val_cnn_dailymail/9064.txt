mr martin nash convinced her to go to the doctor for help miss nina mcarthur , from newton heath , manchester , said : ' it 's his support that has really got me through
' it sounds dramatic but , without him i think i would have ended up dead
' miss nina mcarthur had always been sporty and loved swimming , and competed in her first triathalon aged nine
the pair formed a friendship in june 2013 after miss mcarthur moved out of her parent 's home
' i 'd had a few hard years , ' she said
' after competing in triathlons from the age of nine , i stopped when i developed hyperthermia during a race in 2009
' i decided to focus my energy on studying and started my bank job
i found it incredibly stressful and began limiting what i ate
' when i was training as an athlete i 'd always been quite strict with my diet
then a coach told me if i lost weight i 'd run quicker and i limited it even more
' i started taking those dangerous eating habits even further and began skipping meals
' but miss nina mcarthur 's diet soon got more severe , and her weight plummeted to just six stone
' mum would try and force me to eat my favourite childhood foods like corn beef stew and jam on toast , but the thought made me sick , ' she said
now she has recovered , miss nina mcarthur says she is enjoying life
' i 've been promoted at work and i 've recently moved in with martin nash
we 're very settled and he makes me smile everyday , ' she said miss nash said at her worst she looked like a ' walking skeleton ' when she weighed 5st
she is pictured battling the illness ( left ) and now ( right ) , weighing nearly eight stone ' it was n't that i was desperate to be skinny , i was desperate to be in control
i was so thin i had n't had a period since i was 18
' it got pretty extreme
i would not eat all day if i was drinking with mates in the evening
' after collapsing on a work training course in april 2011 , she went to her gp and was advised to go to an outpatient clinic
but she refused to go , wanting to recover herself
slowly she started eating more and her weight eventually crept up to seven - and - a - half stone
she believed she had recovered , but after meeting a man who competed in triathlons , she was encouraged to play sport again
she began starving herself and training on tiny amounts of food
she said : ' i started to look like a walking skeleton
' my boyfriend encouraged me to put on weight , but it was no use and we broke up after a year together
' it was then that the anorexia started to dominate her life
she said : ' i moved out on my own and fell to five and half stone
i had no energy , could n't concentrate and kept fainting
' if i went shopping i 'd have to buy children 's clothes , though most of the time i tried to cover my body in baggy tops
' though it was clear i had a problem , i pretended i was okay
i 'd take photographs of myself surrounded by food and put them on social media
' sometimes i 'd put a huge meal on the table and take a picture of it
miss nina mcarthur said mr martin nash came to visit her for her 23rd birthday , spent in hospital
' it was actually one of the most special birthdays i have ever had , ' she said
the pair are pictured now miss mcnash has recovered miss nina mcarthur has now written a blog to share her story with others
she is pictured during her battle with the illness - when she would post pictures of herself with food to fool worried friends and family ' i wanted people to think i was eating normally
but my secret was impossible to hide
' not only were her work colleagues worried , but when her periods completely stopped , miss nina mcarthur began to worry about how her anorexia was damaging her health
shorty afterwards , miss nina mcarthur met martin nash , who lived two flats beneath her
' at first we were just friends , ' she said
' but over time , we started spending more and more time together
' he was concerned about me and started inviting me over for dinner
i 'd starve all day if i was going round , but at least i was eating something
' in january 2014 , weighing little more than five stone , miss nina mcarthur collapsed at work
' i knew then i needed to get sorted
' he 'd make me feel normal and take me out for coffee and cake
i became so close to his family , they were my extended support network
' he took me to the gp who said my weight was dangerously low and that i was suffering from liver damage
' because of that he referred me for an outpatient appointment , which martin nash accompanied me to
' friendship quickly turned into a relationship , he supported me every step of the way
' miss nina mcarthur credits mr martin nash with her recovery
she said : ' he loved me when i was at my worst , and i do n't think i 'd be here if it was n't for him ' a week before her 23rd birthday miss mcarthur became a patient at the priory hospital , cheadle royal
it was there she began writing her blog , nina mcarthur 's writing retreat , to tell others about her progress

martin nash brought me flowers and a travel scrabble board to play in the evening and was allowed to take me over to john lewis cafÃ© for an hour for a coffee
' my 90 - year - old nana visited to give me a great big hug and numerous messages of love and support were received from family and friends
' i finally wanted to be kind to myself again and began to understand why i had previously acted the way i did
' luckily , i realised that i wanted to get better
' miss nina mcarthur was put on a high calorie diet , and within 10 weeks she 'd put on two stone
