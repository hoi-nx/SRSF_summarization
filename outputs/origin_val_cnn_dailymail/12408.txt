cnn international journalist of the year 2015 and winner in the category radio : stephanie doetzer : " take care , habibi " ( dradio wissen ) stories about the civil war in syria are often quite abstract
yet , a war is very real
it is not only about the destruction of residential areas and fighting militia
it is also about families that argue about what happens , about friends who do n't talk to each other anymore and relationships that fall apart
political life becomes private , and personal life becomes political -- for all syria but also for those who feel connected with syria
" this contribution is written as a first - person narrative that is very compelling and emotional
it forces you to see what is happening in syria , and there was no doubt that it had to win the award
the contribution has won our hearts by a long way , we are completely convinced , " says jury member ingrid thurnher
photography : jelca kollatsch ( " houses without people and people without houses " , ver.di publik ) the photo series by jelca kollatsch shows the effects of the financial crisis on people in spain who live in andalusia , the region with the country 's highest rates of unemployment and evictions
" the contribution covers an important issue , and it tells a story , almost following the structure of a drama : with breathtaking rigor , the artist goes from the sources of the problem to the eviction of the people in the end , " the jury said
online : christian salewski and felix rohrbeck ( " the gps chase
what happens with our waste ? " , arte future ) and trainees of deutsche welle : " my granny , the regime and i " ( deutsche welle ) this year , the jury chose two winners in the category online : " digital journalism has a lot to offer
the two prizewinners represent a different approach in an interesting way and show how journalism generally evolves with multimedia possibilities , " explains the jury
in the first contribution , christian salewski und felix rohrbeck track the disposal of electronic scrap in german and find out that it is n't always legal and fair
in the second contribution , a group of deutsche welle trainees asked their grandmothers from belarus , brazil , chile , china , kenya and german about their personal experiences in times of dictatorship or autocracy
they created a multimedia online project with videos , words and images , combining the stories of the grandmothers with the history of the different countries
print : alexandra rojkov and jan ludwig ( " you think you can help me ? " , der tagesspiegel ) the contribution of the two authors tells the personal story of an escape from syria and asks how far we would go in a safe country like german to help people in war and crisis zones
" the authors touch their audience by transferring the ongoing conflict in syria to the fate of two individuals , " says jury chairman franz fischlin
tv : lukas augustin ( " unforgiven " , ndr ) twenty years after the civil war in rwanda , the victims and the offenders live door to door
lukas augustin presents a documentary about the efforts made to foster forgiveness
the movie provides insight into the tangle of guilt and atonement in modern rwanda
" this contribution is more than a tv documentary
it is a film about a country that deals with its own history in an incredibly spectacular and exceptional way , " says jury member ingrid thurnher
