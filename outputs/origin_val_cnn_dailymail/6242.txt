former england spinner swann has called on the england and wales cricket board to realise their approach is ' out of date ' , saying that there is a ' stubbornness ' about their selection policy and that they are ' living in the past '
swann watched on as england slumped to another heavy world cup loss , with sri lanka chasing down their 309 for six with ease , winning with nine wickets and 16 balls to spare
the defeat goes alongside reverses against australia and new zealand , with scotland the only team england have beaten so far
writing on twitter , he said : ' a positive thing that can come of this world cup is that maybe the top brass will realise just how out of date our approach is
' swann also aired his views on bbc , adding that england had been overly pleased to get what he considered to be an average score
' i think the problem lies not just with the bowling but the whole approach
it was a very self - congratulatory 310 , everyone was saying ' brilliant '
these days that 's about average and not a great score , ' he said
' we should be looking for 340 , 350 ; the difference between the top teams and everyone else is immense
they 're saying the is the limit when you bat , we 're still looking at par scores
' swann feels the answer could lie with former nottinghamshire team - mate alex hales
' there 's a bit of stubbornness about the selection policy , ' he added
' i like gary ballance , he 's a great lad , but i think even he 'd admit that he should n't be in the team at the minute , he 's in horrible form
' we have a lad in alex hales , one of these new generation players who does go out and knock it about , he tries to smash everything for four and six
' we need to get these young lads playing
we have too many people running it , too many people involved , too many plans and i think we 're just living in the past

' another ex-england player , boycott , said the england team were not being realistic
boycott has long spoken his mind about the national team 's woes , and though he conceded to some positives , he sees plenty of work to be done
he told bbc 5 live : ' i do think we could have got another 20 - odd runs , there was a period where we were just cantering around
we are not a force to be reckoned with at all
' the batting was quite good , but the bowling ? no , no , sorry
it was n't very challenging
' they 're not bad players , we do n't have a bad side at all
but we 're not firing on all cylinders in any department whatsoever
' the sad thing for me , even joe root , ( he gave ) a nice interview , lovely lad , but there 's no realism
they keep telling us ' we 'll take the positives , we did well , we did this '
' they are trying to tell us little things and we do n't see them
they think ex-players like us are just watching to criticise , we 're not , we want you to win
' but we can only tell you what we see and you keep losing
' opinions also reigned in from other nations , with ex-australia spinner shane warne saying on twitter : ' broad & anderson are averaging 80 with the ball you ca n't defend any total , also lacking fire power with bat
