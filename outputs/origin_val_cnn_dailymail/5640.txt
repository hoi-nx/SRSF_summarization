germany should pay reparations to greece for â serious wrongs â by the nazis , members of merkel âs ruling coalition said last night
the germany chancellor has angrily rejected demands from greeks ministers for berlin to pay Â£ 240billion in compensation for nazi atrocities during the ww2
but , in an astonishing twist , senior members of the spd , which shares power with mrs merkel , yesterday disagreed
senior figures in chancellor merkel 's coalition partner in government have united with the green party to declare germany should compensate greece to the tune of billions of pounds for wartime nazi atrocities gesine schwan said : â i think it would be good for us germany to sweep up after ourselves in terms of our history
it is about recognising that we have committed serious wrongs in greece
â the government âs legal case is nât convincing
it leaves a bad impression that germany does nât want to face up to its responsibilities
â ralf stegner , spd deputy leader , said : â we should not link the question of compensation with the current debate on the euro crisis
but i am of the opinion that we need to discuss compensation regardless
â green party parliamentary group leader anton hofreiter said : â neither morally nor legally is this chapter complete
â about 250,000 greeks died during the brutal nazi occupation
greece âs new hard - left rulers are demanding billions in return
justice minister nikos paraskevopoulos said this month that germany assets in greece could be seized
athens is demanding general compensation as well as specific claims for massacres and forced loans
some senior germany politicians view the greeks demand for up to Â£ 250billion in reparations for the nazi occupation as a ploy to gain more time and money to settle its chronic debt crisis

â mrs merkel âs spokesman said the question was â legally and politically closed â
but eberhard rondholz , a historian who has studied the issue , told the financial times : â the government view is false
this issue is not closed â it is very much open
â spiegel news magazine yesterday said lawyers have told mrs merkel the greeks may have a case
it says that a Â£ 2billion loan the nazi secured from greece in 1942 was never repaid â Â£ 10billion today
germany paid greece Â£ 50million in 1960 , but athens says it was not enough .
