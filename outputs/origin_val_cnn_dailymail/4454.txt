a domestic treble is a marathon rather than a sprint
yet celtic are closer to their promised land after routing the arabs in scottish football âs answer to the six - day war
by 5pm on saturday , dundee united were worn out
as punch drunk as a flabby heavyweight leaning against the ropes in the 14th round
exhausted â mentally and physically â by three losses in a week to a side with more depth , energy and firepower
the tayside team fancied their chances after holding on for a 1 - 1 scottish cup draw with nine men a fortnight ago
then celtic won the final
and followed it with a thumping 4 - 0 victory in last wednesday âs scottish cup replay
jason denayer celebrates with his team - mates after giving celtic a three - goal lead before half - time jason denayer taps home from close range as celtic record comfortable victory against dundee united battered and bruised , dundee united were gone then
long before they found themselves three goals down in the first half of this league match
the heat , light and fury which bred six red cards , three penalties and running feuds in the previous meetings had gone
all told , celtic and dundee united met four times in two weeks
by the end , mcnamara âs team were pleased the ordeal was over
the same might be said of the title race
in saturday âs early game , aberdeen shipped two points in dundee
the dens equaliser came from the grandson of former parkhead chairman jack mcginn
proof , if it were needed , that this was celtic âs week
â it âs been a great week , â said defender ambrose
â we know that , but we don â t want to look at what we âve done
we want to look forwards and that means the next game
that âs more important than what we âve already done
â every game counts in the league and we want to keep going
from now until the end of the season , we want to keep doing our best , so we can defend our title and get to the scottish cup final
then we can see if the treble is still possible
â john guidetti struck to make it 2 - 0 to ronny deila 's side after 33 minutes at celtic park on saturday the scottish cup looks the last substantial hurdle
inverness , an awkward opponent , await in the semi-final on april 19
thereafter it is hibs or falkirk in the final
â it âs an enjoyable place to be at the moment because everything is working well for us , â said ambrose
â i think , right now , it would take a lot of effort from another team to stop us
â celtic are playing at a top level
it âs difficult for others to withstand what we have right now
john guidetti is congratulated by his team - mates after doubling the home side 's lead â we have a huge squad and everyone is in their best form
it âs difficult for the manager to pick his starting line - up
there âs a lot of competition in the squad and that makes us better
â there was nothing boastful in the way the nigerian said this
he was merely stating a bald truth
for the fourth meeting with dundee united in a fortnight , ronny deila replaced his entire front four
leigh griffiths , kris commons , james forrest and anthony stokes made way for john guidetti , stefan johansen , armstrong and gary mackay-steven
gary mackay-steven and armstrong were dundee united âs star players until they were sold to celtic for Â£ 2million in january
gary mackay-steven opened the scoring against his former club to set up victory for celtic once again , tannadice chairman stephen thompson had cause to ponder if it was worth it when gary mackay-steven smashed a superb opening goal in 16 minutes , accepting a simple ambrose pass and winding up for a swerving left - foot shot from fully 25 yards
as a former dundee united player , his reluctance to celebrate was understandable
why john guidetti did likewise after doubling the lead in 33 minutes with a looping , deflected shot into the top corner was harder to work out
by then , celtic were playing a training game
a flat affair , given the ill feeling of the previous encounters , the home support could barely even bring themselves to boo ryan mcgowan
there was a brief flash of the old enmity when paul paton was lucky to escape a red card for a wild , scything tackle on gary mackay-steven on the stroke of half - time
if a yellow was a lenient punishment , celtic added to the penalty by scoring a third when van dijk thumped stefan johansen âs low free - kick towards goal before jason denayer intercepted and cheekily back heeled into the net for 3 - 0
gary mackay-steven ( left ) celebrates his goal with stefan johansen during the scottish premiership match the belgian has found a rich vein of form and , as with van dijk , the celtic support should enjoy him while they can
dundee united came close just once , when substitute ryan dow had a dipping , long - range effort tipped over the bar by craig gordon
in truth , the visitors looked utterly demoralised by then
â i thought we were soft in the first half and we accepted things , â said mcnamara
â so i told them i was disappointed in that
i was a bit angry at half - time about belief and not just pride , but in terms of doing things and not feeling sorry for themselves
â in the second half , we did that
we rolled up our sleeves , though it could be argued that celtic took their feet off the gas
â they could afford to conserve their energies
only three times in celtic âs 127 - year history have the club won a treble and they are now tantalisingly close to a fourth
â i never allow myself to think about the treble , â parried ambrose
â none of us do
â the most important thing for the team is to go game by game and that âs what the manager wants
we take it as it comes
â we do nât put anything in our heads
the important thing is to play hard and prepare
everyone wants to beat celtic
â it âs important that we âre calm and work to the tactics the manager wants us to play
â we need to have one spirit , one heart
we have good momentum right now and i think we have delivered what the manager expected
â but we âre not there yet , so we have to keep pushing in training
every time we play a game , he wants us to improve , so that âs a challenge he has given to us
â a popular whipping bhoy when things go wrong , it âs worth recording that ambrose himself has improved of late
the green brigade sang his name on saturday , prompting a wry chuckle from a player who seems a little safer at right - back than centre - half
â the celtic supporters are the best in the world , â said the defender , â i will give them credit for that
â sometimes it âs unfair if i get criticism but that âs football
we âre a team , not individuals
â if a mistake happens , you just have to get on with it , work harder and make sure you correct the mistake
â of late , ronny deila âs celtic have managed not only to correct their early season mistakes , but eradicate them
as the final mile of the marathon approaches , they are pacing themselves nicely .
