" ... receiving the love from the crowd here , it really meant a lot to me
" the bnp paribas open in indian wells , just east of palm desert , california , is n't a grand slam but is one of the top tournaments in tennis

) serena williams scored a three - set win over kim clijsters
but she did n't celebrate
she spent hours crying in the locker room
" ( i drove ) back to los angeles feeling as if i had lost the biggest game ever -- not a mere tennis game but a bigger fight for equality , " serena williams wrote in time in february
" emotionally it seemed easier to stay away

and it 's a wonderful feeling
