a 13 - year - old boy , whose mystery illness bound him to a wheelchair with a feeding tube , has made a miraculous recovery after years of suffering thanks to his determined mother who scoured the internet for answers as to why he was in excruciating pain
according to the today show , bobby , from marco island , florida , was originally diagnosed with dysautonomia , a malfunction in the autonomic nervous system , and ehlers-danlos syndrome , a tissue disorder - but the conditions did n't account for all of his ailments , which included stomach afflictions , loss of vision and agonizing neck pain
refusing to accept her son âs initial diagnosis , bobby 's mom , leithauser , began researching his symptoms online , and came across the work of dr. harold rekate , a neurosurgeon at the cohen children 's medical center in new york , who soon discovered her son had a chiari malformation , a treatable , yet rare condition that affects the cerebellum , the part of the brain that controls balance
three months later , bobby recalled the days after his surgery , saying he ' could n't believe ' his unbearable pain was gone after years of suffering
the teen 's health problems seemingly came out of nowhere when he was only nine years old , when the once - active child began to experience crippling stomach pain , prompting his parents to start limiting his food to the point that he was only consuming blueberries and chicken
but despite their best efforts , his ailments continued
next came headaches , tremors and an inability to control his body temperature or regulate his blood pressure
but even after bobby was diagnosed with dysautonomia and ehlers-danlos syndrome , his physical suffering continued
difficult prognosis : bobby , who was active as a boy , found himself bound to a wheelchair after his condition worsened ' it was really horrendous pain and i could n't hold my head up for more than 10 minutes at a time , ' bobby explained
as his condition worsened , his worried mom began doing research on the internet and contacted other parents whose children had similar issues
chiari malformations are caused by structural defects in the brain and spinal cord
symptoms include dizziness , muscle weakness , numbness , vision problems , headaches and problems with balance and coordination
chiari malformations mostly occur during fetal development , although they may develop later in life after injury , infection or exposure to toxic substances it was once believed that chiari malformations occurred in only one in every 1,000 births , but research shows that they appear to be more common
babies who are born with chiari malformations do n't develop symptoms until adolescence or adulthood - if they develop them at all ' i started putting the pieces of the puzzles together , ' she said
her husband tom noted that because their son 's issues started with severe abdominal pain , they found themselves focused on the wrong area of his body
' the whole time we were looking at stomach pain , never imagining that the problem could be in another part of his body , like the brain , ' he said
mrs leithauser 's determination to cure her son eventually brought her family to dr. harold rekate
as soon as the neurosurgeon saw scans of the boy 's skull and spine , he immediately knew what was wrong
the scan revealed that bobby 's skull and spine were not held together properly because the ligaments were too loose
the misalignment was causing his brain to be squeezed from the front and the back
' i knew that he could be helped by surgery , ' dr harold rekate said
' i knew that the chronic pain that he was in , that the inability to exercise could be helped , that we could change his life
' bobby is now walking again , and his chronic pain and headaches are gone as expected
but what is even more surprising is that the issues associated with his autonomic nervous system suddenly started to get better as well
' to me , it 's a miracle
it really is a miracle , ' mr bobby said
magical surgeon : dr harold rekate explained that bobby 's skull and spine were n't hooked together properly , which caused his spine to push into his brain fast recovery : three months ago , bobby had surgery to properly align his skull and his spine , which improved all of his ailments and allowed him to start walking again
