' and he added : ' russia 's illegal annexation of crimea and its destabilising activities in eastern ukrainian , including direct military support to the separatists , have demonstrated its disregard for international law
' the latest ceasefire agreement , reached in minsk on february 12 and which came into force on february 15 , has seen a reduction in violence in the conflict zone
