trainer scudamore is hoping a breathing operation will make the crucial difference between next sensation winning the grand annual chase after last year âs near miss. the eight - year - old put in a spectacular front - running performance in the festival finale before fading into fourth beaten one and three - quarter lengths by savello
it was initially hoped the improving gelding might even be up to challenging the top two - mile chasers this season but he has failed to win in four runs , most recently at newbury in november
consequently , he lines up in the grand annual off a mark only 1lb higher than he raced off 12 months ago

we actually thought he ran a great race at newbury considering the conditions
