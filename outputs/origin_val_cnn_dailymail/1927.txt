he was ridiculed by opposition mps for making the unprecedented move of setting out an alternative plan to the budget in the house of commons
and now alexander , the alexander treasury chief secretary , has been mocked for a subsequent photo opportunity yesterday holding a yellow briefcase
the stunt saw the box â which was auctioned off to a alexander activist for Â£ 1,500 - held outside the treasury building in an echo of george osborne outside 11 downing street on wednesday
other photographs showed the politician holding a playstation , meccano set and posing with snp leader alex salmond playing football and zimbabwe president robert mugabe falling over
yesterday , mr alexander was harangued by labour backbenchers and faced accusations that he was abusing his ministerial office as he set out the plan for those â left cold â by mr osborne 's budget
despite confirming that the budget was agreed by the tories and alexander , mr alexander criticised the plans in it to cut government spending to 1964 levels - â the era of cathy come home â
ridicule : mr alexander , who is mp for inverness , nairn , badenoch and strathspey , was harangued by labour backbenchers yesterday and faced accusations that he was abusing his ministerial office edited : another mocked - up photograph showed the politician posing with former snp leader alex salmond playing football ( centre ) and zimbabwe president robert mugabe falling over ( right ) prior to mr alexander 's comments , speaker john bercow insisted that such statements â have to be ministerial , delivered not in a personal or party capacity but on behalf of the government â
but as the treasury chief secretary set out his alexander plan that â borrows less than labour â and â cuts less than the conservatives â , he was met with a volley of heckling from labour backbenchers
shouts of â this is an abuse of office â and â this is ridiculous â could be heard as opposition mps and others waved the coalition budget document
at one point , labour frontbencher andrew gwynne reached across the table separating the despatch boxes with a copy of the red book and dropped it in front of mr alexander

he said : â they may not like it but i 'm setting out the numbers in the treasury document published today , which is an entirely legitimate thing to do
â the treasury chief secretary outlined alexander plans to achieve the Â£ 30billion of savings needed to eliminate the structural current deficit through a combination of tax rises , tackling tax avoidance , departmental cuts and welfare savings
mr alexander 's plans would mean significantly less welfare cuts than under the tories but also introduce tax rises which the senior coalition partners have not set out .
