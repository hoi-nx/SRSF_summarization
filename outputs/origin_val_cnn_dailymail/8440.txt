ministers have been accused of putting profit over human rights after organising a secretive arms fair to sell tear gas and rubber bullets to a host of authoritarian regimes
the three - day ' security & policing event ' , which is closed to the public and press , has been organised by the home office to showcase british anti-riot kit to dozens of foreign governments , including saudi arabia , egypt and russia sniper rifles , phone - hacking equipment and specialist ' sound guns ' will be available to help foreign police control uprisings
ministers have organised an arms fair to sell anti-riot equipment to foreign governments including rubber bullets , like those used by police against protesters in sao paulo , brazil last year 2014 the government has publicised the event as a unique opportunity for arms manufacturers to market equipment ' which would be too sensitive to show in a more - open environment '
since the coalition came to power in 2010 , Â£ 15.9million worth of export licences for crowd - control have been approved by vince cable 's business department
this includes Â£ 10million of tear gas or ' anti-riot irritants ' , Â£ 640,000 of ' crowd - control ammunition ' and Â£ 3.1million of riot shields
much of the kit is sold to democracies like france and the us
but crowd - control supplies have also been cleared for countries on the government 's own human - rights blacklist
nine of the countries to receive export approvals - afghanistan , bahrain , colombia , iraq , israel , libya , pakistan , russia and saudi arabia - feature or have featured on the foreign office 's human rights blacklist of ' countries of concern ' over the last five years
the figures - compiled from government data by the caat - show that goods worth Â£ 6.7m were cleared for shipping to the nine countries between 2010 and last september
since the coalition came to power it has signed off export licenses for anti-riot equipment to foreign regimes , including libya under gaddafi ( left ) and valdimir putin 's russia some Â£ 2.95m of tear gas was sold to saudi arabia and Â£ 228,000 of ' crowd - control ammunition ' to libya while gaddafi remained in power , the independent reported
andrew smith , from caat , told the newspaper : ' this is a sign of a system that puts arms - company profits ahead of human rights
weapons like tear gas have an indiscriminate effect and are synonymous with internal repression
' the government may have revoked the licence for tear gas to libya , but it should never have been signed in the first place
gaddafi was a brutal tyrant from day one , and this is a reminder that acts of oppression by his regime were carried out with british support
' the government insists licences will not be granted when there is a ' clear risk ' that the exports ' might be used to facilitate internal repression '
in a statement , the business department said : ' we rigorously examine every licence application on a case - by - case basis against internationally recognised criteria
' risks around human rights abuses are a key part of our assessment and we do not grant licences where there is a clear risk that it might be used for internal repression
