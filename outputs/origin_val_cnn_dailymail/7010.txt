officials in norway are warning anyone planning to visit the islands of svalbard to witness this week 's solar eclipse that polar bears are on the prowl in the arctic region
the islands are said to be the ideal location to witness friday 's phenomenon due to its location in the eclipse 's path and the low pollution in the area
however , the islands are also home to about 3,000 polar bears - the earth 's largest land carnivore , and the area 's tourist website cautions they attack without warning
warning : the islands of svalbard are said to be the best place on earth to watch friday 's eclipse - but they are also home to about 3,000 polar bears , which are known to attack without warning uk teenager horatio chapple , a pupil at eton college , was killed by a polar bear on svalbard during a schools trek in 2011
christin kristoffersen , mayor of svalbard 's main settlement longyearbyen , said she expected 1,500 visitors for the eclipse , on top of its 2,500 residents , meaning the numbers on the archipelago had reached a maximum safe limit
' safety comes first , even before the eclipse , ' she said
' we need to take care of people
it 's terribly cold in march and wehave the challenge with polar bears
' meanwhile , in germany experts said the eclipse will be a good test of the country 's electricity grid , which relies increasingly on renewable energy
the partial eclipse affecting germany is expected to cause a sudden drop and then a surge in solar - generated power , which contributed almost 6 percent to germany 's energy mix last year
in uk , some parts of the country will experience as much as 97 per cent darkness , and outdoor events will be held nationwide as people gather to gaze heavenwards at 8.45am
during the landmark event , the moon will pass between the sun and the earth , casting a deep shadow over the planet 's surface in a partial eclipse
unlike 1999 , it will not be a total eclipse over uk , although that will happen over the north atlantic and the spectacular event will finish over the north pole
the next similar eclipse will not take place over uk until august 2026 .
