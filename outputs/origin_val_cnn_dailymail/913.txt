families reacted with fury yesterday at learning that blair will attend a service honouring soldiers killed in afghanistan
they say the former prime minister has blood on his hands after sending their sons to war and should be facing an inquiry instead
mr blair and his successor brown will be among the 2,000 - strong congregation at a commemoration service at st paul âs cathedral in london
meet the troops : blair poses with britain forces in 2003 after he took the country to war in iraq politicians , royalty , military chiefs and serving soldiers are on the guest list
but fewer than half of the 2,000 places have been given to the families of the 453 war dead â who are limited to two seats each
relatives said it was â horrific â that mr blair and mr brown should have a place , while many family members of those who died did not
bob wright , 68 , whose son corporal mark wright was killed in an unmarked minefield in september 2006 , said : â he ( blair ) is the last person i would want to see
he would have some cheek going
he took the country to war , and cost all of those lives and he âs got blood on his hands
â grandmother joan humphreys , 70 , said it was â horrific â mr blair had been invited but she had not
explosion : private kevin was killed by a bomb in afghanistan in 2009 at the age of 24 the pensioner , whose 24 - year - old grandson kevin was killed by a bomb in afghanistan in 2009 , added : â kevin was my grandson , we were very close and i have nât been invited but blair has
â i know mothers who have nât been invited and he just simply should nât have a place
â another guest , sadler , said brown should not have been invited either
mr sadler said his 21 - year - old son jack was in a vehicle that had inadequate armour when he was killed by a roadside bomb in 2007 , while mr brown was pm
he said : â i âm hoping brown does nât stand up and say anything because he has lots of questions to answer
â roadside bomb : jack sadler was in a vehicle that had inadequate armour when he was killed by a roadside bomb in 2007 mr blair sent troops to afghanistan to oust the taliban and kill osama bin laden following the september 11 attacks in 2001
but the decision sparked widespread condemnation after the war dragged on for 13 years and led to hundreds of britain deaths
there was outrage when he sent britain troops to iraq in 2003
brown took over as prime minister in 2007 , with the last of britain âs troops withdrawing from iraq in 2011 and afghanistan by the end of 2014
around 90 per cent of those attending next friday âs service to mark the end of the afghanistan campaign are either current serving personnel , veterans or family members of those who have died

his father bob wright , 68 , said : ' he ( blair ) is the last person i would want to see ' the queen , the prince of wales , the duke and duchess of cambridge and prince harry will also attend , along with defence and foreign secretaries from 2001 to 2014 , nato allies and charities
mr blair and mr brown were invited by the ministry of defence
a spokesman for the stop the war campaign said : â it is obscene that blair is taking the place of what could be a family member of someone who died in afghanistan
â in october 2009 mr blair was accused of having â blood on his hands â as he attended a commemoration service marking the end of the iraq campaign
peter brierley , whose son shaun was killed in iraq in 2003 , refused to shake the former pm âs outstretched hand .
