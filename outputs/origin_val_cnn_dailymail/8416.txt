oliver sherwood has refused to rule out a shot at next month âs national with many clouds â if you had told me at the start of the season he would be sixth in the cheltenham gold cup i would have bitten your hand off but my gut feeling is he did nât run his race
he jumped off sixth and finished sixth
he was beaten with a circuit to go
â the winner ( coneygree ) is a very good horse
like other trainers are saying about their runners , maybe he got us out of our comfort zone
