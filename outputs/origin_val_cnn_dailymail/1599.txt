amanda knox and her former boyfriend raffaele sollecito are ' fearing the worst ' as italy 's highest court prepares to decide their fate , according to their entourage
knox is waiting for the verdict in their final appeal for the murder of british student meredith kercher at home in seattle , while her one - time lover is in rome for the hearing at the city 's imposing supreme court , nicknamed the palazzaccio or ' bad palace '
raffaele sollecito could be seen arriving at court this morning with his current girlfriend greta menegaldo , before appearing deep in thought as he left this evening after the case was adjourned until friday morning
knox 's lawyer carlo della vedova described her client as ' very worried ' about adding : ' she has n't been sleeping much
' della vedova also scotched rumours that the united states had been trying to get pregnant to avoid possible extradition
' that is absolutely false
she is not engaged either , ' he said
however , it has now been revealed knox 's lawyers have turned to the european court in a last ditch attempt to stop the final ratification of her conviction for murder
they have asked for the case to be suspended , pending the acceptance of her appeal to the european court against a conviction for slander
she has always denied murdering ms kercher ( right ) knox claims that she was coerced by police into making false statements blaming the murder on bar owner meredith kercher during interrogations of more than 40 hours in november 2007
as the slander is considered circumstantial evidence in her murder trial , her legal team asked for the murder trial to be suspended , knox defence lawyer carlo della vedova confirmed
but the move has left representatives of the kercher family shocked
the kercher 's lawyer vieri fabiani said : â if the strasbourg court condemns the italy , what would it change ? what could it usefully serve ? absolutely nothing
â meanwhile , a consultant for raffaele sollecito said that he had already said his goodbyes to his family and air hostess girlfriend greta menegaldo , who accompanied him to the packed courtroom this morning , where neither was able to find a seat
the assistant said : ' it is as if he is not there anymore
he said goodbye to his family and greta menegaldo outside the court
' knox and raffaele sollecito served four years for the brutal murder of leeds student miss kercher in perugia in 2007
she was found half naked with multiple stab wounds to her body and a deep gash in her throat
the pair were freed on appeal in 2011
but last year , they were sensationally reconvicted and ordered to serve 28 and 25 years respectively for the murder
now the supreme court can opt to confirm the convictions , in which case extradition proceedings would start against knox
or if they find contradictions or illogicality in the guilty sentence they could send the trial back to appeal stage
raffaele sollecito has asked to have his case annulled on the basis that it should have been separated from that of knox , as all the proof points to her

raffaele sollecito now claims their stories on the night of ms kercher 's death are not ' intertwined ' raffaele sollecito ( right ) has seemingly abandoned all loyalty to knox ( left ) with his bid to distance himself from her raffaele sollecito out with his girlfriend greta menegaldo ( left )
knox ( right ) is pictured in seattle on a recent outing one of the world 's leading dna experts , who has extensively investigated the murder of meredith kutcher , has claimed the forensic evidence against amanda knox and raffaele sollecito is ' incredulous ' and ' made up ' by prosecutors
' knox , 27 , and raffaele sollecito , 30 , stand accused of killing the british student in perugia and the italy supreme court is expected to either uphold or quash their convictions today
professor peter gill , a lecturer of forensic genetics at oslo university , norway , looked in - depth at the dna results from the crime scene using the originally analysis by the italian police scientific department and also a second independent analysis ordered by the judge in the first appeal
in an exclusive interview with the daily mail , professor gill admits that the evidence against knox and raffaele sollecito is very weak and and compares it to something out of the fictional csi tv series
he said : ' it 's very , very tenuous to use this [ dna ] evidence to link to the conclusion that it proves an activity such as stabbing a victim
if knoxs ' conviction is upheld she could delay going to jail if she were pregnant , according to italy legal experts
there has also been speculation that political pressure from the united states could hamper the extradition process
raffaele sollecito is reportedly seeking to separate his case from knox 's , with his lawyers pointing out that a partial confession written by the united states and later retracted did not mention his presence at the scene of the crime
if that argument succeeds , the italy could be given a new trial
since being convicted raffaele sollecito has deserted knox , his one - time lover , and is now insisting that their positions are ' not intertwined '
his case should have been considered independently of knox 's , he now insists
yesterday bombshell court papers revealed that raffaele sollecito claims he does not remember whether knox was with him at the time of ms kercher 's murder
in a dramatic change in legal strategy , raffaele sollecito has cast serious doubt on amanda knox 's alibi , with the italy now saying he ca n't be sure she was at his house for the whole of the night on which the british student was brutally murdered
all the evidence against the former couple points to knox , raffaele sollecito claims in papers filed by his lawyers in advance of the make - or - break supreme court hearing today

united states amanda knox and italy raffaele sollecito both stand accused of killing british student meredith kercher and have been tried three times for the crime
the last hearing , in january last year , again found them guilty
knox 's legal team has been warned that this decision is likely to be rubber - stamped by the supreme court today
people close to the case do not believe ms amanda knox stands a chance in the hugely - divisive case
one supporter said they were prepared for the ' greatest miscarriage of justice ' that has ever happened to a united states citizen
in their previous two trials , knox maintained that they were together at raffaele sollecito 's flat on the night of the murder after which miss kercher , 21 , was found half - naked with her throat slit in the cottage she shared with knox in perugia , italy
in an a-z of reasons for distancing his position from hers , raffaele sollecito 's lawyers are attempting to demonstrate that the evidence used against knox does not concern him
in the 306 - page paper , raffaele sollecito claims that his computer records prove he was watching the japanese manga cartoon naruto at the time of the alleged murder
but he is not sure whether knox was at his house for the whole night as he had been smoking marijuana
the document says : ' the defence intends to emphasise that raffaele sollecito has always shown himself to be extraneous to the crime , and has always said that that night he did not move from his own home
however , he did not rule out that knox could have gone out
' the document also points out that knox , unlike raffaele sollecito , had an alleged motive for the murder

raffaele sollecito , by contrast with knox , ' had no reason to want the death of meredith kercher
' the document states : ' the alleged motives [ not getting along and the missing â¬ 300 ] concern only relations between the victim and amanda knox , not raffaele sollecito
