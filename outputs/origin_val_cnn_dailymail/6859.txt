the police chief and his department have been widely criticized for their bungled response to teen 's death which sparked national protests the justice department report found patterns of racial profiling , bigotry and profit - driven law enforcement and court practices in the st. louis county suburb that has come to represent the tension between minorities and american police nationwide
most of ferguson 's police officers and top elected officials are white , but two - thirds of the 21,000 residents are black
the report uncovered racist emails from three city employees , including some that belittled black residents or president obama

president obama made his first remarks on the justice department report on friday saying the type of racial discrimination found in ferguson , missouri , is not unique to that police department , and he cast law enforcement reform as a chief struggle for today 's civil rights movement
' i do n't think that is typical of what happens across the country , but it 's not an isolated incident , ' obama told the joe madison radio show on sirius xm radio 's urban view channel
' i think that there are circumstances in which trust between communities and law enforcement have broken down , and individuals or entire departments may not have the training or the accountability to make sure that they 're protecting and serving all people and not just some
