we 've divided the premier league into teams from the north and south of england - with welsh side city included in the south
joe bernstein had the choice to pick any players from the north , in any formation , with no limit on how many from each club
rob draper picked his south xi on monday , and you can read that here
here 's how we split the clubs : north vs south arsenal , aston villa , chelsea , crystal palace , leicester city , qpr , southampton , city , spurs , west brom , west ham united north vs south burnley , everton , hull city , liverpool , manchester city , manchester united , newcastle united , stoke , sunderland north vs south
it is perhaps the fiercest argument between the people of england
but without dipping into the political allegiances , property prices and weather , we 're sticking to the ultimate debating point â football
this week we are starting a new north vs south debate - who would you pick and who would win ? in the nba , each season they stage an all - star match that pits the best from the west against the cream of the east
and would n't it be fascinating if the premier league adopted a similar event ? yesterday , rob draper selected his south xi. here , joe bernstein reveals his north xi - plus seven subs
then on wednesday , we 'll reveal who would win the match thanks to our friends at football manager
and , as always , we want you to tell us who you would have picked in your team ... goalkeeper : joe hart ( manchester city ) tough call between david de gea and joe hart , but the city stopper is better at organising his defenders and more commanding in the air
and , as he showed against lionel messi , he can stop a penalty too
right back : janmaat ( newcastle united ) been outstanding this season and toon fans will have an anxious wait this summer to see if a bigger club snaps him up
janmaat can also play in the centre of the defence but he 's most threatening down the right where his crosses would cause havoc to any rearguard
centre half : shawcross ( stoke ) would surely have been an england regular if he played for a more glamorous club than stoke
better than gary cahill or phil jagielka , less injury - prone than phil jones
this team is so crammed with attacking talent , the two centre - halves are in purely to defend
and they 're good at that
joe hart has been superb in the league and showed against barcelona he can do it in europe too janmaat has been outstanding this season and newcastle united fans will have an anxious wait this summer shawcross pictured scoring for stoke against manchester united at the britannia stadium centre half : skrtel ( liverpool ) totally fearless , he keeps putting his head and body in the way of danger - just what you want from a centre - half
useful in both penalty areas at set - pieces too , he gets his fair share of goals for a defender
him and shawcross would n't let anything pass , allowing the two full backs to push up
left back : baines ( everton ) just gets better and better with age
fantastic at set - pieces , both delivery and shooting , and so calm on the ball
has got over the disappointment of not joining manchester united and it 's no coincidence everton hit their dodgy patch when he was out of the team injured
right wing : sterling ( liverpool ) showed at the last world cup he has now taken over wayne rooney 's mantle as the best player in the england team and it 's hard to believe he is still only 20
the one player in roy hodgson 's squad that you think could actually make it with real madrid or barcelona , he is quick , skilful , has natural balance and courage on and off the ball liverpool 's totally fearless defender skrtel ( right ) squares up to david de gea at anfield recently everton 's baines just seems to get better and better with age in the demanding premier league sterling has become an brilliant performer for liverpool this season as they look to tie him down central midfield : michael carrick ( manchester united ) people ask why manchester united 's form has improved in the last couple of matches
simple , michael carrick is back from injury and making the team tick
always seems to know when to play the right pass , and makes average players around him look good and the good players look great central midfield : james mccarthy ( everton ) if this team has steel down the middle in skrtel and shawcross , and stealth in michael carrick , james mccarthy adds speed
he can cover ground to make tackles and when he needs to use the ball , the irishman is neat and tidy
one of roberto martinez 's best signings and no wonder bigger clubs want him
left midfield : silva ( manchester city ) with baines behind him , silva would n't have to hug the left - hand touchline like a traditional winger , he would start from there , link up with baines at times but also drift inside and drop grenades infield
on his day , a hugely talented and influential player
juan mata is rightly getting plaudits at the moment , in spain they say silva is better
michael carrick has returned from injury and is making manchester united tick for manager louis van gaal james mccarthy , pictured scoring for everton against newcastle united at goodison park , makes the xi silva ( above ) and manchester city team - mate sergio aguero make it into our north xi striker : sergio aguero ( manchester city ) has taken over luis suarez 's mantle as the best player in the league
absolutely lethal against any type of opposition as his hat - trick against bayern munich showed in the champions league
may be asked to leave the penalties to baines though after his fluffed effort in the nou camp
striker : wayne rooney ( captain ) ( manchester united ) wayne rooney has often formed good strike partnerships with players who are of similar build and technique , henrik larsson springs to mind in his brief spell at manchester united , so i have no doubts he would be prolific with sergio aguero
i can see them being on the same wavelength and wayne rooney would spot the argentine 's runs early
wayne rooney captains our north xi for his outstanding form for louis van gaal 's manchester united subs begovic ( stoke ) : another in the joe hart mould ; big , commanding , wo n't leave his defenders alone
pablo zabaleta ( manchester city ) : if you need someone to see out the final 20 minutes , he 's perfect
phil jones ( manchester united ) : another who can put his body in the way if you 're defending for your life
yaya toure ( manchester city ) : totally unpredictable , if you do n't know how he 's going to play , how can the opposition ? young ( manchester united ) : coming into some great form , can play right or left , and will track back when needed
daniel sturridge ( liverpool ) : a great impact sub , can score in instant with his quick feet robin van persie ( manchester united ) : been written off this season , but it 's less than a year ago he scored that header in world cup
yaya toure just misses out on the starting xi but the manchester city star makes our subs bench there is no room for steven gerrard ( left ) but daniel sturridge ( right ) can act as a great impact sub manchester united 's robin van persie ( left ) and young ( right ) just miss out on the starting xi ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : courtois , clyne , fonte , terry , azpilicueta ; matic , schneiderlin ; sanchez , cazorla , hazard ; kane
subs : green , ivanovic , koscielny , delph , bolasie , costa , giroud ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : joe hart ; janmaat , shawcross , skrtel , baines ; sterling , michael carrick , james mccarthy , silva ; sergio aguero , wayne rooney subs : begovic , zabaleta , phil jones , yaya toure , young , sturridge , van persie
