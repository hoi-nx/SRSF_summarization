after leading barcelona to champions league victory against manchester city at the nou camp on wednesday night messi hit back at those that criticised him earlier in the season before celebrating spanish father 's day with his family
the argentina international 's girlfriend roccuzzo posted a picture to her instagram account on thursday morning wishing him ' father 's day '
roccuzzo and two - year - old son thiago each planted a kiss on messi 's cheek as the trio posed for a family selfie to mark the occasion

earlier in the season , however , messi was subjected to intense scrutiny as he and barcelona struggled for form
he was beaten to the ballon d'or trophy by cristiano ronaldo as rumours of transfer surfaced
but any concerns that messi 's star was fading have well and truly been dispelled since the turn of the year and , after the manchester city game , he was quick to remind his detractors of the criticism he received
messi joins in the celebrations with rakitic and luis suarez of barcelona 's first - half goal at the nou camp messi tries to take the ball around the onrushing manchester city goalkeeper hart who makes the save ' a short while ago i was supposed to be a disaster , it 's tricky to go from being a disaster to the best form of ones career , ' messi told canal + after the game
during wednesday 's last - 16 second leg , although messi ran the manchester city defence ragged , he met his match against hart
the england no 1 produced one of the great champions league goalkeeping performances to thwart messi with several fine stops
had it not been for hart 's heroics it could have been a humiliating defeat for manuel pellegrini 's side and messi , in typically sporting fashion , was quick to congratulate him
hart thwarts messi again as the manchester city goalkeeper kept his side in the game argentina international messi and hart acknowledge each other 's performances with a hand shake ' he saved everything
we did all we could to score more goals but the keeper played fantastically well and i âd like to congratulate him
the most important thing was to make it through
' barcelona now turn their attention to the small matter of the clasico on sunday with a chance to open up a four - point lead over real madrid in la liga , but messi is expecting a tough match
' one has to respect them and their current form makes them more dangerous
i would nât say that they âre not in good shape or lacking form
on an individual basis they have great players
we âll just try and play our game
