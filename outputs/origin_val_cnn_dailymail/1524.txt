tough sell ? more than two thirds of u.s. have said they are not interested in buying apple 's new smart watch apple 's new smartwatch may be a tough sell , with 69 percent of u.s. indicating they are not interested in buying the gadget , according to a reuters / ipsos poll
however , the survey also showed limited awareness of the watch
the poll was taken after apple chief executive cook rolled out the product on monday , and only about half of respondents said they had heard news of the timepiece in the last few days
also , in an encouraging sign for apple , roughly 13 percent of survey respondents who did not own an iphone said that they would consider buying one in order to buy an apple watch , which needs an iphone to work fully
apple overcame skepticism about the ipad and ipod when they first debuted , but the survey suggests that the world 's largest technology company has work to do to make the watch ubiquitous
the new watch , a test of cook 's leadership , is the company 's first new product in five years , and it hits stores on april 24
it allows users to check email , listen to music and make phone calls from their wrist
apple will sell various versions , from a $ 349 ' sport ' edition to a $ 17,000 18 - karat gold timepiece
ipsos surveyed 1,245 u.s. online between march 9 and march 13
the data was weighted to reflect the u.s. population and has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points
apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the poll
more than half of respondents , 52 percent , agreed with the statement that smartwatches are a ' passing fad
' one - quarter of respondents said they were interested in purchasing the apple watch , but 69 percent said they had no desire , and 6 percent said they were unsure
initial demand for the watch is expected to come primarily from existing iphone users , but its wider success is seen depending on whether developers create enticing apps tailored to the device , so - called killer apps
