ford may be known for its cars , but at this year âs mobile world congress the auto giant also unveiled a pair of electric bikes
both prototypes are powered by 200 - watt motors , fold to fit on a train or in the boot of a car , and with pedal assist , help riders reach speeds of up to 15mph ( 25km/h )
the bikes are part of an experiment by ford called handle on mobility , which aims to make journeys safer and more efficient
ford unveiled two prototype electric bikes at mobile world congress in barcelona
both the mode : me ( pictured ) and mode : pro are powered by 200 - watt motors , fold to fit on a train or in the boot of a car , and with pedal assist they help riders reach speeds of up to 15mph ( 25km/h ) they are also part of the company 's wider smart mobility plan , which is designed to make cars and other vehicles more connected
the bikes , called mode : me and mode : pro , are based on designs by ford employees and take inspiration from technology seen in cars
for example , both bikes are fitted with rear - facing ultrasonic sensors
these sensors link with the handlebars to discreetly alert the rider when a car is about to overtake using subtle vibrations
the mode : me e-bike ( pictured ) was designed for commuters â to keep moving in congested city traffic â
it folds and stows easily , allowing commuters to park outside the city , for example , take the e-bike onto public transport or a car and travel to the centre , then ride the e-bike to their destination both bikes have a slot for an iphone so an app can be used as a sat - van ( pictured left ) and show when a car is about to overtake ( pictured right ) , thanks to rear - facing ultrasonic sensors in the bike 's frame earlier this week ford unveiled its latest app that not only shows how far you can travel on the power you have remaining on an electric car , but bases its predictions on your unique driving style
called myford mobile , it also lets drivers remotely access their vehicles meaning they can set the cabin temperature on a cold morning before they leave their house
the app was announced at mobile world congress in barcelona and currently works with a selection of ford âs electric and hybrid cars
it specifically suits electric cars because the app can directly link to the battery to see a status level and accurate mileage
but ford spokesman abraham phillip told mailonline the team is working on developing the software for petrol and diesel range
these handlebars also light up to make the bikes more visible to motorists
the mode : me e-bike â built with the help of bicycle manufacturer dahon - is designed for commuters â to keep moving in congested city traffic â
it folds and stows easily , allowing commuters to park outside the city , for example , take the e-bike onto public transport and travel to the centre , then ride the e-bike to their destination
meanwhile , the mode : pro e-bike â built by a ford team â is intended for commercial use by couriers , electricians , and goods and delivery services
it is designed to stow safely into commercial vehicles which can act as carrier and support vehicle , and be combined with more than one e-bike
both prototypes work with an called mode : link , which is currently only compatible with the iphone
this app acts as a sat - nav and sends vibrations to the handlebars so the rider knows when to change direction
turn signals are then triggered automatically for safety
the app also finds bike - friendly roads , hazards and alerts , and could â communicate â with other vehicles
the mode : pro e-bike ( pictured ) â built by a ford team â is intended for commercial use by couriers , electricians , and goods and delivery services it is designed to stow safely into commercial vehicles which can act as carrier and support vehicle , and be combined with more than one e-bike
both prototypes work with an called mode : link , which is currently only compatible with the iphone 6 its multimodal navigation and smart routing lets riders filter journeys based on cost , time , and the amount of cycling required , compared to driving
this map also shows the weather , parking costs and charging stations
the electric pedal assist rate can be adjusted based on a cyclist 's heart rate and includes a â no sweat â mode that takes over when requested , meaning the rider can cool down before arriving at their destination
â there are so many ways to get around a city , but what is really needed is a way to connect all of these transport options together , â said ken washington , vice president , ford research and advanced engineering
â being able to seamlessly move between cars , buses , trains and e-bikes and react to changing traffic situations can make a big difference both for commuters and for those delivering goods , services and healthcare
â there are no immediate plans to release the bikes but ford said they will help test alternative transportation ideas
