residents who were expecting an â upmarket store â to set up shop in their leafy village have been left furious after discovering that discount chain netto is moving in
villagers in historic lymm in cheshire , who were promised a luxury supermarket as part of a new retail development , had believed a high - end chain such as waitrose or m&s might be opening its doors
but after keeping the villagers guessing for almost ten months as to the identity of the store , it emerged that the danish discount chain , famed for its value goods , would be moving on to the site
historic : residents of the village of lymm , cheshire , pictured , were promised a ' high quality ' supermarket high hopes : villagers expected an upmarket supermarket such as waitrose , m&s or booths to move in disappointed : it emerged developers had leased the site to danish discount chain netto ( file image ) the announcement was met with outrage by residents of the picturesque village , who set up a petition demanding their council oppose the move
rob jones , who has spearheaded the campaign against the discount store , said : â the development was described to residents as an upmarket supermarket and that the client wanted to remain anonymous until a later stage
â the applicant it would appear is netto â not a high - end supermarket as promised
â the plans for the new food store had originally been unveiled last may by the developers , the brookhouse group , which boasted of an â upmarket store â creating 35 jobs with parking space for 57 cars
a public exhibition was also held detailing artists â impressions
planning permission was approved but the identity of the retail chain was still kept under wraps
however , last week residents discovered they were not getting the supermarket they hoped for , after netto bosses applied for an operating and liquor licence to the labour - run warrington council
