karla kirby with two of her own children , jordan and joshua , and some of the children she ahs given birth to as a surrogate mother in an interview with the mirror , karla kirby said she decided to become a surrogate as she loved motherhood and was keen to help other people have a family of their own
with two children of her own , and in her late teens , she overheard a conversation where people were discussing surrogacy and decided to contact the organisation cots ( cots ) to find out more
after a counselling session to make sure she was ready , she opted to be a ' straight surrogate ' using her own eggs and the intended father 's sperm which she artificially inseminated herself
karla kirby chose to help a couple where the wife was infertile , and became pregnant after the eighth attempt , with her first surrogate child , ethan , in 2001
she said seeing the emotion on the new parents ' faces when she handed over the baby helped her realise she had made the right decision and 18 months later , became a surrogate again , going on to give birth to nia in 2002 and carey in 2003
