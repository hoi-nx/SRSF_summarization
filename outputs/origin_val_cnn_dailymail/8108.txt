the nichol family had never been on holiday to turkey before , nor had we previously experienced an all inclusive package
so as my wife suzie , nine - year - old daughter sophie and i arrived at the marti myra resort on the mediterranean coast , the place was facing a tough test
the reception area was plush and polished , with acres of wood , glass and marble
john nichol with his wife suzie and nine - year - old daughter sophie at the marti myra resort in turkey to sophie 's delight , plenty of kids were lounging around on giant sofas availing themselves of free wi - fi and watching giant tvs
as the adults sipped cocktails at the lobby bar , the hotel appeared bustling but by no means overcrowded - probably because marti myra is a huge , rambling resort with seemingly endless facilities
all 551 rooms were taken when we stayed , housing around 1,100 adults and 500 children
but there was never any sense we were competing for space
this may well be because the site is set in 100 acres , has seven pools , water slides , beaches , an amphitheatre , five bars and seven restaurants
sophie quickly made friends with other british children and more or less disappeared for the fortnight
this is a resort completely geared towards family satisfaction and we were totally happy for the children to play in the pools , visit the various restaurants and go to the arcade unsupervised
that said , i suspect the amount of vegetables consumed at their private lunches was in inverse proportion to the volume of ice - cream eaten
if that was the case they were missing out , as the food was tremendous - endless buffets of fresh fish , salads , grilled meats - and 20 desserts
for a small supplement , guests can also choose from Ã la carte restaurants
marti myra is in the kemer region , which is dominated by the towering presence of mount tahtali , the highest peak in southern turkey
it demands a visit so we took the cable car to the 7,757ft summit
at â¬ 210 ( around Â£ 150 ) for the three of us , it was n't cheap but it was worth it to experience the glorious panorama
the pool complex at marti myra was a hit with the nichols family in true nichol-clan style , this was our only excursion from the resort as we were more than happy to luxuriate on the beach or by the pool
the only other added extra we chose to invest in was one of the Â£ 100 - a - day pavilions on the pristine beach
these private retreats came equipped with robes , sofas , sunbeds and a fridge
and if you could n't be bothered to open the fridge door yourself , a waiter would bring over drinks and snacks
we could have taken part in all sorts of activities , from aqua - aerobics to archery , dancing and poolside it 's a knockout - style games
the beach party was a riot of noise , while the nightly entertainment included amazing kenyan acrobats
the kids ' club production of grease had suzie and i doing the full john travolta and olivia newton-john routine ... much to sophie 's utter horror
for a more peaceful break you can simply retreat to the calm of the rolling gardens
marti myra really did offer a fabulous holiday experience for the whole family
sophie was happy - and if children are happy , contentment for all will surely follow
