within hours of a white officer shooting an unarmed black man , the police chief of wisconsin 's capital city was praying with the man 's grandmother , hoping to strike a conciliatory tone and avoid the riots that last year rocked ferguson , missouri
chief mike koval said he knows madison is being watched across the nation since 19 - year - old robinson 's death on friday evening , and he has gone out of his way to avoid what he once called ferguson 's ' missteps
' ' folks are angry , resentful , mistrustful , disappointed , shocked , chagrined
i get that , ' mike koval said saturday
' people need to tell me squarely how upset they are with the madison police department
while ferguson police initially gave little information about the shooting of brown , an 18 - year - old , unarmed black man , mike koval rushed to the home of robinson 's mother
she did n't want to meet with him , he said , but he talked and prayed with robinson 's grandmother in the driveway for 45 minutes
it took a week for ferguson to release the name of the officer who shot brown
mike koval announced the name of the officer involved in madison , kenny , the day after the shooting
he volunteered to reporters that the officer had been in a previous fatal shooting in 2007 , and that he had been cleared of wrongdoing
on the day that ferguson police named the officer who shot brown , they also released video showing what they said was brown robbing a store
robinson , an unarmed black 19 - year - old , was fatally shot friday , by kenny , a white police officer , the madison police chief said saturday when mike koval was asked about robinson 's past criminal record saturday , he declined to comment , saying it would be inappropriate to do so a day after the man died
' we have a police chief who genuinely feels for a family 's loss
it should be abundantly clear to anyone following this incident that madison , wisconsin , is not ferguson , missouri , ' said jim palmer , executive director of the wisconsin professional police association , the state 's largest police union
but the chief 's measured approach has n't impressed some demonstrators
mike koval angered some of them earlier this year with a blog post demanding they stop blaming police for their problems
' there are no apologies that can repair the loss or deal with the loss of ( robinson ) , ' said brandi grayson , an organizer with young , gifted and black , a madison group that has demonstrated against what it says is mistreatment of blacks by the justice system
' this was bound to happen
there 's nothing the chief can say short of changing the system
' people gather outside the house where robinson was shot during a rally on saturday to protest his death robinson died on friday night after kenny shot him in an apartment during a confrontation
kenny had responded to a call of a man jumping in and out of traffic
kenny forced his way into the apartment after hearing what mike koval described as a ' disturbance
' the state u.s. justice department 's division of criminal investigation has taken over the investigation under a new state law passed last year that requires an outside agency to lead probes of officer - involved shootings
u.s. justice department spokeswoman anne schwartz declined to comment on sunday
the shooting comes against a backdrop of multiple instances of white police officers killing unarmed black men around the country over the last year
the highest - profile incident was the death of brown in ferguson last august
days of violence ensued , marked by looting , fires , police firing tear gas into a crowd and officers pointing weapons at demonstrators
another round of riots broke out in november after a grand jury chose not to indict the officer who shot brown , wilson
while robinson 's mom did n't want to meet with him , madison police chief mike koval talked and prayed with the dead man 's grandmother for 45 minutes relatives and friends of robinson exit a gathering of church representatives , community leaders and residents at fountain of life covenant church , saturday , in madison , wisconsin last week the u.s. justice department declined to charge wilson with civil rights violations but issued a scathing report accusing the ferguson police department of racism and using policing to fund the city 's budget
mike koval , who is white , took over as madison 's chief in april , replacing retiring black chief noble wray
in september he told the wisconsin state journal he believed his department could deal with a racially charged shooting better than ferguson , saying his agency is more diverse and more invested in the community than ferguson 's ' rent - a - cops
' ' i see in ferguson a series of missteps and miscues where they 're always reacting and , in fact , over-reacting to every set of facts that is thrown in their midst , frankly , ' mike koval said in the interview
two months ago , mike koval wrote a blog post criticizing young , black and gifted for blaming his officers for ' everything from male pattern baldness to global warming
' the entry came in response to the group staging protests over officer - involved deaths during rush - hour traffic , demanding jail officials release 350 black inmates and imploring police to stay out of black neighborhoods
mike koval tried to be diplomatic when asked about the post on saturday , saying he and the group have agreed to disagree on policing black neighborhoods
grayson said mike koval has had plenty of time to prepare for a racially charged shooting after watching what unfolded in ferguson
' he had a perfect response â perfect for white people , ' she said
