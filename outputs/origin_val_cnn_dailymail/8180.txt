a couple of weeks back , after chelsea âs fiery 1 - 0 win over everton , twitter âs support team took swift and decisive action over a series of deeply unpleasant tweets
on february 10 , 2015 , one user wrote â i hope you get shot you utter w * * * * * â in response to a piece i had written about branislav ivanovic âs reaction to everton substitute james mccarthy
the same day , an arsenal supporter sent the message â kill yourself â , without even referencing anything i 'd written about the club
it was by no means a unique experience
branislav ivanovic got to grips with james mccarthy in angry exchange during chelsea 's win over everton ... the incident , a major flashpoint in the game at stamford bridge last month , was covered by reporters ... and at that point the twitter users took it as their invite to join the party click here to follow neil on twitter there was worse , much worse , but publishing the depressing details , which would bring a family member of mine into the public domain , would be an invasion of privacy - and the accounts involved , along with many others that week , were suspended for violating twitter âs rules
the motivation behind this piece is because the daily mail âs head of sport was genuinely taken aback by the scale and sheer venom of the attacks that can take place on this forum
this is the life of a football reporter in 2015 , waking up to indiscriminate messages each morning in the same casual manner you check your phone for texts
social media should be a theatre for healthy debate , a chance to forcefully bat around some ideas or opinions about a sport many of us have devoted our lives to
unfortunately twitter has become the elephant in the room , the one subject we are reluctant to discuss in depth because an admission that the medium can be psychologically taxing is perceived as a weakness
toughen up , grow some , and all those other things people say when they are unable to accept that these are serious issues to confront
the experiences described above are by no means novel : on the night of saturday december 11 , 2010 it was impossible to monitor the number of people who threatened my life when tevez âs transfer request was reported
a piece about tevez , pictured here unhappy at being substituted by roberto mancini in december 2010 , just before his transfer request , did not go down too well with some people out in cyber space tevez is much happier now at juventus ... twitter can still be just as horrible and angry a place though there are people who will tell you that this is part of the game , that these attacks are just twitter trolls hiding behind the anonymity of a keyboard in a bedroom at their parents â house
if it is true , it does nât mean we have to accept it , either
to many we have the best job in the world , roaming the country to watch the biggest matches in the barclays premier league and heading overseas for the champions league , or with the national team at world cups
this is the boyhood dream , a personal obsession after realising at a very , very early age that a career playing the sport professionally would be beyond question
twitter is a modern phenomenon , a bear pit for the football reporters who cross a very fine line when they write about some of the most high - profile issues in the game
neil during an interview with taarabt last year when the qpr player responded to comments made by then - manager harry redknapp
taarabt was answering claims he was overweight neil is up for sports news reporter of the year at the british sports journalism awards this month - an award he won during his time at the news of the world ( above with long - time daily mirror man john jackson ) many will argue that journalists , with the undoubted privileges we enjoy at times , are fair game
others will have similar experiences and many - admirably , as it happens - put it down to a hazard of the job
goodness knows we dish out enough stick to clubs and managers over the decisions they make and there will be people who argue that we should learn to take our medicine
the abuse , though , is pure cyanide
sadly it also affects dialogue , with sensible tweets often lost in an avalanche of poison if you happen to write something even remotely controversial about a team , a player or manager
errors are seized upon , with reporters called to account in a way that was never possible until dorsey dreamed up twitter in 2006
it âs fine to spar , with people such as @ cfcaway , @ terrencethecat or @ wisepoyet frequently pulling me up on pieces that have been written about the goings - on at chelsea
they never overstep the mark , but they do have an opinion and can , on occasion , show a sense of humour
dorsey , pictured in october last year , is a co-founder of twitter surely this is an environment we should encourage , to take responsibility and trade messages about subjects in an atmosphere that is not intoxicated with bile , abuse , threats or intimidation
it feels naive to write that , particularly when you learn about the experience of gaelic athletic association referee patrick nelis in 2013
he attempted suicide after he was bombarded with , among other things , abuse such as â fat , red hamster â on social media
how sad that it came to that
it is little wonder that twitter âs chief executive costolo told the company âs staff , in a leaked email in mid-february , that it was time to clampdown on the pollution in this social forum
â we suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we âve sucked at it for years , â he told employees
( from left ) dorsey , at the new york stock exchange in 2013 with co-founders biz stone , evan williams and chief executive costolo , who outlined the need to find a way of getting rid of the pollution on twitter â it âs no secret and the rest of the world talks about it every day
we lose core user after core user by not addressing simple trolling issues that they face every day
â in the days after costolo âs memorandum was leaked to the media , the company began to take action on the users mentioned above , along with scores of others who were being abusive or harassing people
when they suspended the account of one , he returned under a different guise on monday evening to warn that that i was no longer safe
people like that need to be educated
this is an opportunity for twitter to evolve , to make it clear that this remarkable concept is to be used in a way that is socially acceptable
the issue of trolling , as we know , is not confined to sport
in september 2013 the met police admitted they were powerless at times to investigate and prosecute twitter trolls for their hounding of various public figures
progress is slow , but twitter has suspended accounts of those threatening physical violence and have emailed others to remind them that a behavioural policy is in place
the intentions are honourable and the moment has arrived for a system of best practice to be observed by its 288m users
without it , the minority will continue to distort the experience for the good - natured majority .
