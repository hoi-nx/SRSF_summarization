men in ' immaculate suits ' are tricking motorway drivers into believing they are stranded , then taking their money in exchange for fake jewellery
there were a staggering 26 incidents on the m4 , m40 and m25 in five days , according to detectives who have urged commuters to be vigilant
the conmen tell innocent motorists who stop to help that they ran out of petrol and their loved one has died - so they need money to get home immediately
in return , the gang members have been offering fake gold rings as ' security ' in exchange for the cash to buy petrol
conmen : there were a staggering 26 incidents on the m4 , m40 and m25 ( pictured ) involving men in ' immaculate suits ' who tricked motorists out of cash by convincing them they are stranded inspector colin clark from thames valley police said : ' in some of these cases the men stopping motorists were well - dressed and wearing suits
' some stated that a relative had died or that they had run out of petrol and needed money
' the offenders were often parked in areas which put themselves and other road users at risk
' we take all reports seriously and take appropriate action against anyone found to be offending
' the incidents all took place on the m25 , the m4 and the m40 motorways across berkshire and buckinghamshire
aa spokesman luke bosdet said : ' people getting conned on motorways is deeply disturbing and this is exactly the sort of thing we at the aa warn drivers to watch out for
lies : the conmen have been lying to innocent motorists who stop to help by telling them they have run out of petrol and a relative has died so they need money to get home immediately ( m4 pictured ) ' it has been happening in europe and it is very worrying to see it happening here
' it could be argued that if people are dumb enough to hand over money then in a way , they deserve to be ripped off , but the fact of the matter is that it is a scam that has been happening in other parts of the world
' the problem is where they go from here
our advice for people who come across these conmen is to politely say no , drive a safe distance away and immediately call the police
' the way to deal with these conmen is to catch them in the act
we must get the message through that we will not stand for people getting ripped off on the roadside
