a victim of child sex abuse herself , former child star sarah monahan has weighed into the furore surrounding the royal commission into the reporting of child sex abuse , focussing most recently at the elite knox grammar
sarah monahan was sexually abused as a child by hey dad ! star hughes , who was jailed last may for a minimum of six years
on her blog , sarahmonahan.com , the former tv star brought to light the reaction of some people to the allegations against private boy 's school knox grammar , slamming those who claimed the young boys deserved what they got
' the royal commission into child abuse has been uncovering a lot of horrific stories of abuse in australia , ' her post began
' hearing people discuss the abuse at knox grammar has kind of shocked me
there are plenty of people online who seem to imply that these kids deserved it because their parents sent them to a fancy pants grammar school
' ms sarah monahan , whose claims against hughes were a catalyst into the investigations which eventually saw him locked up , also recounted her own private school experiences in the strongly - worded post
' to suggest that the parents of these kids are to blame because they were more interested in sending their kids to a grammar school than a state school is appalling , she also wrote
' i do nât care if you have a beef with private schools getting money from the government
i do nât care if you once hated a kid who went to a private school
i do nât care if you âre secretly jealous that you did nât get to attend a private school
ms sarah monahan 's ( centre , front ) claims against hughes ( left , front ) were a catalyst into the investigations which eventually saw him behind bars ' nobody , and i mean nobody , deserves to be abused
whether you âre a millionaire âs daughter attending ascham , a janitors kid on a free scholarship at knox grammar , or a middle class kid attending the local state high school
no matter your status , or income bracket , all children deserve to grow up , free of abuse , ' sarah monahan 's piece concluded
her abuser , hey dad ! star hughes was sentenced last may after being convicted of 10 child sex offences , committed between 1983 and 1991
before a packed gallery at the sydney district court , judge peter zahra said hughes had not expressed remorse
' his conduct continued over 20 years
[ even ] after he was questioned by police in 1986 it continued , ' he said
' the offender took advantage of when he was with victims in social settings in his home or at victims ' homes
' he lacks insight into his offending and he is unlikely to access treatment programs
' ms sarah monahan ( left ) was one of the first to speak out against hughes ( right ) , and in a recent blog post addressed the discussion surrounding knox grammar once he was found guilty , sarah monahan reacted to the news by saying she was ' happy ' and that she hopes hughes now ' realises he 's a bad man ' sarah monahan 's most recent comments come following last week 's revelations that former head of paterson denied touching a young woman 's bottom during a school musical to the cheering of young boys , as he admitted deliberately hindering a 1996 investigation into child sex abuse
in the second shocking day of evidence at the royal commission into institutional responses to child sex abuse , dr paterson said he did ' absolutely not ' touch perry , who was 15 - years - old , during a rehearsal of ' guys and dolls ' in 1989
' they were roaring their approval for her performance as the sultry dancer , ' dr paterson told the inquiry , under intense questioning from counsel assisting the commission david lloyd
dr paterson , the former headmaster of knox grammar , provided evidence to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sex abuse last week perry , the ceo of an international women 's charity , told the commission on monday that dr paterson had touched her behind during a rehearsal of guys and dolls
she said the action was greeted by a ' roar of approval ' from young men in the crowd perry was surprised by the reaction her testimony triggered from victims attending the inquiry , with many standing up to applaud her as she left in explosive testimony on wednesday , dr paterson also accepted he had hindered a police investigation of claims into child sex abuse led by inspector elizabeth cullen in 1996
he said on wednesday that when a police inspector from the child protection unit approached him in 1996 about six teachers at knox grammar about whom there had been complaints , he did not give her full information
in reply to david lloyd counsel advising the royal commission , which is inquiring into knox grammar 's handling of sex abuse complaints , dr paterson agreed he knew this would impede the investigation
ms perry , 41 , now the ceo of an international women 's charity , told the commission on monday that dr paterson , the show 's producer , had singled her out during the joint rehearsal between knox grammar and roseville college
as she walked to the edge of the stage ' he placed his hand on my backside '
' i would describe it as between a pat and a grope , ' ms perry told the commission
' he then slid his hand right down to cup my buttocks and ( i ) felt him touch my genitals outside of my clothing
' knox grammar former headmaster paterson said on tuesday that he is ' deeply and profoundly sorry ' for failing to recognise and respond to child sex abuse perpetrated while he was head of the school dr paterson also said it never occurred to him to contact police after a balaclava - clad ' intruder ' broke into a boarding house and sexually assaulted a year 8 student ms perry continued : ' i was humiliated in front of the boys and i heard the boys cheering
' i was disgusted with paterson 's behaviour and thought he was demonstrating to the knox grammar boys that it was perfectly acceptable , even admirable , to be disrespectful to girls
' ms perry was not interested in pressing charges against dr paterson but changed her mind in 2009
an arrest warrant has been issued for former knox grammar teacher christopher fotis after he failed to appear at a royal commission hearing last tuesday ' i wanted to let police know that i was happy to provide a statement if it was going to be useful to demonstrate the culture of disrespect engendered by the school and to highlight the environment and attitudes fostered by the headmaster , ' she said
his testimony followed a day of evidence on tuesday where it emerged dr paterson allowed teachers he knew had abused children to stay on staff for years
others he suspected of sexually abusing students were allowed to resign and dr paterson wrote them positive letters of recommendation following their departures
the hearing on tuesday also heard that the student files of abuse victims went missing from the school , and no detailed records of sex abuse allegations relating to teachers and students were recorded in their files
dr paterson said knox grammar conducted a number of internal investigations into abuse suffered by students without reporting the cases the authorities , but repeatedly denied that incidences were kept from police or docs to protect the school 's reputation
he said he made the decision not to sack one teacher who watched hardcore pornography with students in 1987 because the man had ' made a very silly mistake ' and had ' enormous potential in the profession '
in a case involving another teacher in 1987 , dr paterson said he sent a 15 - year - old student to the library to ' think about what he said ' after the teen confided in him about being abused - describing the student as a ' dramatical boy ' who ' liked to exaggerate stories '
purple ribbons were tied out the front of knox grammar in honour of victims of paedophile teachers dr paterson read out a statement apologising for his failings at the beginning of the commission 's hearing in sydney today dr paterson also said it never occurred to him to contact police after a balaclava - clad ' intruder ' broke into a boarding house and sexually assaulted a year 8 student in 1988
he added that he did not think to report the matter to police even after he formed a suspicion the attack was perpetrated by a staff member
on tuesday , dr paterson was questioned about former teacher treloar who worked at the school until 2009 despite dr paterson being aware of the pornography incident that occurred in 1987
treloar was convicted of child sex abuse in 2010 and sentenced to jail for two years
dr paterson said former knox grammar general duties master stuart pearson called him late in 1987 and told him treloar had shown pornography to a young student
he said he had not asked any further details , including how many boys were shown the tape , how often it had occurred or if he 'd propositioned any boys
