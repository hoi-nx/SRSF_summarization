a woman who discovered she was conceived by rape has been adopted by her birth mother more than 40 years after she was given away
rebecca always knew she was n't brought up by her biological parents , but it was not until she searched for her birth mother that she found out why
the 45 - year - old , from michigan , us , waited until she was 18 to track down met joann , who revealed she had considered aborting her daughter â and later told her that her biological father was a rapist
rebecca , pictured with met joann , 77 , had to wait until she was 18 to track down her biological mother , who confessed she would have aborted her daughter , who was conceived by rape after she was attacked met joann , now 77 , had been attacked while she was on her way to a shop at night , and dragged to a nearby field
rebecca said : ' mum told me she thought he was going to kill her
she was lucky to be alive
' the attacker was never caught but met joann discovered she was pregnant with his baby
rebecca explained : ' abortion was illegal in michigan
mum admitted if it had been legal at the time she would have had an abortion
' that really upset me
she even went to two backstreet abortion clinics but in the end was too fearful for her life when she saw the conditions there
rebecca , pictured growing up , left and right , said she always knew she had been adopted but had no idea about her mother 's attack until it was confirmed by her adoption case worker reunited : met joann walked rebecca down the aisle during her wedding to robert in 1998 ' she said she thought about asking her cousin to adopt me but realised it would be too difficult for her to keep me in the family
' rebecca , who waited until she was 18 to find her biological mother , and lost her adoptive parents as a result , said she understood why her mother had that reaction
she said : ' seeing me every day would have been a reminder of the rape
no wonder my mum had n't wanted me
' all these years i 'd wanted to find my roots
now i knew my dad had been a rapist and i 'd been conceived in what was probably the worst moment of my mum 's life
' rebecca had always known she was adopted from a young age
she said : ' kids at school picked on me for looking nothing like my short , dark - haired parents
' i 'd always wondered where i had come from
' my adoptive parents were very strict and i was nothing like them
' i felt like i did n't have an identity so i was desperate to find out what i could
rebecca revealed she was desperate to find her birth mother , met joann , who was thrilled to see her after more than 40 years
she has now adopted rebecca , who says she finally feels like she ' belongs in the world ' ' my adoptive dad told me i had a half - brother and half - sister , so i wondered if i was the product of an affair or perhaps mum had been widowed
' rebecca 's adoption case worker confirmed the truth
but michigan state protected the anonymity of women who put babies up for adoption
after a change in law , rebecca could receive basic details about her birth parents
she said : ' when i turned 18 i would be able to request information like my birth parents ' eye colour or height , but nothing that would identify them
' on the morning of my 18th birthday i called oakland county court
' all i could discover was that mum was 31 when she had me , 4ft 10in with brown hair and hazel eyes
my father was listed as caucasian and of large build
' her father 's description set rebecca 's alarm bells ringing
she said : ' it made me think of a police description
i spoke to my case worker who confirmed i was the result of a rape
' my adoptive parents tried to comfort me but they did n't know how to console me
' but she was still desperate to find her mother and passed a letter through oakland county court to her mother
rebecca has said she has even told her own children how her mother was attacked she received a reply with her mother 's full name and rebecca 's name at birth - judy ann miracle
she said : ' i was scared she would n't want to meet me but she was thrilled to hear from me
' but she said : ' when i first met her , it felt natural to call mum ' and she has said she sees me as a blessing
' i 'm so happy something so good came from something so awful
' met joann was thrilled to hear from her biological daughter
and when rebecca married husband robert kiessling in 1998 , met joann was the mother of the bride
rebecca said : ' i did n't know if i would ever see her let alone have her at my wedding
it was an amazing day
' rebecca revealed that she even told her own children what had happened
she said : ' i 'd always felt compelled to adopt children so we did that before we had our own
' they know their biological grandfather was a bad man who hurt grandma
i do n't see a reason to hide that
' sadly rebecca 's relationship with her adoptive parents was not as strong and they severed contact
rebecca said : ' in 2010 , i asked mum if she and her husband joe , who was n't with her when i was born , might adopt me
' they thought it was a great idea
i 'm joe 's first child so we had a big party with ' it 's a girl ' balloons
' when i was young i felt like i had to justify why i 'm here
i was n't planned or wanted
mum almost had me aborted
' now i know i was created for a purpose and since she legally adopted me , i finally feel like i belong in the world
