a new robot that moves just like a salamander has been created by engineers
the robot , called pleurobot , walks and swims in a life - like way that mimics the shy amphibious creatures
it was developed by recording 3d x-ray videos of short - ribbed salamanders - europe 's largest salamander - allowing researchers to track 64 points on the animal skeleton

a video released by google 's boston dynamics sparked complaints after an engineer kicked one of its dog - like robots to show off its ability to remain upright
viewers said the robot had been mistreated and claimed the employees were being cruel
it sparked a debate about whether it was possible to be cruel to a robot
ethicists and robotics experts waded into the argument to explain the only way it could be unethical would be if the robot could feel pain
others pointed out it is impossible for robots to have feelings
they say as it is able to cope with a range of different terrain and squeeze through relatively small spaces , the robot could also be used to help search for people trapped in disaster zones
and they added that the robots highly flexible spine also allows it to swim in water , but only if it is given a waterproof skin
professor auke jan ijspeert , a researcher at the biorobotics laboratory at the swiss federal institute of technology in lausanne ( efpl ) , has been leading the development of the robot
according to the group 's website : ' because of its low centre of mass and segmented legs it can navigate over rough terrain without losing balance
' with a waterproof skin it can also swim
' those features may one day enable pleurobot to help in search and rescue operations
' on the other hand , salamanders are a good living analog for the first tetrapods that made the transition from water to land
' in the future , we plan to use pleurobot 's design methodology to bring early tetrapods to " life "
' its engineers say that because it is able to cope with a range of different terrain and squeeze through relatively small spaces , the robot ( pictured ) could be used to help search for people trapped in disaster zones salamanders are remarkable creatures capable of regenerating limbs and researchers at ucl ( ucl ) recently identified the biological pathway involved
called erk ( extracellular signal - regulated kinases ) , the pathway must be constantly active for salamander cells to regenerate - a process not seen in the same way in other mammals
although a long way from achieving the same feat in humans , the discovery could help researchers unlock the â regenerative potential â of cells across other animals
scientists behind the robot , which has 27 movable joints , believe it could be used to help palaeontolgists understand how extinct animals like the dinosaurs moved
