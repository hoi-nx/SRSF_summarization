talk about making an entrance
the teams were out for the second half , the spectators were seated and the referees were ready to get going but there was one problem : two players were missing
so anfield waited patiently , expectantly and then they got what they wanted : emerging from the tunnel , wearing no 7 and no 9 , came suarez and torres , two of this stadium âs most revered former sons
this was an afternoon for nostalgia , a chance for liverpudlians to embrace the past and pay homage to some returning heroes and they grabbed their chance when suarez and torres took to the field for this all - star charity match , between teams captained by gerrard and carragher

manager : brendan rodgers carragher 's xi : reina ( gulacsi 61 ) , flanagan ( moreno 32 ) , carragher , martin kelly , arbeloa ( clichy 46 ) , lucas ( maguire 72 ) , shelvey ( noone 46 ) , harry kewell ( borini 46 ) , downing ( bellamy 46 ) , didier drogba ( garcia 46 ) , mario balotelli ( brannagan 46 )
manager : roy evans attendance : 44,903 torres , who was sold to chelsea for Â£ 50million two days after suarez joined liverpool in january 2011 , had admitted to being unsure what kind of reception he would receive , given the circumstances in which he had left
there was also the fact that his last touch on this ground came on april 27 last year , when he slipped the ball past the stranded simon mignolet to willian
the upshot , of course , was the brazilian scoring and chelsea blowing a hole in liverpool âs title challenge
he need not have worried
his name was cheered before the game , he was hailed on to the pitch and his was the first name sung in the second half of a â contest â that should see local charities benefit to the tune of more than Â£ 1m
it was nât just about torres , though
this was an opportunity for many big names from liverpool âs past to say proper goodbyes , for men like alonso , reina , suarez , jon arne riise and the non-playing kuyt to bring closure to certain chapters in their respective careers
alonso , for one , had waited six years for this
he could have had a reunion last october with real madrid in the champions league but he had been sold to bayern munich two months before
alonso found out about the emotional draw moments after completing his medical in germany
he , clearly , enjoyed the 30 minutes he was on the pitch , as did everyone else involved in the game , which came from an idea gerrard had to say thank you to liverpool as a city before he starts his new venture in los angeles
didier drogba puts an arm around west ham united midfielder kevin nolan as stars from across gerrard and carragher 's careers came out to play harry kewell plays a pass with his left foot as chelsea captain terry and liverpool captain gerrard , playing on the same team , watch on mario balotelli opened the scoring at anfield after just eight minutes , getting ahead of opposition captain gerrard to slam in a long - range shot carragher and his sky sports colleague thierry henry share a laugh and a high five after the former defender thwarts his friend 's chance didier drogba doubled the lead after deceiving goalkeeper brad jones with a step - over and then coolly finishing into the empty net at the the kop end chelsea 's ivorian centre forward has scored 11 goals against liverpool during his long career so it was no surprise to see him score at anfield take terry and didier drogba
for so long these two chelsea stalwarts have been regarded as the enemy but both were given generous receptions for helping the cause , particularly didier drogba when he scored the second goal of the game for carragher âs team on 31 minutes
the first had been scored by mario balotelli and a cracker it was too , the italian whipping a 25 - yard drive that fizzed into the corner of the kop net on nine minutes
he was nât put under great pressure but the finish still smacked of class
at one stage it looked as if carragher âs side , managed by roy evans , would saunter to victory but gerrard has made comebacks a fixture of his liverpool career and he ensured this match did not end in defeat
he scored two penalties , one in the 36th minute after martin kelly had adjudged to trip jerome sinclair and another just after the hour when carragher quite clearly barged suarez over
some would say the sportsmail columnist was lucky not to make it into lee probert âs book
the icing on the cake would have been a goal for either torres or suarez but , despite the best efforts of the uruguayan in particular , it never arrived
a draw was an appropriate end to a memorable day
the smiles on the faces as a lap of honour was completed confirmed that
mario balotelli and didier drogba share an embrace after their goals gave carragher 's xi the lead from early on in the charity game bayern munich midfielder alonso leaves the field at anfield to a warm ovation and an embrace with liverpool manager brendan rodgers jerome sinclair was brought down by martin kelly inside the carragher xi penalty area to give gerrard the chance to pull a goal back reina does his best to put his old team - mate off ahead of his attempt from the spot , but the jibes were all good - natured between the pair gerrard was obviously not phased by reina 's antics , and he sent the spanish keeper the wrong way from the spot , shooting to his left two former liverpool strikers entered the field as half - time substitutes , with suarez and torres both returning to anfield torres holds off the challenge of current liverpool midfielder lucas as he got back into the experience of playing on merseyside gerrard tucks away his second penalty of the afternoon to level the scores for his team after they came from two goals behind afterwards gerrard told lfc tv : ' it has been absolute brilliant , more than anything the charities have done well with a full house
' the hairs on my neck were standing up
there were times i did n't know who to pass to
people have gone out of their way to come here
' it has been absolutely magical
every player who was asked to come here did , whether they had to drive for an hour or get three flights
