mark noble is refusing to give up on his dream of breaking into the england squad ahead of the european championship finals despite being overlooked once again by roy hodgson
mark noble has been one of the star performers since hammers gained promotion back into the premier league back in 2012
the 27 - year - old has represented england at every level from the under 16s to the under and was even made captain of the under 21s team for the euro finals in 2009
but he has somehow failed to catch the attention of roy hodgson who even called up tottenham 's inexperienced midfielder ryan mason ahead of him for the forthcoming games against lithuania and italy when adam lallana was forced to pull out of the squad with a groin injury
mark noble ( right ) , winston reid ( centre ) and diafra sakho pose outside hammers 's future home the hammers will be moving to the olympic stadium in london next summer however , mark noble says he will not sulk over the matter and will continue to show his best form for hammers as he looks to help the club push for a european place as they prepare to move into the olympic stadium next summer
mark noble said : â i have made it clear what i think about the situation and i would love to play for my country
but obviously at the moment it does n't look like it is going to happen
â i will keep playing as well as i can at hammers and enjoying it every week
you never know what will happen in the future
roy hodgson takes charge of england training , having overlooked mark noble for the squad yet again tottenham midfielder ryan mason ( second left ) was a late call up in the position played by mark noble â when we move to the olympic stadium we have to be thinking about european football because of the gate receipts and the money coming into the club and hopefully we will be able to invest in better players
we invested really well last summer and that has shown this season
â mark noble hopes he will given a better chance of an england call - up following the proposals by fa chairman greg dyke this week to limit the number of non-eu players playing in this country
kane has come through the tottenham youth system and only made a name for himself in the top flight back in november , but has already been rewarded for his outstanding season with his first call - up into the england squad this week
mark noble has been one of the standout performers since hammers returned to the top flight in 2012 the 27 - year - old has represented england at every age level from the under 16s to under 21s mark noble feels a number of other home - grown players could now follow kane into the senior squad if they are given the chance to play on a regular basis
when asked about greg dyke 's proposals , mark noble added : â i think that is great
when i came through into the league i was played at 17
you do n't get that a lot now with players coming through the academies
â if you do that you have to be very special because of the foreign players coming in
we have got the best league in the world and we want to keep it like that , but it will be nice to see some of our homegrown boys given a chance
