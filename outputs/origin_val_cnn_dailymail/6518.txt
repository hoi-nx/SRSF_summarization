need some help and inspiration deciding who to back at cheltenham ? sportsmail 's peter scudamore and townend reveal their favourites while a group of racing enthusiast celebrities have also shared their tips for the festival on day two
peter scudamore - eight - time champion jockey and rider of 13 festival winners beast of burden ( neptune investment novices â hurdle , 1.30 ) this rebecca curtis - trained contender has long been on my radar and looks a horse of massive potential
beaten over a shorter distance at newbury over christmas â his hurdling debut â but has won his other three races this season with great authority
best odds : 12 - 1 beast of burden winning the hurdle race at bangor - on - dee races on february 6 don poli ( chase , 2.05 ) one of the irish hotpots of the week and looks a future gold cup contender
won the martin pipe conditional novices â handicap hurdle at last year âs meeting and has won his two races as a novice chaser
the most recent of those was his authoritative three - length defeat of the highly - rated apache stronghold in the grade one topaz novices â chase at leopardstown over christmas
best odds : 6 - 4 don poli , ridden by jockey mikey fogarty , winning the conditional jockeys ' handicap hurdle last year racemail tipsters got off to a stunning start on the opening day
robin goodfellow ( turner ) and captain heath ( townend ) napped 8 - 1 national hunt chase winner cause of causes , while townend also landed his next best bet ( the druids nephew 8 - 1 ) to complete an 80 - 1 double
turner also picked winners douvan ( 2 - 1 ) , un de sceaux ( 4 - 6 ) and champion hurdle winner faugheen ( 4 - 5 ) , while peter scudamore went for the first two willie mullins â winners
baradari ( coral cup , 2.40 ) rated by jockey aidan coleman ( above ) as one of his best chances of the meeting
his boss venetia williams has to be respected here and this contender looks like he still could be a touch in front of the handicapper
best odds : 16 - 1 sire de grugy ( queen mother champion chase , 3.20 ) usually two quick runs might be a negative with the chance they have knocked the competitive edge of horse but gary moore âs reigning champion thrives on racing and there are very positive reports emanating from his sussex stable as he prepares to defend his crown
he looks to have put his injury problems behind him judging by his last time out chepstow win
punters looking for a longer - priced each - way option should consider simply ned
best odds : 3 - 1 baradari ( right ) on the way to winning the keltbray holloway 's hurdle race at ascot on january 17 , 2015 marcus townend - on the best each - way bets baradari ( coral cup , 2.40 ) staying on really strongly when fifth in last year âs shorter fred winter juvenile handicap hurdle and was on the mark over two miles three furlongs at ascot in december
that form has worked out well
this stiffer test looks likely to elicit even more improvement and he looks one of venetia williams â best chances of the week
she won this in 2005 with idole first
best odds : 16 - 1 souriyan ( fred winter juvenile handicap hurdle , 4.40 ) lambourn trainer jamie snowden was successful on the opening day of last year âs meeting with present view and , although that injured gelding has unfortunately not made it back the time , this stablemate looks a lively outsider
has won only one of his three hurdle races but his two defeats should not be held against him , especially last time out on bottomless ground at ffos las
best odds : 25 - 1 modus ridden by tom o'brien winning the ebf junior ' standard open nh flat race at cheltenham last year modus ( weatherbys champion bumper , 5.15 ) eighth in this race last year and purposely saved for another crack at the prize by his welsh trainer robert stephens
he reckons his contender is a much stronger more mature performer now so he can give the irish , who dominate this race , a run for their money
best odds : 25 - 1 and the celebs ... here âs who the celebs are backing in the queen mother champion chase
