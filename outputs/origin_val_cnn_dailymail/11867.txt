almost 50 years ago , nasa launched two men into space in the same spacecraft for the first time - a milestone for america human spaceflight
but the groundbreaking mission is nât necessarily remembered for this feat. two hours into the mission , one of the pilots pulled out a contraband corned beef sandwich which sparked a controversial incident that was debated all the way to us congress
the gemini 3 mission of 23 march 1965 , america 's first two - man spaceflight , was shrouded in controversy when astronaut young snuck a corned beef sandwich on board
the sandwich is shown here embedded in acrylic and is exhibited at the grissom memorial museum in mitchell , indiana the incident was explained by robert pearlman at collectspace , on spaceflight missions , the items astronauts are allowed to take with them are extremely restricted
and in the sixties , at the dawn of the space age , restrictions were more enforced than ever as nasa wanted to ensure each risky mission passed without a hitch
the gemini programme was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the apollo missions
the first crewed gemini flight , gemini 3 , lifted off launch pad 19 at cape canaveral in florida on march 23 , 1965
the spacecraft , nicknamed molly brown , carried astronauts virgil ' grissom , command pilot , and john w. young , pilot , on three orbits of earth
nasa 's two - man gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule 's orbit , remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft
they also pioneered rendezvous and docking with other spacecraft
all were essential skills to land on the moon and return safely to earth
gemini 3 's primary goal was to test the new , manoeuverable gemini spacecraft
in space , the crew members fired thrusters to change the shape of their orbit , shift their orbital plane slightly , and drop to a lower altitude
this paved the way to the manoeuvres needed for the success of the apollo missions
so when astronaut young pulled out a sandwich from his spacesuit , two hours after launching from cape canaveral in florida , mission controllers were understandably perturbed
â where did that come from ? â co-astronaut gus grissom asked young when he produced the previously hidden item , in a bizarre exchange you can read in nasa âs transcript of the mission
â i brought it with me
let âs see how it tastes
smells , does nât it ? â young replied
he had been given the contrabrand from fellow astronaut wally schirra , who was known for his pranks within the agency
but the stunt , although amusing , could have had serious consequences
space food was typically prepared in liquid or cube form to prevent crumbs spilling out and potentially getting stuck in a key piece of equipment
the sandwich though , having not been vetted for launch , quickly began to break apart , which would later earn the astronauts a severe reprimand
â it âs breaking up
i âm going to stick it in my pocket , â said grissom
â is it ? it was a thought , anyway , â replied young
â not a very good one , â said grissom
the rest of the almost five - hour mission passed without incident and the astronauts were treated to stunning views as they orbited earth
â that âs beautiful ! â exclaimed young , looking out a window
but on their return to earth , the astronauts soon found that not everyone had seen the funny side of their exchange in orbit
pictured here in their spacesuits are virgil ' grissom ( left ) and john w. young , seen with the portable suit air conditioners connected and their helmets on
young would go on to be one of nasa 's most decorated astronauts , but grissom died in the apollo 1 launchpad fire on 27 january 1967 young had been given the contrabrand from fellow astronaut wally schirra , who was known for his pranks within the agency , and put it inside his spacesuit on the way to the launchpad , seen here

the spacecraft was incredibly cramped , seen in a simulator on the right ( young is left , grissom right ) , and thus the movements and actions of the astronauts inside were severely restricted the major fear of having crumbs in a spacecraft was that they could get stuck in various controls , something that featured in the 15th episode of the fifth season of the simpsons , deep space homer , when homer opened and spilled a bag of crisps in space ( shown ) â my thought is that ... to have one of the astronauts slip a sandwich aboard the vehicle , frankly , is just a little bit disgusting , â representative george shipley of illinois later said to nasa administrators in houston
â we have taken steps ... to prevent recurrence of corned beef sandwiches in future flights , â replied george mueller , associate administrator for manned spaceflight
despite the incident , the astronauts were not prohibited from flying again
here 's some we made earlier : shown is the official food taken into space on the gemini 3 mission , including dehydrated beef pot roast , bacon and egg bites , toasted bread cubes , orange juice and a wet wipe

navy swimmers stand on the spacecraft 's flotation collar waiting to hook a hoist line to the spacecraft indeed , young would became one of nasa âs most decorated astronauts , flying on the subsequent gemini 10 and apollo 10 missions , and also setting foot on the moon on apollo 16
he was also part of the inaugural space shuttle mission - sts-1 in 1981 - which amusingly was the first time nasa allowed corned beef on a flight - before his sixth and final mission , sts-9 , in 1983
sadly , gus grissom âs next mission was apollo 1 , designed to be a low - earth orbit test of the apollo command and service module
in a routine test on 27 january 1967 , the capsule caught fire , killing all three crew members - gus grissom , ed white and roger chaffee - inside the module .
