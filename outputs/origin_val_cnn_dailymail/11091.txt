the final scoreline suggested otherwise
yet for strachan there were spells of a 6 - 1 thrashing of gibraltar which felt like a form of misery
as rain and wind swirled around the national stadium the scots endured an unexpectedly jittery , uncomfortable first half
gibraltar , a british overseas territory of 30,000 residents rejected by fifa and playing in their first uefa qualification campaign , reacted to shaun maloney 's opening penalty by equalising within 60 seconds
it was their first ever goal in a competitive international
strachan praised the performance of gibraltar after scotland beat them 6 - 1 on sunday casciaro ( second right ) scored gibraltar 's first international goal 72 seconds after scotland went ahead casciaro 's goal sparked jubilant celebrations from gibraltar 's players as hampden park was stunned ' i have to say that all the credit should really go to gibraltar , ' said strachan afterwards
' they made my life a misery for periods of that game
they made it a long game for me as a coach , so well done to them
' but also well done to my players because there were players out there who personally were n't having a great game but they stuck at it
' we had some good chances and never took them
it was nice to see fletcher score a hat - trick i thought he was one of our better players today
' of late fletcher has been the subject of unwelcome headlines
pictured posing beside a Â£ 200,000 lamborgini shortly after sunderland had lost 4 - 0 to aston villa the striker had managed just four goals all season
at international level his last strike was in a 2 - 1 win over iceland in april 2009
' some of his touches were lovely today , ' said strachan
' i was wanting more balls in the first half played through but shaun maloney , fletcher , steven naismith were marked and wanted balls played through
' we played square too many times because they were ready for it and wanted it
' we have people who can turn so i was a wee bit disappointed with that as well
striker fletcher ( right ) led scotland to victory against gibraltar with a hat - trick fletcher was recently mocked on twitter for buying a lamborghini after inconsistent form for sunderland fletcher is the first scotland player to score three goals in a game since colin stein in 1969 ' to be fair the conditions were not great either
' it was swirling out there
robertson and ikechi anya had problems with the swirling wind in the first half
' robertson , the young hull full - back was dragged out of position when gibraltar ' s lee casciano wrote himself into the annals in the 19th minute
opting to play with a three - man defence â with just russell martin at the centre - strachan admitted the system had worked less well than he anticipated
' it did get us four goals , but i was expecting that system to work a lot better than that but the goal sort of threw us a bit
within any system you are hoping your players will play to a level but in the first ten minutes we gave the ball away eight or nine times , that 's too much at international level no matter who you are against
' the campaign comes down now to ireland in dublin on june 13 , a huge game in every sense
win at the aviva and a play - off place â at least â becomes more likely than not
' after five games and performances i am delighted with we are here and we have ten points , i think we are all happy with that
we can go into the second half of this group feeling quite good about ourselves
' i look back at the performances and i think four so far have been terrific
' this was not one of our best but we got through
' we scored six goals and if we had woken up this morning and said we would score six we would have settled for that
' i would n't have wanted the one against us , but that 's the way football works some times
' so it 's been a good old day for everybody today
' gibraltar got their first goal and unfortunately david marshall will always be that name now who is the subject of quiz questions everywhere
' scotland boss strachan ( right ) said he is delighted with 10 points from their first five qualifying games shaun maloney scored two penalties for scotland against gibraltar at hampden park on sunday everton striker steven naismith ( right ) was also on the scoresheet in a big win for scotland despite the scoreline interm gibraltar coach wilson can point to the goal his side scored as evidence of improvement
they host scotland in the algarve in the final round of fixtures and wilson says : ' as a scotsman , it 's a horrible thought - but we might just be the ones who get the result that spoils my country 's party
' they come to us in the last game and although i 'm not naive enough to say we ' ll beat them , if scotland are under pressure to get a result , who knows ? '
