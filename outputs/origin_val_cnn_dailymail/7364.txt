what will it take for arsenal fans to really love giroud ? yes , he is appreciated by the home faithful at the emirates but not to the same degree as other top strikers
aguero , costa and kane are worshipped at their clubs
but with similar goal - scoring exploits this season , giroud does nât get anywhere near the same level of affection from his fans or the rest of the football world
he is valued as a player but not unconditionally loved
he deserves much more credit
of the strikers mentioned , only aguero has a better minutes per goal rate in all competitions this season than giroud , who is a good link man and an important source of goals for arsenal
giroud has scored 11 premier league goals - and 15 in all competitions - during an injury - hit season giroud rounds monaco keeper danijel subasic during arsenal 's win in the champions league the frenchman slots home past brad guzan during arsenal 's 5 - 0 rout of aston villa he started the season in fine form and then was unlucky with injury but he hit the ground running as soon as he returned
after his performance in the champions league first leg against monaco , everyone rushed to criticise and dissect his game
if costa or aguero have a bad game , there is no discussion
with giroud it is as if he always has to play well to win people over
he âs never allowed an off - day
what has been impressive is the way he has bounced back mentally from that , scoring in four of his last five games
the only match in which he did nât score was against manchester united in the fa cup , when he started on the bench
the circumstances of his arrival are part of the problem for giroud
arsenal fans have been fed a diet of pace and movement ever since wenger arrived
from marc overmars and nicolas anelka to thierry henry and robin van persie , wenger âs forwards have always been about great mobility and raw speed
aguero won manchester city the title in 2012 and the argentine is worshipped by the club 's fans kane has burst onto the scene this season and is already adored by the tottenham faithful costa hit the ground running in england and has become a terrace hero amongst chelsea fans giroud is not as quick or graceful across the turf but he was bought as a replacement for van persie
he is an entirely different type of player , so that he has shaken off any unfair comparisons with the dutchman is to his credit
it âs also interesting that danny welbeck and alexis sanchez were signed almost as giroud âs replacements but the frenchman is still the go - to man in the middle
his involvement shows how wenger âs philosophy has almost come full circle
when he arrived he sold hartson and instead opted for pacy forwards
now he has reverted to giroud , who is in a similar mould â there âs not a great deal of difference between a welsh battering ram and a frenchman one
not to say they are one - dimensional players , far from it
hartson was technically sound , a giant in the air and provided a different attacking dimension
but wenger now seems to want physicality back at the top of the side
that means the team have had to play in a different way , though that is not a bad thing
giroud âs link - up play is exceptional and arsenal use him like a backboard , holding up play and waiting for others to run from deep and join the attack and he has been at the heart of many of arsenal âs best team goals
after robin van persie 's departure to manchester united , giroud was purchased to replace him alexis sanchez was signed to replace giroud , but the frenchman continues to keep his place danny welbeck has also been unable to dislodge the totemic striker from his role in the middle although he does not have the same movement as previous arsenal greats , he is versatile and wholehearted , and that has endeared him to most of the fans
it goes without saying how powerful he is in the air and that has opened up a route to goal that has been for so long ignored by wenger
wenger has an outstanding track record of improving strikers â i witnessed how he transformed emmanuel adebayor â and he is doing the same with giroud
his only focus is on what players can do
and you can see in giroud the benefits of having a manager who believes in you
giroud has talked about playing out of his comfort zone to try to improve
he has done that and hopefully arsenal fans will come to love him more
but ultimately for any striker , it should nât matter what you look like or how you play , as long as you offer goals
luckily for giroud , he does just that .
