a real - life paddington bear who suffered such brutal treatment in a circus that she lost her claws , teeth and most of her fur is looking for a new home â with the support of the creator of her marmalade - loving fictional relative
the bear , called cholita , was in a â deplorable condition â when she was rescued from a circus in peru last week by london - based animal defenders international ( animal defenders international )
the group is now appealing for funds to fly her to a sanctuary in the united states
last night michael bond , the author of the bestselling children âs books , gave his endorsement to the campaign to transport her to the united states
he said : â bears , especially from peru , obviously have a special place in my life
â it is such a horrendous story
i very much hope that , with the charity âs help , cholita will get the care she needs to recover
â last night michael bond , the author of the bestselling children âs books , gave his endorsement to the campaign to transport her to the united states a heart - breaking video released by animal defenders international shows the bear in a government zoo with barely any of her thick black body hair left , the result of stress she suffered at the circus
the group said that she had been crammed in a box just 5ft by 5ft in the circus , while her fingers were cut down to stumps and her teeth deliberately shattered so she could not defend herself
the organisation 's president jan creamer said : â her butchered paws , broken teeth and hairless body illustrate more than any words possibly can the terrible suffering poor cholita endured in the circus
â she would have spent years there confined , likely chained , and forced to perform tricks for the audience
â the group 's raid near piura in northern peru last week was one of a number across south america
it is now planning to get cholita on to a flight taking 33 rescued circus lions from peru to a new life in colorado next month , the biggest airlift of its kind ever undertaken
but it urgently needs hundreds of thousands of pounds to pay for the flight and provide cholita with medical care
