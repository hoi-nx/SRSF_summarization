a nasa mission designed to study the interaction of earth 's magnetic field and the sun launched this morning at 2:44am gmt ( last night at 10:44pm edt )
the magnetospheric multiscale ( mms ) mission will use four identical spacecraft to measure a mysterious process known as magnetic reconnection
by orbiting earth , the spacecraft will seek to understand how energy from the sun is funnelled in to the environment of not only our own but other planets , causing space weather such as aurorae
the spacecraft were launched on a united launch alliance atlas v 421 rocket from cape canaveral air force station in florida
after reaching orbit , each spacecraft deployed from the upper stage of the rocket in five - minute increments
' i am speaking for the entire mms team when i say we 're thrilled to see all four of our spacecraft have deployed and data indicates we have a healthy fleet , ' said craig tooley , project manager at nasa 's goddard space flight center in greenbelt , maryland
magnetic reconnection occurs wherever charged gases , called plasma , are present
it 's rare on earth , but plasma makes up 99 per cent of the visible universe , fueling stars and filling the near - vacuum of space
this plasma contains magnetic fields that affects the way charged particles it encounters move
under normal conditions , the magnetic field lines inside plasmas do n't break or merge with other field lines
but sometimes , as field lines get close to each other , the entire pattern changes and everything realign into a new configuration
the amount of energy released can be formidable
magnetic reconnection taps into the stored energy of the magnetic field , converting it into heat and kinetic energy that sends particles streaming out along the field lines
the mms mission will help scientsits understand how this process is taking place in the environment around earth
this could teach us more about geomagnetic storms and aurorae on our planet , and also help us understand similar processes taking place in the rest of the solar system and beyond
over the following weeks , nasa scientists and engineers will deploy several complex booms and antennae on the spacecraft , and test all their instruments
the core of each spacecraft is about four feet ( 1.2 metres ) tall and 11 feet ( 3.4 metres ) wide , although with all of their booms and antennae deployed , they grow to 369 by 94ft ( 29 by 112 metres )
the four will then be placed in a pyramid formation , separated by distances of 6.2 to 62 miles ( 10 to 100km ) , in preparation for science observations that are scheduled to begin in early september
they will fly around earth in an elliptical orbit , travelling through two regions where magnetic reconnection is thought to be occurring
one of these is the side of earth nearest the sun , where plasma from the sun interacts with earth 's magnetosphere
this interaction transfers energy from the sun to earth 's environment , creating ' magnetic explosions ' when the magnetic field lines connect
the process of magnetic reconnection can release bursts of energy that are as powerful as billions of megatons of tnt , which send particles surging through space at the speed of light
on earth , we can see the effects of this in the aurora at the poles , but it can also be dangerous to satellites and cause problems for communications
at the other side of earth , away from the sun , the spacecraft will pass through a region where earth 's magnetic field lines combine , and produce a similar effect
after reaching orbit , each spacecraft deployed from the upper stage of the rocket in five - minute increments
they were stacked together for the launch ( illustrated ) the spacecraft will fly around earth in an elliptical orbit , travelling through two regions where magnetic reconnection is thought to be occurring
one of these is the side of earth nearest the sun , where plasma from the sun interacts with earth 's magnetosphere the process of magnetic reconnection can release bursts of energy ( illustrated ) that are as powerful as billions of megatons of tnt , which send particles surging through space at the speed of light
on earth , we can see the effects of this in the aurora at the poles magnetic reconnection can harm satellites ( illustrated ) and affect communications , so scientists are keen to understand more about the phenomenon the spacecraft will sturdy the former phenomenon for one and a half years , while the following science phase will focus on the latter phenomenon
' after a decade of planning and engineering , the science team is ready to go to work , ' said jim burch , principal investigator for the mms instrument suite science team at the swri in san antonio ( swri )
' we 've never had this type of opportunity to study this fundamental process in such detail
' the mission will provide the first three - dimensional views of reconnection occurring in earth 's magnetic space environment
but aside from providing more information about our own planet , scientists will use the data to work out how the sun affects other planets , and also how the process takes place in other stars

scientists will use the data to also work out how the sun affects other planets , and also how the process takes place in other stars the data could also provide information on how magnetic reconnection occurs near black holes and neutron stars , and also at the edge of the solar system at the boundary of our sun 's influence and interstellar space
' mms is a crucial next step in advancing the science of magnetic reconnection â and no mission has ever observed this fundamental process with such detail , ' said jeff newmark , interim director for nasa 's heliophysics division at the agency 's headquarters in washington
' the depth and detail of our knowledge is going to grow by leaps and bounds , in ways that no one can yet predict
