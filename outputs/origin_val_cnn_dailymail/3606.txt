ronald menzel , director of freedom , said the organisation filmed yesterday 's bird flight in an attempt to draw more attention to eagle conservation
he told the bbc : ' [ this ] represents a historic opportunity for conservation â through these incredible images we are bringing this important cause to the attention of people all across the world
' in the clip , which lasts nearly two minutes , the bird takes off from the tower and soars over dubai , allowing the camera to record stunning aerial views
the camera - a sony action cam mini - weighed approximately 300g , which is about 10 per cent of the bird 's weight
upon landing on the arm of its trainer , mr olivier travers could be seen punching the air with joy before describing the flight as ' perfect '
he said : ' this was an incredible challenge and the most difficult of my career
' not only is this the highest vertical flight that has ever been done , but the eagle also had to fly in a totally different environment , with strong wind disturbances caused by the skyscrapers
' this flight will create huge possibilities for future conservation programs
freedom , organisers of the bird flight , prepare by bringing the bird up to the top of the tower darshan the eagle prepares to take off from one of the freedom team and depart downwards the bird of prey can be seen perched upon the top of dubai 's burj khalifa ( right ) as its trainer jacques-olivier travers waits patiently at the bottom of the world 's tallest building ( left ) for his beloved bird to return to him mr olivier travers , who became passionate about birds of prey when he was 12 - years - old , waits for darshan to land darshan the eagle swoops down and successfully lands on the arm of its owner , france falconer mr olivier travers mr olivier travers punches the air with joy after darshan lands on his arm after the 2722ft flight from the tower ' training and equipping birds of prey with these small cameras will allow us to understand exactly what a bird does when it is released into the wild , and will ultimately help our effort to restore endangered bird populations
' mr olivier travers developed his passion for birds at the age of 12 , after being given small chicks from a nest
he began training darshan after selecting him from a breeding facility in thonon , france
last year , he completed several successful big flights with his bird of prey including one from the golden gallery at st paul 's cathedral to the base of london 's famous tower bridge
during the flight over central london in november last year , the eagle captured breath - taking footage of the capital and the river thames with a high - spec camera mounted on its back
at the time , mr olivier travers said : ' i like to bring the birds where they are not expected
for many years , i have taught the birds to fly in nature using a paraglider
' jacques - olivier travers ( pictured with darshan after the incredible flight ) described the attempt as ' perfect ' views of dubai captured by the imperial eagle will be used by the freedom team to raise awareness of birds the entire project was carried out by freedom to try and raise awareness of birds of prey and extinction darshan the eagle has previously soared from the top of st paul 's cathedral 's in london and the eiffel tower in france in another impressive flight just a month earlier , darshan soared from the top of the 206 - metre observation deck of the eiffel tower in paris , france
the bird was released from the inconic structure by its handler , before flying over the river seine and down into the trocadã©ro gardens at 111 miles per hour
darshan is a white imperial eagle , a bird which was once on the red list of endangered species but has since been saved from extinction .
