he had gone on daytime television to try to win over the women voters he struggles to appeal to
farage had even been given a list of â women - friendly â policies to show how he could cater to the audience of loose women
then he went and said it was a â fact of life â that women will earn less than men when they return to some jobs after childbirth
he told the itv daytime panel show : â if you âre a doctor , a lawyer , a researcher , you âre a woman , you have a baby , you take six months or a year off
you are not disadvantaged at all in that job
â but there are other jobs in which if you take six months off and come back you find yourself behind the rest of the pack and earning less money
that is a fact of life
it âs difficult to change that
â labour âs business spokesman stella creasy was one of those who objected to the comment
she wrote on twitter : â sorry , @ nigel_farage said what ? ! just a fact of life is it women earn less after kids ? no it âs an injustice and we can change it
â linda robson : ' i do n't really know much about politics but can you tell me why you 've been voted the most hated man in britain ? ' mr farage : ' that 's quite a compliment is n't it ' jane moore asked him why he had dropped his immigration cap
she said he was a ' bit flip - floppy '
mr farage : ' the cap is a nonsense
' asked about his drinking , mr farage said : ' i only spend five or six hours a day in the pub , that 's all i do
i ca n't see what all the fuss is about
' nadia sawalha told him : ' if i was your wife i would be giving you a bad telling off for that , what does your wife think ? ' before his appearance , mr farage was shown outside the studio sipping from a loose women mug while smoking a cigarette
he joked that he felt like he was going into the lion âs den and begged the presenters to have mercy on him
actress linda robson , one of the show âs panellists , asked mr farage why he had been voted â the most hated man in britain â
he began replying : â if you look at the political class we âve got , by which i mean the people that go to the same handful of schools , all go to oxford , all do the same degree ... â he was then challenged with the comment : â well you âre one of them
you went to public school , â but mr farage went on : â you look at these political figures , they are all like cardboard cut - outs
they are all playing safe , they are all scared of the media
i âm not , i âm a bit like marmite
people either like me or do nât like me
â he said all politicians are fundamentally â selfish â and neglect their families
he said : â the other three big leaders are very good at coming on programmes like this and saying what wonderful family men they are , how they do the school run and when the babies were little they changed all the nappies and did the night feeds
all i can say is , it âs pretty much impossible to do that
â during the 10 - minute showdown on daytime tv , mr farage was tackled over ' flip - flopping ' on immigration , his private education , his unhealthy lifestyle and his admission that he would be a poor prime minister linda robson asked him : ' when do you get to spend time with your wife and you children ? ' loose women pannelists andrea mclean and jane moore grilled mr farage about his policies and lifestyle nadia sawalha told mr farage should would not put up with his drinking if she was his wife farage was also challenged about whether he has any ' guilt ' about being seen as a beer - swilling , chain - smoking figure his comments came after his second wife , kirsten , last week told the daily mail she felt like a single mother because he is never home
when challenged about whether he has any guilt about being seen as a beer - swilling , chain - smoking figure , he joked : â i only spend five or six hours a day in the pub , that âs all i do
â but nadia sawalha , who was another panellist along with andrea mclean and jane moore , told him : â if i was your wife i would be giving you a bad telling off for that
â he responded : â i get up at five oâclock in the morning , i âm rarely home before midnight
i think at lunchtime i deserve a sherbet
â on his way to the studio mr farage was photographed with a sheet of paper with the heading â women - friendly policies â
the briefing note included , â remove 5 per cent vat from sanitary products â , along with previously announced policies such as extra nhs staff
mr farage did not talk about the policy on the programme

i ca n't see what all the fuss is about

' i get up at five o'clock in the morning , i 'm rarely home before midnight
i think at lunchtime i deserve a sherbet
