' despite working out ' hard ' and following a healthy diet plan , mr diaz knew that the only way he would be able to get rid of his excess skin would be with surgery

' plus - sized , un-retouched models are getting more attention in major brands ... it 's becoming clear that these negative ideas are not going to last , though it 's going to take a while
' yesterday , mr diaz uploaded another ( clothed ) video to thank people for their donations
' you have shown me so much kindness and now i have so much more faith in people , ' he said , promising to document the skin - removal surgery with his fans when he undergoes it .
