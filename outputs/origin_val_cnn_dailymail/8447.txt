england may be pondering a recall for jonathan trott but yorkshire openers lyth and alex lees are ready and waiting to answer the call should selectors opt for new blood in the west indies
england play three tests in the caribbean next month , where they will hope to shake off the ignominy of their woeful cricket world cup campaign
the identity of captain alastair cook 's batting partner is likely to be one of the most vexed questions during selection meetings this week , with incumbent sam robson on shaky ground and jonathan trott reportedly being considered for the first time since departing the 2013/14 ashes with a stress - related condition
jonathan trott is reportedly being considered for an england recall ahead of west indies tour yorkshire batsmen lyth ( left ) and alex lees are ready and willing to provide top order cover he made his name as a no 3 but with another yorkshire batsman , gary ballance , having made that slot his own , jonathan trott is being considered for a promotion
even if the 33 - year - old travels , england may be tempted to take top - order cover and the title - winning pairing are first in line
lyth was the top scorer in division one of the lv = county championship last summer , making 1489 runs and scoring six centuries , while 21 - year - old alex lees made 971 runs is rated as one of the country 's brightest prospects
' i feel like i 've had a good winter with lions and hopefully i get the telephone call which i think i thoroughly deserve , ' lyth told sportsmail
' i 'm looking forward to what might come for me
you can see how many people in recent years have gone on from playing lions cricket to representing england and hopefully i can be the next one
alex lees and lyth were instrumental in winning the lv = county championship with yorkshire last year jonathan trott has not been selected by england since departing the 2013/14 ashes with a stress related condition ' if that 's not the case all i can do is keep scoring runs for yorkshire
' lyth and alex lees are an unusual study in partners as rivals - as well as batting together throughout the county season they also played for the lions in south africa over the winter
even now they are leading rival yorkshire teams in an inter-club friendly in abu dhabi , but their relationship remains strong
' of course i get on really well with alex lees and if he gets the nod i 'll give him a pat on the back and say well done , but i obviously hope it 's me , ' added lyth
captain eoin morgan faces the press after england 's disastrous exit from the cricket world cup england vice captain jos buttler looks dejected as he leaves the field following defeat by bangladesh alex lees is aware of the interest he has attracted as a stylish young opener , but is attempting to remain on an even keel as speculation over a test call builds
' i know i 've had a good 18 months or so but i 've got to keep knocking on the door and getting those runs , ' he told pa
' personally the talk does n't affect me , positive or negative , because people are always going to have their opinion on you and you just have to focus on your game
' there is a spot with england and there 's a few players in the mix. i think there will be an opportunity for somebody this year
' it 's quite refreshing that both me and lythy are in the mix , we can really push each other on to be our best
' that 's good for us and hopefully it 's good for yorkshire
