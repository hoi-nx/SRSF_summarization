he may be king of the jungle but these hilarious photographs show he would be lion if he said he was in charge of this relationship
the astonishing pictures show humans are not the only couples capable of having lover 's tiffs with this lion pair having a particularly vicious - looking argument
the lion was busy trying to show off his alpha male credentials by baring his teeth in an attempt to attract the female but she appeared to take offence , lashing out with her sharp claws and swiping at his face
lunge : this is the moment lioness shows just how annoyed she is with her other half , who sits there without reacting to her bite what did i say ? the lioness launches towards the astonished male who just stands there and braves the ferocious attack fearsome : the situation seems to escalate when she takes a swipe at him while continuing to growl and show her teeth to the poor male take that : the lioness is inches away as she takes a swipe at the beleaguered male who takes a step back to avoid her swing grin and bear it : the male lion just stands there as the lioness gets whatever is upsetting her off her chest at the masai mara national reserve in kenya keen snapper mei , 53 , captured the human - like moment on a trip to the masai mara national reserve in kenya last month
mr mei , from rome , italy , said : ' i was surprised at the scene and their behaviour
it really looked like human expressions - although maybe towards the end of a relationship not at the beginning
' the expressions of the male were funny and i struggled not to laugh while i took pictures
it was a shock when the female turned and attacked him i was n't expecting this
' not impressed : the grumpy lioness swishes her tail and shows her sharp teeth to the large male who looks bemused at why she is so upset not so toothless : he finally snaps back by growling and showing a glimpse of his gnashers during the lovers tiff captured by a photographer fortunately the pair appeared to make up shortly afterwards after spending some time cooling off from their antics in the africa sun. ' he was trying to show his teeth and convince the female he is a good powerful male , an alpha male , ' said mr mei
' but she tested him almost like she was annoyed
' stalking : the fight seemed to start after the lion was seen following the female , causing her to react and fend off his advances nervous : he looks unsure of his next move as she lies low in the grass ready to pounce if he comes too close at the nature reserve in kenya lovers and haters : his persistence seems to pay off as the couple are pictured lying together looking far happier just moments later far more relaxed : the lioness looks sleepy as she uses her paw to rub her eye now shortly after swiping it at the male lion who me ? the duo look like they are talking over their differences with the male getting more of a say now things have cooled down
