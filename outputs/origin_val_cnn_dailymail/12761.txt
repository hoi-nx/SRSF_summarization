call it " the most interesting traffic ticket in the world
" a washington state trooper caught a driver using a cardboard cutout of jonathan goldsmith , the dos equis beer pitchman known as " most interesting man
" the driver , who was by himself , was attempting to use the hov lane
" the trooper immediately recognized it was a prop and not a passenger , " trooper guy gill told the daily news
" as the trooper approached , the driver was actually laughing
" gill sent out a tweet with a photo of the cutout -- who was clad in what looked like a knit shirt , a far cry from his usual attire -- and the unnamed laughing driver : " i do n't always violate the hov lane law ... but when i do , i get a $ 124 ticket ! we 'll give him an a for creativity ! " the driver was caught on interstate 5 near fife , washington , just outside tacoma
" he could have picked a less recognizable face to put on his prop , " gill told the daily news
" we see that a lot
usually it 's a sleeping bag
