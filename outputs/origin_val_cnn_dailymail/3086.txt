a convicted child molester claimed he abducted a young boy who looked like etan patz the same day in 1979 that the 6 - year - old went missing , a former federal prosecutor told a jury monday at the trial of another man accused of murder
key defense witness stuart grabois recounted how , once ruling out family members as suspects , he located ramos in prison in the late 1980s after learning the ramos had ties to a woman who was once used by the family to walk etan home from school during a bus driver strike
i want to get it off my chest , " ' stuart grabois testified
ramos claimed that he had encountered stan in washington square park in greenwich village may 25 , 1979 , before luring the boy to his apartment to try to have sex with him , stuart grabois said
the suspect , having seen stan 's photo on television and on missing posters , was ' 90 per cent sure ' it was the same boy , he said
after the boy resisted his sexual advances , ramos claimed he put him on a subway train so he could go to his aunt 's home in washington heights
grabois said he considered that a lie , telling ramos , ' i do n't believe you
' grabois launched an investigation that resulted in an unrelated sex abuse conviction against ramos in pennsylvania
but the prosecutor failed to make a case against him in etan 's disappearance after ramos refused to ever speak again with authorities about the boy , whose body was never found
the imprisoned ramos , now 71 , was scratched as a potential defense witness in the trial of hernandez after he threatened to invoke his fifth amendment protection against self - incrimination if called to the stand
prime suspect : hernandez , 54 , pictured here in 2012 , is on trial on murder and kidnapping charges after he admitted to killing etan still missing : hernandez told police he bagged etan 's body and dumped it a few blocks away
the boy 's remains were never recovered molester : ramos served 27 years in pennsylvania for rape and molestation of three young boys in the 1980s but with testimony about ramos ' alleged confession and by highlighting his history of molesting children , the defense has sought to portray him as a more plausible suspect than the 54 - year - old hernandez
earlier , jurors watched a videotaped interview of ramos , following his arrest in 1982 after two young boys reported that he tried to lure them into a drainpipe in a bronx park , where he was living at the time
in the video , ramos says his girlfriend used to take care of stan but that he never met him
ramos served 27 years in a pennsylvania prison for the rape and molestation of three young boys in the 1980s
shortly after his release in 2012 , he was rearrested for breaking sex offender registration laws , and returned to prison
the stan family sued ramos in civil court , where he was found to have been responsible for the boy 's death in 2004
etan 's parents were awarded $ 2million , which they never attempted to collect
etan vanished on may 25 , 1979 , after leaving his family 's soho townhouse to walk to the bus
the disappearance helped galvanize the modern - day missing children 's movement , with his picture one of the first to appear on a milk carton
stan ( center ) , father of etan patz , leaves a court in new york city on january 30 , 2015 after attending hernandez 's trial stan and julie patz ( left and right ) sued ramos in civil court , where he was found to have been responsible for the boy 's death in 2004 after police received a fresh tip in 2012 , hernandez confessed that he choked etan in the basement of a new york city convenience store where he worked after luring the boy there with the promise of a soda
he said he bagged the body and dumped it a few blocks away
defense attorneys are trying to show that the defendant is mentally ill and that his lengthy videotaped confession is a delusion
prosecutors argued that hernandez 's admissions are sound .
