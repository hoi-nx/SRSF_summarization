a woman who was so self - conscious of her flat chest that she cancelled a girls ' holiday has revealed how a breast enlargement operation has given her the confidence she has always craved
jade , 22 , from nottingham , said she ' felt like a boy ' growing up , and was even too embarrassed of her 34b chest size to go shopping with her friends
at her lowest point , jade admits that she even pulled out of a trip abroad after getting all the way to the airport because she was too self - conscious to go
she said the enlargement has allowed her to enjoy holidays with her friends , and that she has a new job - and has even bagged herself a boyfriend - all down to her new - found confidence
jade says that before her transformation she did n't even want to go out and would look unhappy in pictures but now she enjoys heading out with her pals jade , who was also bullied at school , said her issues with her body started from a young age
she told femail : ' i remember in pe at school i would go to the toilets and get changed by myself and i 'd always wear baggy jumpers to cover myself up
' i just did n't feel like i looked like a girl without boobs and i was badly bullied for having a flat chest
' all my friends had them and i just could n't understand why i did n't , when you 're young you do look at yourself a lot and compare yourself to other people
' jade revealed that from a young age she was bullied for her flat chest which left her feeling like a boy jade , who used to stuff her bras in order to give herself a fuller bust , said that so low was her confidence that it stopped her doing things with her mates
' i just had no confidence , i would n't go out , or go shopping with my friends
one of the lowest points was when i was 18 , ' she revealed
' i was going on a girls holiday and we were at the airport and everyone was there in crop tops and shorts and i was the only one wearing jeans and i just could n't go through with it
' it was n't until she was 20 - after three years of saving up her tips as a waitress - that jade decided to do something to change her body and her life
she said of deciding to have a boob job : ' i was working as a waitress and i saved up all of my tips for three years and i did n't tell anyone that i was going to do it
' i literally booked it and went by myself
afterwards i called my older sister , and then i told my parents
' they were really happy for me but i think they wished i 'd told them so they could have been there for me
' jade ( left ) would stuff her bra in order to make her breasts look bigger but she still felt self conscious the difference in jade is clear to see as she larks about with some pals at a gig and the change in jade has been noticeable to everyone she knows : ' everyone says now that they 've noticed the change in my confidence
' you do n't realise just how much these things can affect you , it changes your whole life
' and the pretty brunette no longer feels like she has to hide herself away under baggy jumpers
she said : ' now i feel like i can wear different clothes
i 'm not a real girly girl but i 'll wear dresses that show off my figure
' and i 'm not afraid to go shopping with my friends anymore or get changed in front of other people
' jade 's even bagged herself a boyfriend and the pair are planning on moving in together : ' we 're looking to buy a house together
i met him a few weeks after i had the operation
' for years my friends had been asking me to go out with them to the town but i never went , i just did n't have the confidence
they persuaded me to come and i met him on my first ever night out
' i like to think he would have fancied me whether i had the operation or not but i do n't think i would have felt good enough to speak to him
' jade has also bagged herself a boyfriend and a new job since having the boob job and says it has boosted her confidence massively pictured in thailand jade now enjoys showing off her figure in a bikini , something she never would have dreamt of doing before the operation jade 's work life has improved as well : ' i 'm now a manager of a restaurant and hoping to be promoted in the next six months
' before i was a waitress and i would n't have said boo to a goose or even spoken to a manager
i 'm also doing a degree online in english literature and i 'd love to be a teacher one day ' jade continued : ' when i look back at pictures of myself now i just do n't think it looks like me
you can just see i do n't look happy whereas now i look at pictures of myself and i have so many happy memories
' speaking of choosing transform jade said : ' i went to transform because they were the only people who did n't make me feel pressured
' i 'd been to so many consultations but i kept being made to feel like i had to make a decision there and then
it felt like i was talking to a friend , they actually listened to my needs
' ' i went from and 34b to 34g , before i did n't even wear bras i would just wear like kids crop tops
' now i enjoy going underwear shopping , i think as a woman you feel powerful when you 're wearing a matching set and it 's so nice to feel like nothing 's off limits to me
