closed for over a decade , a trail that 's been described as " the world 's most dangerous path " will no longer be off limits to the public thanks to a massive reconstruction project
due to reopen march 26 , spain 's stunning caminito del rey features a cliff face boardwalk that hangs 100 meters above the guadalhorce river
the trail , which begins in the village of el chorro in southern malaga province , has been around since the early 1900s , originally built to provide access to two waterfalls for hydroelectric workers
over the years , the boardwalk deteriorated and , following a string of fatal accidents in 1999 and 2000 , the government demolished the access points to the walkway
the reopening , which comes over a year since reconstruction efforts kicked off , coincides with spain 's annual holy week celebrations
according to the spain daily el pais , the provincial government allocated 5.5 million euros ( $ 5.8 million ) to the project
the entire route is 7.7 kilometers long , with boardwalks covering 2.9 kilometers of the trail
the most famous section includes the balconcillo de los gaitanes bridge , which spans the gaitanes gorge
tourism officials say it takes between four and five hours to walk the entire route , which includes some steep slopes
entry will be free for the first six months after the attraction reopens on march 26
visiting hours are 10 a.m. -5 p.m. from april 1 to october 31 , and 10 a.m. -2 p.m. from november 1 to march 31
those who want to visit need to book a spot on the official website , caminitodelrey.info .
