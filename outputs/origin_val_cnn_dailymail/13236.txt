t.j. maxx has pulled a t - shirt from its shelves after a shopper tweeted an image of the shirt featuring the phrase " hang loose " and an illustration of a noose , leading to an uproar on social media
beachwear company tavik made the shirt , hence the surfing term " hang loose , " but the inclusion of the noose led posters on social media to draw connections to lynching and suicide
" in which a t - shirt company manages to be completely tone deaf in not one , but two ways , " one tweeter wrote
tavik pr manager mcelroy said the company regrets the design
" we sincerely apologize for any offense caused by this t - shirt
this item was released without going through proper protocols and is not related to anything other than surfing
" " at t.j. maxx , we take product matters very seriously and appreciate that this t - shirt was brought to our attention , " t.j. maxx spokeswoman doreen thompson said
" as soon as we became aware of the offensive t - shirt message , we initiated the process to remove this item from our stores
" we mistakenly purchased a few hundred units of the item , and unfortunately , with thousands of products coming into each of our stores every week , our product review process missed this item
we would like to apologize to our customers for any offense this may have caused
" tavik is taking steps to make sure the shirt is n't sold elsewhere
" this t - shirt will not be sold by tavik or any other retailer , " mcelroy wrote in an email
" we immediately pulled this item from all retailers and have destroyed our remaining units
