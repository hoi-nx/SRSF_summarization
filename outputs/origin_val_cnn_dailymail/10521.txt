the conmebol congress held in paraquay this week has given the first indication that the fifa presidential election in may might not be a procession to sepp blatter âs fifth term in office
the confederation had been expected to give sepp blatter a unanimous vote of support
but the motion was never put to the 10 delegates , in the knowledge that it would not be fully backed
the conmebol ( conmebol ) congress was held in paraguay this week there were signs that sepp blatter may not have the unanimous support of south america conmebol has long been a sepp blatter stronghold , but a number of the old guard have been replaced by football federation leaders , including president juan angel napout , who wo nât necessarily back sepp blatter at all costs
the significance of the conmebol snub to sepp blatter is that it was the first confederation gathering since three genuine challengers â prince ali of jordan , belgium âs michael van praag and portugal âs former world footballer of the year luis figo â declared their candidacy for the fifa presidency
sepp blatter âs overwhelming shows of support in asia and africa occurred when the fifa president was nât expected to face any realistic opposition
but all the challengers were in asuncion , paraquay on the campaign trail
all the challengers , including luis figo , were in asuncion , paraguay on the campaign trail radio 5 live have made little ballyhoo of their considerable coup in having john francome on their team for the festival
natural broadcaster john francome has done no media work since leaving channel 4 â where he has been hugely missed â after they changed their racing production company from highflyer to img
bbc âs caution at promoting john francome âs exciting return is understood to be because 5 live do not yet know how much time he will be available to work
radio 5 live have made little fuss of capturing john francome for their team for the festival the disproportionate financial power of the clubs compared to the national ruling body is such that mike rigg â a key member of fa technical director dan ashworth âs staff at st george âs park as head of talent identification â can be attracted away to become chief football officer at fulham by the offer of nearly four times his fa salary
the fa âs Â£ 1.5m - a - year official beer brand deal with budweiser for the fa cup until 2018 at least gives them small respite from the scrutiny around their year - long failure to land a lead sponsor â ironically to replace budweiser â for the most famous club knockout competition in football
the budweiser contract will also give them exposure on the interview backboards for the quarter - finals at the weekend which were giving the impression that william hill , the betting partner , were the main sponsor
the fa have a new Â£ 1.5m - a - year official beer brand deal with budweiser for the fa cup until 2018 the ecb are now faced with a number of counties believing the sky monopoly of cricket must end , with more of the game shown on terrestrial tv to help address falling participation
so , in their wisdom , the ecb have appointed sky sports greatest disciple haynes as their new director of communications â as sports agenda predicted
during 24 years as a sky spokesman , haynes was seemingly programmed only to be super-positive about his employers
cheltenham âs former sponsorship chief peter mcneile fell on his sword two years ago
it came after he told a reporter the jockey club , which own the course , were seeking a single , bluechip sponsor from outside the betting industry for three of its top races , including the cheltenham gold cup
yet all four of the marquee races at the festival still have bookmaker names attached to them
a jockey club spokesman said cheltenham had three new sponsors from outside the betting industry and were pleased with the portfolio
tom scudamore and dynaste charge away with the ryanair steeplechase at cheltenham racecourse kate miller , highly combative head of racing pr for william hill , is leaving the bookmakers after cheltenham to join agency golinharris who conveniently have just renewed their consumer pr contract with william hill
meanwhile , the bookmakers have still to appoint a communications director five months after the search started for a job paying as much as Â£ 200,000 - a - year to the right candidate .
