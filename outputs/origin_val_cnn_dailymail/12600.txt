five full weeks into hernandez 's murder trial , prosecutors have called 77 witnesses
jurors have yet to hear from the former nfl star 's fiancÃ©e , jenkins , patriot head coach jenkins or owner robert kraft
but this week did bring emotional testimony and important developments in the case against hernandez , who has pleaded not guilty to killing lloyd in 2013
check out some of the key moments you might have missed this week
a dna analyst from the massachusetts state police crime lab said she found that hernandez 's dna matched the dna taken from a marijuana joint found near lloyd 's body at the crime scene
lloyd 's dna also was found on the blunt
the dna analyst , biagiotti , testified to finding a partial dna match from hernandez on the shell casing found in the dumpster of the enterprise rental car office
but under cross-examination , lead defense attorney sultan got biagiotti to acknowledge there 's a high likelihood that dna from chewing gum could have transferred to the shell casing found in the dumpster
the office manager at the rental car office , smyth , testified that she put the shell casing and the gum together after finding the items in the nissan altima returned by hernandez on june 17 , 2013
she said she threw them in the trash bin outside of her office
inside hernandez 's downward spiral it was revealed by sultan that the state never submitted the gum for dna testing
the state has not yet explained why
we may hear the answer during the state 's redirect of biagiotti on monday
hernandez is seen on surveillance video buying gum , and he also offered some to smyth
biagiotti said under cross-examination that it 's highly unlikely to find dna on any shell casing
one reason is because the heat from the gun wipes away any dna , she said
the shell casings found at the crime scene did not have enough dna on them to produce a dna profile
hernandez 's family was in court on friday after a week 's absence
hernandez 's mother , terri hernandez , told cnn ' that she thought friday " went very well " for him
testimony this week also focused on fingerprints from hernandez and lloyd that were found inside the rented nissan altima
the car also had fingerprints of wallace and ortiz , who are also charged with killing lloyd
they have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately
state trooper david mackin , a fingerprint expert with the massachusetts state police crime scene services , reported finding the fingerprints of wallace and ortiz in a chrysler 300 that hernandez rented
prosecutors call it the " getaway car , " which was ultimately found abandoned in bristol , connecticut
but no prints were found on the .22 - caliber gun recovered on the edge of a wooded area near hernandez 's home
hernandez is charged with illegal possession of that gun
in addition , no prints were found on any of the shell casings , including the casing found stuck to the blue bubblegum in the dumpster outside the enterprise office
another key find : tire treads of the rear passenger tire of the nissan altima matched a tire impression found at the crime scene , according to court testimony
thibou , lloyd 's younger sister and the last family member to see him before he was killed , took the stand monday
about an hour before his death , she said she watched him get into a silver nissan altima as she sat in a friend 's car outside her home
thibou , who was 19 at the time of her brother 's killing , told jurors that when lloyd first walked to the car , he opened the front passenger door
he stopped and then opened the back passenger door and entered the car
" the light came on and there was a shadow in the back seat , " she said
then she saw the nissan altima pull away
it was 2:32 a.m. thirty minutes later , thibou returned to her home and charged her dead phone
she noticed a text from her big brother
thibou was not allowed to share with jurors what was said in those texts
the judge ruled there is not enough proof the text message meant lloyd feared for his life , legally called " a dying declaration
" that means that the jury did not hear that at 3:07 a.m. , lloyd texted his sister asking , " u saw who i 'm with ? " at 3:11 a.m he checked in again , texting " hello
" finally , at 3:19 a.m. thibou answered , " my phone was dead who was that ? " at 3:22 a.m. , lloyd responded , " nfl
" a minute later , he sent his last text , " just so u know
" during grand jury testimony , thibou admitted she thought her brother was bragging
when reliving the moment when police came to her home to tell her family that lloyd had been shot to death , thibou began to cry silently , wiping her tears after assistant district attorney william mccauley gave her a tissue
during cross-examination , defense attorney michael fee introduced a photo of lloyd taken by thibou
it showed lloyd smiling and sitting in the driver 's seat of the black suburban that hernandez loaned him
on wednesday , jurors got an up - close view of the clothes lloyd was wearing the night he was shot six times
massachusetts crime lab forensic chemist sherri menendez held up lloyd 's bullet - riddled dark blue old navy sweatshirt and then his red plaid shirt
jurors craned their necks to get a better view of the bullet holes in the sweatshirt
the shirt was stained with blood
menendez tested the bullet holes for gunshot residue consisting of what she described as burned particles and vaporous lead
during her testing of bullet holes on the front of the sweatshirt , she found both and was able to determine that lloyd was shot from as close as 3 feet
the autopsy showed the final two shots were fired into his chest while he was laying face up in the ground
just weeks before hernandez was arrested and charged with murder , he toured rental apartments with patriot employee anderson , real estate agent barbara scardino testified thursday
she said she was initially contacted by anderson to find some apartments to show hernandez
he had previously called her to help other patriot players find homes and apartment rentals , sometimes second residences near gillette stadium
this means the patriot staff knew about hernandez 's second home
in early may of 2013 , she showed anderson and hernandez four apartments
hernandez settled on the two - bedroom condo in franklin , massachusetts , referred to as his " flophouse
" hernandez 's home in north attleboro and his condo in franklin are each about 15 minutes away from the stadium
hernandez 's franklin neighbor , bailey , also took the stand , telling jurors that she met another man that also stayed in the condo
it was hernandez 's friend wallace
bailey paid close attention to hernandez and wallace , seeing them come and go during their short stay there
during her one attempt to talk to hernandez and say hello , she says he sort of grunted back , calling it a " nondescript " noise
she also testified that she often heard loud voices that sounded " locker room - ish " coming from the apartment as well as a strong " skunk - like " smell seeping into her apartment from their shared wall
after mid-june , she never saw him again
a representative from sprint , darrow , started off the week with a light moment
he appeared nervous and stopped to take a moment while answering a question
he then turned to judge garsh and apologized
" it 's a big case
" showing no emotion , garsh struck the comment from the record
darrow went on to testify to multiple calls between sprint cell phone client wallace and lloyd , hernandez and hernandez 's fiancee , jenkins , the night before and morning of lloyd 's death
prosecutors say they believe hernandez was using his fiancee 's phone to call wallace
jenkins granted immunity darrow also explained how cell sites ( or towers ) in the sprint network tracked the phone calls , and thus tracked the direction they were driving
another cell phone representative also testified
t-mobile engineer quinn testified about the data transmissions from lloyd 's cell phone beginning on june 17 , 2013 , at 2:32 a.m. that 's when lloyd was picked up outside his home in the nissan altima
data transmissions are the automatic updates that are sent to cell phones
assistant district attorney patrick bomberg methodically walked quinn through data transmissions received on lloyd 's cell phone via multiple cell towers along the route he traveled from dorchester to the industrial park in north attleboro
the last cell tower was just 400 yards from lloyd 's body .
