for many dads out there , they dream of their son making it as a professional footballer
but while this has its undoubted challenges , getting your child to support the same football team is surely a must
in this hilarious video , a young father perches his son on his knee , and begins a chant in honour of his favourite team - forest
after a reluctant start , 10 - month - old joshua soon throws himself into his father 's forest chant the toddler is well trained it seems , and almost as if he is on the terraces himself , he joins in with the actions football fans everywhere will recognise
the father shouts out ' forest , ' in reference to the nottinghamshire club who play their football in championship
at this point 10 - month old joshua raises his hands in the air
' come on you boys in red , ' continues the father , which is met by the blonde - haired child clapping his hands together
the actions are met with a wide smile and attempts at copying his father 's chants
with a cheeky smile , joshua shows he is well on the way to following the championship club the man seated then shouts ' nottingham 's red and white ' on two occasions , but the toddler 's exertions appear to have tired him out , and he holds his hands behind his head
forest are sitting ten points of a play - off place in the championship , and facing a tall order to reach the promised land of the premier league
maybe when he 's older , joshua might get to see forest taking on the likes of chelsea , manchester city and arsenal .
