health secretary jeremy hunt said britain would become the first country in the world with a nationwide meningitis b vaccination programme after the government reached a deal with drug maker glaxosmithkline all babies will be offered an injection against deadly meningitis b â ending a year - long delay , the health secretary said yesterday
the vaccine costs Â£ 20 a time and is expected to be available on the nhs by the end of the year
jeremy hunt âs announcement follows growing pressure from charities , highlighted by the mail , which warned that children were dying and suffering devastating injuries while wrangling about the cost continued
there are around 1,870 cases of meningitis b in the country each year and it commonly affects the under - fives and teenagers
it leads to around 120 deaths and leaves another 400 with life - long disabilities including brain damage , amputations and blindness
a panel of scientific advisers had recommended in october 2013 that the vaccine should not be introduced as it was not deemed cost - effective
but ministers told the joint committee of vaccination and immunisation to carry out another assessment and this concluded last march that it should be offered
the government then spent almost a year negotiating with drugs manufacturers trying to agree a cheaper price
on saturday , the mail highlighted how the jab was being denied to babies because of the cost row
nearly 800,000 babies each year would be eligible for the jab at an average annual cost of Â£ 16million
charities estimate the nhs would spend around Â£ 3million treating and caring for just one child who has survived meningitis but is left with life - long disabilities
gps would give the injection to babies from the age of two months , with boosters at four months and 12 months
in most cases , they would have it with the five - in - one jab and the rotavirus oral vaccination
the move means the britain will be the first country in the world to offer the vaccine to all babies
mr jeremy hunt said : â we can go ahead this year with rolling out the meningitis b vaccine and that âs something families , particularly those with young children , will really welcome
â children need three doses in the first year of life , making the maximum final bill for the 700,000 born each year in england and wales Â£ 42million
gps are also paid a Â£ 7.50 fee for each dose administered meningitis b can kill a healthy child within hours of the first symptoms
the disease is an infection of the meninges - the membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord
since the vaccine was licensed two years ago there have been 1,130 cases , of which at least 452 people died or suffered disabilities
the first symptoms usually include fever , vomiting and headaches
others include limb pain , pale skin , neck stiffness , dislike of bright lights and confusion
it is commonly found in children under five years of age but can also affect teenagers aged 15 to 19
it is fatal in around 10 per cent of cases
some of those who survive are left with long - term problems , such as amputation , deafness , epilepsy and learning difficulties
he said ministers had had a â stand - off â with novartis , which owned the vaccine , â for the best part of a year â as it failed to agree a cheaper price
the jab , called bexsero , has since been bought by glaxosmithkline , which has agreed a lower cost
sue davie , of the charity meningitis now , said : â to know that babies will be protected is fantastic and another great step forward in our fight against meningitis
â chris head , of the meningitis research foundation , said : â we are delighted that vaccinating all babies against this devastating disease is within sight , cementing the britain âs position as a world leader in meningitis prevention
â dr david elliman , a consultant in community child health at the whittington health nhs trust , north london , said : â it is great news
the vaccine will mean the numbers of children suffering this terrible illness will be further reduced
â meningitis is an infection of the outside layer of cells surrounding the brain and spinal cord , causing inflammation and damage
it can kill within hours and is the most common cause of death by infectious disease in childhood .
