the man who attacked a security area at the new orleans airport with a machete and wasp spray also had a bag of molotov cocktails and a car containing smoke bombs and gas cylinders , authorities said
the suspect , richard white , 63 , died saturday after treatment for three bullet wounds he suffered when a sheriff 's lieutenant fired at him to halt the friday night attack , the jefferson parish sheriff 's office said
sheriff normand said earlier that investigators had n't been able to talk to richard white , who officials said suffered from some type of mental illness
he said richard white 's wife and children had been very cooperative
louis armstrong new orleans international airport was back open and fully operational , mayor mitch landrieu said
he praised security officials for acting quickly and heroically and doing everything they could to stop the attack
the incident began when richard white , carrying a bag , entered one of the lanes at the security checkpoint for concourse b and began spraying tsa agents and bystanders with a can of wasp spray , the sheriff 's office said
he then pulled a machete from his waistband and began swinging it at agents and others in the area
" what i saw originally was one of the officers getting sprayed with the wasp spray , " said tsa agent richel , whose arm was hit by one of the bullets fired at richard white
the officer being sprayed with wasp spray picked up a bag and threw it at richard white to slow him down , but the suspect still barged through , richel told reporters
richel , who was not armed , yelled for everyone to run as she made her way toward the sheriff 's lieutenant , who she knew had a weapon
" i was calling , ' run , run ' for them to get away from him , and i was calling for the ( lieutenant ) so she was there and alert , " richel said
" i did n't hear him say anything , " she said
" once i yelled for the checkpoint to be cleared , i looked over my shoulder and he was coming after me
and i ran as fast as i could and thank god the officer was as close as she was , because i would n't be here today
" she said the man came " within inches " of whacking her with the machete
" this man was swinging very hard , very hard with that machete , " richel said
" and if he would have made contact with anybody , it would have been terrible
" normand said lt. heather slyve fired three shots , ultimately stopping the attacker
he said investigators believe it was the first shot that went through richel 's upper right arm
richel showed off a bright pink bandage on her arm and said the bullet went through her tricep
" originally , i thought the machete hit me
i did n't realize it was a bullet , " she said
" i knew he was close , so i honestly thought he hit me and she shot him
" when richard white approached the checkpoint , he was carrying a bag that he dropped as soon as the first agent confronted him , normand said
" what the bag revealed was six half - pint mason jars with cloth wicks into a liquid that we now know to be gasoline -- what you would commonly refer to as a molotov cocktail , " normand said
a grill lighter and plastic letter opener were also in the bag , and next to his body investigators found powdery material and wicks , which they determined were from crushed smoke bombs
" the fact that he ended up dropping the bag ( when ) the tsa agent threw an item at him was huge in the short 40 - second span ... of this event , " normand said
" had he been able to hold onto the bag , he might not have continued to chase the tsa agents through the checkpoint
he might have gone somewhere else
" the bomb squad found more smoke bombs in his car , and in the trunk were three gas tanks -- one for freon , one for oxygen and one for acetylene , a compressed gas used in welding and metal - cutting
normand said their intended purpose was n't clear
normand said " there is a mental illness component " in their investigation of the suspect
" no one at this point in time has any notion about what may have triggered this behavior , " normand said
" and not unlike dealing with the mentally ill , sometimes you will never know what actually triggers some of this type of behavior
" people who had recently interacted with richard white described him as very cordial , calm , cool and collected , normand said
they reported having no suspicions about him and said nothing seemed out of the ordinary
it was n't clear why richard white was at the airport
contrary to earlier reports , normand said saturday , richard white was no longer a taxi driver
