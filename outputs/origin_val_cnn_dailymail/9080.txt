he is a young guy who just wants to live his life
anyone at the age of 24 , if you put a microscope on them for a few months and see how they are living , it would probably be far worse than mario balotelli
he is a normal guy
footballers are put on a pedestal of not being human but we are just normal people

words ca n't describe what he has done not just for the club but for the players as well
he helps players settle in , young players
he takes them under his wing

that guy will always be a legend in my eyes
i am in awe of him now

it means nothing to me
when you watch other people , you do n't get anywhere in life because you are at war with yourself

i just believe in me

i had to be wary
' the gang stuff was nât based on colours - it was more about areas

i was never involved in anything like that and i enjoyed growing up there
