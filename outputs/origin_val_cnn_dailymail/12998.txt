an iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new u.s. hometown was shot and killed by an unknown assailant , according to dallas police
authorities have stepped up patrols in the neighborhood where al-jumaili lived -- and died -- in their effort to find out who killed the 36 - year - old early thursday , as he and his brother stood in the parking lot of his apartment complex watching the snow
al-jumaili 's wife was with them taking photos
dallas police spokesman cotner said al-jumaili , who recently immigrated to the u.s. , had never seen snow and " just like all of us , a pretty snowfall brings the child out in us
" there is " extreme heartache ... and no shortage of sadness for this beautiful young man who had just come to this country 20 days ago , " said alia salem , executive director of the cair in the dallas and fort worth area
cair became involved in the case immediately after the shooting , according to salem , because of " a heightened sense of awareness with regard to hate crimes against muslims
" salem said the muslim community wanted to know whether the shooting death was random or whether al-jumaili was targeted
police say they have no indication so far that it was a hate crime
when shooting broke out , al-jumaili cried " i 'm hit ! " according to cotner , basing that on statements from witnesses and the victim 's relatives
he ran to his apartment nearby and died a few hours later
police did not say where al-jumaili was struck or how many times he was shot
some residents reported seeing two to four men enter the apartment complex on foot through a vehicle gate before the shooting , according to cotner
he said there was no interaction between the men and al-jumaili and his family
in black - and - white soundless surveillance video , one person who appears to be carrying a rifle is seen running just ahead of a second person , dallas police officer monica cordova said
the second person is shown walking at a slower pace , holding what appears to be a handgun in his right hand
approximately 13 seconds later , another person comes into view and passes by the camera , followed by a fourth individual who is walking , she said
from the vantage point of the camera , it is difficult to make out any of the features of the suspects or even the gender , although police have said they are looking for four black males
witnesses say multiple shots were fired from what is believed to be a rifle
cotner said police are conducting tests to find out whether more than one rifle was used in the shooting , but he said he could not reveal the make or model of the weapon
cotner said friday that other than that , police have little to go on
" we ca n't solve this crime alone , " he said
authorities are appealing to the public to contact them with any information that might help the investigation
north texas crime stoppers is offering a $ 5,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and an indictment , police said
salem is encouraging anyone with information about the shooting to share it
she said there are online campaigns underway to help raise funds for the family 's expenses , as well as an effort to raise additional funds to contribute to the reward
