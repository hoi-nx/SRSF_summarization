tottenham defender jan vertonghen has urged kane not to play for england under 21s this summer
kane is set for his first senior call - up later this month for the games against lithuania and italy
but the plan then is for kane to drop down back into the under 21s for this summer âs european championships in the czech republic
kane is likely to be included in england under 21s european championship squad in the summer jan vertonghen ( right ) believes the striker should stay at home and instead prepare for next season tottenham manager mauricio pochettino has already warned the fa he wants talks with the fa before giving them his blessing to call - up kane this summer
and jan vertonghen , who played in the tournament in 2007 , says the 21 - year - old , who has played 41 games already this season , should skip the tournament in preparation for next season
the belgian said : â it âs difficult for me to judge
of course england want him
he is a brilliant striker and he can be the main man , but i think he needs his rest for next season
kane rounds rob green in the queens park rangers goal to double tottenham 's lead on saturday the striker has been in terrific form and continued his goalscoring run with two goals at loftus road â it âs his call and i know a player always wants to play but sometimes you have to be careful
it âs a difficult one because last season i played with injuries , but sometimes you just ca nât
you have to think about what âs going to come
' it âs his decision and it âs a totally different situation from when i played in 2007
did that benefit my development as a player ? it âs hard to tell
â i enjoyed playing for my country because i never played international football at youth level
â so that was my first tournament as a belgium player and i enjoyed it
it was in holland and i played in holland for ajax at the time , so for me it was brilliant

the explosive nature of barkley âs game has been missing in recent months and the statistics he has been producing in games have not matched the levels of 12 months ago
that is why everton believe barkley âs development would be best served by him being given the opportunity to completely rest in june and july before returning refreshed for pre-season
everton manager roberto martinez and southgate have an excellent work relationship and it is expected they will speak in the coming weeks .
