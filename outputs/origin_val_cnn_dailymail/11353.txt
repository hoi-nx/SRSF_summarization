manchester united defender evans has released a statement denying the allegations that he spat at cisse on wednesday night
however , in contrast , the newcastle star has offered his apologies after reacting to something ' very unpleasant '
evans clashed with the opposing striker during manchester united 's 1 - 0 victory at st james ' park , with both appearing to spit at each other
cisse was also pictured wiping something off of his face
but evans says he is shocked by the accusations and that it is not in his character to do anything of the sort , despite the footage , and cisse 's letter of apology , indicating that he did in fact spit at the senegalese international
evans ( left ) and cisse clash after an unsavoury incident on wednesday night manchester united defender evans appeared to launch spit in the direction of the floored cisse newcastle striker cisse subsequently retaliated and appeared to aim spit of his own back at the manchester united man the fa are waiting for referee anthony taylor 's report
as he missed the incident between evans and pappis cisse , it is unlikely the it will be included in his report - meaning the fa can retrospectively punish the pair
hull city striker george boyd was banned for three games last season after being found guilty of spitting at manchester city goalkeeper joe hart
however , the fa have issued new guidelines to move in line with new fifa guidelines meaning evans and cisse could now be banned for six games
evans ' statement on manchester united 's official website read : ' having woken up this morning i am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night 's match
i would like to make it clear that i did not spit at cisse
' i was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor
during the game cisse and i spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that i was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting
' it is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something i have ever done or would ever do
it is certainly not something that i did last night
' however , while cisse has said sorry to his team - mates , fans , and even evans , he said his spit back in the northern irishman 's direction was a reaction
' i have apologies to make to a lot of people today , ' cisse said
' firstly to my teammates and to our supporters , secondly to evans , and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and evans
' i reacted to something i found very unpleasant
sometimes it is hard not to react , particularly in the heat of the moment
i have always tried hard to be positive a role model , especially for our young fans , and yesterday i let you down
' i hope children out there playing football for their clubs and schools this weekend will know better than to retaliate when they are angry
perhaps when they see the problem it now causes me and my team they will be able to learn from my mistake , not copy it
' cisse has apologised for evans after reacting while the manchester united defender has denied all allegations the pair tangled during the first half of the premier league clash and appeared to aim kicks at each other before the situation turned even more unsavoury
the referee missed the incident meaning the fa , who are waiting for anthony taylor 's report , can ban the pair retrospectively for six games each
last season hull city striker george boyd was banned for three matches after being found guilty of spitting at manchester city goalkeeper joe hart
however , the fa upped the punishment for spitting to six games to come in line with new fifa guidelines , which state that any player ' dismissed from the field of play for spitting at an opponent or any other person ' will be suspended ' following the match in which he was sent off until such time as his club has completed its next six matches in approved competitions
' if found guilty , cisse will be banned for an extra game because of a previous violent conduct ban for elbowing everton 's seamus coleman
afterwards , van gaal defended evans
' i did not see that ( incident ) from the bench , but i can not imagine he would do that , ' said the dutchman
if found guilty , cisse will be banned for an extra game because of a previous violent conduct ban cisse elbowed everton defender seamus coleman during newcastle 's 3 - 2 victory in december newcastle head coach john carver said : ' you ca n't do it can you ? it 's one of the worst things in football
' but i ca n't comment on it , i just know there was a fracas on the halfway line and i need to have a look at it
' former manchester united midfielder paul scholes , covering the match as a pundit for bt sport , slammed cisse while suggesting evans was n't a guilty party
' i think evans is spitting on the floor
i know evans , he 's not that type of person , ' he said
' if he wants to do that then it 's not hard to miss , is it ? he 's only stood a yard away from him
what cisse does afterwards is unforgivable
