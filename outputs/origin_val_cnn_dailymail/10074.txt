for a man who had just made it to the champions league quarter - finals and broken the record for goals scored in european competition , cristiano ronaldo cut a frustrated figure as he left the pitch shaking his head on tuesday
the mood of the world 's best player had n't changed when he emerged from the home - team dressing room and told waiting television crews that he would not be talking again publicly until the end of the season
the significance of ' the end of the season ' is that by then we will know just how much a campaign that promised so much for real madrid has delivered
cristiano ronaldo celebrates after scoring , but he could n't prevent his side slumping to a 4 - 3 defeat cristiano ronaldo vowed he would not talk publicly again this season after the defeat by schalke on tuesday ballon d'or winner cristiano ronaldo watches on with his hands on his hips as klaas-jan huntelaar celebrates much more will also be known about the futures of cristiano ronaldo - real madrid 's top scorer â and also his team - mate gareth bale and his coach carlo ancelotti
supporters at the bernabeu turned on carlo ancelotti even before real madrid 's 4 - 3 defeat by schalke had started , with the manager 's name jeered as it was announced before kick - off
gareth bale was whistled at in the second half while goalkeeper casillas also bore the brunt of the discontent , more justifiably because he could have done more about schalke 's first two goals
when casillas , as captain , summoned his team - mates into the centre - circle at the final whistle they went reluctant â ronaldo more than most â but were met with more resounding boos and a show of white handkerchief protest
casillas has said he wants to stay until he is 40 but real madrid want united goalkeeper de gea , and every day that passes without him signing a new deal at old trafford leads them to believe they still have a chance
some real madrid fans waved a white handkerchief after the final whistle on tuesday night casillas has been below his best for some time , but replacing him is not as simple as it sounds casillas called on his team - mates to acknowledge the home supporters following the surprise defeat casillas pulls midfielder isco toward the centre circle to applaud the fans united will be watching the potential unravelling of real madrid 's season closely
the campaign could still end gloriously if important injured players like sergio ramos , james rodriguez and the fit - again luka modric return to their best ahead of the champions league latter rounds
but what if things do n't end well ? united have made little secret of wanting gareth bale at the end of this campaign
he is happy in spain but how many times can a player have his first mistake verbally chastised by his own fans before he starts to wonder if he might not be better off elsewhere ? the former tottenham star is not a particularly social animal and has not put down any great emotional roots in the city
united must be encouraged by the fact that despite him winning four trophies in his first year at the club , supporters are doing nothing to cultivate a lasting bond
gareth bale was subjected to boos from real madrid fans as they were beaten at home by schalke gareth bale has not scored for the champions league winners in his last nine appearances the former tottenham player endured another night to forget as real madrid were beaten but crept through united have also considered the impact that recapturing cristiano ronaldo would create
and they were interested in carlo ancelotti before they turned to louis van gaal to replace david moyes
the italian stayed at real madrid and won his third champions league but he is now drawn to the idea of an england return and the wheels have been set in motion to push his profile in england â not that anyone needs reminding how well he did at chelsea
no - one at real madrid is suggesting cristiano ronaldo , gareth bale and carlo ancelotti all park up at old trafford this summer with de gea moving the other way but there is a sense that there will be an overhaul at the end of the season and with instability prevailing it might not just be squad players such as alvaro arbeloa , fabio coentrao , asier illaramendi and sami khedira who leave
at any club such rumblings would be dismissed as ridiculous but the knee - jerk short - termism at real madrid is nothing new
carlo ancelotti , pictured hugging roberto di matteo , is under growing pressure at the bernabeu carlo ancelotti 's future at real madrid is the subject of discussion despite delivering the club their 10th champions league carlo ancelotti looks to the skies as his side sneak into the last eight of the champions league an online poll asking which striker should be dropped from the ' bbc ' front three of benzema , gareth bale and cristiano ronaldo ( the one that was ' the best in the world ' just three months ago ) was carried out this week by diario as
gareth bale registered 40 per cent and cristiano ronaldo 33 per cent
carlo ancelotti sticks up for both but no one sticks up for him
as he said earlier this week : ' when we win it 's got nothing to do with me , when we lose it 's my fault
' post match on tuesday he was even asked if : ' knowing the business as he does , would he be surprised if he was sacked after defeat to schalke ? ' he has them in the last eight of the champions league in spite of an injury crisis ; cristiano ronaldo has already scored as many goals this season as last ; and real madrid are only a win in next week 's clasico away from returning to the top of the league but you would never know it from the faces of those who were winning the champions league just 10 months ago .
