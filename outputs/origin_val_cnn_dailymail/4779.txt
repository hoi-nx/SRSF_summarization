reverend canon gavin ashenden , the former chaplain of sussex university and one of 35 who serve her majesty , expressed concern about more than 100 passages in the islamic holy book

he was responding to comments by the archbishop of canterbury , who warned this week about being too quick to brand people with strong religious views â extremists â
yesterday , more than 60 imams and leaders of islamic groups signed an open letter to the government accusing it of criminalising islamic
they claimed the â terror threat â was being exploited for political capital ahead of the election , as â the big parties inevitably try to outdo each other in their nastiness â
the signatories , which included journalist yvonne ridley and former guantanamo detainee moazzam begg , criticised the â demonisation of muslims in britons ... despite their disavowal of violence and never having supported terrorist acts â
rev ashenden was responding to comments by archbishop of canterbury justin welby who has reportedly claimed young people are turning to jihad because mainstream religion is not â exciting â
the archbishop said britons âs religious communities needed to do more to provide an alternative to extremism that gives youngsters a â purpose in life â
but rev ashenden told lbc radio he was â attracted to christianity because it invites people to the extremity of forgiveness and love â
he added : â islamic has , i think , over 100 verses inviting people to violence in the koran which christianity does nât have
' if you âre going to invite people to be dedicated ... followers of their scriptures , christians will go around forgiving people and islamic will do something else
â asked to compare the bible and the koran , he said the christianity holy text invites its followers to forgive and try to lead people away from sin , while the islamic text invites people to violence presenter iain dale said muslims would say islamic was â entirely peaceful â , but rev ashenden said parts of the koran â tell you to kill your enemies â
he then quoted verses which he said urged muslims to â strike off the heads â of â those who disbelieve â
when warned his comments could offend muslims , he said : â if they are offended by my quoting the koran they are not offended by me , they are offended by the koran
â he added : â if you âre going to talk about excitement in christianity it âs about delivering people from evil and transforming people âs lives
â asked whether he would describe certain parts of the koran as evil , he said : â i notice that they invite people to violence
i âll let other people decide whether that âs good or evil
