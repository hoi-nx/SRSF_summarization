the honour , the highest decoration for valour in the face of the enemy , was awarded to private james towers after he bravely volunteered for the mission at mericourt near lens , france , on october 6 , 1918
the soldier , from preston , lancashire , stepped forward as the sixth man to dash out in front of enemy machine gun posts and get a vital message to a cut - off platoon 150 yards in front of him
he put himself forward despite witnessing the five previous runners - including his best friend private frank dunlop - get shot down just minutes earlier
during his mission , he managed to evade bullets and even startled a german machine gun nest when he leapt across an embankment and landed just five feet away from them
they were so surprised they failed to launch bullets until after he had fled
the solder eventually made it to the lost platoon , gave the orders to the commanding officer and dug in with them for the night
using his knowledge of the location of the german machine gun posts , he led them safely back to the british lines at dawn the next day
for his incredible act of courage , he was awarded the victoria cross and it was presented to him by king george v at buckingham palace upon his return to british
it was left to his family when he died , aged 79 , in 1977 , and later sold at auction in 1983

it was my lucky day

cambrai , north france , during the first world war private james towers was part of the 2nd cameronian ( scottish rifles )
the group were occupying the ruined village of mericourt , near lens , france , in october 1918 when the battalion was ordered to withdraw troops
mericourt was situated to the east of the beaurevoir line and troops were dispatched in early october to capture the line - the third line of defences of the hindenburg line - and the surrounding areas
the beaurevoir line was the last of a series of german defensive lines and consisted of thick barbed wire entanglements and well - sited machine and anti-tank gun bunkers
the original attack on the hindenburg line launched on september 29 , 1918 , had planned to encompass the beaurevior line as well , but was not successful
british and australian troops were ordered to break through the beaurevoir line on october 3 , 1918
however , on october 6 , 1918 , orders were issued for the village of mericourt to be evacuated
the message failed to reach a party of 30 british soldiers , who were surrounded by german machine gun posts
it was at this point a volunteer was requested to dodge firefight to take the message directly to the b battalion
private james towers was successful and the group was led back to the british lines
two days later , british and canadian troops broke through the hindenburg line at the second battle of cambrai
the collapse forced the german high command to accept that the war had to be ended .
