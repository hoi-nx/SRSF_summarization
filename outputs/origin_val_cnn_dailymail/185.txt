damon hill fears mclaren will experience a painful start to the upcoming formula 1 campaign
the british team arrive in melbourne for this week 's curtain raiser off the back of a troubled winter
powered by honda engines for the first time in more than two decades , they managed fewer laps than any other team during pre-season testing
indeed favourites mercedes , completed almost 1,000 more laps than mclaren , who were plagued by reliability issues , at the three tests in jerez and catalunya
damon hill ( right ) is predicting a miserable start to the formula 1 season for mclaren button 's partnership with fernando alonso will be delayed from forming after fernando alonso 's crash fernando alonso sustained concussion in a crash and has been ruled out of the first race of the season ' there is going to be pain , lots of pain , ' damon hill , the 1996 world champion , gloomily predicted
' the mclaren - honda thing has to work at some point , but formula 1 is so difficult now
there is so much technology and you are taking on so many strong teams
' i expect a modest beginning , but from whatever they start at you want to see a trajectory which is pushing to regular top sixes and a podium at the end of the season
' mclaren and honda forged one of the sport 's most successful partnerships as ayrton senna and alain prost delivered four consecutive drivers ' and constructors ' championships between 1998 and 1991
and their return to the grid this season was expected to bring a similar change in fortune for the british team who have n't tasted victory at a single race in two lacklustre years
' only winning is good enough for mclaren , ' added damon hill
' but if they end the season challenging for podiums then they have made a massive step forward
damon hill believes it would be a step forward for mclaren if they challenge for podiums at the end of the season button pictured driving the mclaren in winter testing in catalunya ahead of the start of the season kevin magnussen will compete in place of fernando alonso for the season opener in australia ' they ca n't be saying they only need to be in the top 10 because that is not good enough for a team like mclaren
' button and fernando alonso form a new - look partnership at the woking outfit this season after the spaniard signed from ferrari and button was retained for a fifth campaign
but fernando alonso will be absent from the season opener in melbourne after suffering concussion during a high - speed crash at the final winter test in jerez
he will be replaced by kevin magnussen
