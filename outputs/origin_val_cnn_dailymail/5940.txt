denis irwin remains convinced shaw will be a big star at manchester united
denis irwin , one of the most decorated defenders in manchester united 's history , tipped shaw to star for manchester united shortly after he signed for the club , but the teenager has had a mixed maiden campaign so far
shaw has impressed on a few occasions , but injury has prevented him from fulfilling his potential
the left - back has started just 12 premier league games so far , but denis irwin is sure the club will start seeing a return on their Â£ 31.5million investment once his injury troubles are over
' i have no doubt he will be a great player for us in years to come , ' denis irwin told press association sport
' until he gets a run of games i do n't think you are going to see the quality shaw can bring to a side
' when he gets that under his belt you will see the best of him
' hopefully he will stay injury - free for us for the rest of year and get a run of games
' manchester united beat strong competition from shaw 's boyhood club chelsea to sign the defender from southampton last summer
denis irwin played for manchester united for 12 years between 1990 and 2002 shaw jokes about with marouane fellaini during a manchester united training session last week denis irwin believes it is unreasonable to expect too much too soon from a player who only made his premier league debut in november 2012 , regardless of how much manchester united paid for him
' he has had a big couple of years , ' said denis irwin , who played 529 times for the club
' he had a couple of years at southampton , he had a big - money move here and he was involved in a world cup at just 18 - years - old so the spotlight has been on him through no fault of his own
' when you are 19 you will make mistakes and you will learn from them
' i have no doubt he will be getting plenty of advice from the coaches and the manager

' it was a big loss for us when we did n't qualify for the champions league
it 's been a strange year , ' said denis irwin , who was part of the team that won the trophy in the most dramatic fashion in 1999
' we have missed champions league football , i have missed big teams coming here
' there are some big matches coming up in the round of 16
we are not involved and it 's not nice watching
' city go to barcelona this week and we watch that and wish we were part of it because it 's the best club competition in the world
