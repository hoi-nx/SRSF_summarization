marine le pen 's hopes of becoming president of french suffered a huge blow tonight as her national front was beaten into joint second place in regional elections
the far - right party was predicted to make massive gains , but early exit polls put sarkozy 's conservatives out in front
it is a huge boost for the 60 - year - old former president who - despite facing a string of corruption charges - is convinced he can become head of state again in 2017
the figures made a mockery of ms le pen 's claims that her fiercely anti-immigration and anti-europe party could mount a serious challenge for power
' we 'll get stuck into the regions and then we 're off to invade the elysee , ' the 46 - year - old had said before the vote
at stake were 101 departments - or administrative regions - and 4,100 regional government seats
ms le pen was certain that she could do better than the opposition conservatives and the ruling socialists , who are performing appallingly because of the hapless government of president hollande
ms le pen had positioned the national front ( national front ) away from its overtly racist and anti-semitic roots , and won 25 per cent of the vote at local and european elections last year
sarkozy immediately ruled out any alliances between his party and national front candidates in next sunday 's second round
' to those who voted national front , we understand your frustrations , ' the ump chairman told supporters at party headquarters
' but this party will not solve french 's problems - it will only make them worse , ' added the ex-president , who came out of retirement last year and hopes to secure the 2017 presidential ticket for his bitterly divided party in primaries next year
manuel valls , the socialist prime minister , has also attacked the national front , claiming it is a huge danger to french
conservative leader sarkozy delivers a speech after his party came first in the local body elections ' i fear for my country , i fear it will split apart when confronted with the national front
its policies would be a disaster for the country , ' said mr manuel valls
' do you think a national front scoring twenty five per cent in european elections , perhaps thirty per cent in local elections , and so on , can not win the presidential election ? ' he asked
while the vote means she can no longer argue the national front is french 's most popular party , le pen said the result was still a gain for a party almost totally absent from the departements at present , and a slap for hollande 's prime minister manuel valls
' manuel valls must now hear the message of voters and have the decency to hand in his resignation to the president , ' she told supporters of the centrist reformer , who hollande already said will remain in post whatever the final vote outcome
although ms le pen was always unlikely to become president in 2017 , it was thought she could come runner up , as her father jean marie le pen did in 2002
le pen senior 's limited victory sent shockwaves round the world , even though he eventually lost to jacques chirac
french president hollande casts his vote in the elections for local councils across french hollande today acknowledged that the key issues of the elections would be abstention ' and the score of the national front ' today , national front candidates were fielded in 1,909 out of a total of 2,054 constituencies for the first round of voting
the second round is next sunday
for the first time , candidates appeared on ballots in pairs - one male , one female - to ensure that 50 percent of council members will be women
those that voted today was estimated at just under 43 per cent of all those eligible - a figure which is up almost six points from the cantonal elections of 2011
the green vote also seemed to have collapsed in today 's poll , with the environmentalists receiving just two per cent of the national poll , according to the ipsos poll
mr sarkozy had a single term as president , between 2007 and 2012 , but was defeated by mr hollande 's socialist party
within a week of mr sarkozy leaving office , the paris home he shared with his third wife , the former supermodel carla bruni , was raided by anti-corruption officers
mr sarkozy denies any wrongdoing , but is still facing a number of enquiries , including one into allegations that he received millions in illegal cash from the late colonel muammar gaddafi
