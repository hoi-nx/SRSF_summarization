falcao 's miserable career at united reached a new low on tuesday night when he was dumped in the reserves by manager louis van gaal
falcao has not played a minute of football for united 's first team since being dragged off midway through the home victory over sunderland last month and was left on the bench as van gaal 's stuttering team were knocked out of the fa cup by arsenal at home on monday night
now the Â£ 250,000 - a - week loan signing from monaco has suffered the indignity of being made to play in the under 21 team in their game against tottenham hotspur on tuesday night

however , the united boss usually asks senior players to play at this level only if they are on their way back from injury
falcao has been injury free since recovering from a thigh injury at the end of november and is unlikely to be pleased at being asked to drop down a level at a time when he is desperately trying to prove he is worth a permanent deal
united officials say falcao , one of the most feared strikers in world football before he suffered a cruciate ligament injury last january , was chosen to ensure he would be sharp for the first - team 's clash with tottenham hotspur at the same venue on sunday afternoon
falcao heads the ball towards goal but his drought goes on after another unsuccessful outing sportsmail reported earlier this year that falcao feels he has to work twice as hard to impress his manager as some other players and has been less than thrilled at times to hear his manager question his fitness levels
but on this evidence he will do well to win a recall from louis van gaal after an anonymous performance
in a poor first half falcao dallied too long on two opportunities and his only other action of note came when he deflected fellow striker james wilson 's goal - bound effort wide from an offside position
united coaches ( left - right ) paul mcguinness ( u18s ) , ryan giggs , nicky butt and tony strudwick ( fitness ) watch on falcao looks to get in between the tottenham hotspur defence at old trafford as united are held by tottenham hotspur falcao has another effort on goal but is again frustrated as united searched for the winner expertly marshalled by tottenham hotspur ' centre - half pairing of 17 - year - old cameron carter-vickers and south african bongani khumalo , 28 , the monaco man cut a desperately frustrated figure
in the second half he was at it again when he diverted sean goss 's shot into the arms of tottenham hotspur keeper luke mcgee before his disappointing evening came to a merciful end
in contrast brazilian right back rafael , fighting for his future at united , was a standout
he calmly intercepted mcgee 's throw out before chipping him with his left foot from 30 yards on 33 minutes to cancel out lively tottenham hotspur midfielder kenny mcevoy 's opener
having only scored four times during his six months at united , the chances of falcao being retained in the summer are almost nil
united have not seen enough to suggest he will prove value for money in the long run while falcao feels he has not always been given a fair crack of the whip by van gaal
after monday 's cup exit against arsenal , van gaal reacted with irritation when asked about the decision to sign falcao and release welbeck last august
welbeck returned to old trafford to score the winner in arsenal 's 2 - 1 win
last night welbeck said : ' united is a club that means so much to me
i 'm a fan and it 's hard to knock them out
i 'll always respect the fans
i had a lovely reception from them and i 'm thankful for that
