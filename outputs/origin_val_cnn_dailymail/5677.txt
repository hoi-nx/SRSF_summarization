bank provoked fury last night after handing out lavish bonuses â including an Â£ 859,000 windfall to its former boss
the state - backed lender âs annual pay report showed 110 staff received more than 1million euros ( Â£ 720,000 ) last year , despite it racking up a Â£ 3.5billion loss
this marked its seventh consecutive annual loss since the financial crisis , when it was rescued with a Â£ 46billion bailout from taxpayers
still on the books : stephen hester , left with a warwickshire hunt , is set to pocket a Â£ 1million bonus from the bank - one of around 70 , Â£ 1million - plus , payments in 2014 one of the biggest winners was former chief executive stephen hester , who pocketed Â£ 859,000 from a long - term bonus awarded in 2012
he handed in his resignation in june 2013 , after being pushed out by chancellor osborne
last night the awards were branded â excessive â and â unacceptable â , with campaigners criticising mr osborne for failing to stamp out fat - cat pay at bank
to avoid a new pay row , current chief executive mcewan waived his entitlement to a Â£ 1million fixed shares allowance introduced last year to bolster his basic pay package and dodge the eu bonus cap
this restricted his total pay for 2014 to Â£ 1.85million
mr mcewan has also waived his Â£ 1million allowance for this year
but yesterday it emerged he could still receive up to Â£ 3.9million for 2015 , including a long - term shares award of up to Â£ 1.6million that will pay out for several years
warning : boss ross mcewan admitted it could be several years until taxpayers finally get their money back after seven consecutive losses he will also receive a Â£ 1.5million â golden hello â shares payment in august to compensate him for bonuses he forfeited when he left his previous job at commonwealth bank of australia in 2012
finance chief ewen stevenson received Â£ 3.1million last year , including a similar Â£ 1.9million â golden hello â payment â this time for giving up for his old job at credit suisse
last night labour mp john mann , a member of the treasury select committee said the awards were â unacceptable â
he added : â here is a bank that âs not doing very well that the taxpayer owns and has underwritten , so why should these few not very successful bankers get paid so much money ? â the boss of bank âs so - called â bad bank â also hit the jackpot as separate filings to the stockmarket revealed he received a Â£ 2million shares windfall yesterday
cullinan , who is responsible for getting rid of the lender âs most toxic loans , was among seven senior figures to pocket a total of Â£ 5.5million from bonuses awarded in previous years
the generous payout for mr cullinan is particularly sensitive as he is responsible for shrinking the investment bank
there are fears that up to 14,000 jobs could be at risk
jonathan isaby , chief executive of the taxpayers â alliance , criticised mr osborne for not doing more to curb pay at bank , which is still 79 per cent owned by taxpayers
he said : â ultimately pay deals need to be approved by shareholders , and at bank that includes taxpayers
in the money : bank , which is based in edinburgh , pictured , has paid Â£ 7.6bn in bonuses since it was bailed out â the chancellor needs to be far more engaged in the process than he is now , and ask the board to justify these salaries
â until the bank is able to stand on its own two feet , rather than being propped up by taxpayers , it should show more restraint on pay
â mr osborne has admitted he made a mistake by not radically shrinking its investment bank when the coalition came to office in 2010
he was convinced by the bank âs former management , including mr stephen hester , that it could trade its way out of trouble
â i certainly regret that , â mr osborne told the financial times
â i did what i could to correct it
â mr osborne also said he would look to start selling off bank as quickly as possible after the election , but admitted this could take years
before the 2008 financial crisis , bank was one of the largest and most aggressive banks in the world
the bank was founded in edinburgh in 1727 , but by the end of the 20th century it was a major player in the city of london too as the uk capital became the world 's leading financial centre
bank sealed its place at the top table of uk banking in 2000 when it bought natwest , which dates back to 1650 and was considered one of the ' big four ' retail banks in the uk
goodwin , right , became chief executive of bank the following year and pioneered a gung - ho expansion strategy with resources poured into its investment banking division
one of the biggest deals came when bank joined a consortium to buy dutch bank abn amro for Â£ 49billion , which was later revealed as a major overvaluation
with the advent of the 2007 credit crunch and subsequent global financial turmoil , bank was exposed as being dangerously indebted and unable to meet its obligations
the labour government felt it had no option but to step in , and in october 2008 it took a 57 per cent stake in the bank in return for Â£ 37billion of new capital
as the bank 's losses spiralled and it required even more bail - out money , the state share of the firm rose to 82 per cent
it is now at 79 per cent
much of the blame for bank 's troubles was attributed to goodwin , who was forced to resign and subsequently stripped of the knighthood he had received in 2004 .
