' we were about to put it in the oven but then we noticed there was a bit of pastry missing and then we saw the maggots , ' he said
' we were going absolutely mad
' i will never buy them again
i will never buy a pie out of a tin again
it could have made my kids ill because at the start i just thought some of the pastry casing was missing but then i looked further
' so the maggots must have eaten it away
i only bought the pie days before
' the 39 - year - old said he fears the maggots may have landed up in the pie after flies laid eggs in its case in the factory
baxters , who produces the product , has not commented mr stuart pay said he would never buy another pie from the company again after the ' disgusting ' discovery mr stuart pay added he thought the maggots may have wormed their way into the pie when it was being made in a factory
' we think there may have been flies in the factory and they may have laid their eggs in the containers there , ' he added
the family bought the pie from their local branch of iceland just days beforehand
mrs pay said the store was however not at fault and that the responsibility lies with baxters
' i do n't think the store are at fault at all
they can not see what is inside the pies
' a spokesman for fray bentos said : ' we have been informed of the claims made by stuart pay & mrs pay regarding one of our fray bentos products and are treating their complaint as a priority
' ' our immediate request on being contacted was to ask for the product to be returned so we could instigate an internal investigation into the can and its contents
' as of yet we have not received the product therefore it is impossible for us to speculate further on these claims
