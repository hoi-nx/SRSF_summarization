unhappy : school headteacher philpotts has criticised the sweet shop for opening at 7.30am a headmaster today criticised a sweet shop which opens at 7.30am on weekdays - because it is leaving his pupils â hyperactive â in class
parents have been asked to stop their children visiting the shop in radcliffe - on - trent on the way to school after it emerged some students were spending their dinner money on sweets
south nottinghamshire academy principal philpotts , 40 , hit out after the sweet cottage opened 1,300ft ( 400m ) from the school gates less than two weeks ago on february 28
the married father - of - two said the shop - which opens from 7.30am to 4.30pm on monday to friday - is causing some pupils to become â disruptive â because they are high on sugar
mr philpotts added : â this has escalated out of control
i am just looking out for what is best for our pupils
there has nât been one specific incident that sparked this
â but students have been coming in late , and just generally becoming hyperactive and causing disruption
the shop is not prepared to acknowledge the effect it is having
â the headmaster , a former wolverhampton wanderers youth footballer , insisted that he wanted to continue working with the shop , but it would carry on opening at 7.30am each day
he continued : â we are asking parents to speak with their children about being sensible with their sugar intake and how they spend their dinner money
opening hours : the shop is said to be causing pupils to become â disruptive â because they are high on sugar letter : mr philpotts wrote to parents of south nottinghamshire academy pupils to warn them about the shop â we will continue to inform and work with parents to avoid any unnecessary disruption during school hours which impacts on pupils â behaviours and learning
â since the shop opened , teachers have reported pupils coming in with stained mouths and hands from the sweets they were buying and then eating
but the owner of the sweet cottage hit back , saying children have always taken sweets to school
he said : â when i was a kid i always took a bag of sweets to school
the headteacher was not invited to come to the shop , he came of his own accord and he upset customers
local shop : the sweet cottage ( in red ) opened just 1,300ft from the school ( in blue ) less than two weeks ago ' working with parents ' : the school caters for 520 pupils aged 11 to 18 and has been rated ' good ' by ofsted â it is just a coincidence that we open at 7.30am
we are not trying to entice schoolchildren in - and we will be opening at the same time during school holidays
â in his letter to parents , which was sent out last friday , mr philpotts urged parents to back the school âs unofficial boycott
it stated : â it is important to note that , as an academy , and in our role in loco parentis to your children , we do not object to sweets per se
â but we do object to students filling up on sweets before the school day has even started
â the school caters for 520 pupils aged 11 to 18 and was rated â good â by watchdog ofsted in its last inspection two years ago .
