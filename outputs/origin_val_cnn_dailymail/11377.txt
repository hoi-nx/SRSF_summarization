individuals and firms can already choose to fill in their annual tax return online , but this is simply the paper form on a website

they have only one opportunity a year to interact with tax officials to reconcile their account and notify them of any change of circumstances
the digital accounts will allow such updates at any time
it will mean users can see all the taxes they need to pay without having to complete a tax return , and pay taxes they owe when it suits them â by linking to their bank account so they can pay in instalments or by direct debit , for instance
there will be particular advantages for businesses , which currently have to pay different taxes at different times , including vat , corporation tax , income tax and national insurance
by early 2016 , all five million small businesses and the first ten million individuals will have access to digital tax accounts
all businesses in the uk and 55million individuals will have one by the end of the next parliament
those who have difficulty gaining access to the internet will continue to be allowed to submit paper returns , or be offered support
officials claim the system will cut the time it takes to complete tax returns from an average of 40 minutes to just ten minutes a year
the accounts will allow tax to be paid at any time and will radically simplify the payment of various levies for businesses
because the system will be automatically updated with information from employers , pension providers or banks , taxpayers will not have to submit duplicate information about their income
