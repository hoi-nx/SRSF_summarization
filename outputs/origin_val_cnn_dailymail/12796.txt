aberdeenshire , scotland in an exclusive interview ahead of his u.s. tour -- and ahead of his 10 - year wedding anniversary -- prince charles paid tribute to the " brilliant " way his wife , camilla , camilla , has taken on the " real , real challenge " of defining her public role
" it 's always marvelous to have somebody who , you know , you feel understands and wants to encourage
although she certainly pokes fun if i get too serious about things
and all that helps , " prince charles told cnn
the couple first visited the u.s. together as newlyweds in 2005 , and camilla was confronted by hardcore princess diana fans with abusive placards
polls at the time found that between 57 % and 73 % of brits opposed charles ' new wife being known as queen
if you go back even further , to 1997 , the year diana died , an ipsos mori poll put it at 86 %
reporter 's notebook : interviewing the royal couple but there 's been a change in sentiment since they married
a new poll conducted by comres for cnn found that only 35 % now oppose camilla being known as queen
nearly one in four said they liked her more now than they did 10 years ago
this coincides with a change in palace strategy -- away from the aggressive spin machine of the 1990s to simply allowing camilla to be herself
when she appears in public , she 's either seen supporting her husband or promoting a set of causes she has a genuine connection with
prince charles praised how his wife has handled herself
" she 's done an enormous amount for the whole issue around osteoporosis , which of course runs in her family , " he said , noting that camilla 's mother and grandmother both suffered from the bone disease
he also points to other issues camilla is associated with , including literacy and preventing sexual violence
the camilla , by sticking to what she knows and cares about , is able to connect with the people she meets , which does n't always come across on camera
when charles and camilla married in 2005 , there was huge sensitivity around the legacy of diana , who was expected to be queen herself
with this in mind , royal aides announced that camilla would not use the title of queen when charles becomes king
instead she would be known as princess consort
that still stands , although the public of today looks less likely to oppose the title of queen .
