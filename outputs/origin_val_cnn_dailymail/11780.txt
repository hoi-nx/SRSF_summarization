looking at someone who is overweight or obese can alter our sense of smell to make the scent of the world around us appear less pleasant , scientists have found
researchers discovered viewing images of fat people caused participants in a study to rate odour samples as smelling worse - even though they were actually fragrance free
the scientists believe the effect may be caused by inbuilt negative bias that many people have towards those who are overweight and obese
does looking at this image of an obese man on a bench conjure up a foul odour ? you may have an inbuilt prejudice if it does , according to a new study by scientists at the university of california , los angeles surprisingly they also found that those who had a higher bmi themselves tended to give the scent samples a lower rating
this suggests that people who have their own weight problems are perhaps also the harshest critics of others who are fat

now scientists believe they have discovered a way to â melt â the excess white fat in muffin tops by turning it â brown â
while white cells are responsible for muffin tops and flab in general , brown fat cells convert excess energy in food into heat
to make white cells behave like brown ones , researchers at the university of bonn discovered a new signalling pathway
by experimenting on mice , professor alexander pfeifer from the institute of pharmacology and toxicology at the university hospital bonn discovered a new signalling pathway for a molecule called adenosine
adenosine is known to activate brown fat cells , and is typically released during stress
the adenosine signal is transmitted by the adenosine receptor a2a
if adenosine binds to this receptor in brown fat cells , fat burning is significantly stimulated
the researchers transferred a2a receptors from brown fat cells to white fat cells in mice and found they started to burn more fat
dr ayako tomiyama , an assistant professor of psychology at the university of california , los angeles , said : ' you would nât think that not liking someone âs weight could then be seen in a totally different sensory modality
' it makes us think how else is weight stigma affecting our lives that we do nât even know about ? ' this is the first step in proving that the consequences of weight stigma could be very widespread in ways that we do nât even know
' the researchers conducted two studies by showing participants two sets of images of people who were either overweight or normal weight
as they viewed each image , participants were asked to smell a container of lotion tinted with different food colourings and rate the scent
each container was actually fragrance free and contained the same lotion
the researchers , whose work is published in the international journal of obesity , found that when images of overweight or obese people were displayed on the screen , participants gave worse ratings to the scent samples
images of average sized or thin people produced ratings deemed as more pleasant
writing in the journal , the researchers , who are also presenting their results at this week 's american psychosomatic society , said : ' the results showed that the substances were perceived to smell worse when they were paired with images of heavy individuals than when they were paired with images of thin individuals
the researchers say that subconscious disgust at obesity may be manifesting itself in people 's sense of smell ' the effect was most strongly manifested by participants with higher bmis ' the researchers claim the results could be a subconscious signal of disgust
previous research has shown that there is a connection between feelings of disgust and the perception of foul odours
it could also be associated with widespread assumptions that people who are overweight have problems with body odour
stigma in society against fat people can be a barrier to them changing their lifestyle , according to scientists rodriguez said that while some people are overtly biased against people who are overweight , others may not be aware that they harbour negative feelings
she said that bias within society may actually be making weight problems for those who are obese worse
in the uk around 62 per cent of adults are now considered to be overweight or obese while in the us 35 per cent of adults are clinically obese
a previous study by the same team in 2014 showed that girls who were called ' fat ' by the age of 10 had a higher chance of being over weight by the time they turned 19 years old
miss rodriguez said : ' it undermines people âs motivation to diet and exercise
' if anything , stigma is a barrier to these lifestyle changes that people commonly use to lose weight
' by being aware of our deep - seated attitudes regarding weight , we can begin to change our behavior
