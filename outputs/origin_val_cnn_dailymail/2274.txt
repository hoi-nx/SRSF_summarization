chelsea clinton and late night host kimmel teamed up monday in los angeles to push for serve a year -- an initiative that urges high school and college graduates to serve their communities for a year after graduating ' we know that the millennial generation wants to serve if they are given the right information and opportunities , and so i think that gives particular urgency to our efforts today , ' clinton said ' it 's great to see so many people , especially young people , dedicating yourselves to public service because you care about people and not because a court ordered you to , ' kimmel joked at the serve a year launch in los angeles on monday
' the goal of this mission is essentially to put less focus on yourself and put more focus on others , ' he said , according to the hollywood reporter
over the next three years , servicenation hopes that mission will be accomplished by portraying the perks of service in television and movies , according to the serve a year website
their hope is that , with the help of partners like comcast , airbnb and the clinton foundation , non-profits like habitat for humanity , teach for america and americorps will have both added resources and new recruits after word spreads about the merits of serving a year
