every election candidate should be forced to declare if they plan to take up second jobs outside parliament , the sleaze watchdog has said
lord bew , chairman of the committee on standards in public life , warned trust in politics had been damaged and it would be ' foolish ' for politicians to think they could ignore public anger
it comes as plans are being drawn up to curb rowdy behaviour in the house of commons , with mps facing bans from debates for heckling and swearing across the chamber
politicians standing for election in may should declare that they plan to keep second jobs once they reach the commons , the head of the sleaze watchdog has said trust in politicians was rocked again last month with the emergence of a new ' cash for access ' scandal
former foreign secretaries jack straw and sir malcolm rifkind were suspended from their parties after being caught by hidden cameras discussing the possibility of working for a fictitious chinese company
veteran tory sir malcolm rifkind also announced he would not stand for re-election in may 's general election , after he claimed mps from professional backgrounds could not be expected to live on their Â£ 67,060 salaries
prime minister david cameron insisted that extra work can be fitted in alongside constituency duties and mps voted down a labour call for a ban on holding paid directorships , consultancies or trade union roles
labour candidates have already been told they will not be allowed to hold directorships or be consultants if elected in may
lord bew , chairman of the committee on standards in public life , warned trust in politics had been damaged and it would be ' foolish ' for politicians to think they could ignore public anger mps caught shouting and swearing across the commons chamber face being banned under a labour crackdown on bad behaviour
commons leader angela eagle wants the speaker to be able to issue yellow and res cards to mps who behave badly
after a first warning , a rowdy mp could be ejected for an hour while a repeat offence could see them miss three sessions
it comes after complaints about the boorish behaviour in the commons and warnings it deters people from engaging in politics
labour mp sarah champion has claimed male mps are ' very good at gesticulating ' about female mps ' breasts and bottoms as they tried to make speeches
lord lord bew told the observer : ' all candidates for parliamentary elections should publish at nomination a register of interests , including paid jobs
' what we would expect them to be transparent about is whether they expect to continue with those roles
if the public feels that they have been brought into a decision on this matter , that can only be helpful
' ' it would be foolish to ignore that we are in a new and worrying place
this is something that could be acted upon
if the parties decided to do it quickly , they could do
' it is important for public confidence that the house of commons is not seen to be influenced by the prospects of personal gain
we just ca n't allow this malaise to continue
' lord bew expressed frustration that parliament had not taken better steps to clean up the system , despite consistent calls by the committee for measures such as a cap on outside earnings , another idea being examined by labour
' they are really riding for a fall , in our view , unless a more proactive approach is taken to these issues , ' he said - saying that voters increasingly saw politics as ' an insider 's game '
' we have been arguing for change in and around lobbying , and we are frustrated we have n't been able to get commons movement on it
we think that would have been helpful in the background to the current issues
' we definitely believe parliament needs to take a more proactive approach
' an opinium poll for the newspaper found significantly increased public support for increasing mps ' basic salaries in return for a ban on outside earnings - with the move now favoured by 40 per cent to 34 per cent
a year ago voters were mostly against the idea by 39 per cent to 36 per cent .
