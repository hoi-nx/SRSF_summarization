india âs groundbreaking mom has returned stunning images , revealing an enormous canyon and its moon phobos in orbit
the spacecraft itself entered orbit around mars in september 2014 , and has now started returning key data as its mission continues
this included the switching on of a new methane sensor yesterday , which has allowed scientists to measure the amount of radiation on the martian surface - and could help in the search for life
although phobos is the larger of the two moons , it is still only about 14 miles ( 22km ) across , and completes an orbit of mars once every seven earth hours
the odd colour of mars is due to the specific filters used by the camera the latest images , released by the isro ( isro ) , include a spectacular 3d view of arsia mons , a huge volcano on the surface of mars that has its peak 10 miles ( 16km ) high
volcanic despoits can be seen on the flanks of the mountain in the image , which was mapped from an altitude of 6,653 miles ( 10,707km ) and has a resolution of 1,824ft ( 556 metres ) per pixel
the isro ( isro ) has released amazing images from its mom ( mom )
among them is this 3d view of arsia mons , a huge dormant volcano on the surface of the planet
volcanic deposits can be seen on its flanks the isro 's mom ( mom ) , india 's first spacecraft launched to mars , arrived 23 september 2014 to study the mars surface and atmosphere and demonstrate technologies needed for interplanetary missions
one of the working group 's objectives will be to explore potential coordinated observations and science analysis between nasa 's maven spacecraft and mom , as well as other current and future mars missions
the team are also searching for methane on the surface , which could indicate signs of life on the planet
the mola ( mola ) instrument on the spacecraft was used to help map the topography of the region
an equally spectacular image reveals phobos , one of the two moons orbiting mars ( the other is deimos ) , silhouetted against the mars surface
although phobos is the larger of the two moons , it is still only about 14 miles ( 22km ) across , and completes an orbit of mars once every seven earth hours
the images were taken with the mars colour camera ( mars colour camera ) on the spacecraft , which weighs 2.9lbs ( 1.3kg ) and is used to view the surface of mars and its moons
in a close - up view of the surface , the mars colour camera captured a shot of the huge valles marineris â which at more than 2,500 miles ( 4,000km ) long is one of the largest canyons in the solar system , covering nearly a fifth the circumference of mars
the image was taken from an altitude of 15,000 miles ( 24,000km ) , with a resolution of about 0.7 miles ( 1.2km ) per pixel
a portion of the canyon known as eos chaos was also observed by the spacecraft , revealing fracture patterns in the surface
the images of the surface could help scientists understand the geological processes taking place on mars at a local scale

the images could help scientists understand the geological processes taking place on mars at a local scale this week also marked the return of results from the methane sensor for mars ( msm ) payload on the spacecraft , which will detect the presence of methane in the atmosphere
it measured the reflectivity of the mars surface , to work out how much of the sun âs radiation is reflected back into space by the planet
officials said they will not release the data until it has been peer - reviewed , though , reported sen. but it is the hunt for methane that is of particular importance , as it could indicate whether there is life on mars or not
dr syed maqbool ahmed , a former scientist on india âs chandrayaan-1 lunar mission said on his blog that the use of the msm was important as it proved the instrument worked
â this is like scaling mt . everest for an instrument specialist like me , â he said
this image , showing the limb of mars against the void of space , was taken using the mars colour camera from an altitude of 8,449km the isro 's mom ( mom ) , illustration shown , is india 's first spacecraft sent to mars
it arrived 23 september 2014 to study the mars surface and atmosphere and demonstrate technologies needed for interplanetary missions
