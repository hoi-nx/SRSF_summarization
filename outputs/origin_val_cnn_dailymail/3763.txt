she falls asleep suddenly up to six times a day often collapses in the street waking from her sleep - walking state , lynne hughes was horrified to discover she had punched her husband in the face , breaking his nose
but the mother - of - two 's outburst was not intentional or malicious
the 33 - year - old is a diagnosed narcoleptic , and falls asleep without warning up to six times a day
she has woken to find she has sprayed mr muscle cleaning products on vegetables while cooking dinner and has come round to find she 's made herself a sandwich
but for mrs lynne hughes , who also suffers the related sleep disorder cataplexy , her illness has a serious side
cataplexy causes a sufferer 's muscles to completely relax , rendering a person unable to move , while remaining fully conscious
and twice while lying paralysed and helpless in a cataleptic state the street , she has been targeted by heartless thieves
although she could n't move , the 33 - year - old felt hands raiding her pockets , removing her bank cards and mobile phone , while they pretended to help her
the conditions leave her prone to acting out her dreams as she sleep walks around the family 's home in mold , flintshire
the bath has been removed , to prevent mrs lynne hughes falling asleep in it , and she has stopped using a kettle
she said her ' life - changing ' sleep episodes are often triggered by laughing or crying
she no longer goes out alone and never carries more than a few pounds in cash in her bag
she said : ' it 's changed my life completely
' on a couple of occasions i 've been robbed
remember , i ca n't move but i am still aware so i can feel their hands going into my pockets
' it happened in chester in about 2008 and then in connah 's quay three years ago
' it was people pretending to help me but really they took my bank cards and phone out of my pockets
' i knew what was happening but could n't do anything as the more stressed i got the worse the cataplexy got
' i do not go out alone now
' narcolepsy , which affects about 30,000 people in the uk , can cause excessive sleepiness and affects the brain 's ability to regulate the normal sleep - wake cycle
cataplexy is a co-existing condition which brings on episodes of muscular weakness triggered by strong emotions such as laughter , anger and surprise
in mrs lynne hughes ' case it causes her to regularly collapse , often after she has been laughing or crying
' i 've had to have my bath taken out because i was n't safe to use it
i ca n't use a kettle either , ' she said
' my husband makes me a drink and puts it in the thermos flask
' mrs lynne hughes has had many bad experiences in public when she collapses in uncomfortable or unfortunate places
she said : ' people will step over me if i fall down in tesco
the mother - of - two , has woken from an episode to find she has punched her husband richard , pictured , in the face , breaking his nose
and the 33 - year - old has also sprayed mr muscle cleaner on vegetables while cooking dinner for her family
she said : ' it can be quite dangerous ' narcolepsy is a condition that affects around 0.05 per cent of a population
in the uk that equates to around 31,000 sufferers
it is a rare sleep disorder , which affects the brain 's ability to regulate the normal sleep - wake cycle
it can cause symptoms including a disturbed night 's sleep as well as excessive tiredness during the day
normal sleep falls into a regular pattern of rem ( rapid eye movement ) and non-rem stages
every 90 minutes or so , a normal sleeper experiences several minutes of rem sleep , where dreaming occurs
they then switch back to non-rem sleep
but , for narcoleptics , their sleep pattern is much more fragmented
this causes them to wake up regularly
in addition , rem sleep can come on very quickly during the day and night , producing dream - like hallucinations
cataplexy is an episode of muscular weakness triggered by strong emotions such as laughter , anger and surprise
the loss of muscle tone ranges from a just - perceptible weakening of the facial muscles through weakness at the knees , to total collapse on the floor
speech is slurred , eyesight impaired ( double vision , inability to focus ) but hearing and awareness remain undisturbed
attacks often last less than two minutes , and they may only last a few seconds
some people have repeated attacks of cataplexy which persist for up to 30 minutes
during both mild and severe attacks , the person stays fully conscious
cataplexy may be most severe when the subject is tired rather than fully alert and can lead to considerable anxiety although anxiety itself is not a trigger
it is thought that about 75 per cent of patients with narcolepsy have cataplexy
source : narcolepsy uk ' the narcolepsy makes me do other strange things as well
i 'll fall into automatic behaviour
' my brain will cycle in and out of a sleep state and my body will carry on going , so i 'll wake up to find i 've made a sandwich
' i have no fine motor skills though so i 'll have put about a pound of butter and a whole chunk of cheese on a slice of bread
' it can be quite dangerous too - i once sprayed our vegetables for dinner with mr muscle instead of frylight oil , but my husband noticed in time
' the 33 - year - old was formally diagnosed in 2009 , but suspects her condition dates back longer than that
' when i was a teenager i 'd start sleeping between lessons and my friends would wake me up on a rota , ' she said
' i just thought i was tired but looking back i realise that was part of it
' i 'm basically the text - book worst - case scenario
i had to do away with the bath because i 'd sink down and i could feel myself start to drown but i could n't do anything about it
' my husband used to have to be in the bathroom to keep an eye on me
' mrs lynne hughes hopes her story will help raise awareness of the conditions she lives with
' you either curl up and feel sorry for yourself or get on with it , ' she added
' my cataplexic episodes are triggered by strong emotion
' i can have a fall if i start crying or fall if i laugh
my little boy calls it a ' splat '
' during milder episodes my speech will slur
' when i had my little boy in january 2007 , during the pregnancy i fell down a lot
' i lived in a maisonette with two sets of stairs and every check up i 'd come in with a bruised hand , a bruised head or another bump
' after visiting a number of different specialists and doctors , some of whom mistook her condition for fatigue and depression , mrs lynne hughes finally recognised her condition as being narcolepsy when she was watching a documentary
she said : ' i just thought , " that 's me
" ' i went to my gp and was referred to a sleep centre in aintree
i was diagnosed within a few months
