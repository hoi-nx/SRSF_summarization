the 43 - year - old today host has filled in a number of times in the past when williams was ill or on vacation
guthrie was among the few tipped to take over permanently from disgraced williams when he was suspended for allegedly fabricating anecdotes about the iraq war
however guthrie , a former attorney who joined nbc as a legal analyst in 2007 , can not accept the spot as she is contracted to present today until 2018
the 43 - year - old today host has filled in a number of times in the past when williams , who is currently suspended , was ill or on vacation replacement : lester holt ( left ) has been raking in viewers to nbc 's flagship news show after he stepped into the role for disgraced anchor williams ( right ) who allegedly fabricated anecdotes about his time in iraq according to deadline , hoda kotb will temporarily take guthrie 's spot as producers grapple to find a solution to boost their viewer ratings that are trailing abc 's good morning america
guthrie 's time in the anchor chair was unlikely to be permanent as lester holt has been having no trouble reining in the audiences
viewer ratings shot up by more than half a million viewers on his second week filling in for suspended williams
nbc 's newscast averaged 10.1 million viewers in the second week of february , roughly 600,000 more than the week before , the nielsen company said
lester holt , 55 , has been with nbc news since 2000 and before that worked as a news anchor in chicago for 14 years
besides being williams ' chief sub for the past two years , he co-anchors nbc , weekend today and nbc on the weekends
he 's been placed in a uniquely awkward position , asked to right the ship for a company desperate to get out of the headlines , not knowing whether it 's a temporary position or one that could become permanent
' it 's tough , ' said veteran news executive rick kaplan , once lester holt 's boss when he was msnbc president
' he has to be very careful , because until williams 's future is outlined very clearly , lester holt is just doing the network a favor in a way
' he called lester holt a wise choice for the role
lester holt has unassailable credentials , works hard and does the job without drawing attention to himself , kaplan said
locked in : guthrie , pictured with chef todd english and lester holt , is contracted to present today until 2018 ' what nbc needs is quiet competence , and lester holt has that in abundance , ' kaplan said
' lester holt is someone everybody can be proud of
he is somebody the people of nbc news can be proud of and rally behind , because that 's what they need right now
' lester holt is choosing to keep his head down and do the job , not speaking publicly about his role
he 's an accomplished bass guitar player , but he 's not going on entertainment programs to show his chops or swap stories about the news business
williams could lose his job if bosses decide he has brought himself into disrepute after it emerged he falsely claimed he was in a helicopter that came under fire while in iraq
an investigation has been launched into his reporting , especially the iraq incident , which he said happened while covering the war in 2003
the probe is also looking into his reports about seeing a body floating by during katrina and his presence at the fall of the berlin wall
williams ( pictured arriving for letterman 's show in 2013 ) is being investigated by nbc news red bank , new jersey , 1970s in a 2011 interview , williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy
however in a 2005 esquire interview , williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies
in the same esquire interview williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling christmas trees in the sleepy new jersey town in which he grew up
a number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone ' stuck a .38 - caliber in my face '
berlin wall , 1989 tom brokaw was historically the only americans anchor present at the fall of the berlin wall
but during a 2008 forum at the ronald reagan presidential library , williams claimed he was at the brandenburg gate ' the night the wall came down
' and although in a 2004 interview williams said he arrived at the wall ' a day after -- more like 12 hours after -- tom brokaw did , ' at a gala in 2014 he stated : ' 25 years ago tonight tom brokaw and i were at the berlin wall '
iraq war , 2003 over the years williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an army chinook helicopter during the iraq war in 2003
last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire , an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present
williams issued an on - air apology and wrote on facebook : ' nobody 's trying to steal anyone 's valor
' katrina , 2005 williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from new orleans
he has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city 's french quarter â even though the area was n't flooded
the accuracy of other katrina claims , including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was ' overrun ' with gangs , have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster
israel , 2006 in a 2007 interview with fairfield university student television , williams recalled ' katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter i was riding in ' during a trip to israel
in fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire ' six miles away '
boston , 2006 a navy vet accused williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the armed forces so that he could appear on snl
on the day of the congressional medal of honor society event the nbc news anchor told organizers that a ' pressing engagement ' meant he would n't be able speak at the dinner , but later that evening he appeared in a walk - on role on snl 's weekend update
the 55 - year - old faces the possibility of being fired because of a ' morality clause ' in his contract that says his role can be terminated if he brings himself into disrepute
williams , who has been the nightly news anchor for 10 years , had recently signed a $ 10 million , five - year pact , page six reported
the defining clause in his contract said : ' if artist commits any act or becomes involved in any situation , or occurrence , which brings artist into public disrepute , contempt , scandal or ridicule , or which justifiably shocks , insults or offends a significant portion of the community , or if publicity is given to any such conduct
company shall have the right to terminate
' weekend anchor lester holt has temporarily taken williams ' place
the show has seen a significant drop in viewers since williams was taken off air
in a statement , nbc chief executive stephen burke wrote : ' by his actions , williams has jeopardized the trust millions of americans place in nbc news
his actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate
' his claims came to light after a show was broadcast , featuring williams describing how in 2003 he had survived his helicopter being shot down by a rocket propelled grenade
his account was challenged by people who were in the actual craft that was hit and it emerged the nbc anchor was in fact in another helicopter entirely , around an hour behind the targeted helicopter .
