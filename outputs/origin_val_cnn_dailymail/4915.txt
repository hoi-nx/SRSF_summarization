in an northeastern indian town , residents are dying of breathing disorders and skin diseases at alarming rates as underground fires that have raged for nearly a century continue to blanket the city in toxic smoke
the town of jharia , in indian 's northeastern jharkhand province , plays host to more than 70 fires which have burned continuously beneath the earth 's surface since 1916
here the infernos have been left to burn unhindered following a coal mine collapse in the resource - rich region - which produced a blaze so intense authorities have balked for decades at the effort required to extinguish it
villagers in jharia , jharkhand , warm themselves beside a fire made of coal scavenged from the vast mine miners work to repair a digger at the bottom of the open - cast mine , where fires have raged since 1916 the underground fires are spewing toxic fumes across the town , causing respiratory and skin diseases women scavenge coal from the area as a permanent shroud of toxic emissions blanket the sky a boy looks out over the mine which is eerily illuminated by the inferno raging beneath the earth 's crust a group of women carry baskets of coal back to their village to sell

toxic fumes - which include poisons such as sulfur , sulfur , carbon and nitrogen oxides - are a part of everyday life where coal emissions are causing devastatingly high rates of breathing disorders and skin diseases among locals
residents and children spend their days clamoring over the hot ground to eke out a living by chiseling out pieces of coal to sell at local markets
the first coal mine fire was detected in the area in 1916 and is believed to be due to a open cast mine not being correctly decommissioned
in the decades since , it has spread to become truly unmanageable
and despite repeated warnings that the town and surrounding area is on the brink of an ecological and humanitarian disaster , little has been done to help residents despite promises to move the entirety of the town

photographer johnny haglund visited the area last year for his award - winning photo project the earth is on fire and described feeling as though his skin was on fire
in spite of horrendous living conditions , he also witnessed children making their way through the area in bare feet in order to eke out a living from what coal they could salvage
he said : ' at the end of every day i had a layer of coal on my clothes and my skin and sometimes and i often felt like my face was burning , ' wired reported
' i had pretty heavy boots , but sometimes just walking around the soles almost melted off
' i saw young kids - six or seven years old - carrying coal with no shoes on , breathing that air
