a new bar opens today in an old abandoned air raid shelter from world war ii and it has been designed to resemble a vintage underground station
based in carnaby street , cahoots , will transport guests back to the 1940s , in a bid to bring soho âs illicit and nocturnal escapades from the era back to life
the pair are owners of the bunga bunga bar and maggie âs nightclub , which is inspired by margaret thatcher and thought that as the soho venue was used in the war as an air raid shelter , it would prove to be a poignant spot to host the bar
charlie gilkes of inception group said : ' we decided to open cahoots , after having been inspired by true events that occurred in post-war britain , and the venue 's own extraordinary heritage
' the site was formerly tatty bogle , an out - of - hours drinking club , first opened in 1917 by a group of scottish officers
' it was also used as a bomb shelter during world war ii and the wartime membership book contains names such as burgess , maclean , anthony blunt and buster crabbe
with cahoots we loved the idea of bringing the history of the place back to our visitors
' first timers are greeted by the station master , in character , at the entry kiosk and issued a â day ticket â to enter the underground station during the war a number of disused underground stations were used for shelter and inhabitants would bring their own nick - nicks and furnishings to feel at home during the raids
to bring cahoots to life , the pair recreated the vintage tube carriage using real london underground fabrics , and leather from the period
they also aimed to make the entrance as authentic as possible to the wooden escalators that would have been used in the stations
if the decor is not enough to inspire a visit , the extensive cocktail menu is an impressive eight pages long and vast amount on offer are priced Â£ 7 - Â£ 9
chose to indulge in dig for victory - style cocktails , drinks served in thermos flasks , milk bottles , as well as new variations of old favourites

inspired by gimlets , it is made from goose original vodka , garden peas , lime juice , basil , agave syrup , and a moã«t & chandon brut impã©rial nv champagne foam when you arrive at the soho location , you are greeted by staff who issue you with a ticket to board the underground tube carriage even the staff are dressed in character , with 1946 outfits , accents , nicknames with back stories as to how they came to work in the bar
