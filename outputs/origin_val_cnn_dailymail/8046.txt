romelu lukaku can score the goals to keep everton in the premier league , according to manager roberto martinez
the belgium international impressed while on loan from chelsea last season , but struggled initially after making the move permanent last july
a total of seven goals before christmas was fewer than everton might have expected from a striker they had just spent a club - record Â£ 28m on
romelu lukaku has been ' phenomenal ' in 2015 , according to everton manager roberto martinez romelu lukaku has struggled at times this season after his Â£ 28million move from chelsea in the summer but the 21 - year - old has scored 11 times since the turn of the year , finding the net in each of everton 's last three matches
roberto martinez puts that recovery down to the fact that romelu lukaku is no longer suffering the after - effects of helping belgium reach the quarter - finals of last summer 's world cup
everton are far from safe in the premier league as they prepare for sunday 's trip to relegation - threatened qpr
but roberto martinez feels that the goals of romelu lukaku will see them out of trouble
he said : he said : ' we made a big investment in him because we always felt that he 's a one - off
' it 's always tough for players after a world cup , and rom found it extremely difficult
' but i 've been so impressed by the manner in which he 's put everything together
' i think he 's been phenomenal
his performances from january have been impressive
' now the target is to see that in the next 10 weeks , and make sure he finishes the season really strongly
' rom 's becoming the type of player who needs one chance to make the difference
' he likes to carry that responsibility , which is something that goes with your character
he 's the full package
' the belgian striker competes with moussa sissoko during everton 's win against newcastle last week roberto martinez has no doubt that everton are in a relegation fight
last sunday 's 3 - 0 home victory over newcastle was only the second time his side had won in 12 premier league matches
he said : ' any team who have n't got 40 points in the final third of the season are fighting for every point
make no mistake about it
' it 's a massive period of the season for us
every point is going to be extra significant for the team
