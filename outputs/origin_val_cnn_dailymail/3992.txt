on september 1 a soyuz â fg rocket will blast off from the baikonur cosmodrome on a mission to the iss and alongside a russian commander and danish flight engineer will be english soprano sarah brightman - who is said to have already paid Â£ 35 million to fund the outlandish space trip
earlier today the 54 - year - old announced more details about the project and revealed some of the gruelling training she is undergoing at the star city in moscow
on september 1 a soyuz â fg rocket will blast off from the baikonur cosmodrome on a mission to the iss. alongside a russian commander and danish flight engineer will be english soprano sarah brightman
the singer is pictured during training at star city in moscow the trip will make her the eighth so - called ' space tourist ' who has paid millions for the privilege of bloasting into space
others include software developer and founder of canonical - which makes the linux - based operating system ubuntu - mark shuttleworth , and cirque de soleil founder guy liberte
ms sarah brightman will begin her 10 - day stint in space and on - board the iss on 1 september
she will be accompanied by colonel sergei volkov , a 42 - year - old russian who will be leading his third mission into space , and 35 - year - old andreas mogensen flight engineer andreas mogensen
however , she will still need to to receive the basic training all astronauts must endure before being allowed into space
at a press conference at the ham yard hotel in soho the 54 - year - old singer ( pictured left ) said her training lasts for 16 hours a day , starting at 6am , and this includes four hours of russian language classes
she will also need to undergo weightlessness training in the russian hydro lab ( pictured right ) a mock - up of the soyuz spacecraft used to take astronauts to the iss is pictured ms sarah brightman said her training lasts for 16 hours a day , starting at 6am , and this includes four hours of russian language classes
it also includes being thrown around inside a machine called a centrifuge at high speeds to adjust to the varying levels of g force the journey into space involves
this training is taking place at the star city in star city in moscow because the crew will travel to the iss on a russian soyuz capsule and need to know how to use it
it falls into three phases , which will last until the mission blasts off in september
these are general space training , group training , and crew training
general space training : this starts up to five years before the mission and involves survival training and a final exam
group training : during the group training phase , cosmonauts focus on learning about the soyuz and iss crew training : the final crew training phase then covers detailed vehicle operations procedures , iss training , and english language
at the yuri gagarin centre the training is broken into a further four sections : simulators , weightless environment training facility and a so - called ' hydro lab ' , centrifuge and flying laboratories
flying labs ( pictured ) help train cosmonauts to carry out specific technical tests of space equipment
in addition , the il-76 mdk flying lab was built to perform parabolic flights to create short - time weightless and low gravity environments - including lunar and martian gravity simulators at the centre is a mockup facility of iss russian segment designed to exercise skills of crews and ground personnel in how to use the systems in the segment
this includes a simulator of the zvezda service module , zarya functional cargo block , a model of iss russian segment onboard computer system and the iss us orbital segment ( ast simulator )
weightlessness environment training the hydro lab was set up in in 1980 and is designed to train cosmonauts in conditions of simulated weightlessness using water
once underwater they are trained how to test space facilities , carry out extravehicular activity and research
it is also fitted with full - scale mock - ups of modules , and cranes are used to lift and drop cosmonauts into the water
centrifuge centrifuges and centrifuge - based simulators are used to improve the cosmonauts â tolerance of g forces
when g - loads are applied regularly the body 's central nervous system adapts and can better manage blood flow , for example
the first centrifuge , called cf - 7 , was installed in 1973 and was designed to study the influence of spaceflight on the human body , reduce negative effects of acceleration , and test aeronautical and space engineering models

this is to help the three astronauts cope with the cramped conditions in the small capsule - like ship that will carry them to the space station

she will be the eight so - called ' space tourist ' to pay for an interstellar trip this training is taking place at the star city in star city in moscow because the crew will travel to the iss on a russian soyuz capsule and need to know how to use it
at today 's press conference the 54 - year - old singer said she was inspired by early space travel
â when i was nine years old i watched the first man on the moon , ' explained ms sarah brightman
â it actually changed my perception about life
â suddenly my mind opened and i started to really work on the career i have now
â i thank that moment , it was pivotal in my life
â i never really talked about it as it could never be a reality , it was all very abstract
â but it was always my ambition to fly to space , its something i dreamed about and wanted
â the future cosmonaut also rebutted a question about how the trip was being funded , saying â i paid for this myself , it was something i always wanted to do
â she added : â i ca nât currently say what the amount is
â at a press conference at the ham yard hotel in soho , ms sarah brightman said : â i âm just incredibly excited to go
â asked whether she planned to â be a starship trooper â she laughed and said : â i might when i âm up there do one of the movements from that - i âll see how it goes
â the joke made reference to ms sarah brightman 's 1978 top 10 single ' ( i lost my heart ) to a starship trooper
' she added that her ex-husband andrew lloyd webber had also been involved in her plans to become the first ever international artist to perform live from space , and the pair has recorded a song about her mission due to be released later this year
â i have mentioned that i would like to sing something from space , ' ms sarah brightman said
' i have been working a little bit with andrew lloyd webber who has come up with a line for something
' i have been working on various things , its finding a song which suits the idea of space , something that âs incredibly simple , because to sing in negative gravity is incredibly different to singing down here
â i âm trying to find a piece which is beautiful and simple in its message , as well as not too complicated to sing
â ms sarah brightman is shown left putting on her spacesuit

this seat is a mock - up of the one she will sit in during the soyuz journey this training is taking place at the star city in star city in moscow because the crew will travel to the iss on a russian soyuz capsule and need to know how to use it ms sarah brightman is pictured inside a hyperbaric chamber
hyperbaric chambers create an environment in which the atmospheric pressure of oxygen is increased above normal levels
the high concentrations of oxygen can reduce the size of gas bubbles in the blood and improve blood flow to oxygen - starved tissues scientists are also working on ironing ' out the technical side of how to make the performance work '
she went on to tell the event âs host , carol vorderman , that she has been studying hard and ends her day of lectures by getting a cup of coffee , some food , and carrying on studying
â the reason i do a lot of studying in the evening is really for my own confidence , ' added ms sarah brightman
â i want to understand why lights come up on the panel [ of the spacecraft ] , all the things i need to know
