that 's part of his game
he thrives off that , ' blanc said of diego costa
' he really needs that to bring out the best in his performances
' the most important thing is to not get caught up in the way he plays
' he will try to provoke a reaction
we need to stay calm , not get caught up in his game
we need to be as effective as possible in stopping him
' it 's up to us to try to take some risks , but not lose our heads and take unnecessary risks
' psg need to stand up and be counted
we also need to stay in the game

the psg boss said : ' chelsea have a slight advantage , because they were able to score an away goal
it 's up to us to try to do what chelsea did in paris
' one of chelsea 's main threats is the fact they 're very good on the counter attack , so i do n't think we should go gung ho
' we have to attack and we need to score a goal , regardless of whether chelsea get one or not
although injuries have hampered zlatan ibrahimovic 's involvement , blanc is sure he will have an impact brazilian defender silva sports a black eye after contact with dimitar berbatov last week ' i hope we do better than chelsea did in the first leg
chelsea created only one chance and they scored from that
i hope we create more than one chance
' blanc hopes thibaut courtois is busy , but beaten , in chelsea 's goal
blanc added : ' their goalkeeper 's performance was what allowed them to start as slight favourites going into the second leg
over the 90 minutes psg played better than chelsea

' he was very good in the first leg and i hope he 's not as good tomorrow night
' david luiz plays with a ball as his team - mates look on with stern glares as they prepare for wednesday night psg traverse the bridge turf under lights ahead of their bid for a champions league quarter - final place for all the millions they have spent - including paying Â£ 50m to chelsea for david luiz - psg are still to break into europe 's elite
blanc believes it will take time
' it 's very easy to talk about , it 's less easy to go out and do it , ' blanc said
' in order to progress as a club you need experience
psg have got a little bit more experience , but we 're still a long way off having the same levels of experience as chelsea
' chelsea took a long while to become one of the best sides in europe
they also invested a lot of money to get there
' we need to be patient
' in order to become one of the top four or top six sides in europe it does take time
we 've started that process
' diego costa ( left with ramires ) will try to get under the skin of psg 's players , says blanc one notable difference this season over last is that zlatan ibrahimovic is available to blanc
the sweden striker was injured last term , but will come up against chelsea captain john terry and either cahill or zouma
' i do n't think those two players ( cahill and zouma ) are going to be happy about facing zlatan ibrahimovic , ' blanc said
' he 's someone who loves the big occasion
he 's a player who can score at any time , in any venue , against any opponent
' i hope he shows that tomorrow night
