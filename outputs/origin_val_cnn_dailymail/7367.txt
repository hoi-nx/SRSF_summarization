a student at an elite all - boys high school has been advised not to bring his chosen partner to the year 12 formal because it is another boy
the student from brisbane 's school , also known as school , was told to ' keep with school ' tradition ' and bring a female date to the senior formal in june , the courier mail reports
headmaster dr headmaster said the formal was a social opportunity for male students to learn how to ' mix and mingle ' with ' ladies ' and the school had a strong preference they bring a female date
the student from brisbane 's school , also known as school , was told to ' keep with school ' tradition ' and bring a female date to the senior formal in june ' we want young men to learn from and interact with young ladies so these opportunities are very important in providing a well - rounded education , ' dr headmaster said
it is n't the first time the school has advised students against bringing their gay partners
several students raised the issue back in 2008 but were told to bring members of the opposite sex
the headmaster at the time , hensman , told the courier mail the issue had n't come up before , but was expected because of the ' changing times '
' not all students take their girlfriends
some take a female friend
it 's about protocols and decorums , ' mr hensman said
headmaster dr headmaster said the formal was a social opportunity for male students to learn how to ' mix and mingle ' with ' ladies ' and the school had a strong preference they bring a female date but the school school is n't alone , with the queensland catholic education commission saying they had similar models of behaviour in their schools
queensland âs anti-discrimination commissioner kevin cocks encouraged schools to be accepting
' i would encourage schools to be inclusive and be supportive of students at this very difficult time of their life , ' he told the newspaper
dr headmaster said the school 's governing body would not oppose a student 's choice of guest but the school 's guidelines and recommendations remained the same
' i think in the end , it really is a decision that a young man would make with his parents and his family , ' he said .
