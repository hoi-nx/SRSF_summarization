it 's long been known that ' health and safety ' has become a catch - all term used to mask shoddy customer service rather than breaches of the law - and now finally , we have the proof
from daffodils being banned on a village green to a chippie not allowing customers to put salt and vinegar on their meal , here we reveal what is not banned under health and safety - despite what some organisations have claimed
among the most ridiculous situations to be prohibited under the guise of health and safety were council parks staff ordering the small wooden canes that protect daffodil bulbs to be removed from the flower bed
the health and safety executive 's panel attempts to ' bust ' myths surrounding what are breaches of health and safety laws
among the most absurd it considered was a claim daffodils in a village green were a danger to the public this was because a member of the public complained someone could be hurt should they fall over onto the flowers
the health and safety executive 's myth busters challenge panel refuted it was a health and safety issue , stating in its decision that ' the request from the park 's department to remove the canes is completely disproportionate to the minor hazards presented by them '
in another equally absurd scenario , a chippie refused to allow a customer to use his salt and vinegar shakers to apply their preferred amount to their meal , as the chippie could n't be sure the individual 's hands were clean
the panel ruled this problem could be easily solved by providing a separate shakers for customers , or salt and vinegar sachets
and a third case involved the first nightclub in britain to ban selfie sticks
although the panel said the ban was entirely reasonable - it was unfortunate the club 's management used the smokescreen of health and safety to do so
more than 600 people approached the health and safety executive âs ( health and safety executive ) myth busters challenge panel in its first three years after being told â health and safety â stopped them from doing something
work and pensions minister , lord freud said : ' people have had enough of bizarre health and safety excuses
' the health and safety executive âs myth busters panel is quashing these ridiculous excuses and making sure people know it is nât the law standing in their way
' for too long businesses have been consumed by red tape and confusion , often feeling they needed to go beyond the requirements of the law , but it âs never been easier to understand the rules and make the right choice , without diluting protection for workers
