dolce & gabbana went familial for fall at its fashion show in milan on sunday , dedicating its collection to " mamma " with nary a pair of " mom jeans " in sight
dolce & gabbana and dolce & gabbana , who are behind the italian brand , sent models down the runway in decidedly feminine dresses and skirts adorned with roses , lace and even embroidered doodles by the designers ' own nieces and nephews
many of the looks featured saccharine needlework phrases like " i love you , mamma " and " per la mamma piã¹ bella del mondo " ( for the most beautiful mother in the world ) as a tableau vivant of moms and daughters stood and posed as a backdrop for the runway
even the usually stoic - faced front row could n't help but applaud and smile as a few models carried their own high - fashion progeny down the runway .
