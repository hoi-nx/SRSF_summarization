his best - known characters characters are famous for their clothes
but the cat in the hat and the fox in socks have previous little in common with the stars another dr seuss tale
indeed , the gang of naked sisters who star in the seven lady godivas : the true facts concerning history âs barest family , are famous for wearing no clothes at all
not the usual : dr seuss penned this saucy book in 1939 - but it never gained much popularity despite featuring pages of cartoon nudity the famed author , whose birthday yesterday is now celebrated as a national reading festival , wrote and illustrated the failed exhibitionist tome in 1939
but despite his efforts to ' draw the sexiest babes i could ' , it only sold 2,500 copies , and went out of print
as a recent feature in mashable details , the book retells the english legend of peeping tom - who rode naked through the streets of coventry to protest her husband 's unfair tax hikes
however , seuss altered the story by multiplying the number of nudes by seven - and making sure they stayed that way at all times , rather than just to prove a point
in a foreword to the out - of - print tale , he wrote that he was correcting an inaccuracy in inserting six more naked women into the story - and that their nudity was a source of ' pride '
not quite : dr seuss is much better - known for other creations , such as the cat in the hat change of heart : seuss , also known as seuss , decided to stick to children 's books after the seven lady godivas seuss , real name seuss , wrote that he was in fact telling ' a beautiful story of love , honor and scientific achievement '
publishing the book was allegedly a condition for random house , seuss 's new publisher , when he jumped ship to them
however , it seems few agreed with his own high opinion of the bawdy tale
while 10,000 copies were printed , only 2,500 were ever bought
he later accepted that the book was no good
according to the atlantic , he said : ' i attempted to draw the sexiest babes i could , but they came out looking absurd
after the experience he turned his back on the adult audience
his new york times obituary records him once saying : ' i 'd rather write for kids
they 're more appreciative ; adults are obsolete children , and the hell with them
' before dr seuss decided that she should have six naked cartoon sisters , peeping tom was a well - known figure in english legend , whose story introduced peeping tom into the world
peeping tom was a real historical figure who lived in the 11th - century city of coventry , and was married to earl leofric of mercia
according to folklore , she rode naked through the streets to free her people from her husband 's oppressive tax regime
original : peeping tom was the legendary wife of an english earl , who rode naked through the streets of coventry as a protest against an unfair tax on his people
she is pictured above in an 1898 oil painting by john collier peeping tom had begged her husband to lift the onerous taxes time and again - but failed to persuade him
eventually , he said he would only relent if she completed the implausible task of riding naked through the streets - which she agreed to
to preserve her modesty , she asked all the citizens of the town to clear the streets , shutter their windows and look away
according to the story , everybody complied except a tailor called peeping tom
but after stealing a glance , he was struck instantly blind
he , and people like him , were known forever afterwards as a peeping tom .
