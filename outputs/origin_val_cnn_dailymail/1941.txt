at school , while the other boys played football , he drew sketches of women in fishnet tights
he said : ' my teacher made me put my hand out and hit me , she then pinned the sketch on my back and made me parade around the class
she wanted to humiliate me
but in the end , all the boys were saying " can you do a sketch for me ! "
' it showed me that it could be a passport and it could open doors and people could love me
so i went on to sketch and sketch and sketch and then made clothes

he said : ' i always found it strange that models were told to be beautiful and shut up
i find that very scandalous
