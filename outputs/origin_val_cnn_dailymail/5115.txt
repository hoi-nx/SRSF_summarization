un investigators have found evidence isis are committing genocide against the yazidi minority in iraqi
the human rights office published a horrifying report describing killings , torture , rape , sexual slavery and the use of child soldiers by the extremists , suggesting they may be guilty of ' war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide
' the report , based on interviews with more than 100 witnesses and survivors of attacks in iraqi between june 2014 and february 2015 , highlights brutal isis attacks on the yazidi
isis , which controls a swathe of territory in iraqi and neighbouring syria , launched a series of systematic and widespread attacks on the yazidi minority 's heartland in the northern nineveh province last august
the jihadists consistently separated out men and boys over the age of 14 to be executed , while younger boys were forced to become child solders and women and girls were abducted as the ' spoils of war ' , according to the investigators
head of the investigation , nagra , said : ' these attacks were aimed at destroying the yazidi as a group , ' suggesting isis was guilty of ' genocide ' against the minority
the report , which was ordered by the un human rights council last september following a request from the iraqi government , pointed out that some villages ' were entirely emptied of their yazidi population
' evidence of genoside : a mass grave containing the remains of members of the yazidi community was discovered by kurdish forces near the iraqi village of sinuni in february many yazidi women and girls were sold into sexual slavery or handed over to is members as ' gifts ' , the report said , adding that witnesses had described hearing girls as young as six screaming for help as they were raped in a house used by is fighters
boys as young as eight were forced to convert to islam and given religious and military training , including being forced to watch videos of beheadings , the report said
' one of the most shocking thing was how organised the attacks have been , ' nagra told reporters
the yazidi at first thought they would be given the same choice as christians in places overrun by the jihadists : to convert to islam , pay a tax or leave
but then the fighters received orders via telephone , and suddenly the men and older boys were being marched off to be executed
' there was a clear chain of command , ' she said
innocent : a yazidi child whose family fled a 2014 offensive by islamic state militants at the dohuk shelter for displaced civilians in iraqi 's autonomous kurdish region according to witness and victim testimony , foreign fighters from at least 10 countries , including a couple of westerners , had taken part in the attacks , as had some people from neighbouring villages
the yazidi , whose ancient religion has elements of christianity , islam and zoroastrianism , are considered to be devil worshippers by the sunni muslim militants
other religious and ethnic groups have also been targeted , according to the report , including christians , turkmen , kurdish and shia
' no community has been spared , ' said nagra , pointing to the thousands of christians who fled their homes last june after being ordered by is fighters to convert to islam , pay a tax or leave
is fighters attacked the badoush prison that month , dividing the 3,000 inmates into groups , freeing the sunnis and loading the remaining 600 mainly shia inmates onto trucks , before driving them to a ravine and shooting them
the jihadists have also ruthlessly targeted anyone perceived to be connected with the iraqi government , the report said , pointing to the massacre last june of up to 1,700 cadets from the speicher army base , after they reportedly surrendered
one witness had described how the cadets were either shot or beheaded , and said he had seen several is fighters ' kicking heads around like footballs , ' nagra said
displaced : thousands of yazidi fled across the border into syria as the religious minority were subjected to mass killing , torture and rape during a 2014 offensive by islamic state militants in northern iraqi outcry : iraqi kurdish protesters hold placards and shout slogans denouncing the isis threat to yazidi women and girls during a 2014 demonstration outside the un offices in arbil faced with the horrific scope and details of these crimes , the investigators urged the iraqi government to allow the cases to be tried before the international criminal court
they also called on the un security council to refer the cases to the international court
' ensuring that there 's no impunity , that there will be accountability ' is of the utmost importance , said hanny megally , who heads the un rights office 's middle east branch
the investigators meanwhile said iraqi security forces and affiliated militia had also been accused of a range of serious crimes during their operations against is
a separate un investigation into the situation in neighbouring syria has also found that is was committing large - scale atrocities in the war - ravaged country , likely amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity .
