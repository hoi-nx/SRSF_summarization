a cat got his head stuck in an outdoor toilet and had to spend a night in subzero temperatures before being rescued by firefighters
the black moggy was discovered in a public toilet in simferopol , on the crimea peninsula , by a resident taking her rubbish out to a bin
rescuers were called quickly - but they had to lift him by the tail and use a pole and hammer to remove him
' the next morning i went out to empty some rubbish and i could still hear it so i followed the noise into the toilet and saw this poor animal with its bottom in the air and its head down the loo
' he was shivering with cold
i am surprised he did n't freeze to death during the night as it had been so cold
' rescuers used a long black pole and a small hammer to chip away a section of ceramic
once they got a section free they delicately tugged the rest of the base from around the cat 's neck
once they got a section free they delicately tugged the rest of the base from around the black cat 's neck at one point it did n't look like the base of the toilet would ever come off - but luckily it did one of the rescuers , alexey petrenko , said they had to be careful not to break the cat 's neck
the 53 - year - old said : ' we gently chipped away at the surrounding area and i held him up by his tail while my friend freed him
' it took about two minutes and he was so cold he could barely stand so i took him home , gave him some milk and put the fire on to warm him up
' after two hours he seemed happy enough and back to normal and i let him go
' the whole rescue took about two minutes
the cat was given milk and put near a fire to warm up for two hours afterwards
