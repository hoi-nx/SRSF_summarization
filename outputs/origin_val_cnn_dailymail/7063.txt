organic kitty litter was partially to blame for a multimillion - dollar radiation leak at an underground nuclear waste dump in new mexico , scientists revealed this week
the energy department report on last year 's accident at the waste isolation pilot plant near carlsbad showed that a drum of waste containing radioisotopes like plutonium was improperly packaged at the los alamos near santa fe before arriving for disposal
the improper mix in the barrel , including the wrong sort of kitty litter used to absorb liquids , sparked a chemical reaction causing it to heat up and generate gases that dislodged its lid , spewing radioactive materials , investigators found
this barrel at the waste isolation pilot plant near carlsbad , new mexico , ruptured a year ago , resulting in radioactive contamination that shut down waste isolation pilot plant indefinitely culprit : the waste drum contained ' chemically incompatible ' materials , including swheat scoop brand of organic kitty litter health scare : the accident at waste isolation pilot plant exposed 22 workers to radiation in amounts not expected to threaten their health the radiation leak that began in the waste isolation pilot plant disposal chamber half a mile below ground february 14 , 2014 , ' did not result from a detonation , ' the 277 - page report released thursday concluded
the accident exposed 22 workers to radiation in amounts not expected to threaten their health , according to nuclear waste partnership llc , the contractor that operates the facility
the accident indefinitely suspended key operations at the site , the energy department 's only permanent underground repository for certain types of radiological waste tied to us nuclear labs and weapons sites
in september , energy department officials estimated the cost of the initial recovery of the dump at $ 240million and said it might be two years or more before it is fully operational again
' i can not say how high a priority it is to get waste isolation pilot plant reopened and operating
in general terms , it is critical for everything we do in geologic disposal of nuclear materials , ' energy secretary ernest moniz said at a senate energy and water appropriations subcommittee hearing earlier this week
the report confirms the agency 's preliminary theories about the cause of the costly mishap and also clarified that just one barrel of waste containing ' chemically incompatible ' materials - including swheat scoop brand litter , nitrate salts and a neutralizing agent - from los alamos was to blame
a worker drives a cart through a tunnel inside the waste isolation pilot plant no. 2 , 150 feet below the surface near carlsbad , new mexico the improper mix of chemicals sparked a reaction causing it to heat up and generate gases that dislodged its lid , spewing radioactive materials the drum of waste that caused the leak came from the los alamos ( pictured ) new mexico slapped the energy department with $ 54million in fines in december for violations of state hazardous waste permits tied to waste isolation pilot plant and the los alamos lab. also last year , a team of federal inspectors released a report that cited chronic lapses in safety procedures at los alamos that contributed to the radiation leak
the lab 's ' waste processing and safety - related control procedures should have prevented the addition of these potentially incompatible materials , ' the inspectors said of the ruptured waste barrel .
