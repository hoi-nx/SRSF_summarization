it looks like the aftermath of an earthquake in suburbia
but this broken brickwork is actually the result of a botched building job that brought the house down on a couple âs plan for a basement extension
goldswain and his eight months pregnant fiancÃ©e hale fled for their lives when the building cracked in half , escaping from their ground floor flat with their upstairs neighbours as debris fell â like something out of a disaster movie â
that was just the start of their nightmare
for although the builders were found by a judge to have been â incompetent â and were ordered to pay Â£ 287,000 damages , the firm is believed to be insolvent , the high court heard
and while the couple had buildings cover , the insurance company has so far refused to pay up
now the pair fear they will never see their money â and they are still saddled with a 23 - year mortgage on the Â£ 345,000 flat
edward goldswain and his partner jacqueline hale , who was eight months pregnant at the time , were planning to extend their Â£ 345,000 ground - floor flat into the basement of this property in finchley , north london , when disaster struck mr goldswain said aims plumbing & building services ltd were paid to do the work , but he and his partner soon noticed cracks appearing in the walls of the edwardian home after a bout of heavy rain mr goldswain said he noticed the cracks widening dramatically
the pair alerted their upstairs neighbour and all of them were forced to flee as the building fell down into the basement yesterday 39 - year - old investment banker miss hale described how , in ten or 20 seconds , cracks in the wall went from 1cm wide to 10cm before one side of the building fell away
the trauma caused her early contractions and she had to be taken to hospital
the baby boy was born unharmed six weeks later
miss hale and marketing manager mr goldswain , 40 , bought the house in finchley , london , four years ago and decided to extend into the basement
aims plumbing & building services limited began work in september 2012
it went wrong within two months and the couple sued
last week mr justice akenhead said the â overwhelming probability â was that the builders failed to carry out the work with reasonable care and skill
barnet council has demolished the building and made the site safe
and the couple â who now have a second son â have been renting as they contest the insurance company âs decision
miss hale said : â the good news is that we âre happy and healthy and we âve got two lovely kids
â the judge ordered aims plumbing & building services limited to pay the couple almost Â£ 290,000 for the destruction of their edwardian home
mr goldswain and ms hale were forced to move out of their dream property , along with their neighbour , and subsequent checks by finchley council revealed the house would have to be pulled down broken home : workers dismantle the property in north london after the botched basement extension
a judge today ruled that it was the builders ' ' incompetence ' which led to the collapse in tatters : the builders were ordered to pay Â£ 290,000 in compensation to mr goldswain and ms hale , but the couple were told they may not see a penny because the firm has gone bust all gone : the couple were forced to live a nomadic existence after the house was taken down ( pictured ) , moving through a string of temporary homes , but have now settled in harpenden there is now nothing more than a hole where their old house used to be , with supporting beams used to keep the neighbouring properties up edward goldswain and his partner jacqueline hale , who was eight months pregnant at the time , had to run from their flat as the house collapsed but the court heard aims plumbing & building services ltd is ' believed to be insolvent ' , so the couple may well never see any of the money
describing it as ' a sad case ' , the judge said the couple bought a lease of the ground floor of 4 stanhope avenue in 2011
they needed more space for their growing family and decided to extend into the basement , aims plumbing & building services ltd starting work in september 2012
however , it all went horribly wrong on november 24 2012 after a heavy rain storm , said the judge
cracks which the couple had already noticed began to widen fast and ' they could actually hear the fabric of the house tearing apart '
the couple and the upstairs tenant , who had a baby , hastily evacuated and watched as the building crumbled
' deeply shocked ' , mr goldswain and miss hale escaped with little more than the clothes they stood up in , the court heard
they watched as the flank wall first ballooned outwards before collapsing in on itself
the next door house was also badly damaged
heavily pregnant miss hale went into premature labour due to the trauma , although her baby was happily delivered unharmed
the council took emergency steps to shore - up what remained of the building and it has remained derelict ever since
since the destruction of their home , the couple have led a nomadic existence , moving between temporary homes , but have now settled in harpenden
and they suffered yet another blow when they discovered that the loss was not covered by their home insurance
they now face paying off the remaining 23 years of the mortgage , while dealing with the heart - breaking loss of their house , according to the evening standard
the couple 's lawyers argued that aims plumbing & building services ltd was ' completely out of its depth ' and ' not competent to do the job which it had been employed to do '
and the judge ruled : ' the overwhelming probability is that aims plumbing & building services ltd failed to carry out their work with reasonable care and skill '
' the firm had taken no effective steps to to prop up the flank wall or to lay a concrete floor slab which could have averted disaster
' however , the judge said aims plumbing & building services ltd had ' played no part ' in the case and was believed to be insolvent
the couple also sued engineering firm , beltec limited , who designed the essential structure of the basement extension
however , whilst expressing ' the greatest sympathy ' for the couple , the judge ruled that the company had not been negligent and bore no responsibility for the disaster
aims plumbing & building services ltd was ordered to pay Â£ 287,754 damages - although the couple are likely to face an uphill struggle in getting hold of any of that
denying claims they opted for the cheapest service on offer , miss hale said she considered quotes from a number of builders before selecting aims plumbing & building services ltd
she and mr goldswain checked references and chose a firm that said it had carried out basement extensions in the past
she added : â the builder did have insurance , which i made him get , and checked before he started
i also called the company to make sure he had it
but they also declined to cover him
â some neighbouring houses were damaged by the collapse , including one that the wall fell against
some of those neighbours â sued the couple
â they will be paid , â miss hale said
' everyone but us gets paid , basically
