the isis militant who appears in a video purporting to show a boy executing an captive israeli - arab is a french terrorist whose relatives include a notorious islamist who slaughtered jewish children and a woman who took her baby to join the violent extremists
essid has been identified as a well - known jihadist , and the half - brother of merah , who shot dead three children , a rabbi and three paratroopers during a terror rampage in the french city of toulouse
but the two , who are understood to have been close before merah 's 30 - hour stand - off with french special forces ended in his death , are among a number of extremists radicalised within the same family
merah 's sister souad is known to have travelled to iraqi and syria to join islamic state with her four children - including her nine - month - old baby
family : the man on the right of isis 's latest horrific video has been identified as essid , a french terrorist who is a member of a family with a number of radicalised extremists essid , a married father , was named by security experts earlier today , after he appeared alongside the young boy in a video claiming to show the execution of a so - called arab israeli spy
the man believed to be essid stands by the boy speaks in french as he refers to the attack on a kosher supermarket in paris in january in which four jewish were killed
' oh jews , indeed allah has gifted us with killing your followers in your own stronghold in french , ' says the man
however , doubt has been cast on the authenticity of the video , which is heavily edited
experts have questioned whether the boy , thought to be about ten , was really the person who pulled the trigger , supposedly murdering 19 - year - old muhammad said ismail musallam with a single gunshot
there is less mystery surrounding essid himself , who has long been known to counter-terrorism forces
' the similarities between essid and the man in the video are very clear , ' said an investigating source in paris
' plenty of experts have made the link
' terrorist : merah , essid 's half - brother , killed seven people - including three children - in 2013 shooting : the 23 - year - old targeted the ozar hatorah jewish school in toulouse , also killing a rabbi a french police source has also told afp , french 's national news agency , that ' we are checking ' the identity of the man in the video
essid , 30 , from toulouse , was caught in syria in december 2006 in a house known to shelter al-qaeda members on their way to iraqi

on his release in 2010 , he returned to toulouse - where he became a constant companion of half - brother merah
his father had lived with merah 's mother , and essid was close to the killer and his brother abdelkader
merah , 23 , would go on to wreak terror in the town , shooting three soldiers , a rabbi and three school children outside a jewish school , before being shot dead
radicalised : merah 's sister souad merah , pictured , took her four children to join isis last year horror : the family of muhammad musalam , 19 , purportedly shot in the isis video by the unnamed child , have said the arab - israeli was not a spy
