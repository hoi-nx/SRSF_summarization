an israel arab man who is shown being shot by a child in a recent isis video has no connections to israel intelligence , the country 's defense minister said wednesday
in the video released tuesday , isis claims the man , 19 - year - old mohamed said ismail musallam , is an israel spy
but israel defense minister moshe ya'alon denied the allegation on israel radio
the isis video shows mohamed said ismail musallam 's israel passport and claims he 's an agent sent to infiltrate the group
mohamed said ismail musallam 's family on tuesday told cnn that he had no ties with the mossad , israel 's spy agency , and had , in fact , been recruited by isis
mohamed said ismail musallam is an israel citizen of palestinian descent
" mohamed said ismail musallam told me and his brother that isis took him , " according to said musallam , his father
" they sent him money through the western union
they said you will have girls , money , cars , villas , paradise , but afterwords he discovered that there is nothing
" it was n't long before mohamed said ismail musallam 's family members did n't recognize him when they talked to him on skype
the man they knew as a kind and funny brother and son who was once a volunteer firefighter had grown a long beard and was carrying a rifle
his father tried to help him get home , sending him money and even enlisting the red cross
but his son never made it back to israel
about a month ago , said musallam said , he was told his son was taken by isis when he was on his way back and trying to cross the border
a video posted tuesday on isis - affiliated social media accounts shows a man who appears to be mohamed said ismail musallam on his knees , wearing an orange jumpsuit
an adult isis fighter and a child -- both in fatigues -- stand behind him
the adult , speaking french , gives a command to the child to go forward with the killing
the child steps in front of the man and raises what appears to be a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and shoots mohamed said ismail musallam in the forehead
the man immediately falls forward to the ground
the child appears to then fire at least two more shots into the body
an issue last month of isis ' english-language propaganda magazine , dabiq , included a purported interview with mohamed said ismail musallam and described his alleged work for the israel spy agency
in the isis video , mohamed said ismail musallam seems to be reading what appears to be a prepared confession , saying he is an israel intelligence agent working for mossad , sent to infiltrate isis
mohamed said ismail musallam 's family members said they believe he was coerced in the video , forced to lie about ties to israel intelligence
" mohamed said ismail musallam is not an agent
mohamed said ismail musallam does n't have a shekel
if he was an agent he would have lived a beautiful life , " his mother , hind musallam , said
" we could have been living a different life and i would not be working cleaning houses so we can live
" this is n't the first time isis has used children to drive home its message
an isis propaganda video released in january -- one that cnn could not independently verify -- shows a boy with a pistol apparently shooting two men in the back of the head
the boy then stands over one of the bodies , fires two more times , and later raises his pistol high
last august , a photo posted to twitter from an isis stronghold showed a 7 - year - old boy holding a man 's severed head and his father 's words , " that 's my boy
" isis has featured children as fighters before , calling them the " cubs of the caliphate " ( the adult jihadis call each other " lions " ) and has encouraged foreign fighters to bring their families
it has taken over schools to indoctrinate children
human rights watch says isis and other extremist groups " have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks , including suicide bombing missions
" cnn 's abeer salman contributed to this report .
