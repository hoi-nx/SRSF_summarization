the 66 - year - old lost his leg in a workplace accident 39 years ago and has a prosthetic limb
he said he had been targeted by cold callers selling products to ease joint pain , as well as receiving sales calls regarding solar panels , pensions and ppi claims up to eight times a day
he has also been hassled by scammers who tried to obtain his computer and bank details by claiming to be from companies like microsoft
mr tim esworthy , who lives in colchester with his wife pauline , 63 , said : â i âm absolutely appalled
â it is terrible â it should nât happen
they know they can target vulnerable people because they have their medical information
â whenever i have taken out any kind of insurance or bought any kind of warranty i have to declare my disability
now i wonder if they got ( my medical details ) through that
â it is quite scary to think of where that information is ending up
it is like big brother â they are watching you
â he said he received cold calls several times a day , some of which appeared to be targeted at him because of his mobility problem
â i âve had people calling trying to sell me some syrup that was good for your joints , â he said
â i said â i do nât want to know , do nât phone me again â , but she still phoned back several times
â we have had people call up more than once and say : â you âve got a problem with your computer , just give us your details â
â or â do you have a standing charge on your bank account ? â they said they would get my money back if i gave them all my bank details
â there must be plenty of people who fall for it
especially if they are targeting people they know have medical problems
â case 2 : the gran targeted bystairlift salesmen grandmother christine lewis was on a list of people who have mobility problems obtained by the mail and has been targeted by stairlift salesmen cold calling her
the 62 - year - old is recovering from a brain haemorrhage she had 12 years ago and was formerly wheelchair - bound
she said it was â disgraceful â her personal medical details had been sold and the companies responsible â ought to be prosecuted out the water â
christine lewis , who is recovering from a brain haemorrhage she had 12 years ago , was on a list of people who have mobility problems obtained by the mail and has been targeted by stairlift salesmen cold calling her she added : â if they âre selling that sort of information , the fact i âm disabled , surely that breaches my rights
it âs illegal so why are they getting away with it ? â they should nât have my information , especially if they know i âm disabled because they are targeting me because they think i âm vulnerable
â if people are selling lists with me name on that explains why i get so many ( cold calls )
â i âm a strong person but there are a lot of people who are frightened of all this
my neighbour is more vulnerable and she believes all these calls
â mrs christine lewis receives an average of two cold calls a day but sometimes as many as eight
she also receives calls and texts to her mobile phone
â i âm sick of them , â she said
â sometimes they get nasty with me
it âs non-stop - i end up losing my temper
â i âm quite laid - back but this really winds me up
i have felt like unplugging my phone but then they win and i do need to use it
â i âm not as disabled as i was but it can be difficult getting to the phone
it is always at an inconvenient time
they call as early as 8am and i âve had calls as late as 9.30pm
â i get so many calls from abroad , you think : â how do you know my details ? â â i find it so intrusive
it is coming into your home and interrupting your day
â case 3 : the couple plagued by 20 calls a day former builder foley and his wife sylvia were harassed by 20 or more calls a day from salesmen and scammers which caused so much stress mrs foley had to visit a doctor
former builder mr foley , 56 , has difficulty walking due to ill health and was on a list of people with mobility problems obtained by the mail
the couple , from rural suffolk , have even received calls from medicine sales representatives who said they â were aware â that someone in the house had a medical problem
they believe mr foley âs details could have been passed on by companies they bought disability aids from online
grandmother mrs foley , 62 , said : â it âs frightening
it is scary how much they know about you
â we were having about 20 calls a day
we have been getting calls and emails , they were mainly from scammers , asking for money
it is mainly people with foreign accents saying their name is david or john
â it really was horrendous
because we are in all day you do nât get away from it
they got me into such a state
â i was getting frightened
i was losing my temper over it and i was so stressed i went to the doctors
â but if you have got a disability and you live in a place like this you do buy things off the internet , so you are having to put your information out there all the time
â the couple nearly lost thousands when they fell for scammers claiming to be from microsoft who they allowed to take over their computer , but luckily they realised at the last minute and their bank suspended all their accounts
mr foley said he thought it was â crazy â his details were being sold but he felt there was â nothing â he could do
the couple have paid a company to block the cold calls but still receive â at least â three a day .
