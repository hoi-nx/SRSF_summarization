after years of battling depression , fern is now clearly feeling very comfortable in her own skin
since leaving this morning , the 57 - year - old has carved out a successful career as a novelist alongside her tv work and as she sparkles as this month 's good housekeeping cover girl
in the interview , fern talks about how she 's over worrying about the signs of ageing : ' my bosoms are dropping ? blah , that 's life ! ' she adds : ' i am vain about being as fit as i can be â not about my wrinkles
i âve had that conversation with myself about , should i do botox , should i do this , should i do that â and i âve talked myself out of it
i âm either going to look odd , or i âm going to look old , and i âd prefer to be the woman i should be
i âm 57 , and i look like a 57 year - old , and i âm happy
she says : ' i have nât had an episode for a long time
i âm cross that it âs been there and that it lurks around , but i âve started to understand it more
i reached a stage where i knew when it was coming , hurtling towards me , and i thought , do nât run away , just stand there , brace yourself , and let it happen
' because i knew it would pass
people who are going through their first or second episode do nât trust that it will pass â but it really will
' the 57 - year - old , who has just written her fifth novel , says that she is over worrying about ageing fern and husband tv chef phil will celebrate their 15th wedding anniversary in may
she says : ' phil and i have a really , really good relationship â every day we tell each other we love each other â and there are also times when we would cheerfully bash each other as well ! ' he âs been a very good father , stepfather and partner to me
he âs the only person who âs ever always been right in my corner
on the day we married he told me , in the car , i will never let you down
we âve had our moments â it would nât be normal if we had nât â but we âre very solid
' but life 's not always glamorous in the britton-vickery household
fern says : ' i rarely have make - up on when i âm at home
i âm at the co-op , i âm on the school run , or walking in the woods with phil and the dog â that âs real life
phil is a very handsome man , but at home , he walks around mostly just in his pants , without having shaved for a few days ! i âm not in the club of people who care about these things â i just do nât care
fern and phil , 53 , have one daughter , winnie , 13 , and phil is a stepfather to fern 's other children , twins harry and jack , 21 , and grace , 18
. with three children flying the nest it 's time for fern to focus on new challenges and she jokes about a surprise career change , saying : ' i might retrain to be a midwife
