arsenal star walcott appeared to contradict his manager wenger on thursday by denying he had started talks over a new contract at the club
wenger earlier this month said that arsenal had ' started early ' in trying to persuade the forward to sign a new deal
but , moving to deny reports of a bust - up between himself and wenger , walcott only served to further muddy the waters by contradicting his boss
walcott ( left ) has denied wenger 's ( right ) claims that he has started contract talks he tweeted : ' i do n't normally comment on false stories about myself but reports about contract demands & bust - ups with the boss are complete nonsense
' there have been no contract talks as yet and my current focus is not on contracts but on doing my best for arsenal
' yet , on march 14 , wenger said : ' the first contacts have been established with the embassy
we will see how that ( negotiations ) progresses politically
' walcott was difficult to convince ( in 2013 ) and that is why it took us much time
' we have started very early with him , but it was slow progress - he is very quick on the pitch , but off the pitch not always
' wenger continued : ' i always wanted to keep him and i still want to keep him now
walcott has only recently returned from injury and is struggling to hold down a regular first - team place ' i want him to stay and be a regular player and fight for his place , but no matter where you go if it is a big club you have to compete for your place
' walcott has recently returned from a lengthy absence caused by a knee ligament injury sustained in january 2014
the 26 - year - old england international 's current deal expires in 2017 .
