and while there is no toorak or malvern in the melbourne cheapies , they are still close to the victoria capital and wo n't stretch the budget much beyond $ 300,000
globally , sydney is considered the third most expensive property market behind only hong kong and vancouver , when it comes to housing versus household income - and melbourne fares little better , ranking sixth

the property on the great western highway is going for just $ 199,950
' now this is a basic entry level but you must remember that st marys has , on our numbers , risen 41 per cent in the past 3 years for units , ' he added

' capital growth will still be at the top end of our forecast this year of between 8 to 12 per cent for sydney , ' mr christopher said
' right now no triggers are there on the horizon to stop it
' ' the waterloo property is an interesting one
' that 's a unit in an area where the median is at $ 736,000 , so to get it for $ 380,000 is an eye - opener

' but he left , perhaps his best , for last

the number of australian residential property listings was steady in the past month , sydney reporting a jump in listings as more vendors placed their houses on the market , looking to make a sale after the summer beak , while some buyers backed away due to the high prices
' the key point that sydney right now is that it has less listings on the market than perth does , it 's crazy considering the population base of both
' stock is getting absorbed very quickly , it 's such a bull market , and property is taken out real quick
' a two - bedroom apartment in the inner western suburb of sydney , gladesville , under $ 500,000 they call the gladesville apartment , which is among louis cristopher 's top 10 bargain buys in sydney as a ' well presented two bedroom unit with a sunny north - east aspect , featuring a modern kitchen with stainless steel appliances and a breakfast bar ' he said from his company 's viewpoint , listings were ' at a record low point for past 10 years '
' over in perth they can not sell a thing , the market is falling away badly , the fly - in fly - out market is gone and that is causing a big rise in rental supply
' i 's different on the retail front because of the mining boom , retail rents went through the roof , they locked themselves in for five year leases and ca n't get it down , so prices stay high
' nationally , the number of unsold properties reached 351,843 last month , a modest rise and 1.6 per cent up from a year earlier
283 ballarto road at carrum downs , negotiations welcome at $ 329,000 for the 3 - bedder ' werribee , hoppers crossing and carrum downs are melbourne âs most affordable suburbs , ' said paul bird from the real estate institute of victoria ' overall there is no national housing bubble forming , except for sydney and parts of melbourne , ' warned louis cristopher from sqm research managing director of sqm research , christopher , said lower interest rates should continue to drive the sydney market and lift buyer demand elsewhere low interest rates will help to underpin investor demand for property , helping vendors to sell their properties , which will keep a lid on listings in those cities , mr christopher said

' we are seeing a very different picture in darwin and perth
the softness in those markets is expected to be ongoing given that the commodity downturn is depressing economic activity in western australia and the northern territory

' overall it goes to show there is no national housing bubble forming
except for sydney and parts of melbourne
