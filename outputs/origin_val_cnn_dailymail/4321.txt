saddened : eva gabrielsson has said larsson would have ' furious ' about the release of that which does not kill us , the fourth book in the millennium trilogy series larsson 's partner has hit out at plans to release a fourth installment in the dragon tattoo series more than a decade after the journalist 's death - dismissing it as nothing more than a money - making scheme
eva gabrielsson has said larsson would have ' furious ' about the release of that which does not kill us , which will hit the shelves in august to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the release of the hugely successful girl with a dragon tattoo
eva gabrielsson - the left wing journalist 's partner of more than three decades - has not only questioned the motivation of the publishing house , but been hugely critical of the author chosen to follow in her late partner 's footsteps
david lagercrantz , a journalist and author best known as footballer zlatan ibrahimovic 's official biographer , is ' a completely idiotic choice ' in her view
' they say heroes are supposed to live forever
that 's a load of c * * * , this is about money , ' she said
' it 's about a publishing house that needs money , ( and ) a writer who does n't have anything to write so he copies someone else
' larsson had , in fact , begun work on a fourth book centering on protagonists lisbeth salander , a feisty rebel hacker - turned - detective , and mikael blomkvist , an investigative reporter , before his untimely death in 2004
aged just 50 , he suffered a heart attack as he walked the seven storeys to his office , where he worked as a journalist and editor of anti-fascist magazine expo
the books were published posthumously , so larsson never saw how successful the books were to become : so far , they have sold more than 75million copies in more than 30 languages , according to publisher norstedts
however , eva gabrielsson , 61 , has dismissed any idea he had an overarching plan for the novels - a theory which has been used to justify the publication of this latest 500 page tome
she also revealed david lagercrantz had not seen the fourth manuscript , and ' started over from zero '
' everyone thinks there was some grand scheme but no , he had no plan for the first three books and when he started writing the fourth one , it was spontaneous
he still did n't have a plan , ' she said
if it were up to her , none of this would have happened
' i would n't have continued larsson 's work
it was his language , his unique narrative
' furious ? : larsson - who died in 2004 , before his trilogy became successful - had started work on the next book , but david lagercrantz , who has picked up the baton , has started from scratch with his version eva gabrielsson says she views lagercrantz is ' a completely idiotic choice ' to continue larsson 's work , with even the ' very literary ' title sitting badly with her
she said : ' [ he ] comes from a completely different background
everything has always been easy for him
he 's never been an activist
' eva gabrielsson , who met larsson as a teenager , added : ' let him dig his own grave
' for eva gabrielsson , the publication is a bitter blow - the outcome of a bitter battle against her partner 's family to manage his work
success : the books , which have sold millions around the world , have been made into blockbuster films following his death , eva gabrielsson wanted to manage his authorship to avoid its commercialisation , but she says she never reached an agreement with larsson 's brother and father and they now manage his estate
she says now ' there is nothing left to protect '
but eva gabrielsson , who only recently moved out of the home they shared as she tries to rebuild her life , believes the wrong things have happened - especially when it comes to the new book
' the worst thing is how saddened larsson would have been
he never let anyone work on his literary texts
' he would have been furious
who knows , maybe he 'll send a lightning bolt at the book launch
