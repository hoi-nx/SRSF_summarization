sam warburton is set to captain wales for a record 34th time in the six nations showdown against ireland in cardiff on saturday
simon talks to sam warburton and wales wing legend shane williams about the game which could decide the six nations
simon : you 'll become wales 's most - capped captain on saturday
what 's the secret ? sam warburton : i take it with a pinch of salt because there are more games now than 30 years ago
warren put his faith in me when i was quite young and he 's stuck with me
before i took up the role , some people said ' if someone 's out of line , then you have to give it to them '
rather than the roy keane approach , and as a tottenham fan , i like to compare myself to ledley king
sportsmail 's simon speaks to wales captain sam warburton and former test winger shane williams sam warburton ( left ) is set to captain wales for a record 34th time against ireland in cardiff on saturday former wales and lions winger shane williams believes his sam warburton 's side are still in the running for the title simon : ryan jones previously held the record , how do the two compare ? shane williams : to be captain , you have to be well liked by the players
sam warburton came in at the latter stage of my career and was much younger than me , so it was a little strange to have him as captain
but he impressed me straight away and , like ryan jones , he trained hard and played hard
simon : wales are still in the running for the championship despite losing to england in round one
are there shades of 2013 ? sam warburton : it 's going that way
our experience in 2013 has given us the belief that we can do it
it was tough then because all the wales teams previously had won a grand slam
ryan jones sat us down and gave us the belief that we needed
we 've had our one lifeline but we 've got the motivation that it 's still possible
shane williams : fate is always in your hands with the six nations , that 's what makes it special
it 's an open championship
ireland are favourites to win in cardiff but you ca n't write anyone off â one result can change everything
simon : jonathan sexton ran the show against england
how much of a threat is he ? sam warburton : if i 'm being honest , i did n't see the game live because i was watching tottenham v chelsea in the capital one cup final
i flicked back and forth to see the rugby score
but johnny is a massive part of the irish team
his attention to detail impressed me on the lions tour and he knew every move so intricately
he deserves to be known as one of the best players in the world
ryan jones ( centre ) previously held the record for wales 's most - capped captain simon : how do you defend against jonathan sexton and murray 's kicking game ? shane williams : the game is changing and there 's a massive focus on rugby league style kicks
when i saw the state of tommy bowe at the end last week , he had chased a lot of kicks and was very tired
it helps being six - foot plus when you 're taking high balls
biggar is one of the best in the world at kicking the ball in the air , running 40 yards , and catching it
it sounds easy but it 's such a big part of the game now
simon : who would you select in the welsh back - three ? shane williams : defensively , leigh halfpenny is the best full back in the world
george north is my first - choice winger because he 's such a talented footballer
on the other wing i would keep liam williams , who 's the form player in wales
scott baldwin and luke charteris were both very good in the pack against france â especially with the 100 per cent lineout â and i would n't make any changes for the weekend â¦ if it is n't broken do n't fix it ! fly half jonathan sexton ( right ) has been superb for ireland during this years 's tournament simon : can the welsh half - backs match the irish ? shane williams : i 've been very impressed with biggar and rhys webb
they 've made those positions theirs at the moment and they are able to take pressure off each other through their time management and kicking games
it helps that they 've been together at ospreys and they will have to be on top of their game against murray and jonathan sexton , because they 're the world 's in - form combination
simon : england were blitzed at the breakdown in dublin , are you putting extra focus on that area ? sam warburton : out of all the six nations teams i 've played against , ireland have been the most effective at the breakdown
i 've not been rewarded as much at the breakdown as i was last year
i have n't made as many turnovers as i would have liked
the post-tackle stuff is always an add - on after training and shaun edwards always barks at us when we 're doing it
it 's key to our game plan
simon : ireland have lost just twice in cardiff in 32 years , why are they so successful ? shane williams : in the nicest possible way , they take an arrogant approach and expect to win every game
they 've had players like paul o'connell , brian o'driscoll and ronan o'gara , who have been able to win these kind of games
they have belief and mental toughness
when they 're playing well , they build up confidence and are a very tough team to stop
wales head coach warren ( centre ) will be pitting his wits against fellow kiwi schmidt this week simon : what 's the key to countering that record ? sam warburton : like every international match , there are three areas : set piece , breakdown , kicking game
if you can come out on top in two of those three then that 's probably going to be the key
i think the breakdown and the kicking game will be the two key areas against ireland
we 're back at our own little nest in the vale and we 're back at home
after two wins , confidence is high
simon : warren vs schmidt will be an interesting coaching battle â how do the two kiwis compare ? shane williams : they both stick to the game plan they want to play
schmidt uses the players as a tool to work out how ireland are going to play , rather than trying to fit them into a certain game - plan
warren 's got a great way with people
he gets the best out of his players by taking the mick out of them
i used to come off the field and , with a glint in his eye , he would say ' oh you were rubbish today ! '
he loves the wind - up and he loves getting his players going
schmidt is very straight down the line
he says it as it is and gets the best out of his players by being honest
they 're different personalities but they 're both hugely successful
wales winger george north makes a strong carry during his side 's victory against france in paris simon : wales are still in the running â¦ how much of a world cup confidence boost would it be to win the six nations ? sam warburton : i do n't think the six nations will have much bearing on the world cup
in 2011 that was n't the case
the six nations did n't reflect our world cup campaign
last year 's autumn campaign finished well for us but that did n't transfer into the first game against england
i do n't think there 's much of a trend with wales
the most important period will be the three months we 're together in the summer
we 'll treat that like a pre-season
