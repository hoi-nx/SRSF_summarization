it was a coal freighter that overturned in a horrific storm in 1940 , sinking , along with the 32 crew aboard , 210 feet below the surface of lake michigan , just off the coast of pentwater
while the shipwreck of the ss william b. davock was finally found , upside down , by divers in 1972 , an investigation into why it sank was deemed all but impossible , due to the murkiness of the water
a group of west michigan - based explorers believe they have determined what caused the ss william b. davock to succumb to the 30 - foot waves brought on by ferocious blizzard
the reason for its sinking was unknown wreck : the ship sits upside down on the shore of lake michigan , 210 feet below the surface and just off the coast of pentwater
because of the way it sits and the murkiness of the water , investigations were n't possible the msra ( msra ) , a nonprofit underwater archaeological organization , were able to make their way down to the wreck on a clear day last fall
the dive allowed for the first - known footage of the ship to be taken
the footage , taken by msra diver vos , of holland , showed a broken rudder and snapped propeller blade
' the waves were so strong , they must have snapped the rudder 's connection , at which point it swung so far over that it struck the propeller , ' vos told michigan live
' with no power or steering , the ss william b. davock would have been at the mercy of the storm
' the ss william b. davock had little warning the storm was to hit on november 11 , 1940
with 75 mph winds , 30 - foot waves and rain turning to snow , it is still referred to as ' the most disastrous day in the history of lake michigan shipping '
discovery : during a dive last fall , the msra ( msra ) , a nonprofit underwater archaeological organization were able to capture the first - ever footage of the wreck , determining a rudder the broke in the storm struck the propeller ( pictured ) taking coal to chicago , the ss william b. davock went down five miles out from little sable point between ludington , michigan and pentwater , lake michigan
another ship , cargo carrier the ss anna c. minch , also went down , along with all 24 aboard , while several other ships were damaged and ran aground
msra board member , rich , further explained what caused the ss william b. davock to sink
' it would have sent the ship into what we call a shivering mode , ' he told mlive
' without the rudder , it would n't have been able to steer and without the propeller working properly you ca n't drive it forward
' the ship would have gone into the trough of the wave sideways which would have swamped the ship
' ' x ' marks the spot : the shipwreck of the davock five miles out from little sable point between ludington , michigan and pentwater , lake michigan
the freighter was en route to chicago when it sank the msra was motivated to delve deeper into investigating the ss william b. davock after the waters of lake michigan started to clear in recent years
' we decided to give it a shot , ' rich said
" the divers did n't even use a light for the discovery
' it 's not as warm as it is in the caribbean , but it 's certainly starting to rival it in clarity
' it was a warm , sunny day
' the ambient light was amazing
' the ss william b. davock was a lake freighter that was constructed in 1907 by great lakes engineering works in st. clair , minnesota
