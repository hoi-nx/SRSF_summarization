minneapolis unexpected car repairs can blow anyone 's budget
but when you 're struggling to make ends meet , the impact can extend well beyond your bank account
as a social worker in minneapolis , heying repeatedly saw how car problems could create a domino effect that endangered her clients ' health , their jobs , even their homes
for years , she wished someone would do something about the problem
then one day heying realized , " oh dang , i think that somebody might be me
" in 2008 , she quit her full - time job and enrolled in automotive school
five years later , armed with a degree in auto technology , heying founded the lift
her nonprofit garage provides steeply discounted car repairs to low - income individuals
the approach is simple : heying sells parts at cost , with no markup , and charges $ 15 an hour for labor ; the going rate in minneapolis is around $ 100 an hour
the result ? big savings for her customers
and for those who ca n't pay in full , she will work out payment plans
to date , heying has provided affordable car repairs to more than 300 low - income individuals , saving them more than $ 170,000 and keeping them on the road to success
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for cnn heroes 2015 i talked with heying about her career change and what she 's learned from her work
below is an edited version of our conversation
toner : one day you 're a social worker , the next you 're in automotive school
what was that like ? heying : imagine a scene of a 38 - year - old woman and 18 - year - old boys
i want to talk about feelings and people , and they want to talk about cars
it was a huge culture shift and a huge knowledge shift
i had to use my brain very differently
i did not grow up working on cars
i did not have a father that wrenched on cars
it was not part of my life growing up
i taught myself a few things ( like ) changing oil
but for the most part , i had no skills around car maintenance
i cried all the way to school the first day ' cause i was like , " what have i done ? " so it was terrifying and overwhelming
and at least three solid times in that first quarter , i was like , " i 'm quitting
i can not do this
" see more cnn heroes i give credit , at least in that first quarter , to one of my instructors who 's now on the board of the lift , who kept saying , " i know that you have a good vision here , and i 'm going to help you get through this
" and when i really thought about it , going to school is nothing compared to people who are trying to raise their kids on minimum wage , who are living with a broken - down car in subzero weather
basically , i needed to buck up
toner : what 's it like being a mechanic ? heying : it 's physically hard
you find yourself in all sorts of crazy positions , digging under things
you 're wrenching on things
but it is mentally challenging , and it can be really frustrating
because you have all the pieces and for some reason , something is not working , and it 's like , " what is it ? " and to really think thoroughly and understand full systems and how those systems play together , it is , i think , way more difficult than i think the average person thinks it is
i think of being a mechanic a lot like being a doctor
people come in , they give you a list of symptoms
you try to ask a lot of questions to narrow it down until we get an accurate diagnosis
and sometimes we get it wrong , but most of the time we get it right
but it is an art and a science mixed into one
it 's a very satisfying job , when you can have a car come in not starting and you send it out the door running
at the end of the day , you can feel really good because you can look back and be like , " this is what i did today
" toner : you 're also helping some of the mechanics on your staff
how so ? heying : different members of our staff have struggled with poverty and crisis in their own lives
some of them have had interactions with the criminal justice system
two of the three techs that we have i met when they were both experiencing homelessness
and they are all trained , formal , certified technicians
and so that is another piece of the work that we do at the lift
we take a chance on folks who other places might not be willing to take a chance on
toner : you save your clients a lot of money
how do they react ? heying : for the most part , people are ecstatic when they get the bill
and that just makes such a huge difference in people 's lives
we had a customer in here a few weeks ago who is sleeping in his car
and he had just gotten released from the hospital because he had frostbite because he did n't have heat in his car
and so it 's not just about getting people to and from work or to and from school , even though that 's a really important piece of it
it 's really about protecting people 's lives
for many people , having a car that works and that is safe holds the rest of the pieces together
and it really allows them to remain independent , to remain self - sufficient , to meet the basic needs of their lives and do it with dignity
