2014 was the year of the beard , with fuzz appearing on every other man on the street
any male who could grow a non-patch facial hair has considered retiring their razor on the last twelve months
the general public are the only ones to have caught the bug either - celebrities have been just as keen to sport some bristles on their chin
but while david beckham has nailed almost every look he has tried his hand at ( apart from cornrows ) , the ex-footballer is n't well - suited to facial hair
he is n't the only one - ultimate eye candy brad pitt has also failed to pull off the style , appearing more like a hobo than a rugged gent
other stars have taken the look on with aplomb , including ashton kutcher , robert pattinson and calum
