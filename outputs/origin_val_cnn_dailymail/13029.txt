the attacked nun is under medical care
" physically , she is better

she is a religious ( and ) has consecrated her life to god and all her life she has remained a virgin
" the investigation into the burglary and rape is ongoing , and no arrests have yet been made , salim told cnn
a series of rape cases involving girls , foreign tourists and a physiology student who died following a brutal gang rape in 2012 has hurt india 's international reputation
crowds have taken to india streets to protest against rape
the nation 's lawmakers introduced tougher laws and punishments for sexual crimes and harassment
despite such action , india continues to see episodes of sexual violence
for instance , five men were arrested in kolkata in january and charged with raping a japanese tourist
police said the men operated as a gang and targeted single , japanese tourists
in december , an uber driver was charged with sexually assaulting a passenger
the incident that grabbed the world 's attention was the rape of a woman by five men on a bus in 2012
she later died of her injuries
anti-rape activists complained when the india government restricted the showing of a bbc documentary about rape that included comments from one of those men
he provoked outrage around the world by blaming the victim and saying the woman " should just be silent and allow the rape
" official data in india show that rape cases have jumped almost 875 % over the past 40 years -- from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011
but campaigners say sexual assaults are underreported because of stigma and cultural factors
experts say the causes of the high number of rapes include the nation 's patriarchy , widespread poverty and lack of law enforcement in rural areas .
