' larry had always told me that he loved me no matter how big i was , but then we split and he started dating someone much smaller
that 's when i realised just how much i had let myself go
' i knew i could n't keep eating myself into an early grave
' stephanie had struggled with her weight since the age of 11 , when she started comfort - eating after her best friend moved to a different school
she began dating larry at the age of 16 , and the two became engaged in 2007 after he proposed on a romantic trip to kenya for her 21st birthday

shortly afterwards , larry began dating another woman
stephanie said : ' it was bad enough that he 'd started seeing someone else , but knowing she was skinnier than me was an extra kick in the teeth

' the couple reconciled soon after and stephanie used her new sense of determination to join her local weight watchers group
she said : ' i wanted to keep larry interested , but more importantly improve my health and confidence
' throwing out all of the junk food from her cupboards , she filled her fridge with fresh fruit and vegetables

' stephanie hit her target weight a month before the wedding and walked down the aisle at 11st 1lb and a size 10 in september 2012
but under her dress , she was hiding an embarrassing secret : a huge sack of loose skin on her stomach

i 'd worked really hard for my body , but i had to hide it away by dressing like an old lady
stephanie , pictured with her mum at her wedding , hit her target weight a month before she tied the knot ' as well as being unsightly , my jelly belly caused itchy sores and even got in the way in the bedroom
' in fact i hated it so much , i nicknamed it ' flabby abby ' ! ' after two years of hiding her body , stephanie spoke to her gp and he referred her to a surgeon , who granted stephanie an operation to remove the skin on the nhs in october 2014
stephanie said : ' the day of the operation was nerve - wracking , so to calm me down , larry and i took bets on how much flabby abby would weigh
' both of us got a shock when doctors told us she 'd weighed in at an impressive 11lb
' breakfast : sausage and bacon sandwich , two hash browns , lashings of ketchup lunch : cheese and coleslaw sandwich dinner : kebab , followed by a mcdonald 's snacks : family - sized doritos , chocolate breakfast : weetabix , soya milk , banana lunch : chicken and feta salad with fat - free dressing dinner : chicken wrap snacks : apples , grapes over the next few weeks , stephanie 's stomach continued to heal and she could finally wear the clothes she had always dreamed of
now a confident size 10 at 10st 9lb , stephanie says she has never felt better
she said : ' i am so much more confident now
larry even jokes that he 's got a new wife because i 'm so much more outgoing
' looking back , i ca n't believe i ever let my weight get so out of control
i 'll never go back to being that big again
