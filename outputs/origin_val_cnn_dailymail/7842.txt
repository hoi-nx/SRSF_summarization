osborne is planning to lift the burden of national insurance on millions of workers in his final budget before the general election , senior labour figures believe
shadow cabinet ministers suspect the chancellor will seek to make a â game - changing â tax announcement later this month that could be funded by scaling back tax relief to wealthy pensioners
labour has been surprised by the tory â muted criticism of its plans , announced last week , to use tax reforms to fund a proposed cut in tuition fees from Â£ 9,000 to Â£ 6,000 a year
shadow cabinet ministers suspect chancellor george osbrone ( pictured ) will seek to make a â game - changing â tax announcement later this month that could be funded by scaling back tax relief to pensioners the party said it would cut the amount people can pay into a pension and get tax relief on over their lifetime from Â£ 1.25million to Â£ 1million , and reduce the amount that can be paid in to a pension with tax relief each year from Â£ 40,000 to Â£ 30,000
mr osborne has already reduced the lifetime allowance , which used to be Â£ 1.5million , arguing that it unfairly benefited the most wealthy
a labour source said a cut to Â£ 1million would fund a significant reduction in the threshold for employees â national insurance contributions
workers currently pay national insurance on earnings above Â£ 153 a week , or Â£ 7,956 a year , at a rate of 12 per cent , but it kicks in at a far lower level than the income tax threshold , which will increase to Â£ 10,600 in april
cutting national insurance would ensure that 1.2million workers who earn too little to gain from the increase in the personal allowance â many of them women with part - time jobs â would benefit
tory sources insisted senior members of the coalition had not yet met to agree measures ahead of the budget on march 18
the chancellor yesterday hailed a report from economists saying living standards in britain will finally return to pre-recession levels
mr osborne said the verdict from the respected institute for fiscal studies had â put to bed â several labour myths , saying incomes had been restored to pre-crisis levels , the wealthiest have paid the most towards deficit reduction and inequality in society has been reduced
cathy jamieson ( pictured ) labour âs shadow financial secretary to the treasury , said : â we need a recovery that reaches kitchen tables across britain , not one which has left working people worse off ' he said the findings showed britain had â reached a major milestone in the recovery , but it âs not the end of the journey â
â we âve got to secure a national recovery and must nât abandon the progress we have made at risk by abandoning the plan that has got us this far , â he told bbc radio 4
he said families had â paid a very heavy price for the mistakes that led to the great recession â under labour
â but the picture you hear , particularly from my political opponents , of the britain economy is not one reflected in this independent report - indeed quite the opposite
â what they show is that britain is growing , that incomes are rising , that the richest have made the biggest contribution , inequality has fallen ... britain is fundamentally in a better position than it was five years ago
â if you look at the rate of progress in the report today , if you look at incomes , they should be higher in 2015/16 than they were in 2010/11 , so on that measure as well we will have made progress
