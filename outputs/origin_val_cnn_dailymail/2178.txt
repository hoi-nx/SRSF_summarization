a retired teacher knocked his wife out with a dumbbell and then slit her throat in a ' mercy killing ' at their Â£ 390,000 home because he could n't cope with her dementia , a court heard
bennett , 75 , killed his wife beatrice , 75 , at their shropshire home after struggling to come to terms with her debilitating condition
his devoted wife of 55 years had been left unable to recognise her husband as a result of alzheimer 's disease and regularly called him a ' double ' or an ' imposter '
bennett , 75 , killed his wife beatrice , 75 , at their Â£ 390,000 shropshire home ( pictured ) in may last year mr bennett decided he wanted to ' end her pain ' and severely struck his wife with several blows to the head with a dumbbell fracturing her skull
he then cut her throat with a kitchen knife before calmly calling 999 and telling operators : ' i 've done a terrible thing , i have murdered my wife
' the pensioner was detained in a psychiatric clinic under the mental health act yesterday after previously admitting manslaughter at stafford crown court
judge simon tonking said : ' this was n't a premeditated killing
it was , in part , an act which you believed to be one of mercy
' the court was told the happily married couple , both retired teachers , were completely devoted to one another but were unable to have children
they were described as a very ' private couple ' who lived in market drayton , shropshire , and relied on one another for almost everything
he then cut her throat with a kitchen knife before calmly calling 999 and telling operators : ' i 've done a terrible thing , i have murdered my wife ' the pair had a ' happy and active ' retirement until mrs bennett , known as trixi , began to show signs of dementia in 2011
prosecutor deborah gould said : ' she was an enthusiastic bridge player and her condition first became noticeable whilst she was playing
' mr bennett became plagued with fears about their future , he became depressed , unable to sleep and was on sleeping tablets
' what undermined the world of this couple was age
' when he dialled 999 to hand himself in , he said : ' she has alzheimer 's
i hit her on the head to stun her
' i could n't see her suffer any more so i put an end to it
' she did n't recognise me as her husband
i have had two years living with this stress
' michael duck qc , for the defence , said : ' that which emerges most strikingly is the depth of affection between husband and wife , the way they had supported each other as individuals for five and a half decades
' on any view , a happy married life
he is contrite in the extreme
the pressures brought to bear on that particular day came together in a tragic few moments
' speaking at the time of the death neighbours of the couple in the picturesque market town expressed shock at the news
local resident paul dawson , 48 , said : ' trixie was very ill. i ca n't believe it was murder , he was probably trying to help her die
' it 's just not possible , somewhere like this
i 'm just gob - smacked
' another neighbour james mullineaux , 68 , a retired police officer , added : ' they were a well respected elderly couple just enjoying their lives together
