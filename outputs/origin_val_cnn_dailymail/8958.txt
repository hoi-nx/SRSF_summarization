my heart says it is new zealand to win this world cup final but in my head i have to go for australia , although not by a wide margin
the important thing for the event as a whole is that it has got the right final , involving the two best sides
i thought india were the one team who might just have a say but australia were too strong â both these sides fully deserve to be here
the reason they have both earned it is that they have played the full - on , modern brand of one - day cricket : powerful batting combined with wicket - taking bowling marshalled by two captains constantly looking to make things happen
it is the completely up - to - date version of 50 - over cricket â slightly different to what was seen from certain other teams we could mention
tim southee is relishing the prospect of facing australia in the world cup final on sunday aaron finch will hope to make an impact for australia in the world cup final everyone likes an underdog , and part of you wants to see the kiwis win because it would be great to have a new winner
they have played exhilarating cricket and you also get the sense that their whole country is really behind them
from an england point of view , they are visiting in early summer and to welcome them as world champions would really add something to it
but my head is ruling the heart largely due to the home advantage of australia playing at the melbourne cricket ground
to me that is a massive factor at world cups
the new zealand have played every match at home so far and i fear that it is going to be difficult to travel to a venue that is going to be quite different to where they have been playing
australia celebrate as they book their place in the final with a win over india in the semi-finals david warner thanks the crowd after winning the semi-final against india the ball has swung around in new zealand , but , with the drop - in pitch , that has not been so much the case at the melbourne cricket ground which , apart from anything else , is much larger than where they have been so far
on some of the grounds in new zealand even the mishits will go for six , and that will not happen this time
one of the more notable statistics of this tournament has been that mccullum has scored 85 per cent of his runs in boundaries , the remarkable kiwi captain is the most important single figure in this game
as a batsman he âs shown that he is looking to tee off virtually every time
new zealand captain mccullum has scored 85 per cent of his runs in boundaries he has made some dashing knocks in the earlier rounds without pushing on to a really big score
if he could do that in the final it would be huge for new zealand
he has been my captain of the tournament
he is aggressive without doing anything for show , but he may have to be a little more conservative in his field placings in this match , and how he uses the spin of daniel vettori will be key
apart from mccullum i like plenty of cricketers in this new zealand side , there are lots of tough nuts who are a bit unsung , guys such as daniel vettori , ross taylor and grant elliot
daniel vettori will play his last ever odi for new zealand in the world cup final the 100,000 capacity melbourne cricket ground will provide a fitting venue for sunday 's showpiece i do not expect them to choke , but i think australia may be building up to a big performance
the aussies have nât quite played their best yet and they have been more stop - start , with a game called off and the loss to new zealand
that will not have too much bearing in my view , and you have got to be impressed by the firepower that runs through the team â look at those late runs from mitchell johnson that were so important in the semi-final , for example
this could go either way , but home advantage should just tip it for australia
and it should be good for the neutral .
