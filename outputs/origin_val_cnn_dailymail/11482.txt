it 's all over and kell brook remains the ibf world welterweight title holder
jeff powell : kell brook 's red shorts covered that wound on his left leg but there was no hiding place for his challenger
jo jo dan was taking right hands to the head as if by habit and he went down for the third time from an accumulation of blows
make that a fourth , jo jo dan falling a split second before the bell
american referee earl brown completed the statutory eight count before agreeing with the challenger 's corner that enough was enough
jeff powell : kell brook was looking for the finish but jo jo dan managed to weather the storm at the opening of the round â and somehow fought back
the brook attack was relentless and jo jo dan reeled around the ring like a drunk , yet still made it to the end of another three minutes of hell
10 - 9 jeff powell : there were no signs of distress from that left leg which had been savagely severed
this time it was kell brook inflicting the pain
one sharp sent jo jo dan reeling
the next , an uppercut , put him down
the third sent him to the canvas again
only a mix of gallantry and clinching got jo jo dan through more punishment to the bell , which seemed more likely to have condemned him to a continuing world of pain rather than to have saved him
10 - 7 jeff powell : jo jo dan had pronounced himself ready not only to rumble but to ignore the sound and fury of the partisan sheffield crowd
he started brightly enough to suggest nerves might not be problem but he promptly pressed forward , playing into kell brook âs preference for counter punching
the home boy âs straight lefts over the canadian based romanian âs southpaw leads were especially effective and he was off to a good start
10 - 9 jeff powell : the motorpoint arena was packed to the tank - full , waiting to welcome the fighter sheffield believes can be its successor to naseem hamed
that atmosphere generator had to be restarted after the electric shock of seeing another son of the steel city , adam etches , brutally knocked out by his veteran belarus rival for the ibf international middleweight belt
the deeply experienced 40 - year - old sergei khomitsky drew etches into a clever trap midway through the third round , opening him up for the perfect right cross
etches went down like an axed tree , crashing his head against the canvas as he landed , and there were no protests as referee howard foster instantly waves his arms over the prone body and summoned medical assistance

the 28 - year - old 's sheffield homecoming has finally arrived
jo jo dan makes his way to the ring with a smile on his face and is looking calm and confident
kell brook has vowed not to make the same mistake as the man from whom he ripped the world crown
kell brook had been considered a convenient underdog when he went to california in august and surprised the incumbent champion shawn porter to wrest the belt by split decision
kell brook 's trainer dominic ingle said : ' shawn porter under - estimated kell brook and believed his own hype and then he was forced to admit he had over-looked him
' there is no danger of kell brook overlooking jo jo dan in the same way
jo jo dan has got into the mandatory position and he wants to win that title
kell brook is looking for big fights ahead but jo jo dan sees no reason why he should n't get them too
' kell brook is talking about fighting floyd mayeather or manny pacquiao , juan manuel marquez or brandon rios â in no given order â before a wembley blockbuster with amir khan sometime next year
nothing wrong with ambition but the first question kell brook has to answer comes in his home town of sheffield tonight
it has less to do with his undeniable boxing ability than with whether he truly is recovered from the machete attack which inflicted horrific wounds to his left leg
