a 22 - year - old college student whose disappearance had police scouring california for weeks said she was overwhelmed with personal problems when she decided to walk away
sahray barber , whose march 9 disappearance triggered a huge land and air search across california 's inland empire , resurfaced on march 19
she had spent the ten days living in two la - area hospitals under assumed names
barber called her father from a shelter after seeing news reports about her case and asked to come home
while she was gone , a huge search involving aircraft , dogs and horseback riders was being carried out by police
barber released a statement to the riverside press-enterprise enterprise on thursday trying to explain what happened to her
she said she had lost her job , her car had been wrecked and computer problems were causing her to fall behind in her studies at the art institute of california-inland empire
she wrote : ' things got so bad that i did n't know what to say or who to ask for help , ' i had dug a hole so deep , that i felt entirely hopeless
' she called her father from a shelter after seeing news reports about her case and asked to come home barber indicated that she paid little attention to media reports of the search while she was in the hospital , but was stunned when she found out all it involved
the young woman called what she did ' incredibly dumb '
she wrote : ' i ask for everyone 's forgiveness , most especially my wonderful family for all the worry and long nights i caused you , and all the amazing men , women , dogs and horses that searched for me
' on the day she vanished , barber walked out of her apartment , threw her computer and a few other belongings over a wall and left with just a few dollars in her pocket
her disappearance was even more concerning because two women had recently been assaulted on the campus of california state university , san bernadino , near barber 's home
san bernadino police chief burguan said the department will seek criminal charges against barber 's roommates
they gave statements to police that indicated barber had been killed , according to burguan
it 's possible that barber will face charges as well due to the scope and cost of the investigation .
