months after being labeled ' soft ' by one of australia 's cricket greats and being dropped from australia 's test xi , mitchell starc has been deservedly voted the player of the cricket world cup
mitchell starc 's worth to the australian team was never more evident than when he dismissed new zealand captain mccullum in the first over of sunday 's final
the new zealand innings never fully recovered and australia went on to claim an emphatic seven - wicket victory

' it was an amazing tournament and some outstanding performances , ' mitchell starc said
' new zealand has been a great team throughout the tournament and even set the benchmark , but i think we came hard today and ( that ) really led to this performance
