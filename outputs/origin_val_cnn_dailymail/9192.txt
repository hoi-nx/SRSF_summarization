parkinson may have snubbed mourinho âs offer of a handshake before the final whistle sounded on bradford âs shock fa cup win over chelsea , but the 47 - year - old will gladly borrow some of mourinho âs tricks as he tries to guide the league one club to wembley again
parkinson faces reading â where he spent 11 years as a player â at valley parade on saturday knowing that another upset would see bradford return to the national stadium in the semi-finals of the fa cup for the first time in more than a century
remarkably , he has already taken bradford there twice in the capital one cup final and league two playoff final in 2013
bradford boss phil parksinon ( centre left ) rebuffed mourinho 's ( right ) handshake during their fa cup tie parkinson did not want to be distracted by mourinho âs premature offer of congratulations when bradford came from behind to record a stunning 4 - 2 win at stamford bridge in january , before going on to take another premiership scalp in sunderland in the fifth round
but the bradford manager can not help but admire the chelsea manager âs win - at - all - costs mentality compared with some managers ( look away louis van gaal ) who are obsessed with imposing their â philosophy â on a club
â i like the fact that he will do whatever it takes to win , â said parkinson
â we are in an era of managers who sometimes their own philosophy gets in the way of what âs the most important thing to win each individual game
parkinson believes the big teams in the premiership are jealous of bradford chelsea were beaten 4 - 2 by league one outfit bradford during the fourth round back in january â mourinho sets up his team to win
the capital one cup final ( against tottenham ) was a good example of that
â for me , that âs what management is about
not just saying â we âve got good players , go and play â
it âs about what tweaks and adaptations are we going to make today to give us the best chance of winning ? that âs why i like looking at what mourinho does because he has great skill at that
â it âs one reason why parkinson is happy to let talk of the poor playing surface at valley parade carry on ahead of reading âs visit
he believes that it got into the heads of sunderland âs players in the last round and contributed to bradford âs 2 - 0 win
â i think more was made of the pitch for the sunderland game , â he added
â by the time their lads came to the game it was probably a bigger thing than it actually it was
we âd had a dry week and it was nât too bad
â if you look around , a lot of pitches are not in a great state at the moment and we âve got some good technical players
â we âve found that rather than saying â god , i just need big strong physical players on the pitch â , you need technical players that can handle the bad pitch and we âve tried to get our best technical team out there

the ambitious bradford boss has also modelled his managerial style on sir alex and was able to study arsene wenger âs situation while scouting for arsenal in 2011 following his departure from charlton
â obviously i âm ambitious like every player in the squad and every member of staff , â said parkinson
â you âve got to want to be right at the top of your game , and i âm no different
â there are many managers i look at
the arsenal experience was great for me because i âd just left charlton and they gave me the opportunity to work within their scouting network
â the longer that went on , the more senior premiership targets they sent me to watch
it âs a great insight into how a club like arsenal have to operate because obviously they ca nât compete with manchester city and chelsea so they had to look at the level underneath or the players that were nât obvious to everybody else
â i really enjoyed that and learned a lot from it
i got offered a couple of jobs within that period but i wanted to see that short - term through with the arsenal experience
â in terms of managers , sir alex is an obvious one
his leadership qualities but also the way he evolved as a manager
â myself and ( assistant ) steve parkin , the rest of the staff , try to have a modern approach with the way we do everything but with an old school mentality of discipline , honesty and commitment
we expect those old school demands from the players
â with sir alex and manchester united , you look at the discipline and the way the players drove on to the end in every game , and the pride they had in wearing the shirt , but also how he evolved all the time in progressing the club
i think he âs a great one to look at
â so having won the playoff final with bradford in 2013 just three months after losing the capital one cup final 5 - 0 to swansea , what are parkinson âs priorities this time around as he tries to take the west yorkshire club to the semi-finals of the fa cup for the first time since 2011 ? he said : â it âs difficult because when we had the capital one cup final , all the way i was saying â the league is more important â
but when we got to the semi-final we were on the point of making history
â i want to do both but at this stage , when you âre so close to being in an fa cup semi-final at wembley , this has got to take priority at the moment
