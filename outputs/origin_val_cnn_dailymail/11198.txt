australia : they âve done it again
that âs five world cups now , their aura disseminated on five different continents â asia ( 1987 ) , europe ( 1999 ) , south africa ( 2003 ) , north america ( 2007 ) , and australasia ( 2015 )
if they ever stage the tournament in antarctica , the rest of the world may as well save themselves the air fare
their story is a remarkable one â of swift , ruthless renewal and of the belief inherent in australian cricket that their natural position is up there , not down here
to watch them against new zealand was to watch expectation thrash hope
australia âs self - belief can not simply be transplanted into other cricketing cultures
but their refusal to tolerate failing systems can
michael clarke was the impressive leader of australia 's equally impressive cricket world cup triumph no team could stop the australian claiming yet another cricket world cup , this time on home soil less than two years ago everyone was having a good chuckle at homeworkgate and david warner
australia lost 4 - 0 in india , david warner swung for joe root , and mickey arthur was put out to pasture a fortnight before the ashes
while england creaked their way through a flattering 3 - 0 win that summer , convincing themselves that all was well with the world , australia âs new coach darren lehmann was thanking god for a schedule that would give his side a crack at instant revenge
australia âs nadirs are as low as anyone âs â they just last less long
it is inconceivable that they would tolerate , as england are in the process of doing , a period of failure that extends far beyond the dictionary definition of â transition â
for that , as much as anything , their latest cricket world cup win deserves an admiring nod
australia generally know when and how to peak
but their behaviour during sunday âs final means this admiration stretches only so far
not for the first time , we were reminded of a curious contradiction at the heart of australian cricket : while they have always been engagingly good losers ( better , in fact , than most ) , they are also deeply unlovable winners
brad haddin , who claimed he felt uncomfortable about new zealand âs niceness during the build - up to the group game at auckland , was at the centre of things , as he often is
after guptill was bowled by glenn maxwell , brad haddin felt the need to clap his gloves in guptill âs face
then , after the dismissal of elliott , brad haddin and james faulkner sent him packing with various snarls and grimaces
brad haddin clapped in guptill 's face after the new zealand batsman was bowled during the final elliott ( left ) was also given a less - than - sporting send - off by brad haddin and james faulkner ( second right ) a meme doing the rounds used both this image and one of brendon mccullum shaking michael clarke âs hand at the end of his match - clinching 74 to compare and contrast the teams â attitudes
even while they âre basking in glory , it should make cricket australia squirm
mind you , it was nât much of a surprise
the immediate postscript of new zealand âs win over south africa in the semi-final was the sight of elliott comforting the stricken dale steyn , like andrew flintoff and brett lee all over again
australia , on the other hand , gurned their way through victory over india in sydney , with mitchell starc harrying suresh raina , and david warner applauding from the balcony after his fellow wallflower virat kohli dropped brad haddin
for more musings on matters cricketing , please follow us on twitter : @ the_topspin the icc ignored all this â presumably because they did nât want to be seen to sully the tournament âs blue - riband matches
but they had already punished pakistan âs wahab riaz for his crude goading of shane watson in the quarter - finals â a set - to which at least had the merit of forming part of a stirring head - to - head
but sledging without context is even worse : the guptill and elliott send - offs just looked crass and cruel
sledging , we are told with wearying certainty , is part of the game
but when did it become de rigueur to cackle at a batsman who is already dealing with the disappointment of heading back to the pavilion ? merv hughes used to do it all the time , not least to hick
his rationale was that he was getting inside hick âs head before the next battle
in a six - test series , it made a sick kind of sense
brad haddin has no such excuse
david warner , ( left ) spraying beer at the mcg after sunday 's victory , is well known for his brash attitude the australian ' behaviour harks back to the example set by the likes of merv hughes ( second right ) no australian cricket - lover i know enjoys this sort of thing , though some on twitter claim with some justification that the poms are in no position to talk : see the life and crimes of anderson
but england fans are also aware that anderson âs sledging contributed to their team âs unpopularity during the years when andy flower âs side was doing well
when england âs wheel turned , there was precious little sympathy waiting for them on the other side
the same applies to australia
if there were neutrals out there who did nât want new zealand to win the final , they did nât immediately advertise the fact
and this had more to do with the fact that sports fans love an underdog
they also dislike arrogance , nastiness and sneering
you can admire the australian cricket team
but it âs a little harder to warm to them
a change of plan from now on the top spin will move from its weekly slot on a tuesday and appear more regularly , as a blog rather than a column
it will come out whenever there is a big cricket story to comment on , and sometimes even when there is nât

that was the week that was thanks boss ! regular readers will know of the icc âs bangladeshi president kamal , who recently endeared himself to his own organisation by referring to them â not unreasonably â as the â indian cricket council â
that followed bangladesh âs quarter - final loss to india , when kamal was convinced the umpires had it in for his team
now , he appears to be at it again , this time after he was denied the chance to hand over the cricket world cup to the australian team on the podium at the mcg on sunday
instead the honour befell icc chairman narayanaswami srinivasan , prompting kamal to huff about his â constitutional right â , duly â dishonoured â
mustafa kemal ( left ) is threatening to reveal icc ' mischief ' , despite being its president ominously , kamal is reported to have said : â after i go back home , i will let the whole world know what âs happening in icc
i will let the whole world know about those guys who are doing these mischievous things
â as president of the organisation he is threatening to rat on , kamal may like to ask himself why he has nât considered spilling the beans before
you could not , as they say , make it up
revolving doors kevin pietersen âs decision to pull out of his ipl deal with sunrisers could have a curious knock - on effect for england
it means an extra slot in the sunrisers team for both a middle - order batsman and an overseas player â and that could be good news for morgan
but it also lessens the chance of morgan being released for a few days to captain england in their one - day international against ireland at malahide on may 8
look out for the very short - term appointment of yet another england captain â¦ kevin pietersen ( left ) celebrated australia 's cricket world cup win with pal james faulkner best bib and tucker it âs easy to forget there were two australian captains at the cricket world cup : michael clarke â¦ and george bailey , who played one game , scored 55 against england , and ceded both the armband and his place in the side when michael clarke returned from injury
he evidently made peace with his role
spies in australia tell us that , 18 hours after the cricket world cup final , a bleary - eyed george bailey appeared at a civic reception still wearing the fluorescent bib that appeared affixed to him for most of the tournament
george bailey ( right ) chuckles at england 's misery during australia 's world cup pool a win
