birmingham staged a stunning late comeback to grab a 2 - 2 draw against derby as the rams missed the chance to go top of the championship
county had looked in control after jamie ward 's first goal since september and a tom ince strike had put them 2 - 0 up but birmingham silenced the ipro stadium by drawing level in stoppage - time through a paul caddis penalty and a clayton donaldson goal
it was not the result derby wanted on a day when the crowd stood to join in a minute 's applause before the game for former rams great and manager dave mackay , who died on monday at the age of 80

goals : caddis 90 +2 , clayton donaldson 90 +6 booked : cotterill , dyer referee : iain williamson attendance : 31,522 the opener came as will hughes played in johnny russell just inside the area in the 20th minute and , although his low shot was parried by randolph , jamie ward arrived to score with a cross-shot that struck the inside of a post and bounced over the line
will hughes rattled the bar with a left - footed shot from 20 yards following a short corner in the 27th minute and jeff hendrick put tom ince through five minutes later only for the winger to lose control
but the speed of derby 's passing and movement was starting to stretch birmingham and when jamie ward got away down the left in the 39th minute , cotterill was booked for a blatant trip
the half ended on a flash - point with birmingham boss rowett involved in a heated exchange on the touchline with several derby players after he felt johnny russell should have given the ball back to his team instead of kicking into the corner
rowett saw his team fall further behind three minutes after the break when will hughes found tom ince on the right edge of the area and he slipped past two defenders before driving a low shot inside randolph 's right post

rowett made a double substitution in the 64th minute but derby carried the greater threat with will hughes having a 20 - yard shot charged down after tom ince set him up
birmingham had a chance to pull a goal back in the 77th minute when the ball broke to clayton donaldson 12 yards out but forsyth got across to put the ball behind for a corner which grant held comfortably
the game was turned on its head in stoppage - time when robert tesche was tripped by tom ince and paul caddis sent grant the wrong way with the penalty
then , with the home fans screaming for the final whistle , birmingham won a corner which was scrambled in by clayton donaldson after wesley thomas hooked the ball back to secure a dramatic point
