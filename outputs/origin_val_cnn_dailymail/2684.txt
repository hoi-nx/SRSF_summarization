with five minutes gone sergio aguero embarked on one of his thrilling mazy runs deep into leicester territory only to be flattened on the edge of the area
if neville was watching , he may well have given a knowing nod
the former manchester united star spoke at length in the build up to this match about how manchester city are unbalanced in a 4 - 4 - 2 when they play sergio aguero , david silva and yaya toure
manchester city striker sergio aguero cuts a frustrated figure during wednesday 's 2 - 0 victory over leicester david silva jumps for joy and punches the air after giving manchester city the lead at the etihad stadium david silva proved his point - literally - sending the argentine tumbling to the floor before many had even taken their seats
neville 's wider point was that the trio - breathtaking when on the front foot but seemingly out of breath when asked to defend - are a luxury manuel pellegrini can ill afford when up against the cream of europe
with all due respect to leicester they are not the cream of europe , rather the dregs of the premier league , but they proved his point more than once at a pancake - flat etihad stadium
from the kick - off yaya toure wandered into the visitors ' half
it was where he would spend most of the match
the ivorian 's lack of an appetite for hard work did not go unnoticed among the blue - collar faithful
after one run , in which he was felled on the edge of the box but failed to win a free - kick , he stayed down for what seemed like an eternity
manchester city midfielder yaya toure appeared to go down for what seemed an eternity during the match sergio aguero is surrounded by the leicester defence as the manchester city frontman bids to make an opening by the time he got up , leicester were on the attack in the manchester city half
it was all too much for one punter in front of the press box who wasted no time in getting to his feet
' get up you lazy g * * ' was his frustrated shout
nobody told him to shut up
against cellar dweller opponents who have four wins from 26 attempts it was unimpressive stuff and perhaps an indication of why , before this encounter , manchester city had just nine points from a possible 21 in the premier league
it would be remiss , however , to deny that when it works ( and it has won them two titles ) it works well
for the opener , yaya toure 's surging run ended with a pass to david silva in space
his flick found an overlapping aleks kolarov and after some ping pong in the leicester box david silva prodded home
david silva prods the ball home past a sprawling mark schwarzer to give manchester city the lead in first half injury time yaya toure gestures in the direction of midfielder jesus navas during wednesday 's victory at the etihad stadium david silva also lofted two delightful balls over the visitors ' defence , one for a misfiring wilfried bony and one for sergio aguero
both strikers put their efforts over the bar but it would be very difficult for any manager to drop the graceful spaniard
neville 's point , however , was reaffirmed on 74 minutes
at 1 - 0 , nigel pearson 's plucky visitors should not have been in with a sniff
but in the midst of host of missed opportunities for the home side riyad mahrez hit a post
had that gone in it could have been title race over
as it turned out , sub james milner made it 2 - 0 after david silva had been replaced by frank lampard
better opposition , however , would have reinforced neville 's point even further .
