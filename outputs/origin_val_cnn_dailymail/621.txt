australia 's 17 - man squad to defend the ashes against england this summer is packed with pace men as well as a fair share of ageing stars
ten of their squad are in their thirties , paving the way for a raft of dad 's army references that will gather momentum if they get off to a bad start in cardiff
nonetheless , this is a squad that i would pick to defend the urn
never mind planning for the future , their tour will be all about the present
team australia celebrate after winning the world cup before naming their ashes squad nice balance my first thought when i saw the squad was that it âs the way i âd have gone about selection
a five - test series in england is not the time to experiment and the australian have put faith in experience
australia 's selection of voges will bring an experienced head with them this summer voges is an interesting choice : like chris rogers , he knows english conditions well
it âs not a tour for blooding a young batsman
it âs also why they âve gone with peter siddle among the seamers
if ryan harris breaks down , peter siddle can slot straight in
firepower if johnson bowls anything like he did during the last ashes , australia should win
both sides know there âs still some scarring
mitchell starc managed to swing the white kookaburra during the world cup so he should be able to swing the red dukes ball in england
he swings it late , too â as brendon mccullum found out in the final
fast bowler johnson will be hoping to terrorise english batsmen like he did last time around i was impressed with josh hazlewood , too
he could prosper in england with his hit - the - deck style
ryan harris always has wicket - taking potential , although i wonder how quickly he âll slot back in after sitting out the west indies tour
no 3 the key the series could hinge on australia âs no 3
whoever it is , england will think they have a chance
shane watson has done the job in the past without ever really making it his own and there âs been talk of steve smith moving up the order
steve smith has been in sensational form and could get moved up the batting order to no 3 he âs in the form of his life but he still moves around a lot at the crease
if the ball âs swinging , that could spell trouble
the other option would be voges , who has just averaged 104 in the sheffield shield
age concern i firmly believe you should try to get every last drop out of some of these cricketers , especially in an ashes
as england discovered in 2013 - 14 , an ageing side is only a problem if the players are approaching retirement , like graeme swann
at 37 - years - old , brad haddin is likely to be playing his last ashes along with a few others but for someone like chris rogers this tour will be a last hurrah
i âll be watching brad haddin
he âs a fierce competitor but he âs 37 and keeping in england can be tricky because of the late swing
dodgy at the back part of the reason michael clarke has given up one - day internationals is to manage his dodgy back
mike atherton will tell you a bad back can go at any moment , although michael clarke looked physically sharp during the world cup
captain michael clarke will be hoping he does n't suffer a recurrence of his back problems but if the australia captain âs back is stiff when they play in england , the bowlers will test out the 33 - year - old âs suppleness against the short ball
he âs still vulnerable early on
michael clarke ( capt ) age 33 caps 108 verdict age has not diminished his class , as he proved in the world cup final
but his dodgy back could be an issue in a five - test series
should out - captain cook once more
david warner age 28 caps 36 verdict could win a test or two by himself if he bats for a couple of sessions
moeen ali âs off - breaks will be crucial in pinning him down
likes to say a word or two
shane watson age 33 caps 56 verdict has a decent record in ashes cricket , but has never reached the stage where he frightens england
but his medium - pace balances australia âs team in a way cook can only envy
marsh age 31 caps 12 verdict a gritty left - hander , and son of former test opener geoff
began test career with 141 in sri lanka in 2011 , but success has been sporadic since then
johnson age 33 caps 64 verdict if england have nât got over the trauma of the 2013 - 14 series , when johnson took 37 wickets at 13 apiece , the ashes will stay with australia
josh hazlewood age 24 caps 3 verdict one of a batch of promising australian fast bowlers , he proved economical beyond his years during the successful world cup campaign
a flawless action bodes well
james faulkner age 24 caps 1 verdict played his only test to date at the oval in 2013 , where he got up england âs noses by accusing them of boring batting
a left - arm seam - bowling all - rounder , he can give the ball an almighty whack
james pattinson age 24 caps 13 verdict injuries have limited him since he burst on to the scene in 2011 - 12 , but the talent is undeniable : tall , aggressive and fast , he should trouble england more than his brother , darren , when playing for england in a single test against south africa in 2008
peter siddle age 30 caps 56 verdict the banana - loving seamer is a veteran of two ashes tours , and could provide relentless accuracy while the quicker bowlers fire around him
kevin pietersen , for one , found him almost impossible to score off in 2013 - 14
brad haddin ( wkt ) age 37 caps 63 verdict australia âs second-most important cog in their 5 - 0 ashes wheel in 2013 - 14 , after johnson
his sledging from behind the stumps is considered the heartbeat of the team
chris rogers age 37 caps 20 verdict this will be his last hurrah in a late - blooming began test career
calm , compact and the perfect foil for the exuberance of his opening partner david warner
steve smith ( vice captain ) age 25 caps 26 verdict one of world cricket âs rising stars , he scored four tons in australia âs recent home series against india
will captain the side full - time after michael clarke retires , and can burgle the odd wicket with his leg - spin
nathan lyon age 27 caps 39 verdict a steady off - spinner who troubled england âs right - handers during whitewash
but , really , they should have nothing to fear
mitchell starc age 25 caps 15 verdict another left - arm seamer , and man of the tournament at the world cup
his yorkers are as dangerous in tests as they are in odis , and accuracy and pace have improved
ryan harris age 35 caps 27 verdict if he can drag his injury - laden body through one final series , australia will be thrilled
he was an unsung star during their 3 - 0 defeat here two years ago , and produced the ball of the series to bowl cook in perth
josh hazlewood age 24 caps 3 verdict one of a batch of promising australian fast bowlers , he proved economical beyond his years during the successful world cup campaign
a flawless action bodes well
fawad ahmed age 33 caps 20 verdict the pakistan - born leg - spinner has played only three one - day internationals and two twenty20 games for australia , so would represent a risk
but australian leggies have done well in england before â¦ michael clarke ( capt ) age 33 caps 108 verdict age has not diminished his class , as he proved in the world cup final
but his dodgy back could be an issue in a five - test series
should out - captain cook once more
david warner age 28 caps 36 verdict could win a test or two by himself if he bats for a couple of sessions
moeen ali âs off - breaks will be crucial in pinning him down

kevin pietersen , for one , found him almost impossible to score off in 2013 - 14
mitchell marsh age 23 caps 4 verdict a rangy all - rounder and younger brother of marsh , marsh stunned england during the world cup with figures of 5 for 33 at melbourne â despite having taken only six odi wickets until then
his batting is the stronger suit
nevill age 29 caps 0 verdict peter who ? nevill has been chosen as the reserve wicketkeeper behind his new south wales team - mate brad haddin , although he has also played as a specialist batsman for his state team
unlikely to get a game unless brad haddin breaks a finger
voges age 35 caps 0 verdict an outsider for a test debut , but he knows english conditions well â voges has spent time with hampshire , middlesex and nottinghamshire â and bowls left - arm spin to complement his middle - order hitting .
