tour de france winner stephen roche has offered his support to geoff thomas , arguing that cycling should not object to lance armstrong joining the former england footballer in french this summer to raise money for the fight against cancer
stephen roche , the tour winner whose own son suffered with leukaemia , believes lance armstrong âs involvement with geoff thomas âs â le tour â event will only help raise awareness and cash for the cause
geoff thomas and lance armstrong are united by both being cancer survivors but some senior figures in cycling â uci president brian cookson and team sky boss sir dave brailsford â have objected to the controversial us returning to the french roads
lance armstrong , who was stripped of his seven le tour title , wants to return to work fighting cancer former tour de france champion stephen roche , pictured with former footballer and charity organiser geoff thomas , supports lance armstrong 's return to raise money and awareness of the disease lance armstrong is set to be part of a team of cyclists rising the route on a day before the tour de france starts the us cyclist revealed details of his doping scandal in an interview chat show host oprah winfrey lance armstrong 's former team - mate vaughters said he would support the disgraced cyclist âs plan to ride part of the tour de france route this summer if it was for â altruistic â reasons
vaughters , who rode with lance armstrong in the us postal service team in 1998 and 1999 , was however wary of his motives for accepting an invitation from fellow cancer survivor geoff thomas to join him in a charity ride
â i sincerely hope his reasons for wanting to do that are altruistic.i have no idea what his motivations are
if it 's altruistic then it 's hard to condemn anything altruistic , across the board
if it 's part of a greater commercial strategy or legal strategy , then i feel like that 's disingenuous
â vaughters , speaking at a uk anti-doping conference , said lance armstrong âs lifetime ban from competition was not the only way he had been punished
â one of the biggest penalties that guys face when they are caught for doping is the loss of their social group , â he said , â they 're no longer accepted amongst their tribe , their people that they were once close with
he would like social acceptance again
i 'm assuming that 's a little bit what he 's after ( with the charity ride )
â vaughters welcomed reports that lance armstrong has met with us anti-doping boss travis in denver , colorado
i do n't know what his motivations are , but to me that 's good news
my experiences with travis have been nothing but positive
â geoff thomas and a team of cyclists will ride the route of this summer âs tour one day ahead of the professional peloton , with lance armstrong planning to join them for two stages
but brian cookson branded lance armstrong âs involvement â inappropriate and disrespectful â
stephen roche , who in 1987 became the second of only two cyclists to win the triple crown of the tour , the giro dâitalia and the world road race title , said : â i believe in what he âs ( geoff thomas ) doing , â said stephen roche
â i know that by having lance armstrong involved with geoff thomas in his charity to generate funds for leukaemia - i think that his overall picture will be a lot brighter
' he will bring in a lot more money for very , very worthy causes
it 's about going forward
we ca n't change the past
we must use the past to make the future better
â it was stephen roche âs son , florian , who suffered with leukaemia and the irishman , speaking to the newstalk breakfast radio show earlier , said : ' i can speak from my heart because my son had leukaemia and he 's on the straight now , thank god , â he said
â and when you 're involved with that , to see how far a euro goes , and how euros are lacking to fund research
' so i 'm speaking from a different perspective maybe than someone who just a general cyclist that 's very disappointed in what lance armstrong has done to the sport
so i know the power he has
' i know that people are going to despise me for saying so , but i think we have got to move on
i think that he faulted - he was n't the only one that faulted - he 's been punished
' he 'll be punished for the rest of his life for what he did
but there is a redemption somewhere as well
where does it start ? does it start this year , next year , in ten years ' time ? does it start by doing a charity cycle ? ' former crystal palace , wolves midfielder geoff thomas ( right ) won nine full england caps in his football career
