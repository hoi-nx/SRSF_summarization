soldiers will operate in and around towns in texas , new mexico , arizona , california , nevada , utah and colorado where some of them wil drop from planes while carrying weapons loaded with blanks in what military officials have dubbed realistic military training
but with residents of the entire states of texas and utah dubbed ' hostile ' for the purposes of the exercises , jade helm has some concerned the drills are too realistic

' texas is listed as a hostile sector , and of course , we are ... we 're here defending the republic
' the chronicle reports that , among the planned exercises , soldiers will attempt to operate undetected among civilian populations
residents , in turn , will be asked to report suspicious activity in order to gauge the effectiveness of the soldiers
military officials say they 've gotten the go ahead for the operations from local authorities such as mayors and county commissions
and sheriff 's deputies told the chronicle they would ensure residents living near where aircraft were slated to create disturbances and drop soldiers , civilian and military vehicles will barrel through and where blank rounds would be fired
