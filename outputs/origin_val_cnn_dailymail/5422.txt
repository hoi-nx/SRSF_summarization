' mr symon spencer , from farnborough , hampshire , added : ' i was crying for most of the weekend after being told
' dogs are really clever and they pick up on your mood and adopt it , so she was feeling low too

' with coco 's medical history not being great and as with most large dogs , they do not do as well with three legs and she would not have a good quality of life , ' he said
' i asked if we went down that route , how much more time would we give her
the vet said only four to six months
' i could n't do that to her , put her through so much for such a short amount of time
