a minnesota mother claims a faulty background check which labels her a murderer has ruined her reputation
lorie wosmek is suing mcdowell agency and her local district after she was let go as a school 's volunteer and made to feel a social pariah
the mother - of - two said that her life changed for the worse in the fall of 2012 when she agreed to a background check after years helping out at remer school district , even coaching one of their football teams
fired : lorie wosmek was not allowed to volunteer at remer school district because a wrong background check identified her as a murderer ' parents acted strange , ' said lorie wosmek to cbs
' people who said ' hi ' to me before would n't say ' hi ' anymore
lorie wosmek was suddenly told she could no longer work around children and the district said that they would let her know why she was being dumped in a letter
it arrived with a copy of her background check which showed up a woman with the same name , but wildly different past
' all i saw on there was homicide , ' said lorie wosmek
false : this is the background check returned on lorie wosmek that ruined her life as a volunteer help : lorie wosmek once worked as a coach in the remer school district and enjoyed her time as a volunteer according to the wrong background check , lorie wosmek was supposed to have committed vehicular homicide
however , lorie wosmek had never committed or been convicted of this crime and tried to tell the district and the background check company ,
she alleges the false check was passed around other school district 's in the area for five months - which stopped her getting more work
the district denies this allegation
denials : the remer school district has said that it does not recognize any of lorie wosmek 's claims lorie wosmek says despite the error being recognized she has not been welcomed back
again , the district denies not offering her more work as a volunteer
' when people hear good news like ' she did n't commit the crime , ' they do n't tend to spread that around , ' said lorie wosmek to cbs
the mcdowell agency , which is in st. paul has admitted in court filings that their check was a mistake
a spokesperson told cbs , ' we believe the evidence will support our position that ms. lorie wosmek 's reputation was not impacted or harmed by anything we did
