micro-pigs assuming the identities of race horses have been pitted against each other to help predict the winners of the cheltenham feature races
named after the horses they represent , the micro-pigs taking part in the champion hurdle include hurricane sty ( hurricane fly ) , fuzzheen ( faugheen ) and kitten trot ( kitten rock )
the micro-pigs also dress in accordance with their counterpart and compete against each other on a specially designed miniature course
the brainchild of coral bookmakers , the micro-competition is part of their cheltenham where horse racing fans are able to compete for free bets
and the footage , while not entirely insightful , is interesting to say the least
opening on an establishing shot of the course , the micro-pig commentator stands before a microphone in a flat cap and welcomes the crowd â who wear ladies day hats
the micro-pigs each wear the colours of their counterpart horse and are paraded in the paddock before the start of the race the commentator then takes the action down to the paddocks and begins introducing the race âs competitors
first up is un de sow ( un de sceaux ) , who is presented as a pig with a weight problem
next is piglet bay ( purple bay ) , who struts around the paddock , before kitten trot is introduced and relieves itself
after a quick look to see â what the market is saying â the race gets under way and despite un de sow , who makes a quick run for it , the other pigs just stand around and graze
a micro-pig commentator dressed in a flat cap introduces the competitors and comments on the crowd approaching the first bend kitten trot is able to take the lead however and makes its way over the famous hill first
as the race reaches its finish , the micro-pigs â except one who stops for a drink â manage to catch up with one another and run in a herd
and it âs almost too close to call as they reach the finishing line before kitten trot makes a last - ditch dash for it and wins
a member of the crowd wears a ladies day - style hat while watching the micro-pig race the micro-pig called kitten trot makes its way over the famous hill and is the eventual winner of the race while not an exact science , considering that faugheen was the winner of the actual champion hurdle race , the competition is certainly a bit of fun
tania seif , head of social marketing at coral , said : â move over paul the octopus , there âs a new breed of animal psychic in town â the micro-pig
â we ca nât wait to see if any of our micro-pig races successfully predict the winner of the actual races at the cheltenham â we âre hoping they bring home the bacon for our punters
â towards the end of the race the competitors are much closer together as they make their way to the finishing line
