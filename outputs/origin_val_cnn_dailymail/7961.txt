steve smith hit a sublime century as australia reached the world cup final with an imposing 95 - run victory over reigning champions india on thursday
the 25 - year - old hit 11 fours and two sixes as he made 105 as the co-hosts posted a daunting 328 for 7 , despite suffering a mid-over collapse
india âs response never materialised and although dhoni made a run - a - ball 65 australia always looked in control with johnson ( 2 - 50 ) and james faulkner ( 3 - 59 ) bowling india out for 233

with the sub-continental side having continually suffered at the hands their opponents since arriving in the southern hemisphere in late november , australia looked strong favourites
but dhoni , india âs exceptional if not a somewhat underrated leader , ensured the world champions rose to the occasion of defending their crown and the result of the semi-final was far from a foregone conclusion
having won the toss , it came as no surprise that michael clarke chose to bat â opting to put runs on the board and attempt to apply pressure on india
the rejuvenated indian pace attack began aggressively and the build - up of early pressure saw david warner lose patience and send a leading edge off yadav to kohli at cover
it brought steve smith , india âs kryptonite over the past four months , to the crease and he provided further evidence as to why many view him as the man to lead australia in the near future
despite the pressure of the situation steve smith never looked fazed and having weathered an early storm of short - pitched deliveries he punished one yadav over for four fours
meanwhile , at the other end aaron finch was struggling to time the ball but steve smith âs ability to attack and keep the run - rate rising allowed his partner to find his feet
after becoming just the second australian player , after david boon , to score four successive world cup half - centuries steve smith finally made his maiden world cup century
in the first over of the batting powerplay , the right - handed batsman hit three boundaries , the last a four pulled from outside off that saw him complete a 89 - ball ton
the match seemed to be swerving dangerously out of reach for india with their bowlers continuing to offer short - pitched balls that were being dispatched to the stands
but , dhoni brought back yadav ( 4 - 72 ) and the eerily quiet scg erupted as steve smith attempted to hook a short ball and saw a top - edge fly to rohit sharma at deep square leg for 105 off 93 - balls

having broken the 187 - run second - wicket partnership india looked to go on the attack but all - rounder maxwell was equal to task , hitting three fours and a six in a quick - fire 23
as maxwell departed australia were faltering and finch , who had grafted his way to 81 , was the next to go - caught at mid-wicket by shihkar dhawan - having become increasingly frustrated at a succession of dot balls
captain michael clarke ( 10 ) quickly followed him back to the hutch with mohit sharma claiming his first wicket as india slowly began to claw the match back to an even keel
though steve smith , finch and michael clarke were all dismissed by the short ball , the indian bowlers were guilty of relying on it far too much and watson and james faulkner cashed in late on to push australia past 300
a cameo from johnson ( 27 not out ) took the co-hosts to 328 - 7 as india conceded 89 in the final 10 overs
if india were going to finally win their first match in australia this summer they needed to get off to quick start
rohit sharma was lucky not to be dismissed for a duck in the first over off starc as he drove a fuller ball to watson at slip only for it to be adjudged to have just fallen short

the second lives for both batsmen was gleefully accepted and the pair put on a 76 - run first - wicket partnership as india looked to make inroads into the substantial target
but josh hazlewood soon had his man as shikhar dhawan ( 45 ) looked to have timed his shot perfectly only to pick out maxwell at deep extra cover
it was a desperately required wicket for australia and three overs later india âs star batsman kohli was dismissed by johnson for just a single
the 26 - year - old has scored 13 centuries in victorious chases for his country but failed to add to that in scg , as he top - edged a bouncer high into the sky and straight into haddin âs gloves
knockout matches bring about a unique pressure and the impressive indian batting line - up collapsed from 76 without loss to 91 for three
as rohit sharma was bowled - via an inside edge - by johnson for 34
in their previous seven matches in the world cup , at least one of india âs top - five batsmen have scored a half - century or a hundred to anchor their side âs innings
but as suresh raina departed for an 11 ball seven and india were wavering on 108 for four , the task of taking india to victory again rested on the shoulders of dhoni

steve smith continued to affect the outcome of the match and with the required run - rate rapidly rising , reaching over 13 with 10 overs left , as he ran - out ravindra jadeja for 16
on 40 occasions in which the 33 - year - old has finished unbeaten when his side was chasing , dhoni has taken them to triumph 38 times
having prodded his way to 47 off 54 balls , the indian captain smashed the recalled watson for successive sixes
paceman mohit sharma ( left ) celebrates after taking the wicket of michael clarke australian fans enter into the spirit of the occasion at the scg india were also very well supported at the scg as they continued the defence of their title but dhoni âs innings was eventually ended as maxwell , with one stump to aim at , ran the indian captain out 65
india had not lost more then seven wickets in their previous seven world cup matches and the previously unexposed tail were quickly dismissed
james faulkner bowled ravichandran ashwin ( 5 ) and shami ( 0 ) in successive balls before starc wrapped up the innings , bowling yadav for a five - ball duck , with 19 balls spare
australia have now won all seven semi-finals they have featured in and the impressive victory has set - up a mouth - watering final against the unbeaten new zealand in melbourne on sunday .
