wales captain ashley williams says summer holidays for the squad have been put on hold as qualifying for euro 2016 takes precedence over visiting exotic hot - spots
coleman 's group b leaders host belgium for their next qualifier but the june 12 fixture at the cardiff causes problems as far as preparation is concerned
the fixture comes nearly three weeks after the conclusion of the premier league season and almost a full six weeks from the final match of the regular european championship campaign , which could mean an extended break for the likes of reading pair chris gunter and hal robson-kanu

but ashley williams says that whatever the decision , wales will not be taking their eye off the ball following the 3 - 0 victory in israel on saturday night , a win which gave the nation its longest unbeaten start to a qualifying campaign since the 1976 european championships
' there was a big wait for this game and it will be the same for the belgium game in june , ' ashley williams said
' when the season ends we will get focused again and keep the ball rolling
ashley williams has his heart set on helping wales qualify for their first ever european championship finals ' we have not spoken about that break yet and i do n't know what they are going to do with us
' but everyone understands the importance of that game and no - one is going to be in vegas or miami before
' we will have a rest and keep ourselves fit
' wales will lose top spot in the group on tuesday night should the delayed israel - belgium game in jerusalem produce a winner - the fixture postponed last september because of the political situation in the middle east
coleman 's men reached their target of being in the top three teams at the halfway mark of qualifying but coleman said wales have met their pre-group target of being in the top three at the halfway stage of the qualifying campaign and , with seven or eight points potentially enough to claim one of the two automatic qualifying places for france 2016 , three of their last five games are now at home
' we have a massive game in june , ' ashley williams said after winning his 50th cap against israel in haifa
' a win over belgium will be a big step to where we have to go
' there is still a lot of football to be played after that so i would n't go as far as to say that we win that and we are there
' we do know that a win over belgium will make a big difference
' we understood how big the israel game was but there is another massive game in june which will be even more important
