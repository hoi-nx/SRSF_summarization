' it was also a blow to countless others who , like hong yen chang , aspired to become a lawyer only to have their dream deferred on account of their race , alienage , or nationality , ' the unanimous court decision reads
' it is past time to acknowledge that the discriminatory exclusion of hong yen chang from the state bar of california was a grievous wrong
' struggle : hong yen chang , from guangdong province , china , travelled to the united states in 1872 when he was 12 years old
he studied law at colombia , graduating in 1886 with ' high markings from the examiners '
but he was banned from practising in california as he was ' a person of mongolian nativity ' defiant : in later life , hong yen chang served as a banker and a diplomat , and was awarded a doctorate of law by the chinese government
but he was never granted a license to practise law in california hong yen chang , from xiangshan , guangdong province , was chosen to travel to the united states in 1872 when he was 12 years old , as part of a chinese educational mission
he studied law at yale and colombia , from where he graduated in 1886 with ' high markings from the examiners '
however , for the rest of his life he faced a struggle to practise law , as under 19th century legislation ' a person of mongolian nativity ' would not be accepted to the bar
in 1888 , after long deliberations , new york passed an act for the relief of hong yen chang , which waived the chinese exclusion act in the state , allowing him to receive a license to practise law in new york

on monday , the california supreme court granted a posthumous law license to hong , known as united states 's first chinese - born lawyer
this came in response to petitions made by hong yen chang 's descendants , as well as the asian pacific american law students association ( apalsa ) at the university of california
' even if we can not undo history , we can acknowledge it and , in so doing , accord a full measure of recognition to hong yen chang 's pathbreaking efforts to become the first lawyer of chinese descent in the united states , ' the court said in its unanimous ruling
' more than a century later , the legal and policy underpinnings of our 1890 decision have been discredited
' the california high court blamed hostility toward chinese , cultural tensions and xenophobia for hong yen chang 's plight , as well as a range of state laws designed ' to disadvantage chinese immigrants ' who moved to california with other immigrants following the gold rush of the mid- 1800s
in later life , hong yen chang served as a banker and a diplomat , and was awarded a doctorate of law by the chinese government
he was director of chinese naval students at berkeley , california , until his retirement in 1920
he died in 1926 , after which his family began the fight to have him recognised in the state
hong yen chang 's grand - niece , rachelle chong , is also a lawyer
she made history as the first asian-american to be appointed to the federal communications commission and the california public utilities commission
three of hong yen chang 's other descendants are lawyers
' we are absolutely thrilled with the ruling , ' said chong
the longstanding injustice , she said had been a sore spot among hong yen chang 's extended family for decades .
