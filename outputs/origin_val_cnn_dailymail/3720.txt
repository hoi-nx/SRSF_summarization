jose mourinho is on course to win trophy number 22 if his chelsea side can stay at the summit of the premier league but instead of keeping medals as a reminder of his success - he retires the watch he wore to triumph
the blues boss has already added watch number 21 which was a , hublot king power special one , this season after lifting the capital one cup last month
with his cabinet of watches filling up year - by - year , jose mourinho knows he 's just a few wins away from adding yet another timepiece to his ever growing collection
the chelsea boss will be hoping he can put his current watch with his collection if he wins the title he said : ' when i win titles the gifts i buy are for my wife , my daughter and my son
but i take my watch from my wrist and i keep it
instead of medals , i keep a watch
' when i finish a season with a trophy , that season is represented with a watch
they 're in a safe box
in this moment , i have a sponsorship deal but , previously , they were n't a particular brand
' previously , it was just a watch that i could feel comfortable with , especially as i come from the time when not every stadium had a digital clock and even if some did they finished at 90 minutes
' my favourite one is the last one , as i designed it with the company and the company did it for me according to my needs - to wear on the bench with the colours i want and material and size and weight
jose mourinho currently has 21 watches in his collection and is looking to make it 22 this season ' i designed it with the company , it 's blue , it 's my watch
' chelsea travel to hull on sunday with both sides needing the three points for very different reasons
steve bruce 's side find themselves just three points above the relegation zone coming into the final leg of the premier league season
jose mourinho 's side are locked in a battle for the top spot with manchester city and with arsenal creeping up into contention , the blues know that they ca n't afford to slip up
diego costa ( centre ) will be hoping to keep his rich vein of goalscoring form going against hull
