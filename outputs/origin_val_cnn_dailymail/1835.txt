sir green , pictured with his daughter chloe , has sold the loss - making bhs department chain for just Â£ 1 to a little - known investment firm retail tycoon sir green has sold struggling bhs for just one pound â a fraction of the Â£ 200million he paid for it almost 15 years ago
the billionaire had failed to turn the loss - making department store chain around due to fierce competition from rivals
it was bought yesterday by a little - known investment firm called retail acquisitions , raising fears for the jobs of 11,000 staff in 171 bhs stores across the country
when asked if their roles were safe , sir green said : â i âm a retailer , not a clairvoyant
â the entrepreneur bought the chain in 2000 when it was called bhs
it joined topshop , miss selfridge , dorothy perkins and burton as part of his arcadia
but its furniture and fashion â aimed at older customers â struggled to sell well enough to keep up with rivals
recent attempts to breathe new life into the chain included introducing food halls in some stores , opening new cafes and selling clothes from some of arcadia âs other brands
but this failed to kick - start growth , and bhs continued to lose customers to cheaper rivals such as ikea , as well as more upmarket competitors including john lewis
sir green said the chain made a cash loss of Â£ 45million last year
analysts estimate that it lost 800,000 shoppers over the past five years
the businessman said he had not been able to give bhs as much attention as he would have liked because of the other brands he owns
â i do nât think anything went wrong , â he said
â you try being involved in six businesses
â i âm not blaming anybody , but when you are in and out of the business you tend to drift
you ca nât be an absentee landlord
it is a challenging marketplace and bhs is in the middle of the market at a time when everyone is discounting
â he said the business is being handed over in a sound financial position with â significant â cash balances and no debt
sir green put bhs up for sale in january
he refused to confirm the sale price yesterday , but this was widely reported as being Â£ 1
he also declined to say whether he had secured an agreement that existing stores and jobs would be safeguarded
â i do nât want some article saying they will close them , â he said
â i âm a retailer , not a clairvoyant
people buy companies and people sell companies
they are buying the business to run it as a going concern
â fears have been expressed over the job security of more than 11,000 staff employed by bhs retail acquisitions is a new business set up by five directors with little experience in the sector
chairman smith , 76 , is a former stockbroker
two other directors are lawyers â one specialising in privacy , who has advised mike tyson , ulrika jonsson and hugh grant
of the firm âs remaining two directors , one is an unknown swede and the other appears to be a former racing driver
mr smith said : â this is a fantastic opportunity to breathe new life into this iconic british high street brand
â we are convinced that with strategic and focused support we will return bhs to profitability and safeguard the workforce
â however , analysts believe the firm may be forced to cut staff
neil saunders , a director of research firm conlumino , said : â on the positive side , it is likely the brand will be reinvigorated and see some investment
â on the negative side , some restructuring [ job cuts ] is likely and over the medium term further store closures will likely be required
