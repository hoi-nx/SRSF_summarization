a father - of - three who claims he has spent 53 years living in uk is facing deportation back to the u.s after being caught up in an immigration crackdown
carl jordan was born in the u.s to an u.s soldier and a so - called ' gi bride ' - one of thousands of uk women who crossed the atlantic to marry soldiers during the second world war
but when his parents split up when he was aged three , mr carl jordan moved back to manchester with his mother
carl jordan who claims he has spent 53 years living in uk - including paying taxes and starting a family - is facing deportation back to the u.s after being caught up in an immigration crackdown the 56 - year - old , who lives close to his elderly mother in haughton green , tameside , says he then set up a life for himself in the uk , which involved attending school , paying taxes and working for four decades
he also married a uk woman with whom he had three children
but , since arriving in 1963 , neither he nor his mother has ever sought to obtain uk citizenship for mr carl jordan , believing he was entitled to stay in the country on account of his mother 's nationality
in fact , those who are born to uk parents outside of the uk are not automatically given a permanent right to remain - and he should have applied for citizenship
now , the government has decided mr carl jordan should be deported from the uk because he does not have the correct paperwork to allow him to stay
mr carl jordan , who has until april 6 to appeal the decision , said : ' i thought it would be all right because i 've been married here , i 've got three kids and all my family are here
i did n't think it was going to get this serious
' the former railway guard and royal mail postman claims he did not know anything about applying for citizenship until immigration officers turned up at the pub where he worked just before christmas
the father - of - three , pictured with his son matthew and daughter chloe , has until april 6 to appeal government 's decision to send him back to the u.s because he does not have the right paperwork after receiving an anonymous tip - off about mr carl jordan 's situation , officials arrested him for working illegally in the uk
he was then released on the condition that he reports regularly to an immigration centre in salford
many europeans who have been in similar situations to mr carl jordan have managed to stay in the uk due to their right to private and family life , under article 8 of the european convention on human rights
in 2011 , beheshti , from iran - who had been trying to get refugee status for seven years but had the claim repeatedly turned down - was allowed to stay in the uk because he said he had a private life that involves going for work - outs with his friends
the 40 - year - old 's lawyers argued his human rights would be violated if he was deported because he had become ' well integrated ' in the glasgow community
the controversial legal ruling by scotland âs court of session meant the threat of deportation has been removed and beheshti is free to remain in scotland indefinitely
beheshti âs claim , it said , was â based on article 8 echr and , in particular , on the fact that he had , so he claimed , established a private life in the uk
earlier this month , loncar , 55 - who won asylum by claiming he fled croatia due to anti-serb discrimination - was allowed to stay in the uk , despite being convicted of killing his wife
since being convicted of the crime in his absence during a retrial in 2000 , croatia had asked for loncar 's extradition from uk - but his lawyers fought move they argued that he had right to family life with his new serbian partner in the uk - despite the pair living hundreds of miles away from one another
in the meantime , loncar continued claiming benefits and was convicted of common assault in the uk
but the high court still ruled that it would be ' oppressive ' to send loncar back after so long
but mr johnson , who is a father to nicky , 30 , matthew , 20 , and chloe , 15 , has now been told to leave the country
the home office says mr johnson was told he needed to apply for residency in 2007 after being granted a visitor 's visa following a two - month holiday away from the uk
but officials said he has failed to provide evidence of long term residency in the country - evidence which would usually come in the form of medical history , tax contributions and evidence of education
mr carl jordan , who has now split from his wife , says he can not bear the thought of being forced to leave and having to say goodbye to his children
he said : ' i have lived here all my life
i went to school here , i 've worked here for 40 years
' but now i 've been told i 've been working illegally all that time , even though i 've got a national insurance number and paid my taxes
' i 've not been sleeping or eating
every time i see my daughter she cries and that sets me off
' many europeans who have been in similar situations to mr carl jordan have managed to stay in the uk due to their right to private and family life , under article 8 of the european convention on human rights
thousands have now signed an online petition requesting he be allowed to say
it reads : ' carl has a close relationship with his children , who are , in the least to say , devastated by this turn of events , especially his daughter , the youngest child
carl 's elderly mother is also reliant upon him and would therefore be left without the help and care she currently gets from her son
' denton mp gwynne is also backing his campaign and has asked the government to grant mr carl jordan discretionary leave while he applies for dual nationality
mr gwynne said : ' my office has asked the immigration minister to grant discretionary leave for mr carl jordan to remain ... while he applies for dual nationality , which he has the right to do because his mother is uk
' i am fully supportive of mr carl jordan
i do feel that he should be given the right to stay
' a home office spokesman said : ' people born overseas to a uk parent do not gain an automatic right to long term residency in the uk , and the onus is on the individual to ensure their immigration status is free of time restrictions
' mr carl jordan was told in 2007 of the need to formalise his stay in the uk by providing evidence to support his claim of long term residency
he was also advised in writing on three occasions what level of evidence is required but he has still failed to provide it
