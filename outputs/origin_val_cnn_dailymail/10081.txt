cassandra fortin , from connecticut , was diagnosed with hl 's lymphoma in september , but did not want to receive the recommended treatment
but in january a court decided that she must have the chemotherapy at connecticut children 's medical center - she was not able to make the decision as she is not legally mature enough
cassandra fortin , a 17 - year - old who was forced to have chemotherapy against her will is now in remission , according to sources close to her case ( file photo ) cassandra fortin , from connecticut , was diagnosed with hl 's lymphoma in september , but did not want to receive the recommended treatment ( file photo ) since then she has been kept in hospital for treatment
cassandra fortin spoke to nbc via facebook chat from the hospital this week , she had to submit a list of people to officials with the connecticut department of children and families ( dcf ) , which has temporary custody of the teen who were allowed to visit her
' the problem is i 've given tons of names of people to be verified , [ but ] it just does n't happen , ' cassandra fortin wrote in an interview conducted via facebook chat
' i have not been allowed to see or talk to my mom since new years , dcf is working on allowing visitation to start
' my boyfriend has not been verified to come see me ... for the most part i do n't get many visitors
' she told the news outlet that now the treatment is taking effect that the guard has been removed from her outside her door , but she is only allowed to visit the cafeteria if she 's escorted by a nurse , patient care assistant or child - welfare official
she said that she missed fresh air , but she was trying to stay positive
cassandra fortin insisted that she never wanted to die and that she was prepared to try chemotherapy but only after exploring other ' alternative ' methods first
on sunday the department of children and families commissioner joette katz said in a statement released : ' we are very pleased with cassandra fortin 's progress toward a complete recovery
' we understand how difficult this has been for cassandra fortin and her family , but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life
' doctors said the chemotherapy would give her an 85 per cent chance of survival , but without it there was a near - certainty of death within two years
her mother jackie fortin said : ' she has always - even years ago - said that if she was diagnosed with cancer , she would not put poison into her body ' cassandra fortin underwent chemotherapy at the connecticut children 's medical centre ( pictured ) hl ( cells pictured ) is a disease of the white blood cells hl is cancer of the white blood cells called b lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system , which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body
the lymphatic system is part of your immune system
clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection - fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes
lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system , such as the lymph nodes or glands
these lymphocytes lose their infection - fighting properties , making you more vulnerable to infection
the most common symptom of hl is a painless swelling in a lymph node , usually in the neck , armpit or groin
it usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50
almost all young people with hl will be fully cured
for older people over the age of 50 , the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent
treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy , chemotherapy and drugs including steroids
several other states recognize the ' mature minor doctrine ' , but the court said she did not understand the severity of her condition
she will have to wait until she turns 18 in september before she can make her own medical decisions
cassandra fortin was diagnosed in september and after initial surgery failed , she was given two rounds of chemotherapy
she then asked for treatment to be stopped and , in order to avoid further trips to hospital , ran away from home
her mother jackie fortin supported her choice but the dcf claimed custody of the girl and took the case to court
' it 's a question of fundamental constitutional rights -- the right to have a say over what happens to your body -- and the right to say to the government ' you ca n't control what happens to my body , ' cassandra fortin 's mother 's attorney , michael s. taylor , told fox ct
her mother told nbc connecticut that her daughter has long held the belief that she does not want ' poison ' in her body
' she has always â even years ago â said that if she was diagnosed with cancer , she would not put poison into her body , ' ms cassandra fortin explained
she was then returned to connecticut children 's medical center to start chemotherapy
' connecticut children 's medical center reported to the department of children and families that i was not giving medical attention to my daughter , ' said ms cassandra fortin
writing for the hartford courant , cassandra fortin said : ' this experience has been a continuous nightmare
' i want the right to make my medical decisions
' it 's disgusting that i 'm fighting for a right that i and anyone in my situation should already have
' this is my life and my body , not dcf 's and not the state 's
i am a human â i should be able to decide if i do or do n't want chemotherapy
' whether i live 17 years or 100 years should not be anyone 's choice but mine
' she added : ' i believe there 's a natural way or at least an alternative to chemo out there that i am willing to look for and explore
' not that it would cure the cancer but it may help it
