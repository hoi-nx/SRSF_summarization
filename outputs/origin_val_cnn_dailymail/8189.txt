a writer and mother has candidly revealed that she was left emotionally ' scarred ' by her agonizing drug - free childbirth and struggling with a condition known as postpartum post-traumatic stress disorder following the delivery of her daughter
toronto - based mother - of - one tara-michelle ziniuk recalled how the traumatizing birth of her now four - year - old daughter anna left her with nightmares and vivid memories of her painful experience in an essay for today 's parent
' at the time , in that moment , i remember very clearly thinking i wanted it to stop more than i wanted to have my baby , ' she wrote
i was exhausted and borderline suicidal
' traumatic event : tara-michelle ziniuk ( not pictured ) said she was left with nightmares following the painful , drug - free birth of her daughter anna , who is now four - years - old miss tara-michelle ziniuk explained that by the time she asked for something to help with the pain she was ' too far along for it to be administered
' the mom , who suffered from painful cramping almost her entire life because of her endometriosis , said she dreaded the idea of giving birth before she had even gotten pregnant , noting that although she wanted to ' experience pregnancy ' , she never wanted to ' experience childbirth '
when it was time for her baby to be welcomed into the world , miss tara-michelle ziniuk passed on having an epidural because the prenatal class she had attended was ' biased towards natural home births '
according to postpartum support international , symptoms of postpartum ptsd may include : intrusive recollection of a past traumatic event , including child birth flashbacks or nightmares avoidance of stimuli associated with the event , including thoughts , feelings , people , places and details of the event persistent increased arousal , including irritability , difficulty sleeping , hypervigilance and exaggerated startle response anxiety and panic attacks feeling a sense of unreality and detachment miss tara-michelle ziniuk , who is currently co-parenting her daughter , was a single mother at the time of her pregnancy
she said she was given information that made her ' fear epidurals , pain medications and any other â unnecessary â interventions " ' , although she noted that there was no ' shame associated ' if the interventions were needed for medical reasons
' the contractions felt like an extreme version of the menstrual cramps i âd experienced with endometriosis , ' she recalled
' it also felt similar to chronic illness in that i felt like i had no control over what was happening - a familiar , yet difficult , experience for me
' miss tara-michelle ziniuk wrote that she ' disassociated ' and wanted her personal support system and her midwife to leave her alone because she ' did n't want to talk to anyone '
tara-michelle ziniuk ( pictured ) said she hated giving birth ' i felt disgusting and embarrassed and sick ; nothing was comfortable or bearable
i wanted it to stop , ' she recalled
although miss tara-michelle ziniuk said that her daughter 's birth was ' not complicated ' , it was a ' long early labor '
her water never broke , and her daughter even came out with a scratch on her head from the doctor trying to break her water for her
after her experience in the delivery room , miss tara-michelle ziniuk started having nightmares and was unable to talk about her experience when others asked about her birthing experience
she was eventually diagnosed as having postpartum ptsd - the same condition that plagues soldiers who have engaged in war - time battles
according to postpartum support international , one to six percent of women experience postpartum ptsd , an illness that can be caused by a real or perceived trauma during delivery or after childbirth
while postpartum ptsd greatly differs from postpartum depression , which is a form of depression that results from the hormonal changes that occur in a woman 's body , they can occur at the same time in certain cases
but both conditions are temporary and can be treated with professional help
although miss tara-michelle ziniuk explained she struggles with recommending drug - free childbirth , she knows that her terrible experience was specific to her particular situation
she ended her essay by saying : ' my wish that i was unable to recall my daughter âs birth does not negate the good that came from becoming her mother - but my experience of parenthood to date has had nothing to do with my so - called natural childbirth .
