the family of michael brown , the teen killed last year by ferguson police officer darren wilson , will file a civil wrongful death lawsuit in the case " very shortly , " attorney gray said thursday
neither he nor attorney parks would say exactly when the suit would be filed , but they said that they disagreed with the grand jury 's and the justice department 's decisions not to charge darren wilson in the shooting
" they have accepted ( darren wilson 's ) self - defense , " parks told reporters
" we do not accept his self - defense
" the slain teen 's parents , michael brown and mcspadden , were in attendance at the news conference but did not speak on advice of their attorneys , parks said
" the last 24 hours have been tough for them , " he said
word of the lawsuit comes a day after the justice department determined there was not sufficient evidence to charge darren wilson in michael brown 's death but found in a separate investigation that the ferguson police department showed a pattern of racial bias
michael brown and mcspadden released a statement wednesday saying they were disappointed that darren wilson would not face charges , but , they added , the federal report on the police department could provide a silver lining
" we are encouraged that the justice department will hold the ferguson police department accountable for the pattern of racial bias and profiling they found in their handling of interactions with people of color , " the statement said
" it is our hope that through this action , true change will come not only in ferguson , but around the country
if that change happens , our son 's death will not have been in vain
" in november , a grand jury cleared darren wilson and , in an uncharacteristic move in grand jury proceedings , the prosecutor released all the evidence that was considered
gray said the civil lawsuit will rely on " pretty much the same evidence , " but it will be cast differently
the jury in the civil lawsuit will be asked to make a determination based on a lower burden of proof -- by a preponderance of evidence , rather than beyond a reasonable doubt , parks said
summing up the crux of the michael brown family 's case , parks said , " there were other alternatives available to ( darren wilson )
he did not have to kill michael brown
