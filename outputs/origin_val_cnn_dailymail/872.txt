the last time liverpool finished outside the top eight in england âs top division was in the 1961 - 62 season , when they were nât even in the top division
they were winning the old second division title that year , ending an eight - year spell outside the top flight , one of the rare periods in their history when they have played below the elite
in the 110 seasons they have played league football since promotion from the lancashire league to the second division of the football league in 1893 , they have finished , on average , eighth
that means they have the highest average finish , all - time , of any club
their precise average finish is 8.26 , which puts them ahead of next - best arsenal ( average finish 8.78 , also in 110 seasons ) and third - placed everton , who have averaged a placing of 9.71 in their 115 league seasons
