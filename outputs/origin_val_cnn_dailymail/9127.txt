less than 24 hours after he was born at st mary 's hospital in paddington , george met his grandparents for the first time
but the first arrivals were not the prince of wales and the duchess of cornwall
instead , beaming broadly and waving at the crowds outside the lindo wing were michael and carole middleton - better known to george as ' michael ' and ' carole '
almost two years on and with the birth of a little brother or sister less than two months away , the middletons have become a fixture in little george 's life - with prince charles left to complain that they ' never let me see my grandson '
visits to highgrove , charles ' gloucestershire home , have been few and far between
by contrast , william and kate regularly take their son to the berkshire village of bucklebury where the middletons live in a Â£ 4.5m georgian pile ringed by neat gardens and surrounded by open countryside
indeed , it was to bucklebury that the couple decamped a day after leaving the lindo wing , with george 's first photo shoot a month later taking place on the lawn and overseen by proud grandfather michael
the intimate photos , which show george cradled in the arms of his smiling mother , were , with hindsight , a sign of things to come
carole , who to her credit provided a happy and secure childhood for her three children , was always determined to be a hands - on grandmother - and so it has proved
first visitors : carole and michael middleton were the first people to meet the newborn george sign of things to come : his first official photo was taken on the lawn of the middletons ' bucklebury home but the carole middleton matriarch 's determination to be involved in her grandson 's life has n't always gone down well with the rest of the family
' carole has rather taken over , dictating when george naps , when and what he eats , ' confided a source to the daily mail 's sebastian shakespeare
' all in all , behaving like she âs queen carole
' so how much involvement does carole have in george 's life ? the answer is plenty
from cosy family outings to dispensing parenting advice to her eldest child , there are few areas of george 's life in which the middletons are n't involved
just a few weeks ago , carole enjoyed an unbroken fortnight of quality time with her grandson in mustique , where the clan had gathered to celebrate her 60th birthday
although nanny maria theresa borallo was there to deal with most of the childcare , carole , who has made no secret of wanting to enjoy a close relationship with her grandson , was spotted smiling happily as she walked hand - in - hand with a toddling george
holiday : george and his parents often holiday with the middletons , seen here en route to mustique ' queen carole ' : sources say carole is taking an increasing amount of control over george 's life involved : carole , seen here with the duchess of cornwall , is said to be a hands - on grandmother to george and that is far from the only occasion that carole has enjoyed one - on - one time with george
just before the trip to mustique , the proud grandmother was spotted at a farmer 's market with the third - in - line , who was , say witnesses , ' trying all the food '
speaking to people magazine , another onlooker told of carole 's obvious pride in her grandson 's progress
' it was just really , really sweet
he was just being like a normal toddler is , running around and exploring â he is such a sweetie
a real bundle of fun
' she [ carole ] just keeps telling people " he 's gorgeous , is n't he ? " like any other grandmother would say about their little one
' the middletons also joined the duke of edinburgh and kate and their infant son at anmer hall on christmas day where , according to sources , kate made lunch and the family celebrated without any of the stuffiness associated with the more formal royal get - togethers
carole 's influence could also be seen in the plans for george 's first birthday celebrations which , in a break with royal tradition , included a peter rabbit themed party
not amused : charles is said to dislike what he sees as his ' peripheral ' role in george 's life loving : this framed photograph of charles and george has pride of place at clarence house contrast that with prince william 's own first birthday which was spent alone with his nanny barbara barnes because his parents were on tour in canada
charles ' first year was marked in a similar way , with the prince of wales spending the day at clarence house without either of his parents , although the duke of edinburgh , then stationed in malta , did send a model plane
william , who has made no secret of the fact that he wants his son to have a ' normal ' upbringing , is happy to spend time with the middletons , with whom he has long been close
something similar to his fractured childhood , which despite the best efforts of both his parents , was blighted by their divorce and , later , his mother 's death , is not what he wants for george
instead , having seen the happy home created for kate and her siblings by carole and michael , he is more than happy to allow them into his son 's life
' kate âs got a very , very close family , ' he said happily , at the time of their engagement
' mike and carole have been really loving and caring and fun
' they have been welcoming towards me so i âve felt a part of the family
' so is george and so will the new baby become
but what does that mean for charles ? despite his complaints about the ' march of the middletons ' , the prince of wales has ' an excellent relationship ' with his grandson , albeit one that is partly dictated by the vanishingly small number of gaps in his busy schedule
when he does see the baby prince , charles is by all accounts a hands - on grandfather - not just to george but to camilla 's grandchildren as well
different : william is said to want a less formal childhood for his son than the one he enjoyed happy : william has a close relationship with the middletons , in particular with father - in - law michael for evidence of that , look no further than the touching photos that emerged of charles last summer , where the heir to the throne was pictured with one of camilla 's grandchildren clinging to his leg during a visit to the highland games
more evidence of charles ' hands - on approach to grandparenting came when photos of a meeting a in clarence house drawing room showed a picture of george given pride of place on a sideboard
charles also greeted the news of a second grandchild with delight , excitedly telling journalists that ' it 's wonderful to be a grandfather again
he added : ' i 'm looking forward to it - but i hope it will be a girl this time
' but whether girl or boy , there 's no doubt that carole and michael middleton will once again be heavily involved in their new grandchild 's life
perhaps , with the prospect of two young children to enjoy , charles and camilla will be too .
