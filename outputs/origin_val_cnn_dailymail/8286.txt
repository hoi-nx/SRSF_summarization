when kerryn barnett sat down at the dinner table with her family on christmas day , she had no idea that she was about to eat her last solid meal for three months
after suffering debilitating vomiting and extreme fatigue after the feast , the 36 - year - old mother - of - three was diagnosed with severe gastroparesis , a condition that paralyses the muscles and nerves of the stomach
in the past five months , the wollongong quality controller has shed a staggering 15kg due to the illness and is living on purely a liquid diet
now she 's been told by her insurance company bupa that they will not pay for her life - saving surgery , leaving her facing a medical bill of $ 33,000
kerryn barnett ( left ) has not been able to eat a solid meal since christmas lunch due to a rare condition called gastroparesis nearly ten months ago , ms kerryn barnett knew something was wrong with her body when she lost her appetite and started experiencing nausea and bloating
' i started to vomit after eating and then the weight started to drop quite rapidly , ' ms kerryn barnett told daily mail australia
ms kerryn barnett went straight to the doctor , who took blood tests and conducted a pelvic ultrasound
the tests continued for four months , with ms kerryn barnett visiting two different specialists and a professor , testing out over 15 types of medication until finally she got a diagnosis
gastroparesis is a rare condition which causes the stomach to stop working as it should
it results in the body being unable to digest or tolerate foods
the disease is extremely debilitating with constant nausea , daily vomiting , fatigue , muscle cramping , fainting episodes , abdominal bloating and reduced appetite taking over sufferers 's lives
ms kerryn barnett has been forced to cut down the hours of her full - time job due to the extreme fatigue she experiences and has lost 15kg in just five months
her main priority is to get out of bed in the morning and help her 11 - year - old daughter and 8 - year - old twin boys get ready for school
the wollongong mother - of - three , pictured here with her husband and children , has lost 15kg in five months ms kerryn barnett is terrified about her future , and is also concerned about how she is going to continue to care for her children then she will go back to bed and hope to make it up just in time to greet them at the door when they return
' i feel absolutely exhausted because obviously none of the food goes down the small intestine , which distributes the food to different parts of your body , so i 'm fatigued and exhausted at the moment , ' she said
' it âs had a huge impact on the kids
' i 've got 8 - year - old twin boys
one runs off to his bedroom crying every time i 'm sick
i obviously try and be as discreet as i possibly can because some days the vomiting is so bad it âs loud and i âm running from one side of the house to get to the bathroom
it âs a little bit hard , ' she said
while she has explained her condition to her three children , ms kerryn barnett said she only gives them the information they need to know
' i 've tried to sit down and explain that there âs nowhere for the food to go and that âs why i start to vomit
' i try to tell them as much as i can but not enough to scare them
' i 've got one that âs a bit emotional at the moment and the teachers are keeping an eye on them , ' she said
her diet now consists only of liquid
a typical meal for the mum would be soup or broth
on a good day she might try to hold down a smoothie with yoghurt
she is unable to drink powerade without water , as it is too strong for her stomach to handle or any type of solid food
going out to a restaurant is traumatic for the mother , as even if she limits herself to soup from the menu , she will more than likely be running for the bathroom after 20 minutes to vomit
the rare condition has paralysed the nerves and muscles of her stomach , but her health insurer are refusing to pay for life - saving surgery ' i 've got 8 - year - old twin boys
one runs off to his bedroom crying every time i 'm sick ' ms kerryn barnett revealed ' you kind of take advantage of the fact that you have the ability to eat , it âs only when you ca nât eat that you realise how much food impacts on you life , even just the social aspect , ' she said
' most of the time as soon as i eat , it âs coming straight back up within 20 mins to an hour and i certainly do nât want to be at a restaurant getting sick on someone 's birthday
due to the extent of ms kerryn barnett 's weight loss and malnutrition , her only option is to try and treat the condition with a gastric neurostimulator as soon as possible
the pacemaker , which is similar to a pacemaker that goes into heart , is placed in the stomach and is used to assist the muscles in breaking down the food which enters the body
the pioneering surgery has only been tried out 22 times in australia , but for ms kerryn barnett , the 80 per cent proven reduction in vomiting could change her life forever
' as a mother of three young children i so desperately want to be here on this earth to see them grow up , this surgery will allow me a chance , a hope to be able to do that
' hopefully it will cut down on the vomiting so i can actually take medication and keep it down and be able to eat some purÃ©ed meals and hopefully solid meals one day , ' she said
however ms kerryn barnett 's insurance provider , bupa , has refused to foot the bill for the $ 33,000 surgery , due to the fact that the device is not regularly used in the medical world , unlike a pacemaker for the heart
ms kerryn barnett 's insurance provider , bupa , has refused to foot the bill for the $ 33,000 surgery , due to the fact that the device is not regularly used in the medical world ' there âs no medicare item number for the device so they wo nât cover the cost primarily for that reason , ' ms kerryn barnett said
' they will pay for the hospital stay , the cost of the surgeon and the abdominal surgery because they all have medicare item numbers so we have to pay for the device ourselves
' ms kerryn barnett was told that she could appeal the decision by bupa , but it will take three to four months for that to occur
' i do nât have three or four months to wait to see the outcome of an appeal , ' she said
' i do nât know where i âll be in four or five months with my current weight loss
' ms kerryn barnett has gone ahead and set the date for the surgery
the pacemaker , which will be installed into her stomach on april 16 , is set to cost ms kerryn barnett $ 25,000 and $ 3800 for each of the lead
if it is unsuccessful , the next step would be to remove her whole stomach , leaving her unable to ever eat solid food again or even consume any liquids
' that would take away my ability to even drink water
i âd never ever be able to have anything else orally so that would be the absolute last resort , ' she said
last week , ms kerryn barnett set up a fundraising page in the hope that the public can help her raise the funds for the much - needed surgery
mr barnett said she is ' amazed ' that over $ 8,000 has already been raised on the site , however she is still holding out hope that bupa will change their mind over their decision
' every time i get off the phone i just spend the afternoon crying it âs just devastating , ' she said
' they 've got my life in their hands
they have n't called me and looked at my individual case
they 've just said a blanket no. ' i feel quite abandoned by them and it âs additional stress when you âre unwell that you do nât need , ' she said
daily mail australia has contacted bupa for comment .
