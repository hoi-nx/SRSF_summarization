crystal palace manager alan pardew has had his players training at selhurst park in the hope of exploiting a set - piece advantage over qpr in saturday 's lunchtime kick - off
crystal palace âs home form this season is the second worst in the premier league , with bottom - side leicester the only club worse than them on home turf
the selhurst park pitch has been re-laid twice this season , and with alan pardew admitting the surface â is nât perfect â , he has called his players into the stadium that they face qpr in on saturday to practice their dead - ball routines
alan pardew admits crystal palace have been training at selhurst park ahead of their match against qpr since taking over at crystal palace , alan pardew has helped take the south london club up the premier league â our home form is something that we âre focusing on , â alan pardew said
â really , we âve done enough to stay in the division away from home already but our home form does nât reflect what it should be
â our stadium needs to be rocking tomorrow and if we want to keep it where it is in terms of that support , you âve got to give them wins
â we âre a good set - play team so we âve been getting used to the co-ordinates here and the environment to make sure our set - plays are on the money tomorrow
qpr will be desperate for points at selhurst park on saturday lunchtime , after seven defeats in their last eight chris ramsey has endured a difficult start to life in the managerial hot - seat at loftus road â this new pitch is good , but it âs not perfect
the premier league pitches do nât really get relaid during the season , they âre perfect , so it âs very unusual for us to have to do that
i ca nât say it âs as good as arsenal âs , swansea âs or newcastle âs , because it is nât
â and alan pardew sees crystal palace âs game against qpr as being more important for the visitors than his side , even though he admits both are still in a relegation scrap
â it âs an important game , â he said
â probably more important for qpr than us , with where they are , those three teams down the bottom ( qpr , burnley and leicester ) really need a quick win to get them in touch again so it âs a huge game for them â probably must - win
crystal palace 's away form has been impressive , but alan pardew admits they need to improve their fortunes at home the selhurst park pitch has been relaid twice this season , and is not as impressive as other top flight clubs â for us , we just need to make sure we pick up points or pick up wins when we can and we âll be ok
we have a cushion at the moment but it can be easily eroded with a defeat tomorrow so we need to make sure that we âre on our metal
â crystal palace , with 30 points , are currently eight points clear of third - bottom qpr but alan pardew still believes it will require a further 10 before his side are sure of staying up .
