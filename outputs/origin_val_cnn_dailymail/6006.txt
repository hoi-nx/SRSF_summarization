dost must have rung in the new year in some style
the wolfsburg striker has been a transformed player since 2014 ticked over into 2015 and just ca n't stop scoring
hardly prolific in the first - half of the season , with just one goal to his credit , the dutchman is now europe 's hottest striker following a sensational run of form
dost 's double in wolfsburg 's thrilling 5 - 3 comeback win over werder bremen on sunday took his 2015 tally to 13 goals in eight outings
dost celebrates yet another goal - this time in wolfsburg 's 5 - 3 win at werder bremen on sunday the tall dutchman striker jumps for joy after scoring for wolfsburg against hertha berlin last weekend january 30 - two goals wolfsburg 4 bayern 1 february 7 - one goal wolfsburg 3 hoffenheim 0 february 14 - four goals bayer leverkusen 4 wolfsburg 5 february 19 - two goals wolfsburg 2 sporting lisbon 0 february 22 - two goals wolfsburg 2 hertha berlin 1 march 1 - two goals werder bremen 3 wolfsburg 5 his total is second only to barcelona 's argentine star lionel messi , who has 15 goals in 14 matches since the beginning of january
but arguably dost 's current form is more impressive , given that the bundesliga only resumed on january 30 following its winter break
having scored against cologne in wolfsburg 's last fixture before the winter pause , dost picked up where he 'd left off with two against league leaders bayern on january 30
he then found the net in the home win over hoffenheim on february 7 , before scoring four in a remarkable 5 - 4 win at bayer leverkusen a week later
the run has continued , with dost scoring two goals in each of wolfsburg 's matches with sporting lisbon , hertha berlin and werder bremen in the last fortnight
the 25 - year - old 's prolific form has pretty much sealed wolfsburg a place in next season 's champions league - though they are eight points behind runaway leaders bayern , they have a 10 - point cushion from third - placed borussia monchengladbach
they are also through to a last 16 europa league tie with italian giants inter milan
dost 's form has also stolen the thunder of andre schurrle , who arrived at the volkswagen arena from chelsea on deadline day for a fee of Â£ 22m
' things keep going , and they 're going well , ' said dost after his brace in werder bremen
' every week i 'm here saying that [ the goals ] will stop again , but i just keep going and we 'll see where i am in the end
' dost 's form has ensured wolfsburg are on course for a champions league place dost celebrates after scoring in wolfsburg 's dramatic 5 - 3 win at werder bremen on sunday it has n't always been so good for dost
this is his third season in the bundesliga and by some way his best - he scored 12 in 33 matches in his first season at wolfsburg , then five in 15 last year
the 6ft 5in target man has prospered from an effective link up with the former chelsea man kevin de bruyne , who has contributed six assists since the bundesliga resumed in january
born in the dutchman city of deventer , dost 's first professional clubs were emmen and heracles almelo , where 15 goals during the 2009 - 10 season led to rumours of a move to ajax
in the end , the 20 - year - old moved elsewhere in the eredivisie to heerenveen and realised his potential with two prolific seasons
in 2011 - 12 , he scored a remarkable 38 goals in 39 matches in dutchman league and cup , finishing as the country 's top goalscorer
dost salutes the crowd at the volkswagen arena after scoring in the win over hertha berlin applying a cool finish to score against hertha berlin during the recent bundesliga encounter inevitably , there was interest from the premier league , with dost turning down a Â£ 7m move to aston villa at the time
instead he moved to the bundesliga and wolfsburg , making an immediate impact with a stoppage time winner away to stuttgart on his debut
aside from that , his winner at defending champions borussia dortmund last season was also memorable
but it is this season that has seen dost elevate his game to another level
having started the campaign as wolfsburg 's third - choice striker , he is now indispensible
with his eye for goal , clinical finishing , aerial prowess and ability to hold the ball up , dost has matured into the complete package , raising plenty of eyebrows throughout the football world .
