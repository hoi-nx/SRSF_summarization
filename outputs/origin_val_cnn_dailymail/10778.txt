neighbors say it was a suicide pact gone wrong scene : police were called to the studio city home of blackstone on monday , after she reported finding her sister and three dogs dead in the garage stephanie âs husband , dennis , 68 , added : â around 4pm they brought jill out and she was conscious and she was sitting up , but they did nât bring anyone else out
' then they brought out one of the dogs , wrapped in a sheet
â the cohens explained how the sisters were under a great deal of pressure , especially jill , 52 , as wendy was deaf
to make matters worse the sisters were facing being forced out of their home in the san fernando valley area by developers
neighbors exclusively told daily mail online said they heard through the police that wendy had died by asphyxiation and were led to believe the incident had been an attempted double suicide , possibly by trying to poison themselves with fumes from their car
stephanie cohen , 60 , who lives across the street from the sisters said : â the police were here for 12 to 14 hours on saturday
we were told they were investigating a double suicide , an attempt , and one of the people died
â on wednesday numerous signs were posted on the property saying it had been marked for demolition
stephanie added : â they were having a hard time finding a new home because the sister that died was very ill - she could nât see , she could nât hear , she was housebound , she was very ill. so she needed to find a house that could accommodate her sister with the illness and the dogs
evidently the pressure was intense on them , but nobody expected this to happen
â according to tmz , jill was the one to call police , who subsequently arrested her after they concluded a suicide note reportedly left by her sister had actually been written by her
jill was initially held on $ 1 million bail before being released later on wednesday , and the case was sent to the los angeles police department for further investigation , according to the website
