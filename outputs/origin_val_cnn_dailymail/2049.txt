reasons to stay alive by matt haig matt haig was working in ibiza with his girlfriend andrea when his life suddenly changed
at 24 , he was a self - confessed party animal who drank too much , while eating and sleeping too little
one day he felt his brain flickering and tingling inside his head and he became overwhelmed by a feeling of intense panic as well as the desire to end his life
matt haig 's first - hand account of the brutal sickness is a scintillating read â to escape a mind on fire , where thoughts blaze and smoke like old possessions lost to arson
â he walked to a cliff edge , looked at the mediterranean and thought : â a single step â versus the pain of being alive
â from time to time most people will moan that they feel â depressed â
the word is easy to reach for when feeling vaguely down or perhaps when we âve become sad for a very good reason â such as a recent bereavement or the loss of a job
or when the stress of work or moving house is so great that you ca nât sleep â or get up in the morning
yet real clinical depression should not be confused with such other faces of gloom
in this short , scintillating , first - hand account of depression and how he combated it , novelist matt haig leaves us in no doubt as to the true , terrifying nature of the beast
writing 13 years after suddenly being struck down by â a new claustrophobic and suffering reality â , matt haig provides enough detail about the symptoms of depression to deter anyone from taking the name of this cruel condition in vain
sadness is not a sickness â but depression most certainly is
suicide kills more people than stomach cancer , cirrhosis of the liver , colon cancer , breast cancer or alzheimer âs , according to world health organisation figures
matt haig takes this a step further : â as people who kill themselves are , more often than not , depressives , depression is one of the deadliest diseases on the planet
â it kills more people than most other forms of violence â warfare , terrorism , domestic abuse , assault , gun crime â put together
â again and again he finds fresh ways of letting the reader know exactly how bad depression is : â at its worst you find yourself wishing , desperately , for any other affliction , and physical pain , because the mind is infinite , and its torments â when they happen â can be equally infinite
â one of his most valuable points he makes is that depression can strike down any sort of person
matt haig is highly educated , comes from a very happy background , has devoted parents and was already lucky enough to be in a stable relationship with the wonderful andrea that has proved a lifesaver
he wants us to understand that ( a ) depression is widespread and ( b ) anyone can be struck down
â millionaires , people with good hair , happily married people
people who exude happiness in their status updates , who seem , from the outside , to have no reason to be miserable
â matt haig gives plenty of â reasons to stay alive â
he comes up with two brilliantly creative sections , which take the form of a dialogue across time between the depressed matt haig â then â and the recovered ( or perhaps i should say , recovering ) matt haig â now
â so when the old self asks for a reason to go on living , the new self replies : â on the other side of this there is life
l - i-f-e. you understand ? and there will be stuff you enjoy
â the point is that someone like me can say things like that , but someone suffering from depression can easily retort : â you do nât know because you have nât been there ! â when matt haig focuses on his reasons to stay alive on page 117 , his ten clear points are all the more moving because you know this knowledge is hard won
in case depressives think they are alone , he tells them robustly there are millions like them , and even gives a list of 39 famous ones , including winston churchill
matt haig âs story of recovery will encourage anyone who feels miserable , whether they are clinically depressed or not , and offers valuable insights to family and friends , too
i love the essential wisdom of this : â you know , before the age of 24 i had nât known how bad things could feel , but i had nât realised how good they could feel either
it is quite therapeutic to know that pleasure does nât just help compensate for pain , it can actually grow out of it
â now there is nothing at all original in the suggestion that pain does pass and that you can learn from it
but it certainly needs repeating â again and again and again .
