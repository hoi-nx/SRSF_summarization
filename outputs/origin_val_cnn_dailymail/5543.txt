john inverdale âs latest on - air gaffe - inadvertently blurting out the c - word - has come at the worst possible time for his career
the host of radio 5 live âs cheltenham coverage was in conversation with jockey lizzie and former champion francome
they were chatting about francome âs early days in racing when inverdale said : â this is looking at it with rose - c * * * * * â rose - tinted glasses from the past ... i apologise there for a slip of the tongue , but lizzie your love of the sport just shines through
â john inverdale inadvertently said ' rose - c * * * * * glasses ' live on air during radio 5 live 's cheltenham coverage the blunder comes just over a fortnight before itv are due to announce their rugby world cup line - up
inverdale was in pole position to be lead presenter after a sure - footed anchoring of the rbs 6 nations helped restore his reputation following his crass remarks at wimbledon 2013 , when he said women âs champion marion bartoli was â never going to be a looker â
that incident caused secretary of state maria miller to complain to bbc director - general tony hall , who wrote back saying inverdale had been told â an incident of this nature must never happen again â
the bbc apologised but inverdale could pay the price when itv name their rugby world cup line - up paul downton , managing director of england , must realise his job would be untenable if peter moores , whom he appointed as coach , is axed after the rugby world cup debacle
paul downton naively rounded on a group of cricket reporters in wellington during his stay at the tournament to ask them to lay off the beleaguered peter moores and get behind him instead
if any move galvanises journalists to do the opposite to what they âre told , it âs a crass move like that

victoria pendleton will be a guest of her sponsors betfair , who have pr company pitch and racing strategist john maxse to plot her course
this looks like a fanciful promotional ploy but everyone involved insists it is a serious venture
the proof will be seeing victoria pendleton in the saddle next march

it has also emerged that he persuaded sky and host broadcasters star to let him be based in new zealand because he loves the outdoor life over there
cricket world cup broadcasters sky sports and star allowed sir ian botham be based in new zealand because he likes the outdoors there - even if it meant he missed england 's humiliating exit have 4,335 for the road ! paddy power , who specialise in causing mischief at cheltenham , were tame by their standards on tuesday , handing out a proposed 4,335 pints from a pop - up pub on the way to the course to recognise mccoy âs career winning rides
mccoy âs representatives complained about the stunt , which the bookmakers are not repeating
meanwhile , the name of cheltenham âs new Â£ 40million grandstand is to be decided by racecourse management and jockey club owners
but as the royal box is situated in the building , and given the make - up of the selection committee , a royal name is odds - on favourite
west ham , who have many racing enthusiasts in their squad , will be envious of cardiff city and aston villa being cheltenham guests of betway - the west ham â new kit sponsors
but west ham manager sam allardyce has taken the players training in dubai this week , meaning they will miss the festival and betway âs notable hospitality

the qatar will be training at st george 's park in may before a friendly against northern ireland to be played in the midlands
this is despite fa chairman greg dyke saying of the most controversial tournament in football history : â the best option would be to not hold it in qatar , but we are now beyond that so november - december would seem to be the best of the bad options
â the fa say qatar using sgp is purely a commercial matter , aimed at making sure the facility is used as much as possible
