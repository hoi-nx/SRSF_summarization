during the course of his relationships with his victims christopher higgs , a father - of - one , would tell them he had debts , either from previous relationships or in the form of household bills
he would emotionally blackmail them claiming to be depressed and suicidal at the pressure his debts were putting him under

during sentencing at plymouth crown court yesterday judge paul darlow described christopher higgs as ' a disgrace to the devon and cornwall constabulary
' the devon & cornwall ( headquarters pictured ) police officer has been suspended from duties since 2013 the victims each made statements in which they told of the horrendous effects suffered at his hands
one of them , a single mother , said he pressurised her daily into handing over money and ' begged and pleaded for money '
she said she was left ' unable to feed herself ' and she was left ' on her hands and knees begging as christopher higgs laughed in her face ' the court heard the women trusted christopher higgs ( pictured ) as an officer of devon and cornwall police force she said it was ' a horrific nightmare he put me under '

in a victim impact statement read out in court , one woman said : ' i was in a vulnerable position when chris higgs lied to me
' he abused his position as a police officer and a friend
i am now struggling to make ends meet because of the debt he left me in
' jason taylor , prosecuting , said : ' mr christopher higgs clearly had a gambling problem , and to fund this he manipulated women
' they fell foul of his charms and when that failed him he turned to intimidation and cajoling
' over the course of his relationships he applied psychological pressure in the form of saying he was suicidal
' robert linford , defending , said : ' he did not set out to befriend each of the complainants in order to defraud them
' they were people for whom he had a genuine feeling of affection and for whom he wanted to be with
' in the background christopher higgs had a secret addiction
to most of us who have never had an addiction , that word may sound like an excuse
' this is no excuse for what he did , but it 's the reason that lay behind his shameful years of offending
' at the time the word of christopher higgs was only as good as his next bet
' judge paul darlow told christopher higgs : ' over a period of three years you defrauded single women who until they met you were financially independent
' you got them to part with large sums of money they could ill afford to lose
plymouth crown court ( pictured ) heard christopher higgs was ' a disgrace to devon and cornwall constabulary ' ' they did not have much but it was their own
' the fact it was used in gambling makes the matter worse
' you are a disgrace to the devon and cornwall constabulary
' because he has no assets the judge made a nominal Â£ 1 confiscation order against christopher higgs , who was led away from the dock in handcuffs
christopher higgs , who served as a response police officer in the helston area , has been suspended from duties since january 2013
he will now be subject to a fast track internal disciplinary process
detective superintendent sam de reya said : ' pc higgs has acted in a wholly inappropriate and criminal manner for which he has rightly been convicted at court
' as soon as these allegations came to light , pc higgs was suspended and a full investigation launched which identified the victims and witnesses who have supported the investigation and criminal case
' as a priority the chief constable of devon & cornwall police will now oversee a special case hearing to complete the misconduct process and finalise pc higg 's current position as a police constable
' det supt de reya added : ' devon & cornwall police expects the highest ethical and professional conduct from all officers and staff operating within the force
' pc higgs ' actions have fallen well below the standards expected on a number of occasions resulting in criminal offences being identified
' the offences significantly impacted the victims who were members of the public , colleagues , family and friends and our thoughts and considerations are with them as pc higgs begins his custodial sentence
