as expected , israeli prime minister netanyahu gave a rousing speech to u.s. congress , rich in historic imagery and replete with literary references
yet a speech filled with powerful words is no substitute for a strategy for actually preventing iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon
as national security adviser susan rice told the pro-israel lobbying group aipac on monday , " precisely because this is such a serious issue , we must weigh the different options before us and choose the best one
sound bites wo n't stop iran from getting a nuclear weapon
" the obama administration , on the other hand , is making a strong and credible case that the deal it is pursuing would block iran 's pathways to developing the fissile material necessary for a bomb and extend the time for iran to produce enough weapons - grade uranium to build a bomb from today 's estimated three months to at least a year
without a deal , iran would revert to building up its stockpile of nuclear uranium , while the international community would lose the ability to monitor and track iran 's activities
at the top of the list of questions the prime minister failed to address is how such a scenario in the wake of " no deal " would actually make israeli safer ? as rice said : " here 's what 's likely to happen without a deal
iran will install and operate advanced centrifuges
iran will seek to fuel its ( plutonium ) reactor in arak
iran will rebuild its uranium stockpile
and , we 'll lose the unprecedented inspections and transparency we have today
" if no deal that the u.s. and five other powers actually might strike with the iran would be acceptable to netanyahu , how does he propose to deal with the iran nuclear threat ? he spoke about ratcheting up international sanctions against iran and keeping them in place until iran ceased regional aggression , sponsorship of terrorism and threatens to annihilate israeli
but years of extraordinarily tough sanctions did not persuade the iran to abandon their nuclear program or prevent them moving it forward
neither did cyberwarfare or a series of assassinations of iran scientists
and if the u.s. was seen as walking away from a possible agreement , the international sanctions regime would likely crumble , not strengthen
iran hard - liners who oppose an agreement would be back in the driver 's seat in tehran , while those would want to see iran rejoin the international community would be discredited and sidelined
it is doubtful that netanyahu really believes sanctions would end the iran nuclear program
that leaves one other option -- military force
of course , israeli could order a military strike on iran any time it chooses , but israeli 's ability to inflict significant damage on iran 's widely dispersed and heavily defended nuclear facilities is limited
when the discussion turns to military action , what is really meant is u.s. military action
it is understandable that a foreign leader speaking in the u.s. congress would shy away from openly asking washington to attack another country , especially after the experience of the 2003 invasion of iraq , which netanyahu also lobbied for
we should recall netanyahu 's september 2002 testimony to the house foreign affairs committee , six months before the u.s. assault on baghdad began , when he said : " it 's not a question of whether iraq 's regime should be taken out but when should it be taken out ; it 's not a question of whether you 'd like to see a regime change in iran but how to achieve it
" netanyahu may have learned from that experience
he knows that the u.s. public is weary of war and has no appetite for another military adventure in the middle east
that 's why he advocates policies that would put the u.s. on a path to military action without mentioning the words " military action
" this israeli leader , who faces a tough election back home in two weeks , has mastered the art of policy vagueness
he applied the same strategy to the failed negotiations with the palestinians last year , declaring he was in favor of a two - state solution but never putting forward a detailed proposal for where the border should be drawn -- or on any other substantive issue for that matter
his biggest demand once again was rhetorical -- that the palestinians recognize israeli as a jewish state
this is an israeli leader who believes in the power of words -- especially his words
but words are no substitute for a strategy -- and that 's where netanyahu once again failed himself , his country and his audience .
