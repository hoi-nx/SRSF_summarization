this is the thrilling moment a professional surfer jumped ship as a major wave at a california surfing spot crashed into his boat
mark healey , 33 , was at mavericks , a famous big wave surfing spot near half moon bay , when he saw the wave coming toward him and made the split second decision
mark healey turned to his friends and said ' i do n't know about you guys , but i 'm jumping '
his friends chose to hold on hard to the railings ' typically , in a potential maritime disaster , the best idea is to stay with the boat , ' mark healey told fox news
' but i really did n't feel like getting smashed around like an ice cube in a shaker
' mark healey , who is also a free - diver and part - time hollywood stuntman , sailed over deck and into the sea while his friends held on hard to the railing
after the wave passed , the boat was still standing upright and mark healey got picked up by his friends , who he said were ' basically crying laughing at me '
mark healey , who is also a free - diver and part - time hollywood stuntman , said he did n't ' feel like getting smashed around like an ice cube in a shaker ' mark healey pops back up for air after the wave passes and leaves the boat still standing upright ' i came up pretty much dying laughing , and then i checked to make sure everybody was okay on the boat , ' he said
' there was some damaged equipment , soaked cameras , but everybody was pretty much in good shape
' mark healey posted a video of his incredible jump on his official facebook page in december , writing ' this was the best wave i got at mavericks saturday ! ' ' that 's me flying through the air , trying to put as much space between myself and the potentially doomed boat
' the video only recently went viral after it won the 2015 wipeout of the year at the xxl big wave awards last week
