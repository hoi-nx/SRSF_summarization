ever wondered what the football world would be like without messi and cristiano ronaldo ? well naturally we 'd miss their stunning goals and dazzling trickery , but it seems erasing them would shake up the order of things in spain
stats gurus opta have calculated what the la liga table would look like if the goals of the divine duo were taken away - and there 's quite a dramatic change at the top
la liga would look very different if the goals of cristiano ronaldo and messi were taken away the deadly duo have scored 57 goals between them in la liga alone this season - cristiano ronaldo 30 , messi 27 real madrid currently enjoy a two - point advantage over their rivals barcelona in the la liga standings how the la liga table would look if goals by cristiano ronaldo and messi were taken away ( opta ) in real life , real madrid currently enjoy a two - point advantage over their clasico rivals , thanks in no small part to the 30 league goals of cristiano ronaldo this season
but if they and messi 's contribution of 27 goals were subtracted , it 's barcelona who would enjoy a slender one - point advantage at the summit
opta went through every match this season in which messi and cristiano ronaldo have scored and took away their goals from the final score
cristiano ronaldo celebrates his goal in real madrid 's 1 - 1 home draw with villarreal at the weekend the portuguese was also on target in real madrid 's 2 - 0 victory at elche last month cristiano ronaldo celebrates one of his hat - trick of goals in real madrid 's 3 - 0 home win over celta vigo in december with messi , barcelona would still win all but one of the matches in which he has scored
that is the 3 - 2 home win over villarreal last month , which would end in a draw
but taking away cristiano ronaldo 's goals affects real madrid 's season more dramatically
the portuguese scored four in the 5 - 1 home win over elche , meaning they would only draw 1 - 1
messi claims the match ball after his hat - trick in barcelona 's 5 - 1 rout of neighbours espanyol messi 's 27 league goals this season have seen him surpass the all - time la liga scoring record messi celebrates with team - mates pedro and marc bartra after scoring in the 5 - 0 rout of levante last month removing his hat - trick against celta vigo would see them claim one point rather than three , and subtracting his goal against villarreal last weekend means they would lose instead of draw
it does prove to an extent that real madrid are more reliant on the goals of cristiano ronaldo than barcelona are on the goals of messi
but in such a nip and tuck title race , who 's to say that wo n't change again by the end of the season
