she may be known for her gleaming , blonde locks , but gwyneth paltrow has made no secret of the fact she ca nât style her own hair
such is her love of a professional look , she invested in a chain of u.s. blow - dry bars last year
the first branch has just opened in london , offering seven hollywood hairdos inspired by the actress , who is also the creative director â all at just Â£ 28 a throw
the chain also has to satisfy her eco-credentials , so the salon does not use styling products that contain any chemical preservatives â called parabens â or sulphates
as a customer , all you have to do is point at the look you like best on the salon menu before you sit back for 45 minutes and sip a green tea as the stylist gets to work
fellow blonde mandie went along to try four of gwyneth paltrow âs most distinctive styles , and see if it really is possible to get hollywood hair on the cheap
sleek volume sleek volume : gwyneth paltrow rocked the ' sleek volume ' at the 2005 oscars ( pictured ) the style : the salon âs name for this look is the red carpet
gwyneth paltrow rocked a similar look at the oscars in 2005
and even the shampoo the stylist is rubbing into my hair has hollywood connections
the salon uses a range called unite by beverly hills celebrity hairdresser andrew dale and is free from paraben preservatives and sulphates
it turns out this is the first of many products that i need to be red carpet - ready
there âs a conditioner , then a mousse , followed by volumising spray
then a slick of another gwyneth paltrow favourite â argan oil
once my pampered hair has been rough - dried , my blo stylist sundya divides it into small sections , rolling each one up into pin curls and securing them on my head with a grip
another blast with the hairdryer and these are gently unrolled
sundya then backcombs the roots before smoothing and separating the curls and fixing the whole look with a whoosh of hairspray
verdict : my hair has more energy and bounce than gwyneth paltrow after a pint of organic green juice
and it feels beautifully soft and natural rather than set and brittle
it âs me , but with added va - va voom
result ! 5/5 tousled tresses the style : this just - got - out - of - bed look , called pillow talk , is easy to achieve when you have your own beverly hills celebrity stylist on speed dial
but if my pillows could talk , they would swear blind they âd never seen my hair looking like this first thing in the morning
sundya reveals gwyneth paltrow âs secret â a salt - water spray to give the hair that matt , slept - in look
tousled tresses : this just - got - out - of - bed look looks easy to achieve but is actually far from it , blo stylist sundya reveals salt - water spray is the secret to creating that slept - in look once she âs sprayed this on and blow - dried my hair using a medium round brush , she twizzles small sections into tight twists , and winds them individually around the barrel of a tong , holding them in place with her fingertips for about 15 seconds each
â this gives more of a wave than a curl , â she says
she then gently brushes through the medusa - like tendrils to create a more relaxed effect , before fixing it with hairspray
verdict : i do nât look â sensual and innocent â , as promised on the salon menu
even â messy beach waves â does nât describe my hair at the end of 45 minutes
far from looking like the sexy surfer girl i had imagined , i am reminded of a bowl of spiral pasta
2/5 amazing grace the style : gwyneth paltrow is no stranger to an up - do
sundya says the key is â all about prepping the hair for a sleek finish â , and i soon discover this involves lots of products , from leave - in conditioner to a â lazer straight relaxing fluid â which smoothes frizz
my hair is blown straight and pulled into a high ponytail
amazing grace : gwyneth paltrow showed off a classic updo in 1996 film , emma ( left )
mandie ( right ) learnt that the key to this delicate look is preparing your hair for a ' sleek finish ' , which can involve a lot of products to create the topknot â gwyneth paltrow calls this look the high society â the ponytail is divided into thick sections and tonged into a chunky curl to help coax a rounded bun shape out of my straight hair
as sundya works her way round the ponytail , she carefully fans out each section , spreading and pinning it to create the bun
when i look in the mirror through the fog of hairspray , i swear i can see grace kelly
the menu â guarantees this coif will get you what you want â , and it âs true , my bun stays firm and perky all day , even winning a few compliments from strangers
4/5 backcomb ponytail the style : gwyneth paltrow rocked a beehive at a louis vuitton event a few years ago
but as i soon discover , this is a seriously high â maintenance look â not for nothing the salon calls it the hunt club â that takes a lot of backcombing
backcomb ponytail : another favourite of gwyneth paltrow 's ( left ) is the beehive inspired ponytail
mandie ( right ) discovered that this seriously high - maintenance look took a lot of backcombing the vigorous brushing begins after my hair âs been washed and dried
and i panic at the sight of the matted bird âs nest on the top of my head
but minutes later sundya has pinned it back and miraculously smoothed away the coarse texture with a brush , while keeping all the volume
the lower lengths ( which were nât backcombed ) are swept into a side ponytail and fixed with a minimal band
sundya then wraps a small section of hair around the band to cover it â the ultimate gwyneth paltrow touch
verdict : my ponytail looks a bit sparse compared with the enormous pouffe on top of my head
the menu suggests it is â a polished look for an impromptu polo match â
sorry , but there are none of those going on where i live
