with this much hair to contend with , bathtime was bound to have an extra twist
and when daz needed to look his best for dog show crufts , which runs till sunday , it was never going to be a case of just â wash and go â
instead , an eight - hour clean - up operation ensued for the dread - locked komondor â involving three hours in the tub , then five more under a vast array of dryers
thankfully , placid daz soaks up the attention as well as the suds
locks like i need a bath : a pre-grooming walk relaxes the sprightly five - year - old daz suds - u - like : owner julie does four - shampoos - and - rinse jobs , before a final conditioner is massaged in it takes a lot of water to lather daz up , according to his owner the 10st 7lb five - year - old stands 33in to the shoulder and is one of around only 45 of his breed in the uk
puppies , which cost upwards of Â£ 1,200 , are born with downy coats that develop into dreadlocks ( or , to be correct , â cords â )
komondors are known as â the ultimate sheep - dog â in hungary , their country of origin , where their thick , shaggy hair protected them from the wolves and bears which threatened farmers â flocks
the cleaning process â at his owner branch âs dog grooming parlour â starts with daz stepping into a hydrobath , which has a door for easy access
the first challenge is to get his dense coat wet enough
miss branch , 52 , of harlow , essex , said : â it âs quite wiry and coarse , so it takes a lot of water before you can lather him up
â then its four shampoos and separate rinses before the conditioner goes on and a final rinse
a rubdown with a towel follows , plus a once - over with a â wet - and - dry â vacuum cleaner to suck out as much water as possible
then it âs out with the arsenal of hairdryers
they include a Â£ 300 x power airmover , which gusts cool air over daz from its three large black hoses â and which is nicknamed â octopussy â by miss branch
â if we left him to dry naturally , it âd probably take up to four days , â said julie âs partner barry davison , 61 , who runs a courier business
high and dry : a hurricane of blowdryers slowly gets the komondor 's coat dried out finally , daz slips into a fetching green onesie that helps keep his locks spotless and means he can carry on as normal until show day
daz , whose pedigree name is jabenezer zolltan , will be at the birmingham nec today in the working and pastoral breeds section , where he has previously won top dog in the komondor class
needless to say , this year he âs hoping for a clean sweep of even more prestigious titles
on trend : a green onsie helps to stop a freshly blow - dried daz picking up dirt like a damp mop crufts - ready : a primped and preened daz is poised for the top spot - even if his podium is a little makeshift
