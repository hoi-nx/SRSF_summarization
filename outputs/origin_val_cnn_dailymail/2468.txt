hundreds of people were targeted by the scam with fraudsters posing as talktalk employees on the phone a major security breach has left thousands of talktalk customers at the mercy of fraudsters
criminals have stolen account numbers , addresses and phone numbers from the phone and broadband firm âs computers
the details have been used in attempts to scam hundreds of customers so far , with one man having Â£ 2,800 stolen from his bank account
masquerading as talktalk staff , the fraudsters phone their victims and try to make them disclose their bank details
it is not known how many of these customers were successfully tricked and had money stolen from them
the company , which has four million customers in all , has now sent an email to every one to warn them of the ruse
one of the techniques used by the fraudsters is to offer their victims a credit in return for their bank details
the customer then finds that their account has been emptied
the fraudulent callers are convincing because they have the customer âs details to hand
talktalk claims only a few thousand account details have gone astray
the data theft came to light when the company investigated a sudden rise in complaints about scam calls between october and december
talktalk insisted it had not been hacked and that the leak came instead from a third party contractor which had legitimate access to customer accounts
customers have taken to the company âs internet forum to air their grievances
one , who received a call from a suspected scammer , said a more prominent warning about the hacking incident should have been given earlier and â not hidden away at the bottom of a lengthy marketing email â
â hacking is a worldwide problem â it happens and you have to let us know immediately , not hide it away , â he wrote
â my 85 - year - old mother who is a talktalk customer could well have been taken in when the guy quoted all the correct info
â another angry customer wrote : â after months and months of being lied to by talktalk you are now finally admitting that you have had a security breach and that our details were accessed from your database
â he said several members of staff had denied there was a problem , adding : â you should be ashamed of yourselves as it is your customers who have suffered and in some cases like my own , have suffered financially
â another wrote on the forum : â this internet provider must have the worst security and data protection for its customers in the business
â the company says it was not hacked but that the details were stolen by a third party
it investigated following a new wave of complaints last year a further disgruntled customer accused talktalk of conducting a damage limitation exercise : â it âs only taken them months to decide to come out and let customers know , or should i say forced to come out and let them know , as they had no option as word spread
â others highlighted problems of dealing with call centres in india
in a statement , talktalk said : â we have become aware that some limited , non-sensitive information about some customers could have been illegally accessed in violation of our security procedures
â we are aware of a small , but nonetheless significant , number of customers who have been directly targeted by these criminals and we have been supporting them directly
â the firm said the problem had also been reported to the information commissioner âs office
