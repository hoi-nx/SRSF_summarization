" india 's daughter , " the bbc documentary about the infamous 2012 gang rape in delhi , premiered in the americans last week
if you have n't seen it , you have likely heard selections from the film 's interview with singh , who is on death row for the crime
" a decent girl wo n't roam around at nine o'clock at night
a girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy , " he says
" when being raped , she should n't fight back
she should just be silent
" certain other men interviewed for the documentary say such things as , " in our culture , there is no place for a woman " and that if a daughter or sister " engaged in pre-marital activities ... i would put petrol on her and set her alight
" note : those men are not rapist - murderers
many ( i 'd like to think most ) of us cringed at these comments and their garishly clear misogyny
but these words were not just a window into one uniquely deranged soul
let 's be clear : singh is just reading -- perhaps more loudly and cruelly than others , but still -- from a cultural script we all share
perhaps your first thought when you heard or read those words was , " violence against women is really bad ... in india
" and in many ways , of course , it is
reports this weekend of a robbery at a christian school in eastern india , in which , officials said , one of the assailants allegedly raped a 70 - year - old nun , add to the narrative
but as unfathomable as this brutality is , we must resist the temptation to presume some sort of americans violence - against - women exceptionalism , making others the bad guys while crowing about " how far women have come " in the americans
or to say , " sure , we still have issues , but not like that
" i know that temptation is there
our global human rights organization , based in the americans and india , works to inspire individuals and institutions to drive the culture change needed to make violence against women unacceptable
when i describe our work -- including our campaigns and issues in both countries and beyond -- the questions people ask often reveal their at least initial assumption : that we here in the americans are working solely to stop violence against women in india
yet we do have issues in the americans , issues " like that
" we have mass murderer elliot rodger , who before he killed six people and injured 14 others in isla vista california last year , wrote his own 137 - page version of that same misogynist script
we know from " the hunting ground , " documentarian kirby dick 's film about sexual assault on college campuses -- also now in theaters -- that multitudes of women , and many men , have had violated their right to an education free from violence
we know that women are leaving the tech industry , wall street , and internet feminism in droves due to untenable discrimination and violence
we know that women ( and people of all genders ) are assaulted by strangers and intimates every day
and what of the response ? as zak cheney-rice noted , discussing " india 's daughter " in mic.com , " from india to the americans , citizens and officials alike display a troubling inclination to sympathize with rapists and vilify their victims
" a united nations report released last week , marking the 20th anniversary of the landmark women 's rights conference in beijing , confirms that ( as the new york times put it ) " violence against women -- including rape , murder and sexual harassment -- remains stubbornly high in countries rich and poor , at war and at peace
we ca n't relegate such violence to " the other , " to the " not here , not us , not me
" to do so is not only incorrect , it is damaging
yes , we must be concerned for the human rights of all the world 's citizens
yes , violence against women varies in form and degree
but to imagine that violence against women happens only , or mostly , " somewhere else , " is exactly what keeps the culture of violence alive at home
concern for others does not absolve us of responsibility for ourselves
likewise , the extreme actions or words of a few marquee misogynists , wherever they live , do not absolve us
we must all ask ourselves : to what degree do we repeat those scripts , or stay silent when we hear them from others ? our actions , and inactions , fuel the culture from which both extreme and everyday violence and discrimination emerge
we can not furrow our brows about india , or any of those " others " -- abusive men in fraternities , for example -- and be done
indeed , " india 's daughter " premiered in the americans with the intent of drawing attention to gender inequality and sexual violence worldwide
so let 's bring about the day when the next buzzworthy documentary is about the women and men and allies of all genders who have stepped up , together , to say no more : not in my home , not in my school , not in my country , not anywhere .
