england head coach peter moores , who should surely be sacked after the world cup humiliation against bangladesh , is doubly fortunate at the timing of this rock - bottom moment for english cricket
firstly , the new regime at the ecb are concentrating on a big restructuring of the organisation , to the extent that axing the beleaguered peter moores was said not to be even on the agenda â or was nât last week
secondly , australia gillespie , who would be hot favourite to replace peter moores , is not sure he wants the role
gillespie has five children â with four under the age of 10 â and the county championship - winning yorkshire coach has promised wife anna he will put the family first
england coach peter moores ( left ) said he is ' desperate ' to continue after his side 's poor world cup campaign gillespie said : â my eldest daughter sapphire lives at home in australia with her mum and i did nât see her grow up as i was on the road playing for australia
i made a promise to myself that i would nât do the same again
the children are my priority , family come first
â and gillespie , who worked very successfully with england number two paul farbrace at a yorkshire bankrolled by new ecb chairman colin graves , added : â it would be a really big ask to go away 9 - 10 months a year
i would find that really difficult
i âd find that a challenge

however , the fa still regard their coaching badges as the gold standard and will react to the wales competition by putting on two pro-licence courses a year in future rather than one
but there will be no reduction in the extra hours involved in completing the sgp course â 500 as compared to 350 in wales â that the fa believe gives their set - up the edge
grand national winning jockey carl âs ghastly n - word comment on a racing preview panel on the eve of last year âs cheltenham festival seems to have been airbrushed out of insular racing âs memory one year on

â andy murray ( centre ) wears under armour sponsored kit whilst the rest of the great britain team wear nike andy murray looks anything but a team player â which he clearly is â in pictures on monday of the great britain davis cup group celebrating their win against the usa
the players and management are in nike - supplied official training kit , apart from andy murray who is wearing his under armour shirt
it transpires that there was nothing in under armour âs Â£ 3.5m - year - deal with andy murray to prevent him slipping on a gb tracksuit to demonstrate the side âs unity for the cameras
but the lawn tennis association , in their wisdom , did nât feel any need to have andy murray , who had come straight off court , pictured in team uniform
former wimbledon champion bartoli âs ambassador appearance at the recent qatari racing festival in doha has only added to speculation that the frenchwoman â crassly described during wimbledon as â not a looker â by john inverdale â is considering a return to the sport , but as a qatari citizen
and bartoli would receive a huge sum for changing nationalities , reportedly as much as Â£ 1million
