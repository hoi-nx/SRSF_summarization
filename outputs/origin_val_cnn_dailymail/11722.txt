joe hart did not need a blinder in barcelona to confirm his status as england âs no 1 goalkeeper , but serious injuries to his two deputies will revive concerns at the lack of cover available to hodgson
fraser forster met with specialists on wednesday after scans confirmed he broke his left knee - cap in southampton âs win against burnley on saturday
fraser forster will miss the rest of this season and may not play again this year which is a blow for southampton as they aim for europe , and also for england boss hodgson at a time when ben foster is out for six months
joe hart talks to the media on wednesday ahead of england 's euro 2016 qualifier against lithuania on friday manchester city goalkeeper joe hart makes a save during training at st george 's park with the england squad ben foster damaged cruciate ligaments in his left knee while playing for west brom against stoke 12 days ago
hodgson will be exposed if joe hart is hit by injury or suspension , although the manchester city goalkeeper has backed the decision to recall qpr âs rob green for the first time in nearly three years
â greeny is rock solid , â said joe hart
â his mentality is great
and he is a very good goalkeeper who has been playing at the top level for a long time
â i was gutted for ben and fraser
it âs really , really sad news
â it has rocked us all as a goalkeeping group and rocked all the lads in the squad because they are great guys and they are having great seasons
â but greeny has come in and hopefully he can profit
he did brilliantly in the championship last year

qpr are in a bad position but he has been fantastic this season
â rob green has 12 caps , but only one since the world cup in south africa when he was pilloried for a mistake which gifted the united states an equaliser as england drew 1 - 1 in their opening group game
he did not play again for fabio capello , and his only game since was against norway , in hodgson âs second game in charge
neymar attempts to nip the ball away from joe hart 's clutches at the nou camp during the champions league tie messi tries to find a way past joe hart but the england stopper was in fine form at the nou camp the english keeper once again thwarts messi during the champions league last - 16 encounter rob green , 35 , has not been in the squad since euro 2012 despite his reliable form at qpr , but will be on the bench for the euro 2016 qualifier against lithuania at wembley on friday and probably for the friendly against italy in turin on tuesday
butland , 22 , has been promoted from the under 21 squad
he has been capped once at senior level , in a friendly against italy in switzerland in 2012 , but he has had little first - team action this season
butland played six times during a loan spell at derby and has played five cup games for stoke , where he has been unable to oust bosnian international asmir begovic since signing from birmingham
others who might come into hodgson âs thinking are john ruddy , who also has one cap â as a half - time substitute for butland in that italy game â and is enjoying a good season in the championship with norwich , and heaton at burnley
heaton is at least playing regularly in the barclays premier league , where 75 per cent of the goalkeepers are foreign
butland âs step up leaves under 21 boss gareth southgate with two championship goalkeepers â jonathan bond , 21 , understudy to heurelho gomes at watford , and marcus bettinelli , 22 , who has recently broken into the fulham team
some experts believe the next keeper to emerge as a serious challenger to joe hart will be manchester city and england under 19 keeper angus gunn , 19 - year - old son of former scotland international bryan gunn
joe hart will win his 50th cap in italy on tuesday , if he plays in both these international games , and is still only 27
he could play at the top for another decade if he can stay fit â hodgson will pray that he does â and that would bring peter shilton âs record of 125 england caps into range
peter shilton was 31 when he played his 50th game for england but went on until he was 40
â it âs exciting , 50 caps would be an amazing milestone , but i want to get there first , â said joe hart
â we have two games and we âve seen recently that you never know what âs going to happen
i just want to push on and earn my right to keep playing for my country
peter shilton was 31 when he won his 50th england cap , while joe hart could win his against italy next week â i want to be here for as long as i can , but there are plenty of other english goalkeepers who want to be in my place and i âm going to have to be at my very best to keep that position
â tottenham defender danny rose on wednesday night withdrew from the squad with hip and hamstring problems
rose was called up by england after manchester united âs luke shaw withdrew on saturday
but the left back has now been sent back to his club with an injury of his own
with leighton baines and keiran gibbs already in the squad , hodgson has decided not to call up a replacement .
