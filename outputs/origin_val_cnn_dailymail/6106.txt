it is one of the world 's best loved musicals - the true story of a novice nun who falls in love with a widower and his seven children
from andrews waltzing through the alps to seven children behaving perfectly , the sound of music might look like it portrays the family everyone wants
but andrews ' real life counterpart - maria - was far from the idealized mother the popular film portrays
in fact she was a difficult austrian woman plagued by insecurities
he said : ' she was incredibly strong with a formidable will , literally an indomitable will
' and sometimes running into that will was not so pleasant
' the 75 - year - old added that his mother was very complex and admitted that she was unhappy as a child
maria was born in 1905 while travelling from her parents ' village in tyrol to a hospital in vienna , austrian , on a train
by the time she was ten both of her parents had died and she was sent to live with a violent uncle
maria escaped from him and in 1926 she was a schoolteacher at the nonnberg abbey , in salzburg , intending to become a nun
but while there she was asked to take a job as a governess at the home of a widowed man , who was left with seven children after his first wife agatha died of scarlet fever
they would quickly become married and have three more children
georg von trapp was previously the commander of austrian submarine u5

rosmarie , one of maria and georg von trapp 's children who does not feature in the film , said : ' we never went running in a field and singing songs like that ' it was not long before maria founded a family choir
although the children sang together before she joined them , they remember her particularly pushing public performances - especially after georg von trapp lost his fortune
rosmarie , one of maria and georg von trapp 's children , often found her mother particularly difficult
she said it got worse after her father died in 1947
' i was not happy on stage
i was made to do it , ' boudicca fox-leonard of the sunday people reported her saying
the now 87 - year - old said : ' we never went running in a field and singing songs like that
we had a hard life
' in real life , after fleeing the country in 1938 the georg von trapp 's came to rely on their musical performances for money she also recounts maria sending her for shock therapy after she had a breakdown and said she locked step - daughter johanna in a room for announcing she was getting married
after fleeing the country in 1938 , the family - known as the maria in the us - came to rely on the performances for money
the popular film was made after broadway found a book detailing the family 's adventurers

but director robert wise rebuffed her attempts to act as an adviser
he admitted in an interview : ' she was bossy , i did n't like that about her
' even director robert wise rebuffed maria 's attempts to act as an adviser

four of the couple 's great - grandchildren are still attempting to keep the tradition alive
sofi , melanie , amanda , and their younger brother august have revived the family 's musical heritage and are singing together
they can remember little of their great - grandmother
sofi said : ' we know she was a little impulsive , but without her the family would never have survived as a single group
' the captain would have been taken off to war if it was n't for the singing
' the sound of music story , by tom santopietro , is out now .
