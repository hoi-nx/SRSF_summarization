president obama has revealed he heard the revelations hilary clinton used a private email account to conduct official state business at ' the same time as everybody else ' when news reports surfaced
in an interview with cbs during his trip to selma , alabama , he defended the former secretary of state and applauded her decision to release the emails
' i 'm glad that hilary clinton 's instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed , ' obama said , according to an excerpt of the interview released by the network
' i think that the fact that she is putting them forward will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need , ' obama said in the interview , versions of which will be aired on sunday morning on cbs
' the policy of my administration is to encourage transparency , which is why my emails , the blackberry i carry around , all those records are available and archived , ' obama added
the growing controversy over clinton 's use of personal email for work while she was u.s. secretary of state threatens to cloud the expected launch of her campaign
clinton tried to quell the growing controversy late on wednesday , saying she wanted the state department to release the emails quickly
but a senior state department official told reuters on thursday the task would take time
transparency : the president applauded the front - runner for the 2016 democratic nominee for saying she would release the emails following criticism ' the review is likely to take several months given the sheer volume of the document set , ' the official said
the state department has said there was no prohibition during clinton 's tenure on using personal email for official business as long as it was preserved
a total of 55,000 pages of documents covering the time clinton was in office has been turned over , according to the state department
but clinton and her aides controlled that process , and the emails were not archived on government servers .
