google is trying to shake up the auto industry with more than self - driving cars , as a new service launched in california will help drivers shop for car insurance
it is thought that this could foreshadow the company 's latest attempt to shake up a long - established industry and has raised questions as to whether google may one day start selling policies
called google compare for car insurance , the tool allows people to compare offerings from different insurance providers
the new service , unveiled on thursday , compares auto insurance quotes from up to 14 carriers that are participating in the comparisons

the mountain view , california , company has said that the size of the commissions will not influence how it ranks the price quotes
ellen carney , an analyst for forrester research , wrote in january that google may be making moves to ramp up its insurance knowledge base through an acquisition of san francisco - based coverhound
coverhound has developed its own platform for consumers to shop for car insurance and an acquisition would also bring a lot of insurance market experience to google
some of the largest auto insurance providers , including state farm , allstate , progressive and geico , have n't joined google 's service
progressive and allstate 's esurance.com also provide auto insurance price comparisons
it is thought that they fear that one day google might compete with them , and no longer act as a middle - man
google has a uniquely dominant position as a search provider through which it can potentially challenge the status quo in an industry
carney pointed out that google is learning about the industry as a step towards one day selling and underwriting its own policies
' they are getting all the data that they need to do it , ' carney said
' i think there is definitely more to come here
' however , a google spokesperson said the company has no plans to sell or underwrite insurance
to date in the u.s. only drivers in california can use the service , but it is expected to be rolled out in illinois , pennsylvania , and texas among other states in the near future the service follows the successful launch of a car insurance comparison tool in the u.k. in 2012
analysts speculate that this is the first move by the company towards actually selling insurance google announced the service through its adwords blog and highlighted some of the features that should make it attractive for both insurance providers and customers
' whether you 're a national insurance provider or one local to california , people searching for car insurance on their phone or computer can find you along with an apples - to - apples comparison of other providers -- all in as little as 5 minutes , ' said google
' you can highlight what makes your business unique , whether that 's an " a " rating in customer service or better discounts for safe drivers
and when users adjust their deductible or add additional cars to their quote , you can show updated pricing that matches their needs
' google plans to provide car insurance quotes in other states , too - illinois , pennsylvania , and texas are suspected to be among the next states
the service follows the lead of the google compare service in the u.k. , which launched in 2012 and allows users to get quotes from 126 providers
google also has similar services in the u.k. for travel insurance , mortgage quotes and credit cards .
