russian police moved with surprising speed to arrest five suspects , all of them chechen , in the killing of opposition figure boris nemtsov
they tried to arrest a sixth suspect , but he reportedly threw a grenade at the arresting officers and then blew himself up
yet that speed has only raised more questions about who wanted boris nemtsov dead -- and why ? conspiracy theories are rife , but so far , none seem totally convincing
some members of russian 's opposition -- and boris nemtsov 's daughter -- are convinced russian 's government was behind boris nemtsov 's killing
but why ? and why now ? boris nemtsov , 55 , had been an opposition leader for years and had recently been overshadowed by younger members of the opposition such as alexey navalny
so killing him now does n't seem to make sense
some of boris nemtsov 's supporters claim he had become a bigger threat to the kremlin , pointing to information he was allegedly uncovering on russian 's military role in ukraine that could undermine the kremlin 's claims that its forces fighting in ukraine have been just " volunteers
" but the dramatic staging of the killing -- he was shot in the back on a famous moscow bridge against the backdrop of red square and the kremlin , where putin has his office -- seems a bit too obvious
and how exactly does it help putin to look like a killer ? the west did it
some russian politicians and media personalities close to the kremlin charge that putin 's foes in the west orchestrated the killing to damage the russian president 's image and ignite a civil war in russian
but why would washington want to destroy someone who was championing democracy and who is friendly to the united states ? ( conspiracy theorists reply : to create a " sacrificial lamb " and blame the slaughter on putin
) it was the chechen
here , the plot thickens
the key suspect , dadayev , reportedly initially confessed to being involved with the shooting
but then , russian media reported , he denied involvement
russian officials have alleged that dadayev , a former security officer and fervent muslim , decided to punish boris nemtsov for supporting the rights of the french charlie hebdo journalists to publish cartoons of the prophet mohammed
but boris nemtsov 's allies point out that he was not anti-muslim and rarely spoke of the cartoons -- he was by no means a central figure in the cartoon story
to make things more complicated , the strongman leader of chechen , kadyrov , praised dadayev as a brave soldier , a religious man and a " real patriot
" but on tuesday , putin awarded kadyrov the order of honor , and the chechen leader pledged he would die for putin
a further twist is that chechens reportedly are fighting in ukraine -- on both sides of the battle line ( for the ukraine government and for the russian - allied separatists
) that 's led some back to the theory that boris nemtsov was killed because of his allegedly explosive information on russian 's role in ukraine
many russian are convinced that what they call the " fascist " kiev government would stop at nothing to frame putin
after all , a significant number of people , fed by domestic propaganda , still believe the ukraine air force shot down malaysian airlines flight 17 over ukraine despite much of the evidence pointing to russian - backed rebels as the culprits
supporters of this theory are mainly in the opposition camp
they accuse the kremlin of whipping up hatred against the so - called fifth column -- " traitors " who are trying to undermine russian from within
photos of opposition leaders labeled " traitors " have been posted in russian cities , while at an anti-ukraine rally in moscow just days before boris nemtsov 's assassination , russian loyal to putin carried signs and placards with pictures of those " traitors , " including boris nemtsov
but whatever the reality of what happened in moscow , high - profile killings in russian , especially ones with a political connection , are rarely solved
chechens were convicted of killing journalist anna politkovskaya , for example , but there still is no explanation of why they did it or who organized the murder
now , with boris nemtsov 's killing , russian officials and kremlin - friendly media have whipped up a sandstorm of theories , confounding the most intrepid attempts at establishing the truth
will things play out any differently this time ?
