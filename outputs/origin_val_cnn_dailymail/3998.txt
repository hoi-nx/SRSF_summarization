' happy feet ' may have triggered the world 's interest into the largest penguin species , but little was actually known about the fluctuating numbers of the emperor penguin , until now
the very first study into how the antarctic 's climate has affected the birds over the past 30,000 years has been conducted by a team of researchers , including some from the university of tasmania and the australian antarctic division
it was found that at some point , the antarctic was too cold for these birds
temperatures were at least 15 degrees colder on average than they are today and just three colonies of the penguin survived that period
lead researcher younger said that despite emperor penguins being accustomed to temperatures of minus 30c , the last ice age seems to have been a snap too cold for them
the study shows how the climate has affected the birds over the past 30,000 years , finding that antarctic was once too cold for them the warming has made it easier for the emperor penguins to feed as the sea ice has melted and lessened the distance to the ocean ' due to there being about twice as much sea ice compared to current conditions , the penguins were unable to breed in more than a few locations around antarctic , ' ms younger said
' the distances from the open ocean , where the penguins feed , to the stable sea ice where they breed was probably too far
' the findings have suggested that the current sea ice conditions might be optimal for the emperor penguin population
with the species flourishing , the study has shown that their numbers began to increase over the last 12,000 years when temperatures rose and the sea ice began to decline
this warming would have made it easier for the penguins to access the ocean to feed
researchers are currently unable to determine the future of the largest and heaviest penguin species as they are clearly very sensitive to climate change and the current ideal conditions for these birds may not last .
