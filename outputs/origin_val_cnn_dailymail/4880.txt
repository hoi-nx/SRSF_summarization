it is a pioneer of ' affordable luxury '
but the expected price tag on one of apple 's new watches is far from wallet - friendly
at $ 10,000 , the 18 - carat gold , sapphire and crystal apple watch edition being launched on monday would be the firm 's most expensive product since the $ 10,000 lisa computer in 1983 , developed by steve jobs , which was poorly received
it is the first new innovation to come from apple since steve jobs died in 2011 , and will be unveiled by chief executive tim cook on monday
analysts have branded the move a clear attempt to segway into asia 's booming luxury goods market - and suggest it could be the start of an entirely new market
this is unprecedented , ' dawson , chief technology analyst for jackdaw research , told dailymail.com
' i think this is apple flexing its muscles , moving into a space that it potentially has all to itself
' the question is : how big is that market ? is apple eating into the market or making it bigger ? ' i think they will make it grow
' tim cook is expected to explain in detail how customers will use the buttons on the side of the device to operate the apps on the screen like an iphone 6
at the other end of the spectrum , customers can opt for a midrange watch or an ' entry - level ' watch sport , starting at $ 349 - a fraction of most watch prices on the market
tag heuer 's monaco men 's watch will set shoppers back $ 72,000
the rolex gmt-master ii mens automatic watch costs an eye - watering $ 373,720
the move into this market comes months after apple poached burberry 's ceo angela ahrendts to be the new senior vice president of retail and sales - and lend a fashionable eye
alongside yves saint laurent 's paul deneve , as a ' special projects ' vice president , and designer marc newson , as a part - time consultant , the team has masterminded the firm 's unprecedented move
big move : the products will be the first new innovations to come from apple since steve jobs died in 2011 wearables : analysts say the shift into wearables will be a major breakthrough for the firm targeting china in october , a prototype of the edition watch even appeared at paris fashion week
however , some have speculated that without a solid grounding in the high - end retail market , the apple edition watch could suffer the same flaws as most iphones , which cease to efficiently function after a few years
but according to serdari , luxury brand strategist and lecturer at sotheby âs institute of art in new york , the details of the edition model that have been released look promising
she told dailymail.com : ' apple produces good design , and i hate to say it but good design is priceless
' from what i have seen , the gold watch has a very elegant profile
the very slight curve shows that the design has been very well studied to fit on your wrist
i am curious to see how it actually feels
' i would n't be surprised if customers have the option of keeping the strap and the casing but updating the software , which would create loyalty and longevity
' serdari , who also lectures on product and fashion design at nyu , notes that apple is following the classic launch strategy of designer brands like chanel , which uses pricing to carve a position in the market
' chanel targets a broad market and in order to maintain the air of luxury increases the prices often very steeply
shoe - in : apple poached burberry 's ceo angela ahrendts to help make a play for the fashion world fashionable : yves saint laurent 's paul deneve ( left ) and designer mark newson ( right ) also worked on it ' if the watch is $ 10,000 , it would be a great way for apple to differentiate itself from the gadget - based market , which is highly competitive
' in my opinion , apple is very well positioned to make the transition to move up
' if successful , the edition watch could act as a springboard for apple to rocket into its bulls - eye : china
tim cook has repeatedly remarked that he predicts china to eventually overtake america as their biggest market
the popularity of the iphone 6 drove the firm 's market share in china to a record high , reaching 25.4 per cent by january 2015 - clouding out samsung as the country 's second - largest seller
however , xiaomi - widely dubbed ' the apple of china ' - remains firm with 27.6 per cent of the market
venturing into watches and potentially other wearables , with ahrendts at the helm , could be the leap that clinches it
dawson said : ' they could really move into anything - necklaces , bracelets , brooches ... it 's not clear how those might feature a screen to function in the way that a watch does
but apple is certainly in a position to try
