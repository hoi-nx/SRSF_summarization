crude roadside bombs filled with toxic chlorine gas are now being used by isis terrorists , it has been reported
iraqi officials say government forces have defused dozens of the devices in the course of their war with the fanatics and have produced video footage which backs up their claim
one iraqi bomb disposal expert said that the use of the chemical is a sign of desperation
crude roadside bombs filled with chlorine gas are now being used by isis terrorists , it has been reported haider taher told the bbc : ' they 're resorting to this new method , putting chlorine in these home - made roadside bombs , which is toxic to those that inhale it
' he described how his team detonated a bomb in tikrit that , unbeknown to them , contained chlorine
they immediately began feeling the effects of the chemical , experiencing ' painful choking ' and blocked throats
the bbc has been shown footage of bright yellow gas rising up from a roadside bomb explosion that the iraqi say is chlorine , as well as film of the tikrit explosion
jennifer cole , senior research fellow at defence thinktank royal united services institute , told mailonline that although chlorine can be lethal , it does appear that it 's being used to spread fear by isis
she said : ' chlorine is easily available from a number of industrial sources and is very hazardous â causing breathing difficulties in particular and in extreme cases prolonged exposure can kill
' used in roadside bombs such as this , in the open air , it disperses reasonably quickly and so appears to be intended to cause panic rather than serious harm
' she added : ' there is no doubt that public perception often sees chemical weapons such as this as more dangerous than conventional weapons such as explosives , even though it may not be the case that a chlorine bomb could cause more harm
in fact , the most damage is likely to be done by the explosion created to disperse it
' chlorine was used by the britain in the first world war , but it proved to be unreliable
in one attack in 1915 the gas blew back into britain trenches after canisters of the chemical were fired from heavy guns at the germans
shocking : this footage purportedly shows toxic chlorine gas which was released from a roadside bomb destroyed by iraqi soldiers in tikrit recently the use of chlorine bombs by isis ( pictured ) is a sign of desperation , one expert told the bbc the u.n. security council recently approved a united states - drafted resolution that condemns the use of toxic chemicals such as chlorine in syria , while threatening militarily enforced action in the case of further violations
all members of the 15 - seat council approved the resolution except for venezuela , which abstained
the resolution follows last month 's condemnation by the world 's chemical weapons watchdog of the use of chlorine in syria as a breach of international law
the opcw ' fact - finding mission concluded ' with a high degree of confidence ' that chlorine was used on three villages in syria last year , killing 13 people
the opcw did not assign blame , but some council members such as britain , france and the united states have blamed syria 's government for the attacks , pointing out that the fact - finding reports linked chlorine attacks to helicopters and that only syria 's government has helicopters
chlorine is not a chemical that has to be declared to the opcw because it is also used for regular purposes in industry
russia on friday again expressed skepticism about blaming the syria government , which is its ally
syria denies using chlorine or other chemical weapons and blames ' terrorists ' for such attacks .
