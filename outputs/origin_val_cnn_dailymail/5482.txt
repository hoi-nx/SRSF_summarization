for the first time women are to get an advanced blood test to detect down âs syndrome and other abnormalities in unborn babies on the nhs
the non-invasive iona test examines dna in cells from the foetus found floating in the mother âs blood and looks for evidence of chromosomal abnormalities that cause genetic disorders
it will be offered at in london through the nhs and privately
the non-invasive iona test examines dna in cells from the foetus found floating in the mother âs blood and looks for evidence of chromosomal abnormalities that cause genetic disorders results will be given within days â compared to the two weeks it takes to send comparable tests abroad for processing
it is one of several non-invasive prenatal testing ( nipt ) examinations that promise greater accuracy for women at high risk of having a down âs baby
eventually such nipt tests will be routinely used to reassure all pregnant women
current screening for down âs on the nhs consists of the less - accurate â combined â test , which uses ultrasound to measure the amount of fluid at the back of the baby âs neck at 11 weeks , as well as a blood test
professor basky thilaganathan , consultant obstetrician at st george âs , said the new test was the first to be regulated under the eu âs health and safety standards
he said : â too many pregnant women have been through the anxiety and discomfort of invasive procedures after receiving false positive results [ women wrongly identified as being at risk ] from the combined test â the iona test gives us the accuracy and reliability to reduce this number significantly
â results will be given within days â compared to the two weeks it takes to send comparable tests abroad a study by the uk national screening committee to check whether nipt should be offered routinely on the nhs is underway , involving five hospitals , and is due to report later this year
trials of another nipt test offering expectant mothers 99 per cent accuracy in screening for down âs syndrome are being run by great ormond street hospital
nipt has a higher detection rate and lower false positive rate than the combined test
this means fewer women will undergo unnecessary invasive follow - up procedures which are stressful and carry a small risk of miscarriage
dr stephen little , ceo of premaitha â the makers of the iona test , said : â we recognised the limitations in the current standard of prenatal screening and the huge unmet medical need for a regulated test
