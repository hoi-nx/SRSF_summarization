swatch , the world 's largest watchmaker unveiled its riposte to apple 's smartwatch
it plans to put cheap programmable chips in watches that will let wearers from chinese to chicago make payments with a swipe of the wrist
swatch group will start offering watches with near field communication ( nfc ) chips within two months , said at a news conference on the company 's annual results which were released last month
the rewards are potentially huge for whoever comes up with a winning formula
andrew sheehy , chief analyst at generator research , sees the retail value of wearable internet - connected devices at $ 93.1 billion by 2018 , versus $ 4.1 billion in 2014 , with smartwatches accounting for about two thirds of the market 's value in 2018
apple 's move into watches would open up a market where swatch was already well positioned to compete , he said
the swiss company 's strategy appears to revolve around including individual tech features in different models rather than going head to head with apple , the world 's most valuable firm , to create all - in - one smartwatches combining many functions
' we are the world champions of integrating smart functions into a watch , ' nick hayek said
' we do n't want to produce a mini mobile phone on your wrist
' at 1600 gmt , swatch shares were up 2.7 percent at 432.1 swiss francs
apple 's watch will go on sale in nine countries starting in april , priced from $ 349 for the smaller model and $ 549 for the standard version , although a high - end ' edition ' watch will sell for at least $ 10,000
' it 's a fantastic opportunity for us
it is opening the market
' especially in the u.s. , many people are not wearing watches any more
somebody is opening this up
let apple do the work
' the new connected watch ' swatch touch zero one'which will go on sale within months both firms ' strategies could co-exist and succeed , nick hayek said , before adding a dig at the bigger rival : ' upgrading software every year , that 's not our business
' for its near - field chips , which will cost around 2 francs ( $ 2 ) per watch , swatch has teamed up with china unionpay , the chinese credit card association , as well as a swiss bank and a major credit card company
the credit card company , described as an olympics sponsor , is likely to be visa , a long - time backer of the event
visa was not immediately available to comment
swatch is also launching a range of sports - themed ' swatch touch ' smartwatches which will be able to ' buddy up ' with a smartphone via a bluetooth connection
the first model will retail at 135 francs , about twice the cost of a regular swatch watch with an nfc chip .
