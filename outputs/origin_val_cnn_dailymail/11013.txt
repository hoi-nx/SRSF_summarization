a note written by durst , scion of one of new york 's largest real estate empires , may hold the key to the murder of his neighbor
durst , a billionaire , was questioned but not charged in the mysterious death of his first wife kathleen mccormack in 1982
the 71 - year - old was then questioned in 2000 after the death of his longtime friend and elderly neighbor berman , shortly before she was to be questioned if she knew about kathleen mccormack 's disappearance
the note read ' beverley hills police-1527 benedict canyon cadaver ' - it has distinctive block capital lettering and the word beverly hills is misspelled
now a documentary producer has been shown a letter durst wrote in 1999 to berman
the handwriting appears to be similar to the note sent to police and again beverly hills is misspelled on both notes
the new evidence was shown publicly for the first time sunday night in the six - part hbo documentary , ' the jinx : the life and deaths of durst
' durst 's father , seymour , was a new york real estate mogul who amassed billions of dollars worth of commercial property in manhattan
police have long suspected that durst was the author of an anonymous note ( pictured ) sent to the beverly hills police department alerting them to a body at berman 's home - it has distinctive block capital lettering and the word beverly hills is misspelled now berman 's stepson showed a documentary producer a 1999 letter ( pictured ) from durst to berman that he said he just discovered
the handwriting appears to be similar to the note sent to police and again beverly hills is misspelled on both notes durst , a well - connected socialite , worked for his father 's durst organization for years as a developer
but he was estranged from his family around 1994 after being passed over as heir to the company leadership in favour of his brother douglas
the houston chronicle reported that in 2006 he finally won a $ 65 million court settlement from his family , restoring a piece of his family fortune
ten years earlier , durst had gained infamy in new yorkdue to the mysterious disappearance of his wife , kathie , and many believed the real estate scion had something to do with it
durst , whose sometimes bizarre life inspired the hollywood movie all good things , was questioned in her murder - and in the murder of her friend when the case was re-opened in 2000 - but was never charged
he has now re-married , ktrk reported , but the identity of his new wife was not released
then in september 2001 , remnants of the body of morris black , durst 's next - door neighbor in the boarding house where he was living , were found floating in the bay in galveston , texas
a trail of blood led police back to an apartment being rented by a mute woman , dorothy ciner - who was actually durst in a dress
the 71 - year - old was then questioned in 2000 after the death of his longtime friend and elderly neighbor berman , ( pictured ) shortly before she was to be questioned about what , if anything , she knew about kathy 's disappearance questions : durst , with his wife kathleen durst , was suspected to be responsible for her 1982 disappearance it emerged that durst had gone into hiding for years , partially to escape the increasing inquiries about the death of his wife
after spending a month on the run , durst tried to steal a chicken salad sandwich and a single a band-aid from a supermarket in philadelphia while wearing a blond mustache and was arrested
durst admitted to shooting morris black and dismembering him before dumping the body parts in the bay
but he insisted that he had acted in self defense as they struggled over a handgun and he was acquitted
but he was found guilty for tampering with evidence over the disposal of the body and was sentenced to five years in prison , but served just one
despite his run - ins with the law , he still has access to his $ 43 million trust fund , which he has used to buy and develop real estate in new york

at the time of the killing , he had been crossdressing to conceal his real identity his lawyer , lewis , blamed a ' medical mishap ' for the incident in 2013 at the store near durst 's residence
lewis , in a statement handed to reporters , said durst ' expressed his apologies ' and has compensated the cvs drug store for damage
he was also ordered to pay a $ 500 fine
in the same month he was found not guilty of trespassing on property in manhattan owned by his estranged family

prosecutors failed to prove to the judge hearing the case in manhattan that durst knowingly trespassed on residential properties owned by the company despite a video showing him walking up the exterior stairs of one of them
in the latest proceeding , manhattan criminal court judge ann scherzer vacated the 13 restraining orders keeping durst away from family members
