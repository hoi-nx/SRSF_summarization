liverpool crown court heard the oven had developed a fault with a guide rail bearing and had been shut down for maintenance so the bearing could be fixed
the company was today fined Â£ 20,000 when announcing the fine to be imposed on the company , the judge said that what happened was ' in the true sense ' an accident : ' it was an avoidable accident but nevertheless an accident ; an accident courted by no - one
' referring to mr catterall 's family , the judge said : ' at least they are able to understand that their loss was not caused by a deliberate unlawful act ; rather it was a result of oversight , negligence , sins of omission and not of commission , but sins nevertheless
' sentencing mackereth , he said : ' you do not need me to tell you how far short of your duty you fell
it was repeatedly brought home to you at the trial
' you will have to live with the consequences of your actions for the rest of your life
the company may only act through its directors and senior officers
' whereas others were also involved , you had to accept that you took the lead in designing and commissioning these ovens
the company 's failure was also your failure - although the full responsibility does not fall on your shoulders
rightly you were not charged with gross negligence manslaughter
' the judge said he fully accepted that mackereth and mr catterall were friends ' and that you were also devastated by the loss '
he told mackereth : ' i have given the matter careful thought and have reached the conclusion that i should mark the gravity of your offending by imposing a prison sentence , albeit that there are circumstances which enable me to suspend that sentence
