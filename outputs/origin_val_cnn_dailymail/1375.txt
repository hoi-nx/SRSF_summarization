the so - called â health tourism gap â between the amount the nhs collects from eu patients and the total hospitals on the continent receive from britons has soared to almost Â£ 700million hospitals â failure to claw back the cost of treating europeans is costing taxpayers millions of pounds a week , figures suggest
the so - called â health tourism gap â between the amount the nhs collects from eu patients and the total hospitals on the continent receive from britons has soared to almost Â£ 700million
it means the britons is now paying out Â£ 15 for the healthcare costs of britons who fall ill abroad for every Â£ 1 it gets back for the nhs treatment of europeans visitors
the prime minister and health secretary have pledged to introduce tough new measures to recoup an extra Â£ 500million from foreigners annually by 2017/18
both gps and hospitals will be given incentives to identify non-british users of the nhs and payment procedures will be made easier
however , the latest department of health statistics indicate there is a long way to go
released following a freedom of information request , they show that in 2013/14 , britons taxpayers handed Â£ 749.8million to europeans governments to pay for the care of britons citizens abroad
this has risen by Â£ 100million from Â£ 649.3million just a year before
but in the same period , the nhs managed to collect only Â£ 50.3million from europeans countries to pay for the care of their citizens who needed treatment here
this is an increase on the Â£ 32million total the year before â but the number is still dwarfed by money going the other way
ministers believe part of the problem is that hospitals do not ask enough questions to identify patients who should be paying for treatment
figures which emerged at the weekend show the nhs is still chasing at least Â£ 62million of unpaid bills for foreigners â care
one london hospital trust alone â king âs college â is owed almost Â£ 18million from overseas patients
one single patient at a different trust racked up an unpaid bill of more than Â£ 420,000
others owe more than Â£ 100,000 for treatments including dialysis , bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy , according to sunday times
health minister poulter was even photographed with a new mother from zimbabwe who is still being pursued for a Â£ 3,000 bill
two years ago , cancer specialist professor j meirion thomas warned many foreigners were travelling to britons for expensive treatment and then leaving without paying
he said the nhs was also becoming the â world âs maternity wing â
last night andrew bridgen , tory mp for north west leicestershire , said : â we âre fortunate to have one of the only truly free at the point of need health services in the world
â but we are not the international health service , it âs the national health service
this is an issue which needs to be addressed
â ukip health spokesman louise bours said : â it is clear from these figures that hospitals in this country are way too lax in chasing up payment for health treatment for eu citizens
â prime minister david cameron , left , and health secretary jeremy hunt , right , have pledged to introduce tough new measures to recoup an extra Â£ 500million from foreigners annually by 2017/18 part of the gap is due to the fact that so many britons pensioners retire to the continent
there may also be more tourists from britons travelling to mainland europeans than the other way round
but there are more than a million migrant workers from the eu here , against far fewer britons employed in other europeans countries
under eu arrangements , britons citizens can be treated by other nations â health services and the bill is sent back to britons
in theory , these europeans nations should also be billed when their citizens are treated by the nhs
in 2013/14 , the britons paid ireland Â£ 246million for treating britons who fell ill there
only Â£ 22million came back the other way
some Â£ 250million was paid to spain but only Â£ 3.2million came back
france received Â£ 152million but returned just Â£ 7million
italy got Â£ 6.2million and sent back Â£ 1.1million , while greece collected Â£ 8.9million and returned Â£ 400,000
a department of health spokesman said : â we want international visitors to feel welcome to use the nhs , provided they pay for it â just as families in the britons do through their taxes
â our plans will help recoup up to Â£ 500million a year by 2017/18
â jonathan isaby , chief executive at the taxpayers â alliance , said : â emergency medical treatment is one thing , but taxpayers can not be expected to pick up the bill for expensive longer - term treatment for tourists
â our authorities must do better to claw back the amount owed by visitors
' zimbabwe - born caroline nyadzyao , who is being chased for Â£ 3,000 by the nhs after giving birth in a norfolk hospital , meets with health minister poulter smiling alongside a health minister at a norfolk maternity unit in 2013 , this new mum is still being chased for the Â£ 3,000 it cost the nhs to help her give birth
zimbabwe - born nyadzayo âs unpaid bill is part of the Â£ 62million cost of â health tourism â to britons
the 34 - year - old , an advertising executive in africa , was pictured with health minister poulter on his visit to the norfolk and norwich university hospital when the maternity suite was reopened
the mum said she complained to mr poulter about the charge and said she was under huge pressure to pay it
but mr poulter has reportedly said he does not remember being told that
miss nyadzayo , now in harare , told the sunday times it was â unfair â she was still being pursued , because the baby âs father is britons
she said : â i know the system may believe i travelled to abuse the nhs benefits , but ... i just wanted to have my first baby as a family and surely everyone is entitled to that ? â the couple were questioned about the birth when they entered britons at norwich airport in october 2013
however , they were released when they agreed they would be paying for it
miss nyadzayo said : â i was told because i was 31 weeks â pregnant it was likely i was going to use the nhs to my advantage
we said we would pay for the birth
but we had no idea how much we âd be charged
