there are a million women who would n't mind swapping places with sarah greene
unlike the rest of the nation 's females , aidan turner 's beautiful irish girlfriend is lucky enough to enjoy the smouldering poldark star for real
the 29 - year - old actress may not yet be a household name but she 's also a long way off being just aidan turner 's squeeze with a blossoming acting career of her own
they are very much a couple whose stars are in the ascendant
they say skype has helped ... and he is clearly smitten with his girlfriend of four years
in an interview with the times this weekend , the 31 - year - old irishman says that while many couples , particularly those in the limelight , might have seen their relationship foundering under the pressure of work commitments , they did n't have that problem
' you meet someone , you fall in love , then you can only see them over skype or phone calls or texts and emails
and you have this whole other side to your relationship and it 's ... it was fun
he continues : ' we knew we really wanted to be together
and knew if we could do that , we could tackle a lot more
it was never : god , this is hard , bloody hell , we need to review this
we never questioned it ; it was great
so we had that from the beginning ... ' early on in the couple 's relationship , greene painted a similar picture , previously admitting to the irish times that they are both resigned to periods apart : ' well , that 's the job we do
we 'll always travel with work
skype is great , and we 're getting on brilliantly
' it 's been actually quite easy because we 're both working
if i was n't working it would be a lot harder
' irish eyes : greene , who was born in cork , starred opposite daniel radcliffe in the cripple of innishmaan and was nominated for both a laurence olivier award and a tony awards for her performance so , who exactly is sarah greene and how did she successfully woo the man that is currently capturing millions of hearts while playing cornish legend captain poldark in the hit bbc series ? to date , the cork - born actress is best known for playing opposite harry potter star daniel radcliffe in the cripple of inishmaan
greene played the role of helen mccormick in the play and trod the boards in the london production in 2013 before transferring to broadway the following year
it was a role that garnered plenty of praise from critics ; nominations for laurance olivier and tony awards followed
the actress is currently starring in penny dreadful , a dublin - based sky atlantic horror show about the cheap - to - buy , sensationalist books of the same name which were published in the 19th century
masterpiece ! aidan turner has admitted to using baby oil to make his body look perfect on screen although the poldark star has said he had to seriously hit the gym to perfectly hone his physique , the make - up department had another trick to ensure his body looked suitably granite - like for the hit bbc show
aidan turner says that some kind of ' baby oil ' was used to make his muscles ripple perfectly for the camera
and captain poldark 's striking eyes might suggest turners ' own peepers were enhanced with make - up but that 's not the case
he told the times that while he had to wear eyeliner for ' some scenes ' , he definitely does n't lush up his lashes with mascara
a role in the canadian - irish television series vikings also raised the irish beauty 's profile and it seems hollywood now beckons too
later this year , the striking brunette is set to start work on a comedy , playing opposite bradley cooper and sienna miller
born in cork , greene trained in dublin , graduating from the gaiety school of acting in 2006 after becoming obsessed with being an actress after going to watch a local panto
she said : ' my parents took myself and my sister to see the christmas panto red riding hood in the cork opera house and i was sold , all i wanted to do was get up on the stage ! ' the couple met after working together in the play titus andronicus but it was a slow burn before a relationship developed
he told irish weekend magazine in 2013 : ' i did a play with her about eight years ago titus andronicus , directed by selina cartmell
' i played demetrius , her character was n't a named character but we met on that
' it was all very platonic and we never hooked up or anything , but that 's how we got to know each other
and then years later we just met again and it just sort of took off
' his brooding good looks are n't always so refined either
the actor has confessed that he is ' inherently lazy ' and only really got in shape for poldark as filming start dates approached
' i worked hard for six weeks , killing myself in the gym , watching what i eat and staying away from bad food
but i would never , ever do all that if i was n't prepping for a role
that 's the only time it just happens , ' he explained
' i 'm not like that now
i 'm back to my usual soft self
' it has n't always been plain sailing on the love front either
speaking to the daily mirror about being hurt by a past girlfriend , the actor said : ' yes , it 's happened to me
i 've been upset , my heart 's been broken
' i do n't know anyone on the planet who has n't had their heart broken
' it 's the purest and rawest thing we have in life and everyone experiences it
' he may have found happiness with greene , but talks of engagement are too hasty
last week , she told irish entertainment websites and goss.ie and evoke.ie while at an event in dublin : ' i 'm not engaged
