we had no idea how much we would really , really , really , really like hanks lip - syncing to a jepsen song , but we really do
hanks shows up in the new video for " i really like you , " " singing " jepsen 's part throughout
the oscar - winning actor is apparently playing himself , signing autographs for fans , and generally being a very cheery movie star , before he and jepsen take part in a flash mob
so what exactly is hanks doing in this video in the first place ? turns out he is good friends with scooter braun , manager for jepsen ( and justin bieber , who also appears in the video )
he even sang and danced at scooter braun 's wedding
abc reported that hanks suggested himself to play the role , after jepsen said it would be amusing for a man to lip - sync her song
the result , as you can see , is kind of magical .
