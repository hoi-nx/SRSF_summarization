sunderland finally cut ties with manager poyet on monday after a 4 - 0 home defeat by fellow strugglers aston villa left the wearside club just one point above the relegation zone in the premier league
with that in mind , sportsmail have sunderland fan joe cooper of 90min.com to tell us what he makes of the situation
is advocaat a suitable short - term replacement for poyet ? let 's see what he had to say
poyet 's sacking as manager of sunderland could n't have come soon enough
chairman ellis short took the decision on monday and it 's hard to argue that it was n't the right call
the relationship just was n't working , our supporters know it and they did n't hesitate to show the uruguayan their dissatisfaction on a grim afternoon on wearside on saturday
there 's a better fit out there
and while we 've been clamouring for a change at the helm over the course of the last few months , it 's become glaringly obvious that poyet himself did n't want to remain in charge either
poyet 's sacking as sunderland manager could not come soon enough for the struggling club 's fans the relationship between poyet , the club 's board and their fans was not working and the move was correct angry sunderland supporters attempt to confront poyet during the 4 - 0 defeat to aston villa on saturday additionally , poyet 's moniker of ' head coach ' meant he was not in primary charge of signing players
he 'd made it obvious that it was n't something he was comfortable with
an unhealthy relationship at the top rolls downwards , as with any business
poyet 's attitude had transcended onto the pitch and it has been having a terrible effect
saturday was the cast - iron evidence of that
we are just a point above the premier league 's relegation zone following the home 4 - 0 drubbing to aston villa
bear in mind that this was a team with the league 's worst attack and they 'd put four past us before half - time
poyet 's position had become untenable
advocaat comes to the wearside club with a wealth of experience from around european football advocaat has never managed in england before but is reportedly in line for a Â£ 500,000 survival bonus the decision to remove poyet does n't reek of desperation , given advocaat 's appointment within 24 hours our situation looks precarious , but it 's worth remembering that it could be far worse
it 's the right time for poyet to leave
something needed to be done before it was too late
luckily , we 've not quite reached that stage yet - there 's nine games to save ourselves
we 've moved swiftly in hiring a replacement , which is always promising
the decision to remove poyet does n't exactly reek of desperation , given former rangers and dutch national coach advocaat was brought in within 24 hours
jermain defoe and steven fletcher look disconsolate for sunderland upfront on saturday afternoon one fan roars towards the bench as poyet 's tenure as manager drew to its inevitable close on saturday another supporter holds up a hand - written sign with the message ' poyet out ' - his wish was granted on monday advocaat has been handed the job on a short - term basis
as well as the wealth of managerial experience he brings , the reported Â£ 500,000 he 'll pocket to avoid relegation is enough of a motivation
he 's no spring chicken at 67 , but advocaat has spoken of his own hunger to prove himself in the premier league
he 's got the knowledge under his belt to do that
there 's enough reason for the fans to be confident that we can stay up
new managers inevitably inject a shot in the arm to their players in their first few weeks
it should be enough to carry us through to the end
you only have to look at crystal palace and west brom to see the impact that both new managers have had on the teams ' fortunes
sam allardyce has been touted as a potential replacement after an impressive season with west ham steve mcclaren looks premier league - bound either with derby county or one of many interested clubs our long - term aspirations may be higher than merely fighting relegation , but it 's now a case of seeing this season out before starting afresh again next term
it likely wo n't be advocaat to take us beyond this summer , but with the likes of sam allardyce and steve mcclaren - who have both had promising seasons at their respective clubs - linked as poyet 's long - term successor , things are looking up
poyet had reached the point of no return , so it 's time to start afresh
