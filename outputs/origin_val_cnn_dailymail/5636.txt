they say one man 's trash is another man 's treasure and that has certainly proved to be the case for entrepreneur dan cluderay
while supermarkets regularly throw away food that has gone past its ' best before ' date , mr dan cluderay , from worksop , nottinghamshire , is now a millionaire after setting up an online business selling out - of - date food to busy mums and bargain hunters
the 40 - year - old says the secret to his success is that his business , approved food , provides just what the savvy shopper is looking for - quality food at prices which save mums around Â£ 60 off their weekly bill compared to a similar shop at one of the big supermarkets
however , the dragons ' den team , which consisted of duncan bannatyne , kelly hoppen , deborah meaden , piers linney and peter jones , unanimously turned them down
not to be thwarted , mr dan cluderay and mr andy needham managed to source Â£ 400,000 through loans and investments from elsewhere which has seen approved food achieve a Â£ 4million turnover
' it 's all very exciting and we have lots of plans to take the business further , ' said father - of - two mr dan cluderay
he said his journey to success began when he was forced to have a career rethink after being made redundant from his job at an it firm in 2001
andy needham 's idea did n't excite dragons ' den investors , from left to right , duncan bannatyne , kelly hoppen , deborah meaden , piers linney and peter jones inside the approved food warehouse which stocks a range of products from toilet roll to dog food bag a bargain : slim - fast mix available for Â£ .199 and 99p pineapple juice are some of the drinks on offer together with his wife , nichola , the pair set up market stalls in hull , leeds and doncaster selling branded chocolate , fizzy drinks and crisps which had been shunned by a range of supermarkets as they were either fast approaching or past their ' best before ' date
for six years , come rain or shine , the couple , who hail from worksop , sourced and sold the goods to a loyal band of shoppers
however , it was after taking delivery of a crate of twinings nettle tea that mr dan cluderay said he had his ' eureka moment '
' i suddenly realised that while there might not be the demand for nettle tea in doncaster , if i could match the goods with customers looking to buy , i 'd be on to a winner , ' said mr dan cluderay , who has two sons , nine - year - old rudi and jay , five
while still working seven days a week on the market stalls , he utilised all his computer skills to start forming a plan to launch his business , approved food
dan cluderay ( right ) with his partner andy needham at their busy sheffield warehouse check out : the warehouse in sheffield is dispatching 600 orders a day mr dan cluderay also sells household products on his out - of - date goods website ' i was working on my idea wherever i could , ' said mr dan cluderay
' even in my son 's playroom i 'd be beavering away
' it was on 14 august 2008 , that mr dan cluderay received his very first order , the day after his website went live
' i 'd collected the names and address of 300 people who i thought would be interested in buying products which are perfectly fine but have have just gone past their sell by date , ' he said
' i was excited sending out the list but even more excited when someone bought something the next day ! ' since then , approved food has gone from strength to strength as thrifty mothers and other savvy shoppers make the most of items such as loo roll , dog food , sweets and sauces
' there are only two dates people really need to know about , ' explained mr dan cluderay
' the " best before " date which means that the food will be at its optimum before that date and acts as a guide to the quality , and then there 's the " use by " date which is concerned with the safety aspect
' it 's only the " use by " date that means food has to be eaten by then or it could make you ill , which is the case with fish and meat , for example
' food is perfectly fine to be eaten way past its " best before " date , as people know , but the large supermarkets wo n't do that and that 's where we come in
dan cluderay reveals how he made his millions by selling out - of - date food on tonight 's bargain fever britain a twix for 29p and 19p special k crisps are among the deals on the approved food website busy , busy , busy : the team prepares to pack hundreds of items proving popular with shoppers ' we sell food , such as cans of baked beans , pasta sauce , tins of tuna , which may have gone past their " best before " date by a few weeks , but everyone knows they will taste just the same as the products which have weeks left to run
' mr dan cluderay said they dispatch around 600 orders a day with his average shopper spending around Â£ 40 a week buying cupboard staples such as pasta , pasta sauce , flour and toilet rolls
' by comparison , they 'd be spending around Â£ 100 at one of the major supermarkets so they 're actually saving around Â£ 60 which they can then spend on something else
' we do n't touch food that has a limited shelf life such as fresh chicken and fresh fish , but we do sell hardy vegetables
' currently operating from a huge warehouse in sheffield and employing 50 full - time staff , he says he can imagine a time when they have bases around the world
' i can imagine warehouses in many countries
the germans in particular are very savvy shoppers and love branded goods , they also love english chocolate , so we get a lot of orders , ' he said
' we also sell huge polish chocolate bars , which cost around ten pence each to buy from us which is also extremely popular
' our biggest customers are by far and away mothers as they 're the ones usually in charge of the purse strings and are always thinking how to feed their families
if they 're happy , then so are we
' mr dan cluderay and approved food will be featured on the television programme bargain fever britain tonight on itv at 8pm
the show takes a look at the uk 's insatiable appetite for deals and discounts and will also go behind the scenes at american wholesale giant costco , car supermarket motorpoint and the shoe chain shoe zone
use by ... you will see ' use by ' dates on food that goes off quickly , such as smoked fish , meat products and ready - prepared salads
do n't use any food or drink after the end of the ' use by ' date on the label , even if it looks and smells fine
this is because using it after this date could put your health at risk
for the ' use by ' date to be a valid guide , you must follow storage instructions such as â keep in a refrigerator â
if you do n't follow these instructions , the food will spoil more quickly and you may risk food poisoning
once a food with a â use by â date on it has been opened , you also need to follow any instructions such as â eat within three days of opening â
but remember , if the â use by â is tomorrow , then you must use the food by the end of tomorrow , even if the label says â eat within a week of opening â and you have only opened the food today
if a food can be frozen its life can be extended beyond the â use by â date
but make sure you follow any instructions on the pack , such as â cook from frozen â or â defrost thoroughly before use and use within 24 hours â
shoppers should make sure they do n't risk their health by eating goods after the end of its use - by date best before ... â best before â dates appear on a wide range of frozen , dried , tinned and other foods
â best before â dates are about quality , not safety
when the date is passed , it does n't mean that the food will be harmful , but it might begin to lose its flavour and texture
eggs can be eaten after their â best before â date as long as they are cooked thoroughly until both yolk and white are solid , or if they are used in dishes where they will be fully cooked such as a cake
cooking eggs until both the white and yolk are solid will kill any bacteria , such as salmonella
people who are in â at - risk â groups should only eat eggs , or food containing eggs , that have been thoroughly cooked
these groups include : babies and toddlers ; elderly people ; pregnant women ; people who are already unwell
every year in the uk we throw away 7.2m tonnes of food and drink , most of which could have been eaten
so think carefully before throwing away food past its â best before â date
remember , the â best before â date will only be accurate if the food is stored according to the instructions on the label , such as â store in a cool dry place â or â keep in the fridge once opened â
display until / sell by ... date marks such as â display until â or â sell by â often appear near or next to the â best before â or â use by â date
these are instructions for shop staff , not for shoppers
the important dates for you to look for are the â use by â and â best before â dates
