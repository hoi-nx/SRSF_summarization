barbarians : militants fighting for the islamic state in syria have thrown yet another young man to his death from a building after accusing him of being gay horror : the blindfolded man is dragged to the roof of the tallest building in the neighbourhood by bearded militants , who use mobile phones to film him being barbarically thrown to his death sick : the stomach - churning photographs show a large bloodthirsty crowd gathered at the foot of a multi-storey building in the group 's raqqa to watch the murder of the young victim the images were released by local activist group raqqa is being slaughtered silently , who work undercover in the isis stronghold to expose the terror group 's atrocities
the photographs carry the distinctive yellow logo of isis ' propaganda wing al hayat media centre , suggesting they come from an as - yet unreleased video of the savage murder
the photographs shows a huge crowd gathering at the foot of a run - down building in the west of the city , which isis captured in early 2014 amid the ongoing chaos of the syrian civil war
so many people are seen in the streets to watch the man being thrown to his death that vehicles are unable to pass , although it appears the militants have erected metal railings to keep the crowds in line , giving a chilling sense of order to the savagery
the blindfolded victim - who is understood to be in his 20s - is seen being dragged to the top of the building by three black - masked militants while two armed but undisguised fighters stand at their side using mobile phones to film the gruesome murder
the next image shows the man plunging to his death , falling face first from behind a white metal railing towards the ground several stories below

in december isis released their first images of the shocking punishment as part of a release that also showed men accused of rape being crucified and left for dead in the centre of raqqa
similar images emerged in january and early february of men being thrown from ' the highest point in the city ' following accusations of homosexuality
in a horrific twist , both of these men somehow survived the fall but were then stoned to death by the crowds gathered below
and just last week another young man was thrown off a roof and stoned to death after being accused of homosexuality
following a trial in an islamic state court , the man was taken to the roof of the building and thrown to his death in front a large crowd below
the man was described as a ' child of lot ' and accused of committing acts of sodomy
lot is referred to in the bible and the koran , where it is claimed the people of sodom and gomorrah carried out sinful acts and were severely punished by god
the islamic state cherry picks sections of the koran and misinterprets the accounts of the muhammad in order to wage jihad and sign up new recruits , experts say
it is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in iraq and syria , where isis has proclaimed what it calls a ' caliphate ' , ruled by its often brutal version of muslim law
the group purport to recreate the conquests and rule of the muhammad and his successors and maintains its worst brutalities - such as beheading captives - only prove its purity in following what it contends is the prophet 's example
but now muslims clerics and other experts are speaking out , saying that the group hand picks what it wants from muslim 's holy book , the koran , and from accounts of muhammad 's actions and sayings , known as the hadith
an isis member parades through the streets of raqqa in syria waving an islamic state flag and brandishing a gun
experts have now said that isis misinterprets the koran in order to wage jihad it then misinterprets many of these , while ignoring everything in the texts that contradicts those hand - picked selections
writings by the group 's clerics and its english-language online magazine , dabiq , are full of citations from koran verses , the hadith and centuries of interpreters , mostly from hardliners
but joas wagemakers , an assistant professor of islamic studies at radboud university in the netherlands , says these are taken far out of context by isis
he explained that muslim scholars throughout history have used texts in a ' decontextualised way ' to suit their purposes and says that isis represent the extreme
he added : ' it would be a mistake to conclude the islamic state group 's extremism is the true islam that emerges from the koran and hadith .
