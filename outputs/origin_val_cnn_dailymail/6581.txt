as many as 1,000 greyhounds a year are being exported from australia to asia and south america where they are injected with arsenic , cocaine , viagra and methamphetamines to increase their aggression ahead of fight - to - the - death races
just weeks after the live - baiting scandal rocked the dog racing industry - when the use of live pigs , possums and rabbits to train greyhounds and boost their aggression was exposed - a horrific and often unsanctioned international trade can also be revealed by daily mail
the dogs , both young animals and those at the end of their racing lives , are shipped mostly to macau , hong kong , argentina and chile where they are housed in appalling conditions

australia dogs , along with those from the us and ireland , are considered among the best in the world for both racing and breeding purposes , and are exported to countries which struggle to produce quality runners
in something akin to the barbaric scenes at cock - fighting rings or dog fights , activists say that at some tracks the greyhounds race in pairs down a straight , with frenzied punters packed either side , and the animals often maul each other at the end of a sprint
animal protection groups in argentina have joined the call for australia 's federal government to intervene , fearing that the crackdown on local trainers because of the live - baiting scandal , will lead to the ' black market ' trade of australia greyhounds gathering even more pace killing fields
these stomach churning images are published by animal protection groups as proof of the horrific lack of control over the fate of greyhounds in asia freedom of information documents obtained by animals australia from the department of agriculture and seen by daily mail show only 20 dogs were officially registered as arriving from australia in argentina in the past two years
it 's widely suspected that hundreds more have been exported through back channels
there is no information about the fates of these animals
' greyhound here , including those from australia , suffer a terrible fate , ' claims an activist from proyecto galgos , who gave her name only as ines
' here the situation is this ; they use the galgos ( greyhounds ) in an exhaustive way
in one day , they can race in many places sometimes ( and ) are drugged with arsenic , cocaine , viagra and methamphetamines
' sometimes they give them the drugs directly in their chest in the racing facilities
' many times they die in the racing facility
a racing galgo does n't run more than one or two championships because of the drugs
' some , she said , are saved for breeding but even then they are plied with reproductive drugs
' that is the best scenario , but if they are no good at running , they are discharged on roads or left to die of starvation and in some cases they are killed
' ' many times they die in the racing facility
a racing galgo does n't run more than one or two championships because of the drugs ' say animal rights groups in argentina , who provided this image to show the level of neglect for a one - time racing dog if they are no good at running , they are discharged on roads , or left to die of starvation , and in some cases they are killed ' according to proyecto galgos from argentina with punting , legal and otherwise , a major past - time in parts of argentina and chile , exposing those who trade in the barbarism comes at a cost for groups like proyecto galgos , with members subjected to death threats on a regular basis
' here ( in south america ) they are used as merchandise , they are objects and when they are n't useful anymore they get rid of them , ' ines said
' sometimes they are sold and other times they change them for a chair or a television or anything
' races are prohibited in two argentina regions , including the capital buenos aires and in santa fe
cordoba is debating whether to shut down the industry too
while it is clear that many have previously been sent using official channels , through the control of authorities via a ' greyhound passport ' , there has been a crackdown on that process by governing bodies like greyhounds australasia
the exports , however , continue unabated
lobbyists say just how so many end up in countries like argentina and korea ( which is not on the official list ) remains a mystery
greyhound australasia ceo scott parker admitted that ga has no control of the greyhound export industry
â we have absolutely no idea of what dogs had gone where in the past six months because we are totally out of the loop , ' he said
â it âs because of the lack of regulations , something we have stressed to the ( agriculture ) minister and hoped we âd get a meeting with him to discuss it but that has n't eventuated as yet but we are still trying
greyhound data shows some of australia 's best known runners have been sent through the correct channels over the years to spend their time in the breeding kennels in places like south america
animal activists want tighter controls on exports by the federal government to ensure the future of all greyhounds lobbyists say not all dogs face the same fate , however , pointing to several examples over the years of top australia greyhounds like this one being cared for in the correct manner by respected argentina studs â the passport has no government regulatory standing but at least that enabled us to make sure they ( greyhound owners ) were doing the right thing
â exporting australia greyhounds without a ga issued passport is against the rules but some might take the risk knowing that government allows their export as long as the dogs are fit and well
â they enter into private arrangements and when someone says 100 have gone over in the past month , it âs out of our hands â a member of the public with no connection to the governing body can send them to anywhere in the world , if they want
â he 's also called on the federal government to put strong legislation behind ' the rules ' of greyhound exports
there are examples of successful transitions ; including star performers bogie ace and the chief , who had top careers on the track in australia and went on to have rewarding stud lives and were treated humanely
they , however , are rare examples
up until now , authorities have been scrambling to keep on top of the shipping of australia greyhounds to asia , particularly macau , for competition at the yat yuen canidrome , but now revelations they are appearing with greater frequency in south america , has activists concerned
' i think what âs clear is that the welfare of greyhounds is not a priority , these dogs come a distant second to profits on offer in this industry , ' chalk from animals australia said
' in australia , thousands of healthy dogs are killed simply because they do nât run fast enough and hundreds are exported overseas each year to countries that have no laws to protect them from cruelty
' the country of greatest concern currently is macau where dogs are raced at a facility called the canidrome
' they are kept in small cages when not racing and are killed if they fail to finish in the top three for five consecutive races
' dogs sent to macau from australia are dead within three years
greyhound racing in macau is built around the supply of dogs from australia which makes the situation all the more outrageous
' advocates also warn that , many of the export countries ( in asia ) , are known for their huge illegal trade in dog meat for human consumption
' macau offers no re-homing program for retired greyhounds and the head of the macau government âs animal control department has stated that every dog imported to the country from australia is dead within around three years , ' ms chalk added
' greyhounds australasia has stopped issuing passports to allow greyhounds to be sent for racing but that has n't stopped the export
' it 's time for the australia government to take a stand and ban the export of greyhounds altogether
' animal advocates have called on the australian government ' to take a stand and ban the export of greyhounds altogether ' to provide more protection for the animals
this is an example of a neglected pup in argentina the live - baiting scandal has led to more than 70 australia trainers being implicated
five queensland greyhound trainers have already been banned for life animals australia claim that ' greyhounds from australia were killed at the canidrome at a rate of more than one every day '
' nearly all of these dogs were healthy and not even five years old
all they had done wrong is fail to finish in the top three for five consecutive races , ' ms chalk said
' with an ongoing supply of dogs from australia , this unethical practice can continue , and is even threatening to expand
' macau is the only place in china where greyhound racing is currently legal but that could soon be expanded
her south america colleagues agree : ' the shortage of quality animals ( in south america ) means the exporting to places such as argentina from australia can be a profitable business
' daily mail has contacted the minister for agriculture 's office for comment
