design heiress margherita has just unveiled her new children 's clothing collection , but do n't expect it to be over-the - top extravagant
the 32 - year - old italy - based mom , who has an 18 - month - old son , otto , with husband eugenio amos and is currently expecting her second child , made sure the line , dubbed simply margherita , was comfortable , practical and affordable
asked by yahoo! style whether she felt under ' pressure ' to dress otto in the manner of kim kardashian and kanye west 's one - year - old daughter north west , she responded : ' no. not at all
you have all your life to be an adult , and to dress like one - you should be a child for as long as you can
kim kardashian , on the other hand , has delighted in parading north west from front row to front row at this season 's biggest fashion shows , often matching her daughter 's audacious attire with her own
notably , she dragged a rather miserable looking north west to a show at new york fashion week last month dressed in a silver fox fur coat , estimated to be worth more than $ 3,500 , and donning a black fur herself
nori , as she is affectionately known by her friends and family , has also been used as a model for the kim kardashian sisters ' own childrenswear line ; in september 2014 she was seen wearing a leatherette mini skirt from the range while attending paris fashion week with her parents
that 's more like it : the 32 - year - old italy - based mom made sure the line , dubbed simply margherita ( pictured ) , was comfortable , practical and affordable laid back : margherita 's vibrant 70 - piece line - up , for both boys and girls , is priced between $ 30 and $ 80 , and designed for children to be able to feel ' free ' practical : the designer explained that her ' main goals were to make clothes kids could be free in , and clothes their parents could get them in and out of easily ' accessible : she also remarks , ' so many baby clothes have sleeves that do nât let the baby âs arms go in and out ' young and fun : margherita , whose collection launches today on yoox and nordstrom , says she loves children 's clothes precisely because they are ' different ' from adult clothes margharita 's vibrant 70 - piece line - up for both boys and girls is priced between $ 30 and $ 80 , and designed for children to be able to feel ' free '
' all the clothes i got before my son was born ; he ca nât really wear them ! ' she said
' either you ca nât wash them , or they âre too hard to get on and off - you know , so many baby clothes have sleeves that do nât let the baby âs arms go in and out
' it âs ridiculous ! so my main goals were to make clothes kids could be free in , and clothes their parents could get them in and out of easily
