if it were possible for anything to be hot in buffalo this winter , it was the newfangled ' ice bikes ' that debuted at an outdoor skating rink
the bicycles on ice skates were an immediate hit when they glided onto the ice at canalside the day the new rink opened on the city 's waterfront
since that december day , the bundled riders who have ignored breath - taking cold to rent them have convinced inventor lisa florczak that she 's onto something
that , and the inquiries from several other cold - weather cities in wyoming , michigan , minnesota and canada interested in rolling them out next year
' i thought i might end up being the laughingstock of the city
' instead , she is relishing being part of buffalo 's efforts to revitalize its waterfront and draw people year - round , even when the lake erie breeze is something more endured than enjoyed
the bikes give even nonskaters a chance to try out the ice , along with the warm nuts , hot cocoa and craft beer sold at nearby kiosks
lisa florczak 's family business , water bikes of buffalo , rented pontoon bikes that let riders pedal the buffalo river in warmer months
then economic development officials put out a call for ideas for the 33,000 - square - foot ice rink being built nearby on a recreation of the erie canal
' they said the ice is going to be pretty large , and they thought they might need something more than just skating , ' ms lisa florczak said
curling , hockey and broomball leagues emerged
' i thought : ` what a perfect opportunity to go from water biking to ice biking , ' ms lisa florczak said
the 26 - inch bikes work with a dull blade in the front and a rectangular base attached to an ordinary bike frame the inventor had looked up ' things to do on ice ' on the internet and saw that bikes that ride on ice were already being used in beijing , she told the boston globe
she bought a bike off the rack at wal-mart and worked with general welding and fabricating in elma on a design
the bikes had to be sturdy , not tip and co-exist with ice skaters
prototype testing showed that sharper blades , like on ice skates , were too fast , as were flat blades that worked like a ski
the finished product is a 26 - inch bike that sits on a rectangular base with a duller blade replacing the front wheel
while originally scared that the bikes would damage the ice , ms lisa florczak told the buffalo news ' the rink guards said they did as much to the ice as a 5 - year - old would do while ice skating
' stainless steel so they do n't rust in the snow , the contraptions ride like a regular bicycle , only without the need to balance
riders brake by pedaling backward
' it 's pretty neat , ' said wolf , of east amherst , after giving a bike a spin
' they take a little getting used to
' ' but once you get used to it , it 's a pretty nice ride
' ms lisa florczak said there were hours - long waits for the bikes during a warm december and riders have persisted despite a frigid and snowy winter in buffalo mr wolf , who has parkinson 's disease , said he rides a three - wheel bike in the nice weather and likes the idea of a winter alternative
the inaugural year had 15 bikes on the ice on weekends only , with riders paying $ 10 for a half - hour turn
ms lisa florczak said there were hours - long waits for the machines during a warm december
riders have persisted despite a winter that has seen nine daily records broken for low temperatures
friday was the 60th day in a row that there was at least an inch of snow at buffalo international airport and the 30th of a snowpack of at least 20 inches
soon ice bikers may be able to outfit their own bikes to ride on the abundant ice
there are plans to sell kits that will let people convert a cycle for about $ 1,500 and the company is hoping for orders from other cities will make for a busy ' offseason
' ice bikes of buffalo , the name lisa florczak chose for the venture , is laser - cut into the running board
it was important , she said , that her city get its due if the bikes took off
she also wants to keep production local , after seeing relatives lose jobs during buffalo 's economic struggles
' it 's been , ' she said , ' an incredible ride so far
