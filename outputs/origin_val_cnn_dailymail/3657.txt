for many women , being mistaken for a celebrity is the ultimate compliment
but for sabrina may , who was compared to gemma , it only made her cringe
every time that sabrina may from towie was out in public , she would be mistaken for the towie star
in fact , one night somebody even asked the size 22 florist for her autograph
after five years of this unwanted stardom , sabrina may decided that it was time to make a change to her appearance - and she lost seven stone and slimmed down to a size 10 as a result
' we were both big , bubbly , blonde towie girls with a love of pie and chips and cocktails
however , i still never thought i was as big as her
' i was kidding myself about my weight
i was genuinely surprised and gutted when people started mistaking me for her
' when i was asked to sign the autograph i knew it was time to change - it was the wake - up call i needed
' sabrina may , who at her heaviest was 16st 12lb , left , was even asked for her autograph when someone mistook her for gemma but she went on to shed the pounds on a health kick , right , and is now a size 10 sabrina may admits her whole family would sit down and tuck into giant home - cooked dinners , which left them all feeling overweight every time that sabrina may from towie was out in public , she would be mistaken for the towie star gemma , right sabrina may says she began putting on weight in her early twenties when her lifestyle changed after leaving college
the mother - of - one , from chelmsford , said : ' i stopped being so active when i was a student

sabrina may said : ' my father paul was a big guy who loved his food
he used to say life was too short for dieting and to just have what you enjoyed
but unfortunately , when he was 26st , he died
' of course , we all knew that at his weight he was n't the healthiest but we had no idea just how serious it was
' after losing her father , who was overweight , she was terrified that her own weight might take her away from her own son so she decided to do something about it she heard about the terri-ann 123 diet plan on facebook and liked the fact it gave her 24 - hour access to online support with other slimmers so she signed up in january 2012 , paul was taken to hospital but medics struggled to diagnose his condition
just ten days later he died of multiple organ failure and doctors confirmed that his weight had played a part
sabrina may said : ' he was just too unhealthy and his size made him hard to treat
' i was lost without him and terrified that my own weight might take me away from my son
i did n't want to put him through what i was going through losing dad
' i knew i did n't want to leave my taylor , who is now three , without a mum
' the plan also allowed her to eat lots of her favourite foods , but cooked in different ways
they are always served without carbohydrates sabrina may also made sure she visited the gym and the weight soon started to drop off she vowed to ditch the chips and get slim but her grief always led her back to the fridge
and unfortunately for sabrina may , she loved unhealthy foods and would feast on large bowls of pasta , crisps , wine and chocolate
her weight rocketed when she fell pregnant with tyler in 2010 , and she remained a size 22 after he was born
sabrina may said : ' i would live on milky coffee all day telling myself i was being healthy
' but at night , when my son was in bed , i would binge eat anything and everything i could get my hands on
' it never seemed odd to me because all my family loved food
i still made an effort with my hair and make - up and wore smart clothes , so i thought i looked ok
