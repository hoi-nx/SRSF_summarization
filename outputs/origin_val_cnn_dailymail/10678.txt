' sebastian 's action trust supports families from diagnosis through a child 's treatment and beyond
' dedicated financial support workers who are funded by money raised through red nose day provide practical support and stability during the emotionally difficult time
' in a couple of weeks chase celebrates her 18th birthday
but she is living with a life - limiting cancer diagnosis and has made the decision to stop her painfully tough treatment
she 's still filled with infectious energy and her huge personality is impossible not to warm to
we 're almost the same age , i ca n't imagine having to make such huge decisions
the singer , pictured joining in a music session during her visit , said : ' the families and staff at sebastian 's action trust were some of the most inspirational people i 've met ' ella , centre in a black top , is urging people to donate to comic relief to support the work of charities like sebastian 's action trust who provide practical support and stability to those with life - limiting cancer ' the trust was set up after the death of sebastian gates in 2003
the nine - year - old recognised how his illness affected his family and wanted to help build a specialist respite centre for families with seriously ill children
' his dreams were made a reality after his death thanks to the hard work of his mum jane , who was recognised with an obe earlier this year
jane is an incredible woman and a true credit to her brave son
' she explained to me that one of the big problems families face when looking after a seriously ill child is their finances
there is so much practical and emotional stuff to deal with , such as hospital visits and treatment that often parents ca n't work
and if you ca n't work because you need to look after your child , then how do you find the money to pay the rent ? a red nose like this one modelled by ella costs Â£ 1 with at least 60p going to comic relief ella said she will think of the inspiration people she met at sebastian 's action trust when she performs on comic relief - face the funny on bbc one this evening ' i met a family at the trust who were too overwhelmed to cope with their money worries
ten - year - old reece needs a bone marrow transplant to cure a blood disorder called severe aplastic anaemia
his older sister danielle is the same age as me
she quit sixth form and started work in a coffee shop when her brother got ill to help with the family 's cash flow
' but their mum cathy got behind on rent and council tax , which added a massive amount of stress to an already very difficult situation
when the trust helped cathy to get her finances sorted , the relief was immense
' the families and staff at sebastian 's action trust were some of the most inspirational people i 've met
it makes me proud to be part of red nose day and i hope we can all raise as much money as possible to support an incredible project like this one
' watch comic relief - face the funny on tonight from 7pm , bbc one , to see how red nose day cash is transforming lives in the uk and across africa
