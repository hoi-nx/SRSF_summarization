kate has strutted her stuff on every catwalk going , but now it looks like she 's passing the baton to her half - sister lottie
lottie moss , 17 , proved her worth as a fledgling model as she made her runway debut at paris fashion week on monday in the sonia rykiel autumn / winter 15 show
the young starlet showcased a velvet playsuit and ankle boots as she stomped down the runway behind fellow fashion royalty , georgia may and lizzy jagger
while this was lottie 's first runway show , she has n't been short of high fashion campaigns since launching her modelling career
lottie 's first assignment was for a high - fashion editorial spread in the february issue of dazed and confused , the magazine co-founded by jefferson hack , kate 's ex-boyfriend and father of her daughter lila grace
she 's starred on the glossy pages of i-d and teen vogue magazines , bagged a red valentino campaign and modelled in a beats by dr. dre advert

standing at only 5ft 5in , lottie is by far the shortest model on storm model management 's books and is a full two inches shorter even than kate , who is also uncharacteristically diminutive for a model
