the wraps came off bentley âs stunning new two - seater aston martin rival on the eve of the geneva motor show in switzerland
the prototype coupe will be available for an estimated Â£ 130,000 price tag when it goes on sale within three years
bond âs relationship with aston martin dates back to the original db5 in goldfinger to the new db10 in the forthcoming movie spectre
bentley executives have spoken over the past year about their desire to produce a new smaller but sporty â baby â bentley to take on aston martin , ferrari and maserati
it comes as bentley also prepares to launch its first 4x4 sports utility vehicle called bentayga
leading motor magazine autocar produced images of how the sleek new two - seater to be built at crewe would look
but there was a chance tonight to see the real thing in the metal
the new car is likely to be powered initially by a specially - tweaked 500 brake - horse - power 4.0 litre twin - turbo engine introduced recently into other bentley models
through the smoke : the wraps came off bentley âs stunning new two - seater aston martin rival today favourite : bond âs relationship with aston martin dates back to the original db5 in goldfinger to the new db10 in the forthcoming movie spectre
he is pictured last month with the db10 during filming in rome but higher powered options are also likely to match the 200mph top speed of other cars in the bentley range
and though already widely dubbed bentley âs new â baby â , bosses stressed that it will not be a noticeably small car , despite having fewer seats and just two doors
it is set to sit alongside the existing continental gt rather than below it , say insiders
the british - based but german - owned luxury car firm is part of the giant volkswagen group and employs nearly 4,000 people at crewe
the car was the star of the packed volkswagen group night in geneva motor show which attracted hundreds of journalists and executives
bentley sales director rose said : â emotionally for an englishman it âs fascinatingly attractive
and we âve got a very good bond at the moment in daniel craig
interior : bentley executives have spoken over the past year about their desire to produce a new smaller but sporty â baby â bentley to take on aston martin , ferrari and maserati on the road : bentley bosses believe the two - seater continental gt grand tourer is just the job to tempt 007 to â defect â from his big screen affair with aston martin stretching over five decades â it would take a lot of years to get him to defect from aston martin
but we âre working on it
bentley is on track to double its record sales to more than 20,000 on the back of the new 4x4 to be unveiled later this year , before going on sale next year at around Â£ 130,000
last year bentley sold a record 11,020 sportily luxurious limousines , coupes and cabriolets
but bentley expects the new sports utility vehicle to increase sales to 20,000 a year by the end of the decade after hitting 15,000 deliveries by 2018 - and is already expanding its factory to cope with it and other new models
bentley âs chief executive wolfgang duerheimer said last month : â we think the success of the suv will lift us into a new dimension
â he added that bentley would remain british , even if the british voted to leave the european union , saying : â the bright future is based in british and in crewe
â bentley said more than 4,000 potential customers have already expressed an interest in the new luxury off - roader without having seen it
he added : â there âs a lot we could do
the idea of a fifth line is attractive
we seriously not short of ideas but a small car could be something we could do
â â the advantage of a smaller car is that it would enable us to have something to go up against aston martin or maserati
â however , small will not mean cheap - as prices are expected to range from Â£ 120,000 to Â£ 140,000
regarding the forthcoming bentayga 4x4 , mr rose added : â there âs nothing to say bond might not drive a sports utility vehicle
â autocar editor - in - chief cropley said bentley was out to â steal aston martin âs lunch â
he said : â bentley will unveil a super performance front - engined two - seat sports gt at the geneva motor show
â it is a preview to a new model aimed squarely at stealing sales from aston martin and ferrari
â he noted : â bentley is likely to say the car âs main purpose is to test the reaction of potential new customers
â but bentley âs well - established track record is to show first , then build later
mr cropley said : â the new two - seat coupe would extend bentley âs product portfolio to five distinct models
â in the original ian fleming books , bond drove a powerful â blowers â bentley with a supercharged engine
