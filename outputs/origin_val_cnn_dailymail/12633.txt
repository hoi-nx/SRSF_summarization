hillary clinton worked hard last week to put the " dead end " sign on the state department email story by announcing there was nothing to find
but in her rush to control the narrative , clinton may have ( once again ) missed the bigger picture : in politics as much as in business , authenticity matters
her press conference had the familiar ring of a controlled performance -- the carefully parsed explanation , the combative posture -- that stretched our belief that what she 's telling us is really the whole story
people wonder : is she playing it straight with us ? why the nagging suspicion that brand hillary does not include bringing to the public table who she really is ? as the author joe mcginniss reported in his classic book on the 1968 nixon campaign , " the selling of a president , " political consultants long ago began marketing candidates like bars of soap
the practice has accelerated since the ' 60s as campaigns have concluded that political brands face the same tests among voters that consumer brands do among customers
and among consumers today , authenticity means more to success than at any other time in the history of brands
the desire for authenticity is a tangible driver of revenue for brands
increasingly , people want to give their money to brands -- political as well as commercial -- that have a set of values they can also buy into
as author james h. gilmore told the new york times , a sense of authenticity reinforces trust in what is real " in an increasingly staged , contrived and mediated world
" a recent global study found that 63 % of consumers would buy a brand they perceive as authentic over its competitors , and more than 60 % would recommend an organization they perceive to be authentic
ignoring the importance of authenticity to voters is a significant risk , as both romney and gore learned too late
and they were running in a perceptual environment more forgiving than today 's
voters easily identified the space between who these candidates really were and how they wanted us to perceive them
romney , the successful entrepreneur and moderate politician , struggled to seem ordinary and " severely conservative , " while gore was perceived as having such an overblown sense of himself that the claim of having invented the internet stuck to him like mud , even though he 'd never said it
the two shared what will likely also be clinton 's destiny : winning a party nomination by default as there were few compelling alternatives
for clinton , an uncontested rise to the democrats nomination could mislead her campaign into believing that she does n't have a problem with authenticity
she does , especially among independents and republicans
to be fair , clinton 's appeal as potentially the first woman to reach the white house makes her seem virtually bulletproof among certain voting groups
a recent gallup poll shows " first female " status as the " best thing about a hillary clinton presidency , " leading the positives mentioned by 30 % of democrats and 17 % of independents
but the next - closest best thing about clinton is a long way off : her experience is mentioned by only 16 % of democrats and 8 % of independents
a fledgling campaign apparatus , with powerful political recruits like john podesta and robby mook and marquee brand wizards from coca-cola and microsoft , might want to be looking hard at the dangerously lukewarm voter sentiment about experience and suitability that is lingering just beneath the surface of the " first female president " juggernaut
part of the heightened danger coming out of her press conference lies among millennials , who will be a critical voting group for democrats in the 2016 presidential election
and authenticity is of paramount importance to millennials in how they relate to everything in their lives , including politicians
as one commenter on a mediapost article on millennials put it , " if brands ca n't be authentic millennials will call them on it
want to win our hearts ? a little self - deprecation and humility never hurt
" forty percent of millennials in the u.s. admit to full - blown cynicism about the way they are approached by brands of all kinds
according to the mediapost article , authenticity and the allied trait of trustworthiness are two of the top brand attributes millennials look for before they make a decision to hand over their money and , one could argue by extension , their vote
these days , too , it 's trickier than ever for brands to stay in step with the conversations that move people to make judgments
whether they 're consumers or voters , people are more in tune with each other than at any other time in human history
they can gang up more easily to support or reject a person , an idea , and , yes , a company , brand or politician
brands are left on the outside looking in , puzzling out how to insert themselves into a meaningful relationship with constituents who can turn on them at any second
this trend of demanding more authenticity from brands they invest in , and rewarding brands for it , has been accelerating with consumers across the u.s. over the course of the very same seven years since clinton last ran for president
since consumers are also voters , it stands to reason that any political brand -- including hillary clinton -- should look even more seriously today at how to increase its value by focusing on perceptions of its authenticity .
