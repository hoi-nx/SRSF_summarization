child rapist horrocks , 35 , delivered post to schools for more than a year because of an admin blunder a child rapist delivered post to schools for more than a year after a criminal records blunder led to his conviction being missed
horrocks , 35 , was jailed for 12 years in 2007 for raping and sexually assaulting a five - year - old girl
but in december 2013 he was given a job at whistl delivering post to businesses and schools
the convicted sex offender had two schools in the prestwich and whitefield areas of north manchester in his rounds
horrocks , who was based at the company 's sorting depot in prestwich , was sacked this week after the company was alerted to his conviction by one of his colleagues
the child rapist , from wigan , told the company that he had an unspent conviction for a ' sexual offence ' when he applied for the job
the firm , which employs 4,500 people across the uk , says it then did a crb check on horrocks , which confirmed he had a conviction but the information was not passed on during the recruiting process
whistl claim horrocks did not give full details of the offence and the company made no attempt to investigate what he was jailed for
one member of staff at the prestwich depot , who did not wish to be named , said : ' this has caused panic among the management at work
' horrocks has been going to schools and businesses as well as private homes - that is what we do
we deliver post to those kind of premises
i think it is shocking that this can happen
' a spokesman for whistl said : ' horrocks was employed as a delivery operative by the company in autumn 2013
he was subject to a crb check and the ongoing associated mail integrity code of practice for the delivery of mail
horrocks , who was based at this industrial estate in prestwich , manchester , was sacked this week after one of his colleagues told bosses about his conviction ' he had declared an unspent conviction and due to an unacceptable administrative error , the conviction was not highlighted
as soon as we became aware of the conviction , we met with mr horrocks and agreed to terminate his employment
' we are currently undergoing a thorough review of the existing paperwork for delivery personnel and recruitment processes to ensure that this is an isolated incident
we are distressed that this situation has arisen as we aim to work to the very highest standards
' he was a delivery person who would deliver mail to letter boxes in prestwich and whitefield
he would have no reason to be in contact with children whilst on his rounds
