the agony for forest is that there are only eight games left in their late pursuit of the play - offs
the powerhouse winger showed improbable runs to glory can be completed with a solo goal to savour as manager freedman collected another three points
antonio âs display was the story of this match
more than once he beat rotherham âs defenders for strength and pace before applying a deftness of touch
forest striker dexter blackstock ( right ) tussles with rotherham 's kari amason ( left ) rotherham 's smallwood ( left ) slides in with a strong challenge on forest 's osborn ( right ) forest winger michail antonio ( right ) vies for the ball with rotheram 's jack hunt ( left ) forest ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : karl darlow , michael mancienne , lascelles , wilson , eric lichaj , gardner , burke ( tyler walker 90 ) , lansbury , osborn , antonio , blackstock ( barrow 79 ) subs not used : collins , fox , paterson , vaughan , evtimov booked : gardner scorers : blackstock 43 , antonio 45 rotherham ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : adam collin , jack hunt ( richardson 48 ) , farrend rawson , broadfoot , lafferty , smallwood ( milsom 57 ) , kari arnason , conor sammon , frecklington , pringle , derbyshire ( bowery 75 ) subs not used : green , morgan , hammill , thompson booked : smallwood , kari arnason referee : michael bull attendance : 20,569 his goal , as the interval approached , was a combination of his talents
picking up the ball well inside his own half , he turned and galloped
he checked inside jack hunt , sped clear of kari arnason , cut across farrend rawson and unleashed a shot from 25 yards that flew into the bottom corner
there was an inevitability about it all
eric lichaj will be credited with the assist but in much the same way a tee might aid a 300 - yard drive by rory mcilroy
it was antonio âs 13th goal of the season since a Â£ 1.5million move from sheffield wednesday
what a bit of business that now looks
dexter blackstock ( centre ) rides the challenges of frecklington ( left ) and smallwood ( right ) frecklington ( left ) is fouled by osborn ( right ) during the championship match at the city ground two minutes earlier antonio had set up the opener , lofting a ball into the path of dexter blackstock
the striker crept behind kirk broadfoot and lobbed a finish that goalkeeper adam collin got a hand to but in vain
the result extends freedman âs record to seven wins , two draws , and one defeat since taking over from stuart pearce
brentford , in sixth , are eight points ahead
it seems just too much , but you never know
rotherham are in a similar predicament at the other end
evans â team sit six points above the drop zone
they mounted a challenge of sorts in the second half , and very nearly pulled one back when frecklington sent a sweet shot against the post
karl darlow then produced a magnificent save with 17 minutes left when diving to keep out conor sammon âs firm shot
blackstock ( right ) opens the scoring for forest during their 2 - 0 win over rotherham on wednesday night he is congratulated by forest team - mate henri lansbury ( top ) as forest make a late charge for the play - offs with the match won , freedman gave 18 - year - old tyler walker , son of forest legend des , his debut as an injury time substitute
evans said : â it âs a cruel game , we were the better side in the first half for long spells
â but the night belonged to antonio
â every team needs a bit of magic and certainly michail antonio gives us that , â said freedman
he added a thinly veiled call to neighbours derby , who have not won in five games
â of course the season is finishing too early but we need to make sure we take care of business and keep on winning , â freedman said
â it âs a fierce competition like i âve never seen
teams above us are really panicking
certain teams that are not too far away from us location-wise
