cody simpson just wants to make the world happy
that 's why the australian - born pop star is in austin , texas , this week , where he will be performing at a un / mixradio brunch at the sxsw
simpson , 18 , is the spokesman for the # happysoundslike playlist , promoting the un 's international day of happiness on friday , march 20
the singer and other celebs selected tracks for the playlist
" there is honestly nothing i can think of that i like to do more than make other people happy through live music , " said simpson , who will perform a few acoustic tracks at the sxsw brunch
the international day of happiness is a global celebration that came about after the u.n. general assembly adopted a resolution in 2011 recognizing happiness as a " fundamental human goal
" the observation was decreed in 2012 after the first un conference on happiness , and the first day of happiness was held on march 20 , 2013
simpson said it makes sense to have music as such an important part of the day
" i want to be able to share a message of happiness , " the singer said
" i think music is such an escape for people
" he selected marley 's " three little birds " for the playlist
britney spears selected prince 's " kiss , " and pharrell picked talking heads ' " this must be the place
" ed sheeran , david guetta , charlize theron , john legend and james blunt are also among those taking part
simpson recently released a cover of marley 's " no woman no cry " and said the legendary reggae artist is a personal inspiration
" the majority of music today has no substance , " said simpson , who is an independent artist
" you want to be able to feel something true
" as for what makes simpson the happiest ( other than music , of course ) , he said it 's the simple things like relaxing with his family and just slowing down
" happiness is kind of taken from you if your mind is too busy , " he said
" be present in that moment
" fans are being encouraged to post the song that makes them the happiest using the social media hashtag # happysoundslike .
