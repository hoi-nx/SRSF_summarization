two newly - wed brothers in pakistani are spending their first weeks of married life behind bars after police arrested them on terrorism charges for letting off firecrackers during their joint wedding ceremony
officers in karachi said the grooms went ' too far ' during the celebrations , and have charged the brothers and three other people under the explosive provisions of anti-terrorism legislation
if found guilty they could face long prison sentences , or even the death penalty
the brothers set off firecrackers , like the ones pictured , during their wedding ceremony in karachi , pakistani , but now face spending their married life behind bars after being charged with terrorism offences setting off fireworks and firing weapons into the air is a longstanding custom at pakistani weddings , but police officer abbas golarchi said the wedding party 's celebrations scared the community living nearby
he told agency afp : ' very powerful crackers were being used during the marriage ceremony creating fear among the neighbourhood , a densely populated area of the city
' the five arrested are in police custody awaiting a remand hearing which is due to take place on wednesday
a sentence of the death penalty is unlikely , it is thought , before no - one was harmed during the joint wedding celebration
it is customary at pakistani weddings to set off firecrackers and fireworks , and human rights campaigners have accused the police and judiciary of using anti-terrorism legislation in cases not related to militancy human rights campaigners say pakistani 's anti-terrorism legislation and anti-terrorism courts are frequently misused to prosecute cases that have nothing to do with militancy
in their world report 2015 , human rights watch criticised the passing of the protection of pakistan act by the country 's government , denouncing it as ' overly broad ' counter-terrorism legislation that violates international human rights standards and allows security forces to act without accountability
more generally , pakistani police are often criticised for their heavy - handed approach
in april last year , police in the eastern city of lahore booked a nine - month - old boy on an attempted murder charge after his family members allegedly threw bricks at officers trying to collect an unpaid bill
at least 40 people were killed in 2005 after firecrackers exploded on a bus carrying wedding guests back from a ceremony in lahore , eastern pakistani , according to a bbc report .
