a sour appearance on business competition show shark tank actually ended in success for start - up founder jesse genet
the 27 - year - old taped this past year , pitching her company lumi which sells diy kits to print custom designs on t - shirts , bags , and other surfaces
but the shrewd angel investors on the show refused to bite at genet 's offer of a 5 per cent stake in her company for $ 250,000 , believing she was overestimating the worth of the business of $ 5 million
' that âs 50 times your free cash flow - it âs ridiculous , ' he said
o'leary and fellow shark laurie greiner offered jesse genet an alternative deal , based on a much - lower valuation of her company , but genet refused to budge , leaving the show empty handed
as she ended her bargaining with the sharks , genet remained positive saying : ' i 'm going to make this into a credible company '
and it appears she was right
just one month after her episode aired she has already doubled her profits
shortly after taping the show , genet applied for and was accepted into y combinator , one of silicon valley 's most prestigious start - up incubators
she joined the incubator in december and in just three months has increased her profits to $ 2.5 million by expanding her product line and redesigning her website
' [ the comments ] were dicey , but i can handle that , ' jesse genet told business insider
' [ shark tank ] helped us realize what was really big about our business and what was not scalable
' on tuesday , she presented her company at y combinator 's biannual y combinator , showing off a whole new line of products not shown on shark tank - including custom stamps
on the right track : in three months at y combinator , genet has doubled her sales to $ 2.5 million

jesse genet spent two years trying to track down the inventor , and ended up convincing him to sell her the trade secret formula for $ 50,000
kickstarter helped her raise $ 270,000 to get the business started , and now her product is sold in retailers like michael 's .
