her black leather handbag sold for a rather conservative Â£ 25,000 at auction four years ago
but collectors seem less willing to part with the same amount of money for baroness thatcher âs armoured ' battle bus ' , which is rusting in a dealer 's yard because nobody will meet the asking price

her first visit to northern ireland as prime minister was to belfast in august 1979 , three months after taking office - and two years before the hunger strikes by republican prisoners in 1981
and a year after the brighton bomb , she signed the anglo-irish agreement in 1985 , giving the irish republic a say in northern ireland 's affairs for the first time - causing unrest among unionists
the bus , powered by a 12 - litre rolls-royce engine , can carry about 35 passengers and features a blast - proof floor and armour - plated glass throughout , as well as a bomb - proof armour - plated body

interior : the vehicle has been sitting for a year in a lot in rural northamptonshire owned by tanks and surplus military equipment dealer mead , after he paid Â£ 16,940 for it february 2013 seating : designed and built by glover and webb using foden and rolls-royce parts , the bus also has its own auxiliary generator and air supply in case of attack mr mead said : â it has been on the market about a year
this is not something you can easily flog - ( it ) gives total protection to 36 people
it is not ukraine or afghanistan
â it might look as out of date as a centurion tank , but it could save a lot of lives
you would not be saying it was out of date if someone was firing rocket powered grenades at you
â the bulletproof glass is 2in thick , and the blast - proof floor is 2ft deep
mr mead said a rocket - propelled grenade would blow the wheels off , although the vehicle could take the hit
â it has blue windows and is about as streamlined as a brick with huge wheels on it
â it weighs 17.5 tonnes - double the normal weight of a bus - but can do 80mph because it is fitted with a v5 tank engine
it was designed to get her out of trouble
on the road : baroness thatcher on a campaign bus in south - east london with her husband denis in 1987 - a different vehicle to the one now up for sale in northamptonshire three decades ago : baroness thatcher survived the brighton bombing in 1984 in which the ira 's patrick magee attacked a hotel ( above ) where conservative party conference attendees were staying landmark moment : one year after the brighton bomb , baroness thatcher ( right ) famously signed the anglo-irish agreement in 1985 , giving the republic of ireland a say in northern ireland 's affairs for the first time â one guy from the sas rang up and told us some of the windows looked funny because they had been blown out on the training exercise and replaced with a different tint
but we have fixed that

baroness thatcher , who died in 2013 , survived the brighton bombing in 1984 in which the ira 's patrick magee attacked a hotel where conservative party conference attendees were staying
for many years after she left downing street in 1990 , the bus was used to ferry troops from londonderry airport to belfast escorted by two saracen armoured vehicles
after being sold off by the army , it went to a research laboratory who used it to protect onlookers watching explosions during weapons testing - and was then bought by mr mead âs tanks a lot .
