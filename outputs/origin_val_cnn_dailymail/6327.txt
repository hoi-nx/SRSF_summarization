almost half of all eight year olds and a third of children aged five have fillings or teeth missing because of tooth decay
furthermore in 2013 , 46 per cent of 15 year olds and 34 per cent of 12 year olds had ' obvious decay ' in their permanent teeth
while high those figures do represent a slight reduction over the course of a decade , when the comparable figures were 56 per cent and 43 per cent respectively
the latest figures , published by the hscic , reveals children are so embarrassed by their rotting teeth that they try to avoid smiling or laughing
of those a sample size of 9,866 were surveyed and underwent an examination
around 40 per cent of five year olds from more deprived families had tooth decay , compared with 29 per cent from less deprived families
in addition , 59 per cent of 15 year olds from deprived families had tooth decay , compared with 43 per cent from better off families
meanwhile northern ireland is uncovered as the childhood tooth decay capital of the uk , with 72 per cent of 15 year olds suffering oral disease
in nhs that figure is 44 per cent , and wales it is 63 per cent
but while remaining high , the levels have fallen since 2003 when the comparable figures were 78 per cent , 55 per cent and 65 per cent , respectively
the child dental health survey reveals a promising trend , experts said , with the extend and severity of tooth decay in permanent teeth of children aged 12 and 15 falling
the child dental health survey examined the prevalence , severity and extent of dental caries , also known as tooth decay
each tooth is classified based on how decayed it is
three components qualify as different levels of decay
they are : but they warned large swathes of the childhood population ' continue to be affected by disease , and the burden of disease is substantial in those children that have it '
tooth decay was still found in 34 per cent of 12 - year - olds ( compared to 43 per cent in 2003 ) and 46 per cent of 15 - year - olds ( 56 per cent in 2003 )
just 38 per cent of children were classed as having good overall oral health , meaning they had no obvious decay , no tooth surface loss into the dentine , which is the layer under the tooth enamel , and no tartar
in july the hscic published figures that showed the number of admissions for dental problems , among five to nine year olds rose from 22,574 in 2010 - 11 to 25,812 in 2013 - 14
acting chief dental officer for nhs serbjit kaur said : ' these results are very encouraging and are a credit to the dental profession and all those who promote dental health
' there have been significant reductions in the numbers of 12 and 15 - year - olds with obvious decay in their adult teeth
' future progress requires further work on prevention and a joined - up approach to dental care and wider health and social care services for children , as set out in the five year forward view
' the survey also highlighted how girls are better at brushing their teeth , with 69 per cent of boys aged 12 saying they brush at least twice a day , compared to 85 per cent of girls
sugary drinks were also found to be a cause for concern , with 16 per cent of 12 year olds and 14 per cent of 15 year olds saying they drink the beverages at least four times a day
the 2013 survey is the fifth in a series of national children 's dental health surveys that have been carried out every ten years since 1973 , focusing on the dental health of five , eight , 12 and 15 year olds in nhs , wales and northern ireland
dr sandra white , director of dental public health at phe ( phe ) , said : ' phe welcomes the overall fall in tooth decay levels and the fact that more and more children are brushing their teeth twice a day and regularly visiting the dentist
the diagram above reveals the various stages of tooth decay
the survey found in 2013 , 46 per cent of 15 year olds and 34 per cent of 12 year olds had ' obvious decay ' in their permanent teeth girls were found to be better at brushing their teeth , with 69 per cent of boys aged 12 saying they brush at least twice a day , compared to 85 per cent of girls ' however , children from low - income families are twice as likely to have tooth decay , which is not only painful but can require hospital treatment and also affects their confidence and self - esteem , so there is no room for complacency
' tooth decay is a serious , preventable disease and this survey echoes the need to urgently reduce the amount of sugary snacks and drinks in our children 's diets
' anna bradley , chair of healthwatch , said : ' tooth decay is preventable as long as parents have the right information about and access to nhs dentists
' yet we know from local healthwatch research into dentist access that some parents ca n't find a dentist who will treat their children on the nhs and others do nât know when to take their child to the dentist
' it seems that , as a result , children with tooth decay are increasingly needing emergency dental treatments in hospital
' last year alone 26,000 five - nine year olds required emergency dental surgery
' it âs crucial that information about which dentists are available to nhs patients is up - to - date and there is good information for parents about how to care for their children 's teeth
' this means decay can be prevented and there is no need resort to emergency a&e treatments when decay has already set in
