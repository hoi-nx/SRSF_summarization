' it 's being blown out of all proportion
we had no idea about the school 's policy on toy guns
it 's a simple mistake

she did n't let him at first
he explained about golden time and took the gun
' three teachers said they felt threatened by this gun

' the school has brought in the police over the incident and officers will now talk to the 10 - year - old boy selwood academy has not commented on its threat to expel jayden other than to say it will handle the issue ' internally ' mr pleasants added : ' my partner is devastated by this
she is in a state of depression
she feels like she has failed as a mother
' i think that they ca n't handle jayden and this is an excuse
we worked hard to find the right medication for him and we think we finally have
' we received a letter saying he is not allowed out in public otherwise we might face prosecution because he is not in school
