to beat the world 's best golfers you often have to be flawless -- and that 's what inbee park managed at the hsbc women 's champions tournament , playing 72 holes without dropping a shot
the south korean triumphed by two strokes from teen prodigy lydia ko , who took park 's world no. 1 ranking last month -- at 17 the youngest player of either gender to reach the summit
ko , born in korea but raised in new zealand , had to settle for second place at sentosa in singapore on sunday -- international women 's day -- after winning her previous two events
" she played great all week , " ko said of her 26 - year - old rival , who will stay second when the new rankings are released next week
" no bogeys around here and on a course where you can hit a good shot and you can get bad luck
" inbee park , who finished 15 under par , won not only $ 210,000 for winning the lpga tour event but also $ 7,500 from a bet with her dad -- with the stakes at $ 500 for a birdie and $ 1,000 for a bogey
" this week was just incredible , " said inbee park , who has held the no. 1 ranking for a total of 73 weeks in two periods and now has career prize money of nearly $ 10.3 million
" i do n't think i can even believe myself that i did n't make any bogeys for 72 holes
" inbee park led the tournament from start to finish , and closed with two - under - par 70 -- a score matched by ko -- as she claimed her 13th lpga tour title
she has now played 92 holes without dropping a shot , going back to the third round of last week 's honda lpga thailand , where she tied for seventh
" it 's good to have a family here and they are big energy , " said inbee park , who got married last october
" this week just went so quick
i did n't have to think about golf when i 'm not on the course , so i think that was a big help
" former world no. 1 stacey lewis finished third , two shots behind ko , as the american finished with a par 72
" it was fun being in the final group
that 's where you want to be
but even par usually does n't cut it , " said lewis , who won the tournament in 2013 .
