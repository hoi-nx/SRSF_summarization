jordan rhodes shrugged off the fierce speculation over his future by snatching an injury - time winner for blackburn at ewood
this derby was drifting towards a goalless draw when tom cairney sent over a corner with 15 seconds remaining of the four added minutes
henry flicked on and jordan rhodes stuck out a boot to score his 14th goal of the season from close range
it was an amazing finish after 48 hours of questions about the possibility of the striker leaving blackburn

their championship promotion rivals derby , norwich , sheffield wednesday and nottingham forest have also registered an interest in blackburn âs record Â£ 8m signing who still has four - and - a - half years left on his contract at ewood
but having rejected a Â£ 12m offer from hull city last summer , blackburn âs owners venky âs are reluctant to sell while their club still have an outside chance of reaching the playoffs following this win , as well as the prospect of a fa cup quarter - final replay with liverpool next month
asked if he has been given assurances that jordan rhodes will not be sold , manager bowyer replied : â yes , it just would nât add up
why would you loan out your top goalscorer ? my five - year - old nephew might be able to work that one out
â i ca nât answer on behalf of middlesbrough but jordan rhodes has just scored the winner and he will be starting at charlton on saturday
â he just handles the speculation enormously well
i was quietly confident of him scoring tonight , to be perfectly honest , because that âs what he does when there âs all the talk
â bowyer described this as blackburn âs best win of the season after the physical and mental energy his players exerted in sunday âs goalless draw with liverpool at anfield
they lost corry evans and markus olsson to injury in the first - half but ben marshall should have put them ahead in stoppage time when he headed over from craig conway âs cross
substitute craig davies wasted bolton âs best chance when he raced clear only to shoot straight at jason steele , and jordan rhodes should have scored with a 79th - minute header from close - range before making amends at the death
conceding another yet another late goal was a sickener for bolton who are still not free of relegation danger

â that âs five games in the last month and it âs cost us seven points
we âd be home and hosed but we still have a bit of work to do
â if we ca nât defend a set - piece in the last 30 seconds of the game â¦ the players are nât learning so we âve got some work to do to make them mentally stronger because it âs obviously a psychological thing
â you think it ca nât happen again then lo and behold it does
i âm lost for words
