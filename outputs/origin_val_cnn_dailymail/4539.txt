professor patrick pullicino , a leading neurologist who has criticised plans to ask every ill or elderly person if they want to die at home or in hospital a plan to draw up a â death list â of how every ill or elderly person wants to die has been criticised as a dangerous and worrying idea
the influential commons health select committee yesterday called for a new database listing whether people would prefer to die at home or in hospital
they said two - thirds want to spend their final days at home â but half still die in hospital
a register of preferred options would help to stop this happening , mps on the committee said
but professor patrick pullicino , a leading neurologist , said the plan simply perpetuates the â central flaw â of the discredited lcp
the professor , who was the first senior doctor to expose the failures of the lcp three years ago , said such a register carried huge risks
those who wished to die at home might be denied essential care , said professor patrick pullicino , a consultant neurologist with east kent universities nhs foundation trust
he also said it was not possible to know when a person will die
the lcp was abolished last july following several examples of â shocking â abuse , many of them unveiled by the daily mail
many families complained that their relatives were sedated with a â chemical cosh â then killed by the removal of food and fluids , leading care services minister norman lamb to denounce the lcp as a â national disgrace â
professor patrick pullicino said the latest plan risked making the same mistakes
â this predication of a specific line of treatment on a prognostication of imminent death that is not evidence - based was the central flaw of the lcp and is perpetuated in this report
â research into the question of how to diagnose imminent death accurately was â completely absent from the list â of priorities in the report , he added
the doctor said the danger was particularly acute for those with dementia
around two - thirds of people want to spend their final days at home â but half still die in hospital ( file picture ) the report was also criticised by dr tony cole , chairman of the medical ethics alliance , a pro-life group of medical organisations
â there have always been difficulties in predicting imminent death , â he said
â a patient at the end of life may also have a treatable condition which could be relieved
people making their own end of life plan may not have foreseen this
â the mps â report says most people who express a preference say they would like to die at home but this was made difficult by disparate community palliative care services
sarah wootton , of dignity in dying , the assisted suicide lobby group , said there was â a real need for greater information and support for people approaching the end of life to enable them to plan ahead â .
