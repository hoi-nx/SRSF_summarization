liverpool and manchester united met on sunday and renewed hostilities in english football 's greatest rivalry , but 100 years ago they were making headlines for all the wrong reasons in a scandal that shocked the nation
the events ultimately cost one player his life and left another broken
it was good friday , april 4 1915 and british was at war
as the two sides met , manchester united were struggling to avoid relegation , while liverpool were in mid-table
in an oddly tame affair , anderson put manchester united 1 - 0 up before liverpool defender pursell conceded a penalty yet manchester united 's o'connell missed by some distance
anderson added a second before liverpool forward pagnam hit the crossbar and was seemingly chastised by teammates for trying to score
turnbull ( second row , third from right ) sits next to enoch west and arthur whalley sits on the left of the front row ( all three are circled ) the sparse 18,000 old trafford crowd , sensing something was awry , jeered and booed , the match referee and local reporters noted liverpool 's lack of commitment
united manager john robson is alleged to have left the stadium in disgust
' the second half was crammed with lifeless football , ' reported the manchester daily dispatch
' manchester united were two up with 22 minutes to play and they seemed so content with their lead that they apparently never tried to increase it
liverpool scarcely ever gave the impression that they would be likely to score
' a fortnight later , handbills were circulated alleging that a large amount of money had been bet at odds of 7/1 on a 2 â 0 win to manchester united
a suspiciously large number of bets had been made on that very scoreline causing odds to shorten to 4/1
the two points manchester united won from the game were enough to earn them 18th place and safety
united with the three trophies they won in 1909
turnbull is seated front right the sporting chronicle published a notice from a bookmaker called ' football king ' who promised a substantial reward for information that would lead to punishment of the ' instigators of this reprehensible conspiracy '
it stated : ' we have solid grounds for believing that a certain first league match played in manchester during easter weekend was ' squared , ' the home club being permitted to win by a certain score
' wylie , curator of the manchester united museum , has been reflecting on the scandal this week as the 100th anniversary approaches with many questions still unanswered
' football was under intense scrutiny anyway , with it being wartime , ' he said
' there had been so many complaints in the newspapers , in parliament , from the military , that professional football was being played while british soldiers , sailors and airmen were being killed , so the powers - that - be were anxious to see that football was n't tarnished any further and they launched an investigation
' the football league 's lengthy delving found that players from both sides had been involved in rigging the match : turnbull , arthur whalley and enoch west of manchester united , and sheldon , miller , pursell and thomas fairfoul of liverpool
manchester united captain charlie roberts holding the fa on the steps of manchester town hall they were accused of plotting the events during clandestine meetings at the dog and partridge pub in stretford
sheldon , a former manchester united player , was found to be the plot 's ringleader
liverpool 's pagnam and manchester united 's anderson had refused to take part ; pagnam had threatened to score a goal to ruin the result hence his teammates remonstrating with him when he hit the crossbar
he later testified against them and claimed sheldon had offered him Â£ 3 in a taxi en route to the game
at the same hearing , manchester united legend billy meredith denied any knowledge of the match - fixing , but said that he became suspicious when none of his teammates would pass the ball to him
manchester united 2 liverpool 0 ( april 2 , 1915 ) anderson ( 2 ) manchester united : beale ; hodge , spratt , montgomery , o'connell , haywood , meredith , potts , anderson , west , norton
manager : jack robson liverpool : scott ; longworth , pursell , fairfoul , bratley , mackinlay , sheldon , banks , pagnam , miller , nicholl
on december 23 , 1915 , the seven were banned from playing for life
stockport county 's lawrence cook , a first class lancashire cricketer , and manchester city 's fred howard were also suspended for their part in placing bets
a distraught enoch ' knocker ' west , the only manchester united player to have appeared in the game , protested his innocence and sued the fa for libel
' it was n't a glorious episode , ' says wylie
' players could see that football was changing
with the sport under such scrutiny amid wartime , it was pretty obvious that football in 1915/16 would be very different , if it happened at all
summer wages were being abolished , so once you got to the end of april there would be no wages until the end of august , and it was still unclear what would happen the following season
they could see their livelihood going
that was supposed to be encouragement for players to do things for the war effort
' by the time their bans were handed down , the football league had suspended operations for the duration of the first world war
it was suggested that if the men joined the armed forces their punishment would be rescinded
all except west , signed up
for turnbull it was to have tragic consequences
the death certificate of turnbull ( right ) , featuring the memorial at arras in france a forward of great repute , turnbull was a boys ' own character who had joined manchester united from manchester city with meredith
the fiesty scot , pioneered the first footballers union and his 1909 fa cup final winning goal prompted manchester united 's owners to build old trafford to herald a new dawn
fittingly , turnbull , who lived in maine road , scored manchester united 's first goal at the old trafford
yet following the betting scandal and facing a life without football , turnbull went to war
sadly , on may 3 1917 , at the age of 33 , lance sergeant turnbull was killed during a muddled , unsuccessful night attack on german lines just east of arras , france
his body was never found
he left a widow , florence , and four young children
the fa gave him a posthumous reinstatement
all the other players , except west , had their bans lifted by the fa in 1919 in recognition of their service to the country
enoch west , who had been good friends with turnbull , had continued to fight a different battle , one to clear his name
in february 1916 , when manchester united and liverpool played in a regional match , he took to standing outside old trafford handing out handbills : ' Â£ 50 reward
to all whom it may concern : i , enoch james west ( late manchester united ) , offer the above sum to be given to any red cross fund if any person or persons can prove that i bet or won any money in any way over the match at old trafford , manchester united v. liverpool , on good friday , 1915 , the said match over which i got suspended
( signed ) enoch james west , 68 railway road , old trafford
enoch west twice unsuccessfully attempted to sue the fa for libel and in 1918 was caught and banned again for playing under an assumed name for a club in ireland
he was eventually pardoned under a general amnesty in 1945 , by which time he was aged 59
he had served the longest ban in football and maintained his innocence until his death in 1965
his family carried on his fight
a book entitled ' free the manchester united one ' by sharpe pleaded enoch west 's case
on publishing , sharpe said : ' i am confident that at the very least , i have established that there is little or no genuine evidence which can be interpreted as conclusive proof of the guilt of enoch west as he was charged
' west 's great grandson , graham west , said : ' i would just like to set the record straight , enoch ' knocker ' west was wrongly accused of match fixing and he protested his innocence till his death bed
having been accused of this , it broke his heart , all he lived for was football
he died a broken man thanks to these accusations that were never proved
' sadly , the full truth may now never be known
the liverpool daily post reported : ' a more one - sided first half would be hard to witness
' the sporting chronicle wrote ' the liverpool forwards gave the weakest exhibition in this half [ the second ] seen on the ground during the season
' the manchester daily dispatch reported , maybe most tellingly : ' the second half was crammed with lifeless football
manchester united were two up with 22 minutes to play and they seemed so content with their lead that they apparently never tried to increase it
liverpool scarcely ever gave the impression that they would be likely to score
