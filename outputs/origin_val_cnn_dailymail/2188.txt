when poyet lost his temper and took out his anger on a cooler box â emptying dozens of drinks bottles and scattering ice on the touchline â it was in protest at so much more than jack rodwell âs booking for diving
the yellow was merely the tipping point which made the uruguayan see red
rather , there was frustration at the rapid unravelling of sunderland âs season and his reputation
he chose to take it out on bruce , marching over to the hull boss in apparent offering of a friendly handshake before sarcastically applauding in his face
bruce , understandably , reacted and only the intervention of the assistant referee prevented a physical confrontation
hull boss bruce and sunderland manager poyet were on good terms before the crucial game however things turned sour when bruce and poyet began a slanging match and had to be pulled apart bruce appeared to take exception to poyet 's sarcastic applause of a referring decision by mike dean the two managers are restrained by match officials who try desperately to keep them away from each other all eyes were on the technical area as the opposing bosses threatened to come together poyet had lost his head
twenty - four hours earlier he had lost star winger adam johnson â his four - goal top scorer â after his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with an underage girl
he responded by naming four central - midfielders in a 4 - 4 - 2 system
it was a bizarre decision which smacked of protest at what he perceives to be a lack of attacking options provided by the club âs hierarchy
that they escaped with a draw was more to do with good fortune , jack rodwell âs late equaliser having appeared to go in via his arm
the linesman cuts across an incensed bruce as poyet turns his back on the hull manager as the pair locked horns bruce makes sure he gets his point across by bellowing in poyet 's direction but there was enough to worry followers of the sunderland after another insipid display
as for poyet âs indiscipline , it soon spread through the team
lee cattermole was booked for a blatant kick on david meyler in the second half and will miss the next two matches
he was substituted moments later
earlier there had been a reckless lunge by liam bridcutt , for which he was lucky not to be sent off and wes brown could have seen red for the foul which led to dame nâdoye âs opener
poyet was sent to the stands for his antics and could face further punishment after the game poyet had been vanquished to the stands just before half - time and the concern must now be that sunderland , too , could be vanquished to the championship
the head coach said before the game he was shocked by sunderland âs involvement at the wrong end of the table
perhaps he should take a closer look at the numbers
his team have now won just one in 11 league games and have scored just once in more than eight hours of football
the uruguayan looks in deep thought as he finds his seat among the supporters after his dismissal the 47 - year - old watches on with interest as his side searched for the equaliser at the kc stadium poyet talks of implementing his own style of play which will , in the long term , excite supporters
there is precious little evidence of that offensive brand at present and , jack rodwell âs leveller apart , they barely mustered an effort on goal
the body language of defoe told its own story
dropping deep in an attempt to enjoy a rare feel of the ball as they trailed after the break , he was robbed of possession by one of his own players
paul mcshane ( right ) is in disbelief as jack rodwell 's header in the 77th minute rescues a point for the sunderland sunderland boss poyet reacts animatedly to jack rodwell 's equalising goal from the stands of the kc stadium defoe flapped his hands in dismay
it was yet another show of a side sadly lacking in organisation and discipline
but when you have a boss who starts with four central - midfield players and is himself sent off just when you need his guidance more than ever , what chance do you stand ? that they got a point had little to do with their absent manager .
