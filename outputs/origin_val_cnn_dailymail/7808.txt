wenger never knows when he is wrong , and that flaw has cost the arsenal manager , according to his former midfielder petit
petit , who was part of wenger 's team at tuesday night 's opponents monaco before joining him at highbury in 1997 , won the double under the frenchmen the next year , and has known the arsenal boss for three decades
but as well as praising his former manager 's work ethic , the former gunners star , 44 , also questioned wenger 's stubbornness and inability to switch off
wenger is preparing to take arsenal back to his old club monaco in the uefa champions league petit ( right ) worked with wenger at both clubs , but says his former manager has a striking fault ' he 's a workaholic , someone who lives for the job , ' petit told france football
' he has a passion , almost pathological , for football
he almost forgets to live his own life
' for 35 years he has coached , i 've know him for nearly 30 , and he has never changed
he has another flaw : he does not recognise when he is wrong
' petit revealed that , at times of stress , wenger can be found walking barefoot around the training ground to get back in touch with nature
' he has tics , ' the premier league winning midfielder continued
for example , when he 's fuming and needs to think , he must walk barefoot in the grass
he needs to be in contact with the elements , like in matrix ! ' petit signed for the gunners in 1997 , alongside marc overmars ( right ) , and won the double under wenger the frenchmen celebrate winning the league in 1998 , but petit has said wenger can be too stubborn however , the former gunners midfielder did praise wenger 's man management and his work ethic wenger 's great strength , however , according to petit , is his ability to get the best out of his players by understanding them on a personal level
' before you are even interested in the football player , he is interested in the individual , ' said petit
' he attaches great importance to human relations
he is very attentive to detail
' petit departed arsenal in 2000 for a short stint at barcelona , after playing just one season with the man who would go on to become the club 's record goalscorer , thierry henry
but petit was quick to stress that his compatriot , who has been working back at the club while doing his coaching badges , should not be talked about as wenger 's successor yet
thierry henry , arsenal 's record goalscorer during two spells at the club , has been tipped to succeed wenger but petit says thierry henry , who was part of the 2004 invincibles , should not be thought of as a manager yet ' it 's way too early to tell [ if thierry henry can succeed wenger ] , ' he told rmc sport
' we live in a society where fast food is consumed very quickly and we also quickly discard what was consumed
for thierry henry , as with zidane , he needs time
' you do not become a coach just because you pass your degrees
it 's like when you become a parent
one becomes a function of his children , we adapt , we learn about ourselves
so getting the degree is one thing
become a coach week after week , that 's something else
