it 's the day the music died
in the early morning hours of february 3 , 1959 , a small aircraft carrying buddy holly , ritchie valens and j.p. " the big bopper " richardson crashed a few miles from mason city municipal airport , near clear lake , iowa
pilot roger peterson also died in the crash
the voice of the hit songs " peggy sue " and " that 'll be the day " was silenced forever
a few months later , the civil aeronautics board blamed the accident primarily on the pilot 's lack of qualification and certification to fly solely by instruments and secondarily on an inadequate weather briefing
now , the ntsb , the successor to the aeronautics board , may be taking another look
the ntsb received a letter from aviation enthusiast coon , a self - described retired pilot and aircraft dispatcher , asking it to look at other possible contributing factors to the crash
they include the aircraft 's weight and balance calculations ( for passengers , baggage and fuel ) , possible issues with rudder panels and possible carburetor induction icing , coon told cnn in an email
" you have gotten our attention , " the ntsb wrote in february , saying it would examine the information he provided , coon 's email said
the ntsb never fully closes a case , but any petition to re-examine a crash needs to show that there is new information suggesting the original probable cause is incorrect , ntsb spokesman eric weiss said
the agency has two months to review the petition and decide whether there 's new information that would make it revisit the case
in 1959 , buddy holly , ritchie valens and richardson were part of the the day the music died , a tour that had started in milwaukee and traveled to small cities in minnesota and iowa
the musicians had traveled in subfreezing temperatures in unheated buses , and people were getting sick
buddy holly booked the four - seat aircraft to fly to fargo , north dakota , where he planned to finally do laundry and rest in advance of the group 's next concert in nearby moorhead , minnesota
country legend jennings , then buddy holly 's bass player , gave up his seat to a sick richardson
jennings , who died in 2002 at age 64 , was haunted by his decision for years to come
dion and the belmonts were also on the tour , but dion gave up his seat on the plane after hearing the $ 36 per - person price tag
he was the only headliner not on the plane and the only headliner who did n't die that night
fans remember ' the the day the music died ' the crash has inspired generations of artists
lou diamond phillips played ritchie valens ( originally valenzuela ) in the 1987 hit movie " la bamba
" gary busey played buddy holly in the 1978 movie " the buddy holly story
" don mclean , who was inspired by buddy holly 's music , memorialized that day as " the day the music died " in his 1971 song " american pie
