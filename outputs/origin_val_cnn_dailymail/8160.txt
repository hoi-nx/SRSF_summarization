wu chang , a hospital spokesman , said doctors had supported the parents in their desire to have a second child
he said : ' extracting stem cells was relatively risk - free and painless for both mother and newborn , and offered life to the existing son as the operation has an extremely high success rate
' the operation is now scheduled to take place later this month
stem cells taken from blood and tissue in the umbilical cord can be used to treat a variety of conditions , including various forms of cancer
cord blood and cord tissue stem cells are considered to be one of the most promising sources of future medical treatments
the first successful cord blood stem cell transplant to treat fanconi 's anemia took place in 1988
since then , the list of conditions where stem cells are standard therapy has grown to include various forms of leukaemia and neuroblastoma , as well as conditions of the blood and the immune system
more than 30,000 cord blood transplants have been performed worldwide and there are more than 300 clinical trials underway
