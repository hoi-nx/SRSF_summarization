the duke of cambridge made the unannounced â private visit â on thursday to gchq prince william has made a top secret visit to britain âs most secretive building , the mail on sunday can reveal
the duke of cambridge made the unannounced â private visit â on thursday to gchq ( gchq ) â the maximum security â listening station â which tracks electronic traffic of terrorists and spy agencies around the world
the duke of cambridge âs first ever trip to gchq , housed in a doughnut - shaped building in cheltenham , gloucestershire , comes after the mail on sunday revealed that he and other young royals were being advised to change their email addresses and cut back on social media activities over fears they could be targeted by foreign spies and hackers
but questions were asked last night about the duke of cambridge âs use of a publicly funded royal helicopter to make the trip , as it was not an official public engagement and was not announced in the kensington palace âs court circular
the duke of cambridge was flown from london âs kensington palace to gloucestershire airport on the queen âs helicopter flight , funded by the taxpayer , and which is supposed to be only used for official engagements by the royals
under gchq rules , the royals have to pay for their own private visits
but last night kensington palace declined to comment on the reasons for the trip or confirm whether the william would pay back the estimated Â£ 8,000 travel costs
a kensington palace source initially described the 200 - mile round trip as a â private visit â but later suggested it was â official â , and so could possibly be paid from the taxpayer - funded royal travel budget
the gchq ( gchq ) â the maximum security â listening station â which tracks electronic traffic of terrorists and spy agencies around the world kensington palace and gchq refused to say whom he met , or what he saw
but it is believed the william met the new head of gchq , robert hannigan , and also saw the agency âs code breakers at work , monitoring internet and communications traffic to pick up terrorist threats
other members of the royal family have previously visited gchq , which was opened by the queen in 2004
a gchq spokesman said yesterday : â prince william paid a private visit to gchq on march 19
as it was a private visit we ca nât go into further details of what his itinerary involved
