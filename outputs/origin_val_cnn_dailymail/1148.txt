tony irish , the boss of the international players â union , has criticised the icc over their decision to cut the cup in england to 10 teams , saying : â the global game needs a global view
â with the likes of ireland and afghan â two of the more engaging sides in this year âs tournament â in danger of missing out on qualification in four years â time , the icc have faced tough questions over their commitment to spreading the game beyond its 10 test - playing full members
but irish âs comments , part of a wide - ranging interview with sportsmail about some of the major issues faced by international cricket , carry particular significance : fica , the federation of international cricketers â associations of which he is chief executive , represents the players unions in england , australian , bangladesh , new zealand , sri lanka , south african and west indies
tony irish , the south african boss of the international players â union , says cricket needs a global view and not a 10 - game cup that the icc has planned for 2019 that will exclude the likes of ireland ( above ) fans of afghan , who have n't been disgraced in their first cup in australian and new zealand in other words , he is speaking on behalf of the majority of the world âs top cricketers
â fica takes a global view on the game , â said irish
â one of the objectives must be to try to grow the global game
the opportunity for other countries to participate in the cup , the pinnacle tournament , is important
â however , we do accept the challenge relating to the length of the event
we think we should look at reformatting the event , perhaps into four pools , or having a pre-qualifier
â irish , whose push for fica to play a greater role in determining the game âs future has not been helped by india âs refusal to form their own players â union , said the format of future world cups should not be influenced by the tv - driven desire to guarantee as many group matches as possible for the indian
afghan and new zealand playes come together after their cup pool a match in napier â one can understand that from a commercial point of view , and from the point of view of satisfying the biggest cricket market , â he said
â but you âve got to balance against that the fact that a sporting event is a sporting event , and if a team performs poorly in a particular format , then that âs how the results go
the growth of the game is equally important
â the icc has 105 members â 10 full members , and a number of competitive associate members
the important thing is that the body that administers the global game needs to have a global view
â irish , who also heads up the south african players â association , questioned how associate nations were supposed to get exposure against the full members when the international schedule is already full to bursting
india have n't got a players ' union which hinders the international union 's powers to push for an inclusive game he said : â there âs very little framework any more to the ftp
it âs not being governed by a set of principles which allows â¦ cricket to have a greater context
it âs a lot of individual agreements between countries , which are just plugged into a matrix
â it âs a pity the world test championship has been shelved
the team rankings give some sort of context , but they âre extremely difficult to understand
â and irish is concerned that the takeover of the icc by the indian , england and australian boards last year will result in an increasingly unlevel playing field at international level
though the icc have promised more funds to all full members and the best six associate teams as a result of their latest broadcasting deal , many are worried that the big three will pull away from the small seven because they will simply schedule more lucrative series against between themselves
under the old ftp , teams were obliged to play each other home and away every four years in series of at least two tests and three one - day internationals
now , the fixture list is drawn up on the basis of individual agreements between teams
â the fear is that the stronger countries will just play each other more and more , and the weaker countries will have less opportunity to play the stronger countries , â said irish
â the rich get richer , and the poor get poorer
