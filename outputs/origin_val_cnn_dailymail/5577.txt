joe hart claimed his 100th clean sheet in the premier league on saturday when manchester city beat west bromwich albion 3 - 0 at the etihad
he became the 14th goalkeeper to pass the milestone but has some way to go before he can claim the crown , currently held by david james with 169
yet at the age of 27 , joe hart has plenty of time left to make his way through the list that includes peter schmeichel , david seaman and edwin van der sar
manchester city goalkeeper joe hart kept his 100th clean sheet against west bromwich albion on saturday joe hart 's clean sheet could have gone when saido berahino had this chance but the striker hit the crossbar david james ( left ) and cech ( right ) lead the list of the most premier league clean sheets david james , current player - manager for indian super league club kerala blasters , got his 169 from a career that saw him play for liverpool , aston villa , west ham , manchester city and portsmouth
chelsea 's cech would most likely have passed that total , had he not lost his place as first - choice goalkeeper to 22 - year - old thibaut courtois under jose mourinho
third - placed schwarzer left chelsea for leicester on a free transfer in january as cover for the injured kasper schmeichel , whose dad peter sits ninth in the list
yet schwarzer is running out of time to close in on cech with the 42 - year - old - the oldest player to feature in the premier league this season - set to be relegated as leicester sit bottom
everton goalkeeper tim howard , having conceded five against dynamo kiev during their europa league exit on thursday , will look to move up the list before the 36 - year - old retires
as for joe hart , the man that thwarted barcelona 's messi in the champions league last week , he will now chase thomas sorensen and jussi jaaskelainen on 107 and 108 respectively
he will next be able to do so against crystal palace on april 6 after the international break with england
