and they said that if i confessed , he would be freed
' otherwise the same thing would happen to me as to shavanov
' the official version is that shavanov killed himself with a grenade as police came to arrest him
he added he was not guilty and the judge did not allow him to speak , he told moskovskiy komsomolets newspaper

other media in russians today named him as ruslan geremeev
in sensational claims , the newspaper reported that the man who ordered 55 - year - old boris nemtsov 's murder is a highly decorated major in the same interior ministry unit called ' north ' in chechens in which alleged killer zaur dadayev served until recently
