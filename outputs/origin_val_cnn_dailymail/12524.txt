even with the national chapter shutting the sae house at the university of oklahoma , the school president said the university 's affiliation with the fraternity is permanently done as a campus group called for the expulsion of fraternity members
the members have until midnight tuesday to get their things out of the house , university president boren said in a monday afternoon news conference
" the house will be closed , and as far as i 'm concerned , they wo n't be back , " he said , adding that the university is exploring what actions it can take against individual fraternity members
a saturday video showing party - bound fraternity members on a bus chanting a racial epithet found its way anonymously to the school newspaper and a campus organization , which both promptly publicized the nine - second clip
boren : not just another college president the students on the bus clap and pump their fists as they boisterously chant , " there will never be a ni * * * * sae
you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me
" by sunday night , sae 's national chapter had suspended the university of oklahoma members and threatened lifelong suspensions for anyone responsible for the chant , but boren took it a step further
he appeared at a campus rally and told students over a bullhorn , " i have a message for those who have misused their freedom of speech in this way
my message to them is : you 're disgraceful
you have violated every principle that this university stands for
" he said that he was angered , outraged and saddened by what he saw in the video
boren stressed that the fraternity members ' behavior is not indicative of what university of oklahoma students , nicknamed sooners , represent
" it was unbelievable that this could have possibly occurred with university of oklahoma students , " he said
" sooners are not racists
they are people who respect each other and care about each other
" he called for zero tolerance
" the only way you put a stop to it is have zero tolerance when it is found out
clearly , i think some of our students wanted this exposed
they wanted this video out there , and i 've asked them to please let me know when they 're other things like this that happen , " boren told cnn
the student newspaper , the oklahoma daily , received the video in a sunday email , said print editor katelyn griffith
the fraternity celebrated its founder 's day on saturday , and the video showed members traveling to a formal event that evening , she said
" we decided that this was definitely a story they needed to cover without question , " she told cnn
" this was something that we knew would n't be tolerated by the students at university of oklahoma and the university at large
" unheard , a campus organization launched in response to the police shooting of michael brown in ferguson , missouri , received the video sunday via anonymous text and immediately moved to " let our community and our university know that this behavior is not tolerated , that 's it 's unacceptable and it 's extremely , extremely offensive , " said the group 's co-director , chelsea davis
this mentality is not new to campus , and it 's not confined to one fraternity , davis told cnn , but it 's the first time people have been caught on video
" unfortunately , it took them getting caught on video camera for this to happen , but this is definitely not something that is brand - new
it 's not something that 's only seen within this one organization , " she said
davis said the only acceptable response is to expel -- not suspend , as that would send the wrong message -- all the students involved
" i was hurt that my fellow peers that i walk to class with every day , people that i see every day , could say such hateful things about me and my culture , about my friends , about my brothers and my sisters , " she said
at a news conference , boren said the school was looking into punishing the individuals involved , especially against those " who have taken a lead " in the chanting
while expulsion is an option , any punishment must be " carefully directed " if it 's to pass constitutional muster
one key will be whether the offending students created a hostile environment on campus , he said
boren emphasized that " there is no room for racists and bigots " at university of oklahoma
" i think some of the students themselves may take themselves off the campus , and i hope they do because this is not a place that wants racists , " he told cnn later
that sentiment echoed throughout campus , as a large crowd of students attended a protest at the university 's north oval , some of them arriving with tape over their mouths with the word , " unheard , " written across it
other students took to social media to express their disappointment , with one person urging students to change their profile picture to an image that says in sooner crimson , " not on our campus , " the " ou " in " our " offset in gray
university of oklahoma is shorthand for the university of oklahoma
unheard posted the video online sunday with the comment , " racism is alive at the university of oklahoma
" it was addressed to @ president_boren , the university president 's twitter handle
boren quickly threatened to throw the fraternity off - campus if the allegations were true
the sae 's national chapter also moved promptly , saying in a statement it had closed the chapter " following the discovery of an inappropriate video
" the group further apologized for the " unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video
" " i was not only shocked and disappointed , but disgusted by the outright display of racism displayed in the video , " sae national president bradley cohen said in a statement
a group of students gathered to pray over the racist insults
one of them told cnn affiliate kfor-tv he was " nauseated , frustrated , " but he was happy with the sae headquarters ' decision
" we should be past this
this is disgusting , " he said
spray paint marked a wall of sae 's fraternity house at the university
" tear it down , " the graffiti appeared to say
police posted squad cars in front of the house
members of the university of oklahoma football team protested , marching in lieu of meeting and practice
backlash extended beyond campus as well , with hip - hop star waka flocka flame saying on instagram that he was canceling an upcoming show for the saes
" all races partying have a good time and enjoying themselves together peacefully
that 's what waka flocka flame is all about
for that reason , i must say i 'm disgusted and disappointed in the actions of the sae fraternity at university of oklahoma and i will be canceling my scheduled performance for them next month
racism is something i will not tolerate , " the atlanta rapper wrote
