a wife has lost her Â£ 2million divorce battle with her property tycoon ex-husband - who is worth Â£ 38million â because she had signed a ' post-nuptial agreement '
a judge heard william and hopkins , who had lived together near wincanton , somerset , married more than three decades after starting an affair , but separated after less than three years
the high court in london heard the couple , who separated in the summer of 2011 , had signed a ' post-nuptial ' agreement under which mrs hopkins would receive two properties , Â£ 350,000 and a share of her ex-husband 's pension
but mrs hopkins , 62 , complained that the agreement had been breached after she was put under ' undue pressure ' and exploited - and argued that she should be awarded a further Â£ 2million
a high court ( pictured ) judge rejected hopkins claim for Â£ 2million after she signed a ' post-nuptial ' agreement , which already entitled her to two properties , Â£ 350,000 and a share of her ex-husband 's pension deputy high court judge nicholas cusworth qc , in a written ruling , said that he preferred mr hopkins 's evidence - and added mrs hopkins had ' sought to underplay ' the agreement and had ' dramatised ' what happened
he rejected her claim of ' undue influence ' and cleared mr hopkins of ' badgering and harassing ' her
mrs hopkins had claimed her ex-husband was worth Â£ 54.3 million , although he put the figure at Â£ 38.4 million
she also accused her former husband of ' bullying ' her into signing up to the deal
mr hopkins , 66 , described by lawyers as a multi-millionaire property developer , disputed her claim and offered another Â£ 200,000
she said that when she had questioned the fairness of the agreement , he had become ' uncontrollably angry ' , raising his fist and tightening her clothes around her neck
but mr hopkins denied there was any such incident , but accepted there may have been ' some physical tension ' between them during an ' extremely fraught ' time as their marriage broke down
the court heard mr hopkins and mrs hopkins had written lists of ' how things could change ' to each other shortly before separating
mr hopkins had written at the top of his list : ' i would like to be listened to ' but mrs hopkins added ' listening ' third on her list
the couple , now in their 60s , met in the 1980s while both were married with young children
they had a child together after what was described as a ' clandestine affair ' , but only married in 2009
after moving in together in wincanton in 2001 , they married after mr hopkins had begged her to give him ' one last chance ' , the court heard
but just over a year after their wedding , mrs hopkins went to see a divorce lawyer to seek advice about her entitlements â and the post-nuptial agreement was signed in august 2011
under the deal , mrs hopkins got the family home - ' lynwood ' , in wincanton , which is valued at more than Â£ 530,000 as well as an investment property worth about Â£ 250,000
she also received a 50 % stake in her husband 's pension , worth more than Â£ 200,000
deputy high court judge nicholas cusworth qc ( pictured ) said mrs hopkins had ' sought to underplay ' the agreement however , mrs hopkins had claimed liabilities , including legal costs bills , and said she would be left with less than Â£ 430,000 , before pensions
she sought Â£ 2million , claiming she would need every penny to meet her reasonable needs
but the judge ruled it would simply be ' unfair ' to mr hopkins if his ex-wife was not held to the terms of the post-nup
he found mr hopkins had done nothing which undermined her ability to ' form her own mind ' about the agreement and what it meant
mrs hopkins , at the time , ' was rational , thoughtful , saddened by her situation , but certainly capable of independent thought '
' she knew her own mind and was keenly aware of her own objectives ' , the judge added
although mr hopkins had ' confessed to bullying behaviour ' in some letters he wrote , judge cusworth concluded : ' i reject the wife 's case that she was operating under any undue influence , duress or improper pressure when she entered into the post-nuptial settlement '
' i do not find it to be a dishonest document
i find that it was entered into freely by the wife , and with full appreciation of its implications
' she had received ' copious volumes of legal advice ' before signing her name on the dotted line
mrs hopkins had never contended for more than a ' needs - based award ' following her divorce , and the judge said that was what the post-nup gave her
lamenting the titanic expense of the case , the judge said the pair had run up lawyers ' bills of more than Â£ 750,000 fighting over money
even after receiving the Â£ 200,000 lump sum , mrs hopkins would still owe over Â£ 120,000 in legal costs
the cost of the case to mr hopkins came to Â£ 638,097 - including the lump sum awarded to mrs hopkins .
