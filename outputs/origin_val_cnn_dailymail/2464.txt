within these guidelines , apple is said to be advising developers to design applications to be used for no longer than 10 seconds at a time
boss tim cook is shown at the iphone event in september in particular , bmw , facebook and united continental holdings were mentioned in the report
internet access is blocked inside the room , the developers have to bring source code for their apps on a drive that ca nât leave the complex , and they ca nât discuss the plans with anyone

built - in is a ' taptic engine ' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications the watch has a completely new user interface , different from the iphone , and the ' crown ' on the apple watch is a dial called the ' digital crown
' users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map , or scroll a list
the crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen
different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes , and force touches
the glances feature shows info users would like to see , similar to google now , and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom
music can also be controlled on an iphone through the apple watch
built - in is a ' taptic engine ' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications
it understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers , and messages can be dictated to the iphone
users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply , or have it transcribed to them
there is no keyboard on the watch , and messages can only be sent through dictation , or emoji
siri is also built into the apple watch
apparently , apple boss tim cook wants developers to consider how much their apps send notifications to users to avoid the wristband vibrating constantly and ultimately draining the battery
for example , facebook âs instagram has added a feature that only sends a notification when a certain user posts a photo
some app developers have already released interactive demos about how they predict the watch will work

and hardware-wise , an italian designer has created a website that lets people mix and match the colours of the apple watch case and band to experiment with different looks
mixyourwatch shows the different combinations from leather to steel bands and gold and steel cases
according to reports , apple experimented with sensors that measured conductivity of the skin
the results were also said to have varied on how tightly the watch was being worn
these would have been used to track stress levels and monitor heart - rate
but ' these features did n't perform consistently on some people , including those with hairy arms or dry skin ' and the plans were said to have been subsequently dropped .
