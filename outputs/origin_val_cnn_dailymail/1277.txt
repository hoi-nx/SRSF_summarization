hospitals have been warned to free up their beds over the next two weeks in an attempt to avert an easter crisis in the nhs ( file image ) nhs england has drawn up emergency plans amid fears casualty departments will be unable to cope with high demand over the four - day break , which starts on april 3 , while staff numbers are low
as many patients as possible must be discharged from hospital in the next fortnight so casualty departments will not be over capacity before the start of the bank holiday
the warnings come after hospitals suffered one of the worst performances on record over the christmas holidays
waiting times in emergency departments are at a record high , partly because so many patients are unable to get an appointment with their gp
a memo from barbara hawkin , the nhs deputy chief executive , was sent out to all nhs trusts and groups of gps
the unprecedented 11 - point plan for gps , hospitals and social services departments said it is â critical â organisations have â resilience plans â in order to cope with the mounting pressure

figures showed waiting times in nhs england were at their worst in a decade â and that in the last three months of 2014 almost 21,000 patients had languished on trolleys for up to 12 hours
in one shocking case , an 81 - year - old grandmother who had fallen in her home had to wait 11 hours for an ambulance and then had another 60 - minute wait on a trolley in a hospital corridor
some patients reported having to â fight â their way into casualty units packed like â nightclubs â
it is feared that , with hospitals and gps already struggling to meet targets , there could be another disastrous waiting time crisis this easter
an nhs england spokesman said last night : â while we are pleased to have come through a difficult period , now is a good time to reinforce our message that we are resolved to driving up performance in the coming weeks and throughout the year
