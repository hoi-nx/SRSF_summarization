richard scudamore âs elevation from ceo to premier league chairman at thursday 's club summit will also see the world âs richest league have a new - look set of directors
but the board will remain remarkably different from the company director structure at the top of other multi-billion - pound businesses
the three - strong premier league version is expected to consist of just richard scudamore and two newly appointed independent directors to be unveiled on thursday , who will hopefully provide some gender and race diversity
richard scudamore ( left ) will be elevated from ceo to premier league chairman at thursday 's club summit and be joined by two newly appointed independent directors fa chairman dyke will be under pressure to explain his campaign for more homegrown players the formation , which will need a change of premier league statutes , is at least a step nearer fit - for - purpose governance than the current two - man board of richard scudamore and peter mccormick , the interim chairman who is standing down
the premier league still regard their six - times - a - year club summits as board meetings with their 20 shareholders , despite most of the top - flight foreign owners never bothering to attend
meanwhile , fa chairman dyke has tended to keep quiet in premier league meetings , but he will be under pressure on thursday to explain his campaign for more homegrown players in premier league squads to help the national team
dyke has strong backing from uefa for this initiative , which has nât been supported by the premier league representatives on the fa board

ticketmaster are infamous for their computer system continually crashing during the sale of london 2012 olympic seats
kevin pietersen 's signing back at surrey coincided with a bothed mass email to members about tickets clarke , who stands down as ecb chairman in may , has been the loudest autocratic voice on most english cricket issues since he took the helm in 2008
yet clarke has chosen to stay noticeably silent on kevin pietersen âs return to surrey
the football league are taking a lot longer than promised to probe the ffp returns of leicester and qpr
the leicester issue centres on a far east marketing deal to offset losses , agreed with a sheffield agency owned by former premier league chairman sir dave richards and his son
and investigating qpr owner tony fernandes writing off Â£ 60million of debts to counter massive breaching of ffp limits is proving hard enough without the extra difficulties of ceo phil beard having left the club and finance director rebecca caplehorn moving to spurs
