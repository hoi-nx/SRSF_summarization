an investigation has revealed how factory workers in china risk contracting a potentially fatal disease to produce jeans for fashion labels abercrombie & fitch and american eagle outfitters
employees at a factory where the two companies source their products were filmed using a method known as sandblasting - which gives the material a fashionable faded look
the practice is known to be dangerous and has been banned in some countries after being linked to deaths from respiratory disease silicosis
dangerous method : secret footage taken during an undercover investigation shows workers in china factory which supplies abercrombie & fitch and american eagle outfitters continue to use sandblasting the short programme , titled ' denim blues ' and due to be aired on al jazeera on march 19 , also exposed poor working conditions and environmental damage resulting from the industry in the china city of xintang , known as the jeans capital of the world
the video , shot by an undercover researcher , captured employees working at a frantic pace in a factory known as dongguan tiangxiang
chemicals lie haphazardly around the room and workers use a potent chemical called potassium permanganate without wearing proper protective masks
the secret footage also shows sandblasting going on in the factory and the labels of american eagle outfitters ( aeo ) , abercrombie & fitch and hollister , owned by abercrombie & fitch , are clearly visible
secret footage : in the short film , an undercover researcher discovers an abercrombie & fitch label at a factory where jeans are being sandblasted part of initiative : american eagle outfitters ( american eagle outfitters ) jeans are also seen in the footage
the company joined an initiative in 2011 to help boycott the practice in 2011 , aeo joined an initiative spearheaded by levi and h&m to boycott the controversial production method known as sandblasting
in a company statement , the popular brand said : ' until we believe that proper controls can be put in place to ensure sandblasting is done safely , we are no longer developing new styles with sandblasting
' jeans with a distressed , already - worn appearance have been popular since the 1990s and method to create the effect is by blasting them with sand
manual sandblasting of jeans requires only a hose , an air compressor and sand - workers literally blast the material with sand to give them a faded look and to soften the denim
constant exposure to minute particles used in the process can lead to accidental inhalation , and later respiratory disease silicosis
silicosis is caused when small particles of silica dust from the sand embed themselves within the lungs
the incurable disease causes shortness of breath , coughing , weakness and weight loss and in its acute form is fatal
when asked by investigators about their supplier 's continued use of the practice , they claimed the sandblasting facilities had been removed but did not say when
a spokesman said : ' aeo has thoroughly investigated the factory dongguan tim cheung ( here referred to as dongguan tianxiang ) and has verified that all sandblasting equipment has been removed from the factory
' abercrombie & fitch also appeared to dispute the evidence , claiming : ' yes dongguan tiangxiang produces goods for us
we do n't allow vendors to use sandblasting during the manufacturing process of our goods
' on their website the world - famous brand says : ' [ we are ] proud of our commitment to international human and labor rights , and to ensuring that our products are only made in safe and responsible facilities
' we partner with suppliers who respect local laws and share our dedication to utilizing the best practices in human rights , labor rights and workplace safety
' abercrombie & fitch believes that business should only be conducted with honesty and respect for the dignity and rights of all people
health risk : a bucket of chemicals lies exposed in the dongguan tianxiang factory , where aeo and abercrombie & fitch source their jeans dirty environment : the footage shows how working conditions in the factory are a long way from what abercrombie & fitch customers might imagine employees at a factory where abercrombie & fitch and aeo source their products were filmed using a method known as sandblasting - which gives the material a fashionable faded look sandblasting is dangerous as constant exposure to minute particles in the process can lead to silicosis
in 2009 , turkey banned the process after hundreds of former workers were diagnosed with the disease
dozens of others have died
the method is still legal in china and some workers run mobile sandblasting services travelling between factories - and they are paid around 4p for each pair of jeans
factory managers refused to discuss the process , but workers speaking on the condition of anonymity confirmed the controversial practice continues
one worker told al jazeera : ' the main problem with sandblasting is the dust
this means you risk getting silicosis if you are not properly protected
' some workers say they suffer not only from lung problems but also from allergies caused by dyes and other chemicals used in the making of denim
al jazeera will be airing the show on thursday march 19
