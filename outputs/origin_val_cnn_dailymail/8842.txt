a probe into how police handled child sexual exploitation in rotherham is looking into allegations against 42 officers after complaints were sent to the force watchdog
the independent police complaints commission ( independent police complaints commission ) was already examining allegations against ten officers involved in the investigation into one of the country 's most prolific child abuse rings
but today the commission said it had received 30 new complaints containing 100 allegations about 42 officers involved in the rotherham investigation
the independent police complaints commission is examining 100 allegations made against 42 officers from south yorkshire police who investigated child sex abuse in rotherham ( file image ) the complaints came in the wake of the jay report , which described how 1,400 children , mainly girls , were routinely raped , trafficked and groomed in south yorkshire between 1997 and 2013 it said in a statement : ' the complaints contain more than 100 allegations against 42 named police officers , both retired and serving , as well as a number of allegations against officers whose identities are currently unknown
' the complaints followed on from the jay report , which described how at least 1,400 children were raped , trafficked and groomed in the south yorkshire town between 1997 and 2013
the independent police complaints commission statement said : ' work to establish the identity of the unknown officers and to identify any links between the different complaints and incidents is ongoing
' the allegations range from neglect of duty by failing to adequately investigate on the basis of intelligence or to deal with incidents appropriately , inappropriate comments and suggestions of corrupt relationships between police officers and offenders
' the commission said it was also investigating an allegation that south yorkshire police failed to act on information passed to them in 2004 and 2006 about alleged child abuse in nearby sheffield
this complaint relates to two named police officers who are now retired from the police service , the independent police complaints commission said
the jay report , published in august last year , sparked furious debate about the tragic crimes which took place in rotherham , and how the perpetrators went unchallenged for so long
the alexis jay report found that the abuse went unchallenged as police and council chiefs were afraid of being labelled racist , as the perpetrators were largely gangs of asian men professor alexis jay , who wrote the report , described how hundreds of vulnerable teenagers , mainly girls , were routinely exploited by gangs of mainly asian men with impunity
police and senior council officers were accused of failing to tackle the problem for fear of being seen as racist , and of ignoring or doubting the victim 's accounts
a wave of high profile resignations followed and the national crime agency was brought in to investigate the crimes and how they were handled
the jay report was followed by another report by casey , which was scathing in its criticism of rotherham council and led to the replacement of the local authority 's ruling cabinet with commissioners appointed by communities secretary eric pickles
after more revelations about the scale of exploitation in neighbouring sheffield , the south yorkshire police and crime commissioner , alan billings , last month called for a wide - ranging inspection of his force , along the lines of ms casey 's review of the council 's actions .
