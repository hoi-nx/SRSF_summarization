' harrison started boxing at 19 and became the first uk boxer to win olympic gold in the super-heavyweight division when he triumphed in sydney
his triumph paved the way for future medalists amir khan , james degale , anthony joshua , luke campbell and nicola adams through increased funding
he turned professional the following year , signing a Â£ 1million deal with the bbc for his first 10 fights
six million people watched his debut - a first round knockout of mike middleton - but his contract was terminated in 2004 after he had accumulated a record of 17 wins from as many contests
harrison suffered his first defeat when he challenged danny williams for the vacant commonwealth title
although he would later avenge that loss , it was the first of several high - profile bouts in which harrison failed to produce the goods
sprott knocked him out in the third round of their european title clash - although that defeat was also avenged three years later in a rematch for the same belt
harrison twice used the short - format prizefighter to his advantage , first in 2009 when he defeated coleman barrett , danny hughes and scott belshaw
that propelled him into his second clash with sprott which saw him finally win a major honour

and once again he earned himself a high - profile fight , this time against the uk and commonwealth champion david price

those who urged him to retire were left disappointed when he again turned to prizefighter for redemption in 2013
and his three victories over derric rossy , martin rogan and claus bertino produced his familiar rhetoric of finally being at one with himself and the sport
harrison landed just one punch on david haye as he was dismantled inside three farcical rounds but in wilder he faced another hurdle that could not be overcome
