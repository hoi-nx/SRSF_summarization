so it 's no wonder that busy supermodel lindsay needs ways to unwind , just like everyone else
the 30 - year - old has now revealed her top tips for managing stress to online beauty magazine , byrdie , and thankfully they are things that everyone can incorporate into their lifestyle
lindsay commented on the feeling of love that she receives from spending time with her pet : ' she 's just full of love , as are most pets
' she goes on to suggest alternatives for those who do n't own dogs : ' if you do nât or ca nât have a pet , many animal shelters love to have volunteers who come to interact with the animals
' in fact , several shelters [ ... ] let you come and walk the dogs for a few hours a day
' lindsay also recommends massaging oil into the skin on daily basis , revealing it 's the smell that works to de-stress : ' the scents will immediately transport you to a calm place
' aromatherapy oils are yet another way that the model stays stress - free in her hectic lifestyle forget coffee , the model drinks calming organic tea , containing liquorice ginger , cardamon , and cinnamon she even carries her oils with her , admitting , ' i never leave home without it
' the victoria 's secret model also says drinking a special herbal tea when she 's on the move or feeling out of sorts can make her feel calm again
in particular , she goes for natural herbal vata tea , which consists of liquorice root , organic ginger , cardamom and cinnamon
lindsay further adds that she personally opts for the tea when ' travelling [ or ] feeling restless
' the 30 - year - old emphasises always ' falling asleep the right way ' - especially with carly next to her 5
spa day - a midday spa appointment is one of the victoria secret angel 's favourite ways to unwind and for the model , getting her beauty sleep is a must
she opts for a pre-bed ritual to guarantee she 'll feel well - rested the next days , explaining that it 's important to fall ' asleep the right way '
this involves removing devices from around the bed
she said : ' reading on my ipad is a big no - no. ' instead , she suggested ' a cup of warm almond milk before bed and then massaging your feet with an essential oil
' the best time to go to sleep ? ' preferably at 10pm - according to ayurveda , an alternative medicine , originating from india , your body repairs itself most effectively between 10pm and 2am , ' she said
while another new age tip for managing stress is : ' a mid-day ayurveda facial in between running to my appointments ' , which she describes as ' the perfect pick - me - up
' and the best bit is the massage
the model 's favourite parts to concentrate on are : ' my favorite part is the face , neck , arm , and shoulder massage
' for those who are new to the entire spa experience ? ' bring a friend to enjoy the day , ' she advises
for the next tip , lindsay ca n't quite put her finger on the reason she finds painting her nails so relaxing
' maybe it 's the total distraction from all my daily activities and the focus it takes to paint inside the lines
' lindsay finds that the concentration needed to paint her nails is a relaxing experience ayurvedic self - massage - the model has always been interested in alternative medicine and tried out ayurveda , which aims to balance the body , mind , and spirit through a combination of sleep , yoga , herbs and oils , meditation , and a healthy diet another tip from lindsay : ' i love the idea of giving yourself an oil massage every day
' earlier this year the model became interested in ayurveda : an alternative medicine that originated in india
' i wanted to try something new and good for my body and mind
' prior to giving the self - massage , the model suggests : ' [ rubbing ] a couple drops of calming oil into [ your ] hands for a few seconds ... and deep breaths to slowly transition into a meditative state
' lindsay states that she enjoys an oil massage due to the fact : ' it 's incredibly soothing and detoxifying
' lindsay says that something that everyone can relate to enjoying is a getaway the beauty pairs a face mask with under - eye patches , and for the extra relaxation factor , a cup of tea lindsay flags going on holiday as ' the ultimate way to recharge ' and that listening to the sound of the waves is an incredible relaxation technique
her low - budget alternative ? ' if you ca nât afford a seaside getaway , no problem
thankfully there 's an app for that - the soothing sound of crashing waves , no beach required ! ' and if you 'd rather just put your feet up at home , make like the model and slap on a face mask while you 're sipping a calming cuppa
although she admits : ' i try not to scare my husband like this too often ! '
