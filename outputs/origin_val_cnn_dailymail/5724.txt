environmentalists involved in prince william 's china tour warned british diplomats not to let him visit a park where elephants perform circus tricks two months ago , the mail on sunday has learnt
but the advice â given to officials at british 's chongqing consulate as the william 's itinerary was drafted in january â was brushed aside , one of the ecologists said yesterday
the william 's tour â on which he was accompanied by four press officers â ended in a pr disaster when he visited a rescue centre at wild elephant valley , only a few yards from an arena where elephants play football , dance and do tricks for tourists
in the spotlight : prince william surrounded by his support team in china during his royal tour the degrading performances at wild elephant valley that happen just yards from the rescue centre visited by william last month the mail on sunday revealed the william would be visiting the park and informed the buckingham palace of the cruel conditions , but royal sources claimed prince william wanted to visit regardless so he could ' shine a spotlight ' on the issue
however when the william was at the park , and was asked by sky tv if he knew elephants were performing nearby , he seemed wrong - footed , hurrying away in silence as journalist mark stone called after him : ' the china are using elephants to play football , your royal highness
' ecologist alice hughes , an associate professor based at xishuangbanna botanical gardens , said : ' when the british consulate told us ' we might take prince william to wild elephant valley ' , we all said unanimously , ' do n't take him there
it 's basically a circus
' we warned the british consulate off but i think some of them are very , very naÃ¯ve
' she added : ' i do n't believe our concerns were filtered through to any higher levels
if prince william had known what was going on there , i do n't think there is any possibility he would have gone
i think he must have been assured they really were doing conservation work
' both buckingham palace and the foreign office declined to say if the concerns had been passed on to the william
but yesterday one of his aides insisted : ' prince william absolutely knew what was happening
' another aide said : ' our view is , this was n't embarrassing
it was an essential thing for the duke of cambridge to do and one of the key reasons he went is to encourage conservation efforts and that comes in complex packaging
' both buckingham palace and the foreign office declined to say if the concerns had been passed on to the william , pictured during his visit a kensington palace spokesman added : ' it goes without saying the duke of cambridge does not condone the performances , but he recognises the incredible work wild elephant valley has done to protect the elephant population
' but louise rogerson , from the elephant asia rescue and survival foundation , said : ' tourists will flock to wild elephant valley now
prince william is indirectly supporting cruelty to elephants forced to take part in these circus performances
