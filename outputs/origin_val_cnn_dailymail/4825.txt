france , who are fourth behind ireland , wales and england , have been far from convincing so far this campaign , accounting only for scotland 15 - 8 in their opening match

after venting following the wales defeat , philippe saint andre put his support behind his players this week , saying he had ' faith ' in them to turn things around in italy
' the team has a lot of potential , ' he said
' over the last two and half years we 've learned a lot
i have a group of professionals , and a good team , but they need to maximise their potential
' saturday ( against wales ) , we were only at 70 - 80 per cent
as a coach , but also as a lover of rugby , i expect a lot more from this team
i have faith in this squad
' they have the right values , and they are doing well as a squad
they need to do more on the pitch , as a team and individually
they need to take the initiative
' but honestly , if we did n't believe in them , we 'd have changed lots of players
on sunday in italy i expect a reaction because we have a squad with values and they will show it on sunday
