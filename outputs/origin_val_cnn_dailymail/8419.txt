the remains of a woolly mammoth that died 10,000 years ago have been unearthed in siberian by oil workers
two tusks , teeth and rib bones of the extinct giant mammal were discovered buried three metres down in the frozen soil around 31 miles ( 50km ) from nyagan in khanty-mansi , russia
oil workers had been digging at a site owned by rosneft close to the town when they noticed a tusk sticking out of the excavator bucket
ancient : two mammoth tusks ( shown above ) together with fragments of jaw , teeth , tibia and ribs were dug from the frozen soil of siberian
oil workers noticed a tusk sticking out of the excavator bucket using shovels they then unearthed a second tust , a tibia , ribs , teeth and fragments of the animal 's jaw
aton rezvy , head of palaeontology at the khanty-mansiysk museum of nature and man , said he believes the mammoth is at least 10,000 years old
since the 1700s scientists have debated what caused the demise of mammoths
all but a few isolated island populations disappeared between 20,000 and 10,000 years ago
one popular theory , bolstered by this study , is that ice age people hunted most of the mammoths out of existence
however , some experts argue that global warming helped make the giant creatures extinct between 20,000 and 25,000 years ago
other researchers argue that an impact of extraterritorial objects in north america 13,000 years ago , led to rapid climate change , eventually wiping out the mammoths
today , it 's thought that a combination of factors led to extinction
he estimated that the giant animal had been a fully grown adult female , around 30 to 40 years old when she died
he said they hoped to conduct further analysis of the bones to learn more about the mammoth
he told the siberian times : ' we can send the find to determine the radiocarbon date
' genetic analysis will help to determine which population this mammoth was from - europe or north america
' recent research has shown that many woolly mammoths discovered in siberian may have originated in north ameria and migrated across the bering strait when sea levels were lower
many believe the original siberian population of mammoths disappeared around 40,000 years ago , with north america mammoths dominating until around 4,500 years ago
the exact reason for their extinction is still debated with many blaming changes to the climate as causing their demise
others have pointed to evidence that humans and neanderthals hunted the giant creatures along with other ice age megafauna and may have pushed them to the brink of extinction
palaeontologists who examined the mammoth 's remains ( shown above ) estimate it died 10,000 years ago oil workers had been excavating a site 31 miles from nyagan in russia ( above ) when they found the mammoth
they estimate that the giant had been a fully grown female , around 30 to 40 years old a recent study has suggested that human hunting caused a massive drop in mammoth populations in western europe around 30,000 years ago
just a few isolated populations of mammoth are though to have clung on
dozens of mammoth remains have been unearthed in siberian , including entire skeletons and even mummified bodies still preserved in the ice
the mammoth 's remains were unearthed about 30 miles from the town of nyagan in khanty-mansi , russia vladimir bednyakov ( pictured above ) had been operating the digger when he unearthed the mammoth tusks vladimir bednyakov was operating the excavator when he discovered the latest mammoth
he said : ' i noticed something in the excavator bucket
it turned to be a mammoth tusk
' we have the rule - if we find something , we stop the work and call the bosses
' but i was also interested myself , in what this was
' i took the shovel and began to dig. ... found more remains , the second tusk , teeth and other bones
' woolly mammoths , like the one shown in the artists impression above , lived from about 200,000 years ago until around 4,500 years ago when the last isolated populations are thought to have died out completely
