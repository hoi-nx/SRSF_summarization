horologist mitchell set 16 clocks on landmark buildings to midnight on his last day of work , because he is annoyed that no - one will replace him time is standing still in swansea , because the keeper of the city âs clocks has stopped their hands in protest at the post he has held for 30 years being axed
official horologist mitchell set 16 clocks on landmark buildings to midnight on his last day of winding up their complex workings by hand
the 72 - year - old , who is retiring , has given council chiefs a ticking off for failing to replace him â and says the clocks will have to be left as they are for safety reasons
mr mitchell , who is the only fellow of the british horological institute based in south wales , said he was â really wound up â by the decision
he added : â i have been doing it since 1985 until i finished last week with no one to replace me
i stopped the clocks on safety grounds on saturday
i did nât want the weights falling over on the pulley systems
i was emotional doing my last rounds â except that i was angry with the council
â eight of the clocks are on council - owned buildings , such as the guildhall
however , wales âs second city also has a bye - law that says the council must take responsibility for maintaining eight clocks on private buildings , including st mary and morgans hotel , which dates back more than 100 years
council bosses are arguing that the privately - owned clocks should no longer be their responsibility , and say they intend to purchase an electric winding system to take care of the rest
but mr mitchell said that no action had been taken despite his best efforts to put plans in place for after his retirement
he said : â i even offered to do another year until it was resolved
when i was 65 i was asked to do an extra five years because nobody else would do the job
â i was happy to carry on for a while
i did another year after the extra five , and then another year
the 72 - year - old , who is retiring , wanted to give council chiefs a ticking off for failing to replace him

' i told the churches , out of politeness , and asked them to tell me when the council officially informed them
they have nât informed them
â mr mitchell added : â there is a an old bye - law in swansea which gives the council responsibility for looking after public clocks
â mr mitchell âs rounds also include the clocks on the city âs old police station , the morriston tabernacle , st thomas church and st paul 's church
yesterday , all were pointing to 12 oâclock , much to locals â surprise
cash - strapped swansea council believes private clocks should be cared for by their owners , including church authorities

they say time stands still for no one â but it does for swansea council now
â fellow worker donna cadette , 60 , said : â everyone has mobiles now to check the time anyway but it is a real shame
it is a real shame
â it is part of our history to see the big clocks and to hear the chimes
â meanwhile , cash - strapped swansea council has said that private clocks should be cared for by their owners , including church authorities
it added that it would resume maintenance of clocks in council buildings as soon as possible
a spokesman commented : â we are hopeful we can finalise the latest contract details quite quickly so clocks in council - owned buildings can continue running
â the long - term aim is to install automated winding systems into the council - owned clocks to provide a more efficient solution to reduce future costs
