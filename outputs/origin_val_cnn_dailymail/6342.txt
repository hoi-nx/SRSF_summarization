lads ' mags may have taken off in the mid- 1990s , but some of the many titles that became synonymous with the booming sector had already been around for some time
the likes of fhm and arena had been catering for the male market since the middle of the 1980s and more emerged in the following decade
but although many titles prospered in that era and continue to do so , circulation for some of the best - known magazines started to suffer with the rise of the internet
men 's monthly magazine arena was set up in 1986 with the aim of providing a mix of fashion and style
