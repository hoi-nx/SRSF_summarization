perez was slain with his hands cuffed behind his back , attorney plunkett said
inmate andrew jay arevalo was also handcuffed and ' miraculously survived three shotgun blasts to the face , ' plunkett said
' this is what i clearly consider to be an excessive use of force , ' she said in an email to the associated press
plunkett said she represents andrew jay arevalo , not perez , and plans to sue the guard , prison officials and the state
' this is a terribly tragic and completely unnecessary shooting , ' plunkett said
clark county coroner murphy said wednesday that he ruled perez 's death a homicide from multiple gunshot wounds to the head , neck , chest and arms
murphy noted his ruling meant perez , 28 , died at the hands of another person
it did n't establish fault
nevada prisons chief cox said in a statement issued after the coroner 's ruling became public that andrew jay arevalo and perez were fighting when a guard at high desert state prison opened fire
policy and procedure were followed in contacting the coroner , las vegas police and the prisons inspector general , cox said
the department of corrections director did n't mention handcuffs and did n't identify the guard
but he said the shooter was one of three correctional officers who remain on administrative leave pending completion of a nevada department of investigations report and a review by the state attorney general 's office
patty cafferata , spokeswoman for state attorney general laxalt , said the case will be evaluated and appropriate action will be taken
laxalt 's office also could be called on to defend the state in wrongful - death and excessive - force lawsuits
a spokeswoman for gov. brian sandoval referred questions about the case to cox
perez and andrew jay arevalo were being housed separately in a disciplinary wing , known as ' the hole ' , where inmates are handcuffed behind their backs when they are outside their cells , and no more than one inmate is usually allowed out of a cell at the same time , plunkett said
' procedure was followed because perez and my client were both handcuffed , ' the attorney said
' but procedure was not followed because they were out of their individual cells at the same time
scene : perez and andrew jay arevalo were in the ' hole ' , or administrative segregation , at high desert state prison in indian springs , nevada , in november , when they started fighting
both were handcuffed , but prison guards opened fire on each
perez died and andrew jay arevalo survived plunkett added : ' obviously , in light of the shooting , the procedural violation is the least of the issues
' plunkett said she has talked with an attorney for perez 's family
but she declined to identify the attorney
' this was not a riot , ' plunkett told the las vegas review-journal
' there was no threat to a co. there was not threat to any other inmates
' perez 's younger brother , victor perez , 30 , said the family were not properly told what happened to his sibling
three days after he died , they visited his body in the mortuary and were shocked to see it riddled with bullets
' we had to undress him ourselves to take pictures of his wounds , ' mr perez told the review-journal
' everything was hidden from us
' deputy clark county public defender claudia romney represented perez when he pleaded guilty in december 2012 in las vegas to battery causing substantial bodily harm , but she does n't represent him now
records show that perez was sentenced in february 2013 to 18 months to four years in prison
police said he hit a man in the head with a two - by - four piece of lumber while man was walking with his daughter and son on a downtown las vegas street
perez was previously convicted of felony domestic battery for choking his girlfriend nine months after their baby girl was born
he was sentenced in may 2010 to one to three years in state prison
andrew jay arevalo , 24 , pleaded guilty in june 2013 in las vegas to burglary and was sentenced in august 2013 to two to six years in prison
prisons officials issued a 78 - word statement the day after perez died saying he had been in prison since march 2013 , that an autopsy and investigation would be conducted , and that no further details about his death were available at that time
the statement did n't say perez had been shot or that andrew jay arevalo had been wounded
at the state legislature in carson city , elected officials were surprised wednesday to learn that a prison guard shot and killed an inmate a full 19 weeks earlier
assemblyman ira hansen , r-sparks , chairman of the assembly judiciary committee , said it was the first he heard of the case
assemblyman james ohrenschall , d - las vegas , a committee member , said he wanted to know what happened
' there needs to be more of an investigation , ' said assemblywoman marilyn kirkpatrick , the democratic assembly floor leader .
