it is a stunning sunset - and heralds that for antarctica , winter really is coming
antarctica is moving from 24 - hour daylight to the 24 - hour darkness of winter
in between there is a brief period where the sun does set and rise - and this is the first sunset of 2015
the centre is designed to house between 16 and 52 members of staff , depending on the time of year
a central social hub gives residents the chance to relax and contains a dining room , bar and a gym
as the south pole moves from 24 - hour daylight towards gradual darkness , the british antarctic survey research station on the brunt ice shelf witnesses this year âs first sunset over antarctica for the crew of the french â italian halley research station in antarctica , it means isolation is coming
they are about to be ' locked in ' - and will have to survive six months of complete isolation
to make things worse , four months will be in darkness because the sun never rises above the horizon
called halley vi , it is made up of four - legged modules linked by enclosed walkways
the centre is designed to house between 16 and 52 members of staff , depending on the time of year
a central social hub gives residents the chance to relax and contains a dining room , bar and a gym
a vacuum drainage system keeps water consumption down , and the ski - clad stilts keep the units about 4 metres ( 13 feet ) above the level of the ice
the inside of the centre has been been specially designed to support crew numbers ranging from 52 in the summer to 16 during the three months of total darkness in winter , when temperatures at the base drop as low as -56c
it has triple - glazed windows and a quiet room at the north end of the station is included for residents to contemplate the antarctica environment in peace
this year , esa - sponsored medical doctor beth healey will monitor five experiments that are helping to prepare for long - duration missions to explore our solar system
' living in concordia is similar in many ways to living in space , where crew are cut off from the world without normal sunlight and live in reduced pressure â concordia station lies 3200 m above sea level , ' says the esa
' from searching for life that could survive in these extreme conditions to monitoring how the crew of 13 interact and cope with living in close quarters , beth healey will have her hands full as the crew maintain the station and perform antarctica science for the french and italian polar institutes
' called halley vi , the lab is made up of four - legged modules linked by enclosed walkways
esa signed an agreement this month with the british antarctic survey to perform two of the five concordia experiments at their halley vi station
if this pilot season runs well , esa will extend the cooperation
concordia offers esa scientists a place to investigate how humans adapt to living in isolation and at high altitudes
the crew at halley experience the same isolation and lack of daylight but live at sea level
performing the same investigations at halley will allow researchers to cross one factor off the list that might influence data : air pressure
over the next six months , volunteers at halley and concordia will record themselves in a video diary and have their social interactions monitored
this is working towards objective computer software that will give clues to an astronaut âs state of mind
the halley vi centre , a dismantlable research station created for the british antarctic survey by british architects hugh broughton , was nominated for the world architecture festival awards 2013 ask anybody how they feel and most will reply â fine â but , for mission controllers planning a complex spacewalk or spacecraft docking , having an objective second - opinion could be a lifesaver
the system works by analysing small changes in intonation and grammar , as well as charting how often people talk to each other , to develop an idea of how people feel
the second experiment being run at both sites will test how our eyes adapt to four months of outside darkness and artificial lighting
concordia sunset david vaughan , british antarctic survey âs director of science , concludes : â we are committed to supporting excellent science in antarctica in all disciplines
we are hugely excited to be hosting these new experiments that may help prepare for , perhaps , the biggest adventure in history , a manned flight to mars

during winter the sun stays below the horizon for around four months
a skeleton crew of up to 15 to keep the base running and fend for themselves for nine months
it was built solely for purpose , to enable scientists to live comfortably as they carry out vital research work in the freezing cold antarctica
but thanks to its strikingly futuristic appearance , the halley vi centre has been causing quite a stir in architectural circles , and it has now been nominated for a prestigious global award
in a textbook example of form following function , british architect firm hugh broughton created the series of four - legged pods , seven of them blue and one red , which stand on moving ice and can be raised to keep them above the snow which builds up
the halley vi centre consists of series of four - legged pods which stand on moving ice and can be raised to keep them above the snow which builds up the dismantlable research station , which few fans of design will ever get to see unless they venture to the antarctica wilderness , is among the nominees for the world architecture festival awards 2013
halley vi is the sixth facility to occupy the site on the brunt ice shelf - a floating sheet of ice about 10 miles ( 16 kilometres ) from the edge of the south atlantic
most of the previous stations were crushed under the weight of the polar snow , while halley v had to be abandoned due to fears that the station would be lost if the ice sheet split apart , said survey spokesman paul seagrove
solitude : antarctica is the most isolated place on earth - but its remote location means the scientists have been able to see the stunning aurora australis home from home : the modules include house labs , a dining room , a bar and a gym linked : the scientists do not need to go outside to move between modules as they will be joined together by walkways
