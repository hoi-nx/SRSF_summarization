the duchess of cambridge was all smiles as she met the families of brave men and women killed in afghanistan following a commemoration service at st. paul 's cathedral today
kate , who is eight months pregnant , also provoked a smile or two from those around her , when she appeared to grimace as her unborn child kicked her as she made her way out of the cathedral
the 33 - year - old was accompanied by the queen and other senior members of the royal family for the ceremony at st. paul 's cathedral in london , which was also attended by veterans and family members of the soldiers who died
by this point , kate has totally mastered the art of looking put - together and ladylike ( as if she had any other choice ! )
there 's a reason why her outfits are endlessly replicated everywhere
of course , being royalty has something to do with it , but apart from that , kate has majorly enviable style so its understandable why so many people want to get a piece of it to call their own
as every pregnant woman knows , it 's next to impossible to look chic and structured as your belly comes in , but kate pulls it off with ease ! the duchess of cambridge 's coat is amazingly still available over at beulah london for close to one grand

earlier , kate had appeared moved as she sat beside husband william and his brother harry to hear the tributes paid to the 453 men and women who died while serving in afghanistan
the service was held to mark the end of combat operations in afghanistan after 13 years , with the final british battalions pulled out and sent home last autumn
harry , who served two tours of duty in the country , looked particularly solemn as prime minister david cameron spoke of the ' outstanding bravery ' of the men and women who fought

the princess royal , who looked wonderful in her military uniform and cockade hat , was also at the service and , afterwards , travelled back to gloucestershire for the final day of the cheltenham festival
during the service , a cross made of shell casings from the memorial at the main allied base in afghanistan , camp bastion was brought through the cathedral by representatives of the three forces and presented at the altar
officer cadet noor aziz , from the royal military academy at sandhurst , read a recital before the archbishop of canterbury blessed the camp bastion cross for its new memorial at the royal british legion 's national memorial arboretum in staffordshire

they marched in silence past st paul 's accompanied by military bands and pipes and drums , with prince charles taking the royal salute , through the centre of london to guildhall
