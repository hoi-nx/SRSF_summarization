glasgow 's chances of hosting great britain âs davis cup quarter - final against france appear to be on rise following initial talks with the lta
although andy murray immediately expressed a desire to play the july tie on a grass court , the fact that neither wimbledon nor the queen âs club will be available is believed to be pushing decision makers towards a return to the emirates arena
andy murray celebrates extravagantly during his straight sets win over john isner on sunday great britain supporters would relish supporting murray and co in glasgow again in july all three day 's of davis cup action at the emirates arena were sold out in a matter of minutes the only available outdoor grass arena with a big enough capacity is in eastbourne - but neither the players nor captain smith are keen on playing at a venue renowned for a lack of atmosphere
the noise and passion of the scottish crowd played a huge part in the weekend win over the usa , sparking a debate within the lta over whether that x factor may outweigh any disadvantage that comes from not playing on grass
while andy murray prefers it to the indoor hard court , he would be favourite to beat any of his france opponents on any surface â while british no 2 james ward is actually better when he moves on to the artificial surface , potentially the decisive factor when the final call is made
gb captain smith doubts the chances of glasgow being able to create a larger grass - court venue smith embraces with andy murray after the latter 's straight sets win secured gb 's quarter - final berth andy murray ( middle ) is looked on in envy by his fellow gb team - mates after securing a tie against france sportsmail understands that the city authorities are willing to leave the july 17 - 19 dates clear in the hope of getting the nod over the coming week or so
unfortunately , because it takes about a week to set up the court , a bette midler concert would rule out taking the quarter - final to the hydro , the city âs biggest indoor venue
but a return to the emirates , which hosted over 21,000 fans over three days , is very much on the cards
although no one from glasgow life would comment on their plans yesterday , a spokesman said : â the atmosphere at the weekend was electric and glasgow proved , once again , why we are one of the world âs top sporting cities
any decision on hosting future davis cup ties would be for the lta
