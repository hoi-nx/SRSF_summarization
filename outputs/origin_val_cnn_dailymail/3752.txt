dozens of cheap and popular southern california wines are tainted with dangerously high levels of arsenic , claims a new lawsuit filed this week
sutter home , korbel , franzia and trader joe 's charles shaw , also known as ' two-buck chuck , ' were just a few of the 31 wine brands the lawsuit claimed were unsafe
twenty - eight southern california wineries were listed in the complaint , which is asking for a halt in production of the wines in question
kabateck said 83 wines , almost all of which sell for below $ 10 a bottle , contained arsenic levels 10 parts per billion above the range considered safe for drinking water
the environmental protection agency standard for drinking water is 10 parts per billion - meaning that the tests allegedly found arsenic levels that were double the federal drinking water standard
' this is a very serious public health concern , ' kabateck said
' we would hope the wine industry would take these wines off the shelf immediately
' ' if not voluntarily , we would ask the court to do it
' the us does not have a set standard for safe levels of arsenic in wine , according to the san francisco chronicle
the lawsuit claims 83 of the 1,306 wines that were tested contained arsenic levels 10 parts per billion above the range considered safe for drinking water but wines are allowed to have arsenic levels up to 100 parts per billion in canada - and other countries allow even higher levels
the institute , an advocacy group for southern california wineries , called the lawsuit ' misleading ' and ' false '
according to institute spokeswoman gladys horiuchi , southern california wines have never come close to exceeding the arsenic levels that are accepted in other countries , she told the associated press
in a release statement , the institute said arsenic was ' prevalent in the natural environment ' and that ' no research ' had found the amounts in wine to ' pose a health risk to consumers '
the lawsuit specifies the wines contained ' inorganic arsenic , ' which is more toxic than the arsenic found naturally in the environment
chronic long - term consumption of inorganic arsenic can cause cancer , as well as liver and kidney damage
but a number of wine producers have fought back at the lawsuit and said they plan to contest the claims
a trader trader joe 's spokesman said the grocery store chain had ' no reason to believe the wines we offer are unsafe , including charles shaw white zinfandel '
korbel said the lawsuit was ' without merit , ' adding that the company plans to challenge the allegations
the 83 bottles of wine cited in a lawsuit this week as having dangerously high levels of arsenic came from 28 southern california wineries and were bottled under 31 different brand labels
some of the labels included several different types of wine
