the special bond between a severely disabled boy and his dog has been recognised at crufts
rescue dog miracle beat off 200 other entrants to scoop the prestigious friends for life award
the crossbreed was saved from thailand 's illegal dog meat trade a couple of years ago and adopted by amanda leask from strathglass , scotland , and her six year old son kyle
luckily for miracle , the truck carrying him to his death was intercepted by agents working for the phuket - based animal welfare charity soi dog foundation
the dogs were taken to a purpose - built shelter in thailand , where they were then put up for adoption
amanda leask spotted miracle âs photo shortly after he âd been rescued on a soi dog facebook post
miracle ( seen here hanging over the crowded pet cages ) was destined for dog meat restaurants in vietnam when he was saved by the animal welfare charity soi dog foundation devastated by his plight and the hopelessness of his situation , she enquired about adopting him
already an owner of three rescue dogs from soi dog foundation , amanda leask very soon had her fourth
and while miracle quickly got to work returning the favour to his new owner by creating a powerful bond with her son kyle that transformed the young boy 's life
kyle was born with cerebral palsy , and was later diagnosed with autism
his condition means that it is incredibly difficult for him to communicate with his family
after learning that autistic people can develop extremely close relationships with canine pets , amanda leask decided to adopt some dogs
kyle and miracle have since developed a close bond , which amanda leask says reveals an unspoken mutual understanding
amanda leask ( pictured here with miracle and kyle ) says there is an ' unspoken language ' between the hound and her disabled son she said : ' they âve both faced so much hardship in their lives , it âs like there âs an unspoken language between them
' when kyle gets upset because he ca nât convey what he wants to , miracle will go and lay at his side for kyle to touch and stroke
' miracle seems to automatically know when kyle needs him
' ' if kyle simply wants some attention , miracle will go over and shower him with kisses , and it works the other way too
' amanda leask adopted miracle after seeing his photograph on a soi dog facebook post - he has now made a full recovery she continued : ' kids can build up confidence in dogs where they seek solace , and miracle gets this in abundance from kyle
' the unique bond between man and dog is still yet to be explained fully but amanda leask says the amount it has helped kyle is unlimited
she said : ' he seems so much happier in the presence of miracle
' it âs like they âre soul mates
' miracle won Â£ 1,500 for his crufts eukaneba friends for life award , and amanda leask will share the money between soi dog foundation and the autistic society .
