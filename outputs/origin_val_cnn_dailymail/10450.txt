miliband âs flagship plan to cut university tuition fees to Â£ 6,000 will not help bright youngsters from poor homes , britain âs biggest anti-poverty group warned last night
in a scathing assessment , the left - leaning joseph rowntree foundation said the labour leader âs vow to bring down fees from Â£ 9,000 â sounds progressive â¦ but sadly it is nât â
the charity said there were â better ways â to use the Â£ 3billion - a - year cost of the policy to help the poor , such as increasing spending on sixth - form colleges in poorer areas
coming under fire from left : the joseph rowntree foundation has criticised miliband âs flagship plan to cut university tuition fees to Â£ 6,000 it also pointed out that because low - paid graduates eventually have their fees written off , the policy would â mainly benefit mid to high - earning graduates who âd otherwise have been repaying all or most of their loans â
also , there was â no evidence â the rise in fees under the coalition had hit the level of applications from poorer students , said the foundation , which added : â even if poorer students are put off , there is no evidence that these students would be much less deterred by fees of Â£ 6,000 than Â£ 9,000
â the biggest factor preventing young people from poorer backgrounds from going to university is that the majority do not get good enough results at school to even attempt it
â launching the policy last week , mr miliband said he was determined to keep the pledge he first made in 2011
the tories have opened a three point lead over labour in a poll
they are up to 34 per cent with labour on 31 in the survey from former tory deputy chairman ashcroft
last week âs ashcroft poll had labour in the lead
the new poll shows 42 per cent of voters believe britain would be burdened with more debt under a labour government
for the tories it is 11 per cent
labour is well ahead on improving the nhs
he insisted poorer students would benefit , adding : â the scourge of debt from tuition fees is not only holding back our young people , it is a burden on our country
â but the proposal has been condemned as â financially illiterate â by experts
university vice-chancellors are sceptical that a labour government would make up the shortfall in fees
and many in mr miliband âs inner circle fear his plan for a Â£ 3billion - a - year raid on the pensions of the better - off to fund his eye - catching initiative will cost the party votes
former labour leadership contender diane abbott told lbc radio yesterday : â i think it âs generally understood that miliband was the person in his shadow cabinet who felt most strongly about doing something on tuition fees
â at a people âs question time event in brighton yesterday , mr miliband was accused of â electioneering â by a member of the public , who identified herself only as francesca
launching the policy last week , mr miliband said he was determined to keep the pledge he first made in 2011 she told him : â i would like to know why you are cutting the tuition fees in the light that a record number of students from poorer backgrounds are applying to university
' and also the fact that it âs middle - class , better - off students who are going to be paying less
â the only conclusion i can get to is that it smacks of electioneering
