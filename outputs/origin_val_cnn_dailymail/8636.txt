these kaleidoscopic photographs show the inside of the colourful crayola factory which produces around 12million crayons every day
photographer bryan derballa , 32 , captured the incredible crayon - making process during a visit to the factory in easton , pennsylvania
crayola , which was founded in 1885 , uses a complicated production line to make the iconic colouring sticks
mr bryan derballa 's pictures provide a fascinating glimpse into the creation of the crayons which certainly take many of us back to our childhoods
here , crayons are separated and funnelled into boxes a rotary table moulds coloured paraffin into wax crayons at the factory in easton
excess wax is caught by a scraper blade and recycled a mixing kettle full of paraffin and orange powdered pigment is stirred up before being moulded into crayons at the crayola factory in easton the photographer , from new york , said he walked for miles as he photographed the manufacturing process
he said : ' the factory was massive
i probably walked a couple of miles during the course of our shoot just moving from one end of the factory to the other
' that does n't even include the storage and shipping departments that we saw but did n't really cover
his pictures show a silo , which contains 100,000lbs of uncoloured paraffin wax and is heated and moved to mixing kettles
powdered pigment is then added to create a colour
the coloured liquid is then pumped into a water - cooled mould , before it is ejected through crayon - shaped cavities and sent for labelling

finally , the boxes are date coded and checked via a metal detector , which confirms there are only crayons inside
mr bryan derballa added : ' i loved the mixing kettles where the pigment is mixed with the melted wax - they were these beautiful vats of molten colour
' one of the best parts of this shoot was how earnest and innocent it all was
' and the smell of paraffin brought me back to my childhood
