ryan coward , 23 , lived at the home in salford with his parents and brother before he was jailed for 32 months for being ' concerned in the supply of cannabis ' neighbours living near the explosion described the booming blast as the ' loudest thing they have ever heard ' with one adding he felt furniture in his house shake another said : ' i heard a huge explosion , and i thought a bomb had gone off in the street
it was just so so loud
' detective chief inspector clare devlin from greater manchester police said : ' while we are only in the early stages of our investigation , we believe this was a targeted attack and can confirm that a hand grenade was used
hand grenades were used by dale cregan in the murders of pcs fiona bone and fiona bone , and short in 2012 ' clearly this is something we are taking extremely seriously and i am sure people in the area will be hugely shocked by this news
' there are a large number of officers dedicated to investigating exactly what has taken place here and they will also be speaking to residents in the local area today and over the coming days
' thankfully no one was injured during this attack , although the occupants of the address are understandably extremely distressed
' make no mistake that we are going to find out exactly what has gone on here and why , and catch those responsible
this kind of violent behaviour on the streets of salford will simply not be tolerated
' it comes after a wave of stabbings in the surrounding area which saw one 29 - year - old man slashed multiple times with a machete
hand grenades were used by dale cregan in the murders of pcs fiona bone and fiona bone , and short in 2012
dale cregan gunned down mr short outside his home in clayton , greater manchester , in august that year before he threw a grenade at him - the first time a military grenade had been deployed in the country in that way
while on the run for the murders of mr short and his son , mark , whom he gunned down in a pub in may , dale cregan lured the two policewomen to an address in hattersley with a bogus 999 call in september
after shooting the pair , he left his ' calling card ' of an m75 grenade , which he threw on to the path where the two officers lay
a bag containing 10 m75 grenades from the former yuglosavia was found in a storm drain in glodwick , oldham , in 2013
following the discovery , greater manchester police said they believed they had recovered all the grenades from dale cregan 's batch
m75 grenades were also reported to have been used in several attacks by an underworld crime gang in merseyside
greater manchester police discovered this stash of grenades inside a storm drain during dale cregan 's 17 - week trial
