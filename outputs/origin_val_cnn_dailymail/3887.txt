the partner of chelsea star fabregas today won her family division battle with her ex-husband over the alleged cut price sale of their luxury london home to the footballer
property tycoon taktouk claimed the Â£ 5.5million sale of the family home in central london to a company owned by fabregas was at least Â£ 2million under value and sued his ex-wife semaan for compensation
but deputy judge richard snowden qc said such a claim ' has no real prospect of success ' and dismissed it
he said the claim ' is yet another court battle between mr taktouk and ms semaan arising out of the breakdown of their marriage in 2011 which led to their acrimonious divorce in 2013
' fabregas 's girlfriend , semaan ( left with chelsea player ) , has won a family division battle with her ex-husband , taktouk ( right ) after she sold her former marital home to the footballer the judge said mr tartouk still owed ms semaan nearly Â£ 1million of a lump sum in a divorce order and legal costs of more than Â£ 500,000
ms semaan , 39 , is currently pregnant with fabregas 's second daughter
they already have toddler , lia , born in 2013
in january last year , family division judge mr justice coleridge gave the go - ahead for the sale of the former family home in belgravia to a spanish firm zirrintza owned by mr fabregas
in a preceding hearing , mr taktouk had claimed the property was being sold at ' significant undervalue ' , claiming it was worth up to Â£ 10million and at least Â£ 7million
but in allowing the sale , the judge said mr taktouk ' has a history of lacking credibility '
deputy judge snowden said he had failed in a bid to appeal a previous ruling and had now launched these new proceedings
but he still owed his lebanese born ex-wife almost Â£ 1million ordered to be paid as part of a Â£ 1.4million lump sum in divorce proceedings , the court heard
ms semaan originally hooked up with fabregas in spain when he played with barcelona and she took her two children , aged 14 and 10 , by mr taktouk with her
a row centred on a property in this london street , where ms semaan and mr tartouk used to live ms semaan flew to spain to be with fabregas when he played for barcelona
they have since had a daughter they returned to london last summer after the player 's Â£ 27million move to chelsea
in a previous case , mr justice coleridge ordered the sale of the grade ii listed flat in april 2013 when mr taktouk was ordered to pay his ex wife Â£ 1.4million to buy a new home
he claimed that if mr fabregas bought the former home she would end up staying there and have Â£ 1.4million in the bank
he also claimed a higher price was achievable
also in april 2013 , mr taktouk lost his bid to appeal against the financial settlement when he claimed that fabregas would be keeping her in the future
the judge said taktouk was financed by his wealthy father
since then mr taktouk and his father undertook to pay a total of Â£ 680,000 owing in legal costs in a series of lump sum payments
the court heard Â£ 250,000 had been paid , but the balance with additional costs taking it over Â£ 500,000 are still to be paid
in dismissing his claim the judge said mr taktouk was seeking to argue the same points which had already been ruled on
mr taktouk and ms semaan married 15 years ago when they were both 24 and living in lebanon
a company owned by fabregas , who moved back to london to play for chelsea last year , bought the house
