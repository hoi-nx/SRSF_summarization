daley blind 's only previous visit to anfield came as a wide - eyed 10 - year - old when his footballing father danny secured tickets for a game against arsenal from jari litmanen , a former team - mate who had signed for liverpool
among the players on view were steven gerrard , michael owen and thierry henry
' it left a great impression on me , ' said daley blind
' as a young boy from holland who loved football , i just took everything in
the crowd noise and atmosphere were crazy
it was a special day
' at lunchtime on sunday , blind will return to anfield for the first time with his new manchester united team - mates
this year 's clash carries even greater significance than usual with a champions league place at stake and for blind it carries on the family tradition of being involved in big matches
daley blind ( right ) will play at anfield for the first time with manchester united on sunday afternoon daley blind is enjoying his time in manchester but admits he had to adapt to the pace of the premier league the 25 - year - old scores his first goal for manchester united to salvage a 2 - 2 draw against west brom in october last year his father played 42 times for holland and was captain of ajax 's legendary 1995 champions league - winning side alongside patrick kluivert , edgar davids and edwin van der sar
it was a first major triumph for an emerging manager called louis van gaal who clearly likes the blind family
almost two decades later , he selected daley for holland 's world cup team last summer and then signed him for manchester united in a Â£ 14million deal from ajax
it has been an eventful debut in the premier league for both of them
manchester united 's results have been far better than last season when they finished seventh under david moyes
they visit anfield having lost just twice in 19 league games
at the same time , their performances until last weekend 's 3 - 0 victory against tottenham had been patchy with new signings like angel di maria and radamel falcao struggling
blind has been a steadying influence , his versatility useful as van gaal has tried to juggle injuries and suspensions
the 25 - year - old has been used mostly as a holding midfielder but with michael carrick returning last weekend , he switched to left back as manchester united turned in their best performance of the season
daley blind says his manager is essentially the same person in england as when he took holland to the world cup semi-final
blind talks with his dad , holland coach danny , during a training session at last summer 's world cup in brazil the holland international believes he is similar to his dad when out on the football pitch blind , pictured alongside radamel falcao , was one of a number of summer signings made by louis van gaal blind screams with delight after curling the ball into the bottom corner of boaz myhill 's net at the hawthorns ' people only think he 's intimidating because he is honest
he is honest to people , ' explained daley blind
' yeah , sometimes the truth can be hard to some players or people
but i really like that in a person and especially in a manager
' every player knows their job , what they have to do in training and matches
it is very clear and i think that makes everything a bit easier for players
as a team we believe in his philosophy
' it is a good feeling for a player if you know where you stand
sometimes it can be a bit frightening when somebody is really honest but i think it is positive
i do n't get any special treatment , definitely not
i make mistakes , too , and i try to learn when he says something
it can look as if he is angry but he is trying to make you better
he does that from a football perspective , it 's not personal
he treats everybody the same
' in keeping with manchester united 's season , blind has experienced highs and lows
a knee injury that kept him out for six weeks in the autumn was frustrating
when fit , he has weighed in with important goals at west brom and west ham and last week was vital in the tottenham win , with luke shaw and marcos rojo unavailable
it was seen as a return to the old , swashbuckling manchester united
blind does n't think it 's that simple
he believes manchester united did n't change their approach much , the major difference was getting two early goals
manchester united boss louis van gaal has tried to implement his own philosophy at old trafford this season louis van gaal is pictured with danny blind and ajax chairman michael van praag back in 1994 blind , pictured in action against tottenham , has proved his versatility under van gaal this season danny blind leads his son out during his ajax days ( left ) and lifts the champions league trophy in 1995 the dutchman looks dejected alongside wayne rooney and tyler blackett during defeat by leicester ' everything came together
we tried to play attacking football
but there were still moments we used david de gea to switch play or had to show patience
but of course when you are leading 3 - 0 at half time it is a lot easier because the fans are excited
i think we have played better and better in recent weeks , against tottenham maybe we did it for longer
' the cries of ' attack , attack ' heard from manchester united fans this season are meant to lift the players
but daley blind says the team have to use their heads in matches , too
' of course , you go on the pitch feeling you want to win
every game is difficult in the premier league , you have to be also smart in the games
' sometimes you need to have composure
against tottenham , we attacked them in the first half
then in the second half , we let them come at us a bit more and played from there
i think we can play different styles
' that adaptability is one of the reasons van gaal signed blind rather than any other member of his dutchman world cup squad
he has proved invaluable in a season where manchester united have suffered an unprecedented number of injuries and said : ' i think i am a player who can switch really fast in my mind
for me , it is not an issue where to play
i know what you have to do in each position
i think it is an advantage for me
' blind has been particularly impressed with manchester united 's travelling support since joining the club blind ( back row , second from right ) left ajax for old trafford in a Â£ 14million deal late last summer the former ajax man was a key part of van gaal 's squad as holland reached the world cup semi-finals danny blind and his son pose in front of christ the redeemer in rio during the 2014 world cup in brazil van gaal described daley 's father as the best leader he 's ever had â some claim when he has managed at bayern munich and barcelona
daley says he has inherited characteristics from both parents
' i think on the pitch i am more like my dad
calm and thinking about stuff
off the pitch with my friends , i am more like my mum
she says things straight away , very direct
i can speak sometimes without thinking
' i was five when my dad won the champions league
i ca n't remember watching it live on the television but , growing up , i saw all the videos and dreamed it might be me one day
i am proud of his achievements and proud to carry the name blind
' i guess i must have seen louis van gaal as a boy when i 'd go to watch my father train but i ca n't remember anything specific
i first got to know him with the dutchman team
' when louis van gaal tells me things , i think it might be the same advice he used to give my father ! ' daley and danny also work together with their national team where danny is a coach and tipped to be manager
' sometimes i prefer to speak to the other trainers , ' laughs the younger blind
' if he 's close by , i might whisper " dad "
the other players think it 's funny , they accept it
' danny is also a regular visitor to watch his son play at old trafford but wo n't be at anfield on sunday afternoon
daley blind netted another late equaliser for manchester united in their 1 - 1 draw at west ham in february marouane fellaini celebrates with his team - mate blind after his crucial strike at upton park daley blind only knew compatriot robin van persie and andreas pereira before he joined manchester united last summer off the field , daley has settled in well and chosen to live in a city - centre apartment rather than a sprawling footballers ' wives pad in cheshire
' i like people around me and everything within walking distance , ' he says
' occasionally people want to take a picture on the street but that 's not a problem
i liked amsterdam and i like manchester , they suit me
' it also gives blind peace of mind that his girlfriend is in a safe environment when he is away with the manchester united squad
for someone who knew only two of manchester united 's players when he arrived â national team - mate robin van persie and youngster andreas pereira , who started his career in holland â blind has acclimatised well
one of his social objectives is to try to find time to restart golf lessons
he has been in england nearly eight months now
' the best thing for me is the amount of away fans that follow manchester united
the stands are always full , it was a big surprise when i first saw that , ' he said
' on the pitch , the pace and power of matches was new for me , box - to - box
my first game at home to qpr was n't the quickest but i still felt more tired than after any ajax match
when we played at manchester city and had a red card ( chris smalling ) , wow , the intensity but i think i coped well
' if a problem does arise , his manager is an important safety net
' he is personal , any player can always reach him if they want to , ' he says
and the result when daley blind visited anfield just over 14 years ago ? liverpool lost 2 - 1
a repeat on sunday would leave manchester united with one foot firmly in the champions league
like father , like son .
