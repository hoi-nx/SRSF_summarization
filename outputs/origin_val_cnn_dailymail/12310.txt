chelsea 's good week continued when the blues beat west ham 1 - 0 in the english premier league to maintain a five - point lead over manchester city atop the table
chelsea manager jose mourinho -- who picked up another trophy sunday in the league cup final -- had never lost to west ham in the top flight and belgian attacker hazard ensured three more points when he netted in the first half wednesday at the west ham ' upton park
" the game was very difficult , " hazard told sky
" one big battle against a good team with very good players
" it 's always difficult when you do n't score the second goal to kill the game
but one goal was enough
it 's not always like this
" the goalkeeper , the defense we have are very strong
" chelsea keeper thibaut courtois made a string of good saves in the second half but west ham boss allardyce lamented his team 's finishing -- plus the refereeing
he felt hazard 's goal was offside
" when you look back on the season and they say these things even themselves out , that 's the biggest load of rubbish i 've ever heard , " the under pressure allardyce told sky
nigel pearson , manager of last - place leicester , also felt aggrieved after his team lost 2 - 0 to reigning league champion manchester city
leicester did n't get a penalty when manchester city striker wilfried bony appeared to foul jeff schlupp in the box in the first half or when fernando fouled andrej kramaric in the second
leicester struck the woodwork , too

the win was " very important because it was a very difficult week with two bad results against liverpool and barcelona , " said city manager manuel pellegrini , who rested club captain vincent kompany

manchester united claimed all three points at newcastle when ashley young took advantage of keeper tim krul 's error in the 89th minute ; arsenal doubled third - last qpr 2 - 1 ; surging liverpool shut out second - last burnley 2 - 0 ; and league cup finalist spurs defeated swansea 3 - 2 in a game overshadowed by french striker bafetimbi gomis collapsing to the turf
manchester united defender evans might have been fortunate to escape unpunished at st. james ' park , since he appeared to spit in striker cisse 's direction when they clashed in the first half
cisse then appeared to spit back at evans
arsenal remained third , with manchester united in fourth on 53 points , two better than liverpool , four better than southampton and six better than spurs , who have a game in hand
