it is a job that would move the most mild - mannered soul to explode in a malcolm tucker-esque burst of coarse cussing a dozen times a day
if you ca nât deal with a steady stream of frustrations , do nât ever move into coaching - it âll break your heart * and * send you halfway round the twist
take vern cotter âs experiences yesterday
he âs picked his xv to take on england at twickenham , the toughest test of this exasperating six nations campaign
vern cotter has had a difficult time of things , with alex dunbar picking up a late injury before saturday 's game coach vern cotter said the 24 - year - old centre alex dunbar had played a key role in the scotland xv he âs watching the boys run through their paces in the final training session before catching a lunchtime flight to london , when alex dunbar â without another player within touching distance â changes direction and crumples to the turf
suddenly one of his key men , a wrecking ball in attack and a bear in defence , is out not just of tomorrow âs calcutta cup clash , but the rest of this season â possibly including the rugby world cup
stern vern has to move from barking orders to comforting a young man facing up to a potential six months in rehab
if he did nât believe in voodoo , hoodoos , juju and jinxes before he took the scotland gig â¦ â we âre a team who do nât get things easy , â said vern cotter , looking more than a little shaken by the turn of events
â it âs another example of it
â it âs the kind of thing that can happen any time , of course
i will give you an example
thursday training when i was in charge at clermont , we had finished , i âd blown my whistle
wesley and jason were running , laughing , wesley tackles jason and breaks his leg
these are just the things that happen , unfortunately
â vern cotter âs declaration that the squad may be brought closer together by the sudden loss of alex dunbar - his team - mates moved to win one for the gipper , so to speak - is understandable
it does no - one any good to start tearing cloth and weeping over the absence of one player , however influential
matt scott has ability and form enough to deputise , definitely , while recalls for jim hamilton at lock and david denton at no8 should help scotland in their bid to do something pretty ambitious â out - england the english big men
alex dunbar , here showing his disappointment after scotland 's loss to wales , awaits results of scans on his knee how england and scotland will line up for saturday 's calcutta cup clash â england are a big physical team and they play a very percentage - orientated game , based on occupation , field position and a strong pack , â said vern cotter
â they also have very good finishers in their team , strong runners , line breakers
so they are a team based around their power , their line - out and their scrum
â we âve been looking at trying to compete â and put them under pressure in what they consider to be their strong points
hopefully if we can contest there and keep the game as tight as possible for as long as possible , you never know
â ireland got on top of them around the rucks and i think they will be more aggressive in that area to get the go - forward they did nât get against ireland
ireland shut down their passing game and got them into an arm wrestle
â defensively , ireland played very well against them and did nât let them put in several passes
they will have worked on how to counter those tactics
first and foremost , we look at our contact zone and our set piece
we have to be able to adapt
â we also need to be better in the air
we have known that since the start of the six nations
we know that they use the ball in the air a fair bit
â jim hamilton is there for his experience
he knows their players very well and i think he may be able to unsettle them with his individual knowledge
he is there to give us that solid base at scrum and lineout
â dougie fife wins just his fifth cap on the right wing , given the chance partly due to a sean maitland injury but also because vern cotter likes â his energy , enthusiasm , his kick - chase , â adding : â he is a young player who is strong , creates line breaks and is a finisher as well
it was tight , but we think his energy , especially in the aerial game , will be important
â alex dunbar faces a race against time to be fit for the rugby world cup after injuring his knee at training vern cotter spoke in the aftermath of the home defeat to italy about the brutal honesty required in order to fix the problems so obviously exposed , although he plays down any notion that he âs been tearing his players limb from metaphorical limb this week
instead , he says that suffering that late loss might even be of long - term benefit to his squad , pointing out : â we were two minutes away from lauding the character of a young team for getting out of a tough situation with a scrum penalty
â in a lot of ways it has been a bit of a blessing because we can really look in depth at things that may have been ignored or smoothed over
we have had a good look at ourselves
the coaches , the players , everybody
â addressing those promises of a bloody inquest into the worst performance of the campaign , he added : â those things are always a little exaggerated
we were just very clear on what we want to see and what we expect
we need to learn from certain things
that was the theme behind this week âs training
â this weekend , there is the calcutta cup and the result two weeks ago
that means there has been more of an edge to training
it is always nice to have an objective
â we are two days away from playing for something that we could bring home
it has been a few years since scotland won at twickenham
no one is giving us much of a chance
but we will be measuring our improvements from two weeks ago and those things will help us develop our game and become more competitive
â hardly a rousing cri de coeur aimed at whipping his men into a frenzy
but , then , maybe he âs saving all his fired - up frustrations for the pre-match address
as the six nations rolls on to the penultimate weekend of the campaign , vern cotter may have enough fuel left to strip the paint from the walls of twickenham .
