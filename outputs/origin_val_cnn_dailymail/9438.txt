the devastated parents of a new zealand man , jailed for making a joke about buddha , have revealed the horrific conditions their son is suffering through in a myanmar prison
wellington - based brian and blackwood have launch an online petition to campaign for philip backwood 's freedom , insisting that their son and his colleagues have been unjustly convicted
they have revealed their pain they feel as they can not help their son , who is being subjected to the brutal conditions inside yangon 's notorious insein prison
he has been sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment
he has been held in the jail since his arrest in december
' he sleeps on a wooden pallet , no bedding is allowed , no mattress , no pillow , ' brian told abc
he is only allowed to see his fiancÃ© noemi alamo and their seven - month - old daughter for an hour every fortnight
blackwood and his two myanmar colleagues were sentenced to two and a half years in jail for using a buddha image to promote a cheap drinks two weeks ago the bar manager and his two myanmar colleagues were jailed for two and a half years with hard labour by a yangon court for using a buddha image to promote a cheap drinks night
however , blackwood 's hard labour penalty has been lifted as he is a foreigner
the ad posted on facebook in december caused a stir of outrage in the former junta - ruled country , where surging buddhist nationalism and religious violence has sparked international concern
philip blackwood , who worked at the vgastro bar in yangon , was found guilty of insulting religion , after the new zealander posted a mocked - up photo of the buddha wearing dj headphones on facebook â in reference to a well - known international club brand
the three convicted men have the support of a number of human rights groups , including amnesty international and human rights
the group have condemned the court 's ruling and called for the unconditional release of mr. philip blackwood and his colleagues
' it is ludicrous that these three men have been jailed simply for posting an image online to promote a bar , ' a spokesperson for amnesty international in asia and the pacific said
â they should be immediately and unconditionally released
â according to international commission of jurists in the asia and pacific , the conviction violates mynamar 's own legal standards
' the conviction violates international standards for imprisoning people for speech ( and ) seems to violate myanmar âs own legal standards which require intent
' blackwood 's loved ones are fighting to help alleviate some of blackwood 's struggles during his sentence
' he has a hole in the ground for a toilet and he has a bucket of water that he washes in , keeps himself tidy with
' he is only given broth and rice to eat
' i do n't believe that we understand half of what he is suffering
' mr philip blackwood leaves court after being sentenced to two and half years in prison
he was found guilty of insulting buddhism blackwood , the manager of vgastro bar in yangon , was arrested after posting a promotional image of a psychedelic buddha wearing headphones to the bar 's facebook page blackwood 's parents worry for their son 's physical and mental health , as he tries to withstand the heat and poor hygiene
they are particularly concerned as their son suffers from a chest condition and from asthma
the 32 - year - old was arrested by myanmar police in december , along with owner tun thurein , 40 , and manager ko ko lwin , 26 , after an official from myanmar 's religious department complained about the advertising
the bar has since been shuttered - up
the harsh conviction comes despite philip blackwood and mrs blackwood 's insistence that ' the judge 's ruling that the three had ' intentionally plotted to insult religious belief ' was not founded on any concrete evidence at all
' mr. philip blackwood did not have legal representation when he was charged , nor did he have any interpreter to explain what was going on , ' the petition reads
' three months later , they were found guilty , despite prosecution not having established intent on the side of the three accused

the trio could face two years in jail for breaching myanmar 's religion act in emotional scenes after the verdict , family members of the two myanmar defendants expressed shock and fury at the sentencing , with the mother of one exchanging barbs with a handful of nationalist monks waiting outside
the case has been watched closely by international observers amid fears that the buddhist - majority country , which has seen a surge in foreign investment since it began emerging from the grip of the military in 2011 , is seeing its much - lauded reforms stalling
the trio were also held responsible for protests that erupted outside the bar over the image
judge ye lwin said that while blackwood , 32 , had posted an apology , he had ' intentionally plotted to insult religious belief ' when he uploaded the photo
he added that although the new zealander had admitted to posting the picture without intending to offend , it was also ' unreasonable only to blame the foreigner ' when explaining the guilty verdicts for the myanmar defendants
htut ko ko lwin 's mother screamed at a group of monks taking photos with smartphones outside the court after the sentencing
the wife of bar owner tun thurein said she would consult her lawyer about appealing
' they just decided everybody is guilty so i 'm very shocked
this is very unfair , ' myat nandar said
blackwood made no comment as he was bundled into the back of a police truck through a scrum of media cameras
myanmar has been rocked by several deadly outbreaks of religious violence in recent years , mainly targeting the muslim minority
the bloodshed has coincided with the rising influence of hardline monks , who have advocated controversial new laws
rights groups say these would severely curb the freedom of religious minorities and women
v gastro bar , which opened just two weeks before the incident , swiftly deleted the offending image and posted this apology on its facebook page phil robertson , deputy asia director of human rights , said tuesday 's sentences showed ' freedom of expression is under greater threat than ever ' in myanmar , which is gearing up for crucial elections later this year
' the authorities should accept the heartfelt public apology of the three men , vacate the conviction , and order them to be released immediately and unconditionally , ' he said in a statement
blackwood 's parents told fairfax media from their new zealand home that they were shocked by the decision and their son would consider an appeal
' we hoped common sense would prevail and he would be found not guilty because it was not a malicious or intentional act ... ' said father brian blackwood
the arrests come during a surge of religious nationalism in myanmar , a predominantly buddhist country
