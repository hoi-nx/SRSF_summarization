cavendish has issued a typically blunt assessment of the circ report into past practices of doping and suggested lance armstrong 's charity return to the tour de france ' could be done in a different environment '
circ was established to investigate whether the uci , cycling 's world governing body , was complicit in past doping practices , such as the lance armstrong affair , which saw the american stripped of his seven tour de france titles and banned for life
some of the reports findings were scathing but , according to 2011 world champion and 25 - time tour stage winner cavendish , little was revelatory
cavendish says there were few revelations in the circ report the 25 - time tour de france stage winner said the report was ' all the s * * * that 's been out there the last few years just compiled into the one document ' cavendish , speaking after announcing he 'll compete in august 's prudential ridelondon-surrey classic , said : ' to be brutally honest , i do n't really think there 's anything new in there
' there 's all the s * * * that 's been out there the last few years just compiled into the one document
' people talk about the past of cycling like it 's the present
it 's a little bit frustrating ; that would be an understatement
' as long as cycling 's cleaning up and i 'm racing in a fair playing field in a sport i love , then i 'll continue to be happy with that
' one unnamed but ' respected ' professional cyclist told circ that 90 per cent of the professional peloton continues to dope , while another reported the figure was 20 per cent
cavendish does n't see much use in the report , commissioned by new uci president brian cookson cavendish did not confirm if he had read the report in full or just the media dispatches which followed its publication earlier this month
he did not speak to circ and was unaware that riders could approach the commission to share their views
asked if he felt the report represented the views of the modern peloton , cavendish said : ' absolutely not
i was n't asked at all to say anything
' ninety - five per cent of the peloton will know the one rider who will have said certain comments and the other five per cent wo n't have raced or known that rider , so could n't comment on it
' i think certain quotes from unreliable sources do n't really mean anything and completely warp the sense of the whole process
' lance armstrong plans to return to the tour alongside former footballer geoff thomas , another cancer survivor
lance armstrong ( left ) plans to return to the tour de france , the event for which he was stripped of seven titles due to doping , as part of a charity ride with former footballer geoff thomas geoff thomas is riding the tour de france route one day ahead of the professional peloton , which includes cavendish , to raise funds for charity and has invited lance armstrong to join him
cavendish said : ' there 's no denying what lance armstrong did for charity ; he did work a lot for charity
' but maybe this situation could be done in a different environment
