gascoigne told the high court today that phone - hacking was linked to his alcoholism
the 47 - year - old former footballer gave evidence at the hearing in london to determine what compensation should be paid by mirror group newspapers ( mirror group newspapers ) in eight representative cases
mr gascoigne , who has fought a well - documented battle with alcoholism since quitting the sport , told senior judge mr justice mann that he was ' fuming ' that his privacy had been invaded
he was supported by former tottenham captain gary mabbutt ( right ) dressed in a dark suit and pink - and - white striped shirt , the former england midfielder , who arrived at court supported by former tottenham captain gary mabbutt , said he had changed his mobile because he knew there was something going on with it
his voice hoarse and shaking with emotion , he said : ' i knew i was getting hacked by the mirror group newspapers
' phone calls to my father and family were getting blocked so i changed my mobile
it happened again so i kept on changing mobiles , five or six times a month
' questioned by lawyer david sherborne , who has said hacking was rife at all three of the group 's national titles by mid- 1999 , he said that the experience of being hacked was ' scary '
mr gascoigne , who is complaining about 18 articles , all of which are accepted to have been the product of illegal activity , said : ' i could n't speak to anybody , i was scared to speak to anybody ... my parents , my family and kids , it was just horrendous
' and people ca n't understand why i became an alcoholic
' he added : ' at the time i was going through a bad time because i knew i was getting hacked , 110 %
of course ( people ) would n't believe it - my family and mr mckeown ( therapist johnny mckeown )
' as i was speaking to him on the phone , it clicked again
he told me i was paranoid , i was going through a mental disorder
' i said ' no , there 's f * * * - all wrong with me '
i knew , i knew
i put the phone down ... i 've never told a lie , nothing to lie about , nothing
' the former footballer ( pictured , centre left , with his lawyers ) said phone hacking had partly led him to drink gascoigne , pictured in a court sketch , said he was ' disgusted ' after being told he 'd not be cross-examined after speaking briefly , mr gascoigne was told he would not face cross-examination by matthew nicklin qc , for mirror group newspapers
he replied : ' i have waited 15 years to be sat here so i am disgusted , really
' i would like to trade my mobile phone in for a coffin because these guys have ruined my life
i have no life , they 've left me in a state
' he said that , in early 2006 , his suspicions caused him to spend Â£ 80,000 on counter-surveillance equipment
gascoigne said that he blamed his family for what he thought were leaks and did not speak to them for almost two years - refusing to go for christmas with them - because he thought they had betrayed him
' it is very sad to me that a lot of damage has already been done to my family that can not easily be fixed
my apologising to them now can not turn back the clock for things i have said to them , and the hurt that this has caused
' he said the stories caused serious rows with his former wife , sheryl , as every time she visited priory , the press and photographers were there
' i do not believe for one moment that sheryl would have told the press about my going into treatment because it was so important to both of us and our families that i got better , ' he told the court
gascoigne felt as if his life was falling apart while was playing at everton ( left ) and said phone hacking affected his relationship with his ex-wife sheryl and stepdaughter bianca ( pictured together , right ) he also fell out with his life - long friend , james ' jimmy
' i now believe that i was totally wrong to blame jimmy and that he has in fact been an incredibly loyal friend to me over the years
' after he was not cross-examined in court , gascoigne said : ' they bottled it , ' as he left the building
in a written statement supplied to the court , gascoigne said that his fame had brought many benefits but also caused him much heartache as he had struggled to come to terms with the end of his playing career
constant media pressure made it very difficult for him to lead a normal life and had led to his family not being as close as they once were
he said he suffered from alcohol dependency and also had treatment for drug use and addiction to the drink red bull
his statement said : ' i have suffered from mental illness , including paranoia , obsessive compulsive disorder , depression , anxiety and suicidal ideation
i am bipolar and i have an addictive personality
' he said the period between 2000 and 2006 was very difficult , and he wrongly accused people close to him , such as his stepdaughter bianca , of going to the newspapers with stories about him
' i became obsessed about being monitored
i felt that i was being watched or listened into all the time for years and the pressure on me because of that was more than i think any sane person could bear
' details of eight representative phone hacking cases are being heard at the royal courts of justice he said that , while he was at everton in october 2000 , he felt as if his life was falling apart and went to stay at the priory rehab clininc as he needed to get help quickly
' the main reason why i had to go to get help at the priory on this occasion was the constant pressure from the media , including articles and threats of articles being published by journalists
' i was also convinced that my phone was being tapped to get stories about me that very few people knew about
i felt very paranoid at that time about being pursued by the media
' the other cases involved in the litigation are those of actress lucy taggart , tv executive alan yentob , actress sadie frost , soap stars shobna gulati and shane richie , flight attendant lauren alcorn and tv producer robert ashworth
