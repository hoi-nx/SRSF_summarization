a student is fundraising for children with cancer after he defied medical odds by beating a brain tumour three times
chandos green , a student at chichester university , west sussex , must still have annual mri scans after he endured three risky surgeries merely to survive to the age of 19
and now , just months after his last operation , he is already training for the 2015 london marathon in the hope he can raise thousands for the charity children with cancer uk
survivor : chandos green , 19 , who has battled a life - threatening tumour three times
right shows the scar on his head from his most - recent operation to remove the tumour at southampton general hospital fighter : despite surviving his last brush with death less than a year ago , chichester university student mr chandos green is now training to run the london marathon this year to raise money for a cancer charity speaking of his latest brush with death - only averted when surgeons removed a golf ball - sized tumour - mr chandos green said : ' i remember asking the surgeon if i was going to die and i broke down when i was going under the anaesthetic
' luckily i was fine and managed to beat the tumour once again
but the operation made me realise that life can be short
' mr chandos green , from bournemouth , dorset , appeared to be a healthy toddler until , at the age of three , he began suffering dizzy spells and falling over unexpectedly
after his worried mother took him to see their family doctor , her son was referred to poole hospital where specialists diagnosed a brain tumour
brain surgeons at southampton general hospital were able to remove most of the tumour , but were unable to take out parts that were close to mr chandos green 's motor neurons - the essential circuits that connect the brain to the muscles
mr chandos green remembered : ' when they discovered the tumour i was still really young but i remember being in the hospital and being confused by it all
' i recovered quickly from the operation and managed to start school but that 's when the problems started
' initially people did n't say anything about my scars but then people kept coming up to me and asking what happened to my head
' they began to notice the tumour had given me a limp and i had lost movement in my left wrist

it was diagnosed after he began suffering dizzy spells and falling over tests : mr chandos green aged five
despite the success of mr chandos green 's first operation , his symptoms soon returned and he was forced to undergo a second operation at the age of six to again remove his brain tumour recovery : mr chandos green aged six , following his second operation
he remained cancer free for the next 13 years until he enrolled at chichester university , when the familiar symptoms began to reappear with the same symptoms reappearing just a couple of years after his first fight with the tumour , a new mri scan showed mr chandos green 's tumour had regrown
aged just six , he was once again forced to go under the surgeon 's knife for a risky operation to remove the growth and save his life
again he recovered and returned to school
but this time he fell victim to cruel classroom bullies who dubbed him ' tumour boy '
despite the taunts , mr chandos green rebuilt his life , enjoying a normal adolescence and completing his gcses and a-levels
but when he enrolled at chichester to begin his degree , all - too - familiar symptoms began to return
' i started studying social work and the beginning of it was great until i started to get headaches
' one day when i woke up early to go on a trip and i fainted in my room and woke up three hours later
' it was then that i realised that something was n't right and i went to the hospital to get some checks done
' just a day after his 19th birthday , chandos green received the devastating news he would have to battle the life - threatening disease for a third time
' i was now old enough to fully understand what was going on and i was so scared going into the operation , ' he said
steve clifford , a professor of molecular paediatric oncology at newcastle university , said : ' it is possible that some brain tumours may return some time after they were first treated
' however it is rare for a brain tumour return three times , especially when the individual 's lay dormant for 12 years
