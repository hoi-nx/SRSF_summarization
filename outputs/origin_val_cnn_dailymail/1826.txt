but with an outside chance of a top - four finish , spurs tried to breathe life into their season in the seventh minute when nacer chadli sent a neat volley past lukasz fabianski from danny rose âs cross
finally , there was noise emanating from white hart lane
that was quickly replaced by a stunned silence after eyes clocked gomis , all alone , collapsed in the centre circle
both sets of medical staff sprinted on to attend to the stricken striker
gomis received five minutes of treatment
gradually the worried expressions lifted , a clear sign that this was nât as serious an incident as that of fabrice muamba âs cardiac arrest at white hart lane three years ago
the incident only added to the subdued atmosphere , and when ki sung-yueng converted from a tight angle in the 18th minute , the decibel levels â but for a small corner of visiting fans â dropped further
spurs supporters need nât have worried , though , as ryan mason and andros townsend scored before the hour
they were , though , forced to endure a hairy final five minutes after gylfi sigurdsson smashed home a volley in the 88th minute to set up a grandstand finish
and hugo lloris produced a breathtaking save deep into three minutes of stoppage time to ensure spurs returned to winning ways
