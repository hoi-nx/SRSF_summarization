the man who invented the coffee pods used by millions of americans in their k-cup instant brewing machines has admitted he regrets ever coming up with the design
in an interview with the atlantic , sylvan , who came up with the idea for the coffee pods and the machine in the early 1990s , revealed that he ' feels bad ' about the negative impact that the pods are having on the environment
sylvan , who no longer uses the plastic pods himself , also confessed he wishes he had never created them in the first place
' i feel bad sometimes that i ever did it , ' said mr sylvan , who sold his share of the company in 1997 for $ 50,000
last year the company sold 9.8 billion k-cup - brewed portion packs and earned $ 4.7billion
the design is simple - a small plastic capsule containing ground beans that can be put into a machine to produce a cup of coffee at the touch of a button
however despite the multi-billion pound success of the company nothing has been done to try and make the packaging of the popular k-cup pods recyclable
and mr sylvan insists this will never happen
' no matter what they say about recycling , those things will never be recyclable , ' he said
' the plastic is a specialized plastic made of four different layers
' mr sylvan , who co-founded the company with peter dragone , added that the unique plastic used in the k-cup - known as plastic # 7 - is only recyclable in a small number of cities in canada , and can not as yet be processed yet in the americans
unfortunately the plastic is also integral to the unique design of the pods
it ensures that the coffee inside stays completely protected from any outside elements and remains completely intact while the coffee is being brewed
the popularity of the simplistic coffee pods has also come across the shores to the uk
adverts for k-cup featuring the slogan ' brew the love ' , enticed americans audiences
and in england thousands of customers have been lured into buying nespresso machines following similar adverts featuring george clooney
nespresso is now the most prominent capsule company in the uk
the machines do not take the k-cup capsules but take similar plastic ones and nespresso has established its own sustainability advisory board
mr sylvan also confessed that despite his earlier dedication to the brand , he no longer drinks coffee made using the capsules
in 1995 he had to go to hospital with heart palpitations after testing up to 40 cups of his coffee a day
he now no longer even owns a k-cup machine and only drinks filter coffee
george clooney has helped popularise the nespresso brand in the uk , a similar version of the k-cup damaging : k-cup has come under fire on numerous occasions from environmentalists who claim that the number of k-cup sold in 2014 alone would circle the earth 12 times if they were laid down end - to - end k-cup has come under fire on numerous occasions from environmentalists who claim that the number of k-cup sold in 2014 alone , and subsequently put into landfills , would circle the earth a staggering 12 times if they were laid down end - to - end
they have started a kill the k-cup campaign , which features a youtube video showing the world being destroyed by the plastic coffee capsules
but despite the continued criticism , keurig green mountain , the brewing system 's parent company , has yet to come up with a viable solution to the problem , despite insisting that they have been trying to find an environmentally - friendly alternative since 2006
' it 's a warranted criticism , ' monique oxender , chief sustainability officer for keurig green mountain , told the salt earlier this year
' we 're not proud of where we are right now , and we 're committed to fixing it
' alternative option : mr sylvan insists that he has managed to create a new design for the k-cup which would be far more environmentally - friendly than the ones currently being used not according to mr sylvan
the entrepreneur insists that he has come up with an alternative design to his original creation which would involve relying on the same kinds of materials used for foil ketchup packets
but while mr sylvan is convinced that he holds the answer to k-cup 's ongoing environmental concerns , he added that the company have thus far refused to trial his new design
' i told them how to improve it , but they do n't want to listen , ' he added to the atlantic
' there 's a much better way of doing it
' ironically , mr sylvan 's current work , running energy efficient solar energy company zonbak , requires him to be much more mindful of the environment , which is perhaps why he is suffering from such feelings of guilt over his most infamous creation .
