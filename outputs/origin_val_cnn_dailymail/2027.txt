picking up their copy of the parish news , residents of the town of westhoughton were probably expecting the usual mix of announcements , reminders and perhaps a page or two of genteel religious discourse
instead they were treated to five pages of a minister ranting about his wife âs adulterous affair
james wilson , 54 , shamed his wife , alyson , 56 , in a 2,000 - word article that left many elderly worshippers in shock
james wilson , 54 , churchwarden of st bartholomew 's c of e church in westhoughton near bolton , has accused his wife alyson ( pictured together ) of having an affair in an extraordinary rant in a parish magazine mr james wilson claimed his wife alyson had committed the ' most heinous ' crime of any marriage by leaving him for her ex-police officer boyfriend in the 2,273 - word tirade , which he published in the parish magazine he edits in the piece , entitled heartfelt story , mr james wilson , a lay minister , accused her of conducting an affair behind his back and then abandoning him to set up home with her ex-policeman lover
he begins by telling parishioners : â sadly , i have to report to you , my wife of 20 years recently ended our marriage and not in an amicable or hearty way
i am and have been in quite a mess
â she was constantly out till all hours most nights , coming home with flowers , even a teddy bear that went to bed with her and sat on my bed 24/7
this soft pushover ai nât being pushed over anymore
â the former media sales consultant wrote under the headline ' heartless story ' : ' she would go missing for days at a time
it was blatantly obvious she was having an affair â¦ and she came home from him and got in my bed
' how cold is that dear reader ? it 's heartless , cruel and just not on
talk about rubbing it in my face
' mr james wilson , who is a lay minister at st bartholomew âs , a c of e church near bolton , wrote in the westhoughton parish magazine : â i am bereft , numb , angry and disgusted with my estranged wife , a woman i have loved , worshipped and adored for 20 years
mr james wilson published the rant in the westhoughton parish magazine , which has now been retracted by the church for being ' totally inappropriate ' â i understand relationships end â¦ but to make the decision on your own , then go and jump into the first bed that comes along is wrong
â â why i am sharing all this with you ? simply to make you think about your actions that only you choose to do
â i can tell you that during my six years as warden to my own knowledge some 11 relationships have ended in adultery from our own church pews
we are supposed to be a beacon of light for jesus
we are supposed to live life correctly
â church leaders immediately recalled all copies of the magazine , prevented any further deliveries and ordered remaining copies to be pulped
some parishioners in westhoughton called for the bishop of manchester to intervene
one , who would not be named , said : â he âs obviously in emotional turmoil
we do feel for him but it was totally inappropriate
the parish magazine has never been so controversial
â mr james wilson , who joined the church in 1995 , became a church warden in 2008 and runs the church youth club
in 2010 he was made a lay minister and has been editor of the parish magazine for several years
he has been married to alyson for 20 years and the couple have a son tom , 18 , while mr james wilson has a daughter , emily , 28 , from a previous relationship
in the article he says : â i put a tract on her actions on my facebook page so all my family and friends found out together
she does nât like being in the news
so when she gets passed this magazine , i âm sure i will get berated from her
mr james wilson said his wife alyson , 56 , would sneak out to meet her lover before returning to the marital bed
he said he wrote the five - page rant to parish worshippers because he wanted to ' highlight the impact adultery ' â but she lost the right to tell me what to do as soon as she jumped into bed with another
she was so wicked to me that i am lost for words
sadly , dear readers , she is still trying to blame me
no one ever forces you into the arms of another man
â mr james wilson - who has another child , emily , 26 , from a previous relationship - said he now ' regrets the turmoil caused ' but published the article because he wanted to highlight his wife 's alleged cheating
he told mailonline : ' my intention was to highlight that marriages do break up and cause hurt and that adultery does occur
' she used to go missing for nights and days
it was pretty clear , she used to bring home flowers and teddy bears
' she also used to say she was going out for tea with the girls which i know she hated doing
' the night before she left she finally told me she had met someone else
mr james wilson , who has two children , claimed the marriage breakdown had taken its toll on both him and the couple 's 18 - year - old son tom ( pictured together )
he blames her for apparently leaving him for another man ' she has cheated on both her previous husbands as well
but when you fall in love with someone you fall in love warts and all
' we were together for 20 years and married 18 - and - a - half years
in the last few months she spoke to me awfully
' she 's ruined her life and reputation
our son , thomas , was 18 yesterday and she only saw him for 20 minutes and all she did was grill him about all of this
' i want this year to be remembered for tom 's 18th and good things as a family , not for what that woman has done to us all
' mr james wilson , who joined st. bartholomew 's church in 1995 and became a churchwarden in 2008 , said he is now planning to issue divorce proceedings
he said : ' the church are saying i 've brought them into disrepute but i 've worked for the parish magazine for 15 years and the majority of my stories have been happy
this is the reality of life and relationships and now i 'm being cast as a villain
mr james wilson , a lay minister at st bartholomew 's c of e church in westhoughton near bolton ( pictured ) , described his wife as ' heartless and cruel ' and said he was now looking to issue divorce proceedings ' my whole intention was to help other people in an adulteress relationship
it 's the most heinous of crimes to a human being
' it 's knocked me out and it 's taken some swallowing
none of us deserved what she has done
' i had to go to bed at night knowing my wife was in bed with someone else
' i 've lost more than a stone in weight , none of us have been sleeping or eating and my son 's college work has suffered
' mrs wilson , who works at debenhams in wigan , was unavailable for comment last night
a spokesman for the diocese of manchester said the church was â supporting james wilson through his personal difficulties
it was totally inappropriate for him to vent his hurt and anger â¦ in the parish magazine
