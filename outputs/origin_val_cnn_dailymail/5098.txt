at a time when few women would leave their houses alone , isabella bird braved war , floods and male scorn to complete arduous solo journeys in america and the far east
from 1894 to 1897 the victorian explorer trekked across china while it was with war with japanese , documenting the lives of the men and women she met through detailed written accounts and a collection of vivid photographs
some of her incredible journeys , published in her 1899 work in the river yangtze and beyond , are now the subject of a new book by deborah ireland
' isabella bird did n't become famous as a travel writer until she was 44 - at that time women just did n't have careers as writers
and it was n't until she was 60 that she discovered photography
' in her book , ireland charts isabella bird 's three years spent travelling in china and reprints her stunning photographs of china daily life gradually being infiltrated by european clothing and customs
isabella bird turned to writing as a way to make money for her and her unmarried sister born in 1831 the daughter of a clergyman , as ireland writes : ' the adventuress who travelled and rode in all weathers , exploring remote and dangerous regions , was writing about a life in sharp contrast to the one originally envisaged for her
' the intrepid yorkshire woman started writing in 1854 when she travelled to america to mend a broken heart
but it was n't until 1875 that she found fame with an account of her experiences in hawaii
bird was on her way home from an ill - fated trip to australia when she fell in love with the islands
she initially wrote extensive accounts of her escapades to her sister , and decided that writing would provide a much - needed income for the unmarried pair
on her return , isabella bird embarked on her publishing career and her candid accounts of her travel became instant bes - sellers , and she has n't been out of print since
ireland writes : ' as a respected international traveller her views were sought by prime ministers , ambassadors and the newspaper men of the day
' her books were engaging , accessible and entertaining and she opened up a world of travel to the armchair explorer
' despite saying she was too old for arduous journeys , isabella bird travelled 8,000 miles during an extended trip to china , travelling on horseback and in carts , by boat and in a sedan chair , using her newly acquired camera and photographic skills to document her journey
she traversed the country , from hangzhou ( hangzhou ) to hong kong and from one end of the river yangtze to the other as well as venturing into korea and japanese
isabella bird was 60 - years - old when she discovered photography , and developed all her prints herself in her letters home to her sister , isabella bird tells how she loved everything about the process of photography in 1894 she set off from liverpool to the far east unaware she was travelling into the first sino-japanese war between china and japanese over control of korea
she was deported from korea on a japanese steamer with no money and luggage and only the clothes on her back and was forced to take refuge in china
there she experienced a flood on the manchurian plain and risked her life helping drowning villagers in terrific storms before succumbing to malaria
she then broke her arm when the cart she was travelling in overturned just miles from the house of the missionary who was to take her in
confined to the town of shenyang ( shenyang ) by her injuries , she spent time getting to know the missionary doctors and photographing their patients , many of whom suffered from leprosy or the effects of opium addiction
isabella bird 's account of her travels was hailed by one reviewer at the time as ' one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of late nineteenth century china ever written ' as well as the scorn of her countrymen , isabella bird also had to contend with the hostility of the locals who were not used to seeing a foreigner , let alone a foreign woman , travelling her photographs of this time show pagodas and palaces as well as the mean back streets and the ravaged faces of disese sufferers
while travelling in the china interior she managed to avoid the plagues of rats and other vermin by suspending her clothes and boots on the tripod of her camera
she adopted china dress as the tight fitting , tailored clothes she was used to were considered offensive by the local population
in her book , ireland charts isabella bird 's three years spent travelling in china and reprints her stunning photographs of china daily life gradually being infiltrated by european clothing and customs isabella bird 's legacy is her iron will and her determination to never give up in the face of adversity , says ireland however she did not quite escape the curiosity or hostility of the locals who were not used to seeing a foreigner , let alone a foreign woman , travelling
ireland writes : ' overnight halts were a problem because of the stir she created by her arrival
this could range from curiosity to extreme hostility â from holes drilled through the walls of her room followed by whispering and giggling , to a full - blown riot with shouts of " foreign devil " , " child eater "
' she also received the scorn of her countrymen , with archaeologist sir austen writing to her publisher 's son : ' i must say i think the woman must be devoid of all delicacy and modesty who could travel as she did , without a female attendant among a crowd of dirty persian muleteers and others
' however isabella bird 's account of her travels was hailed by one reviewer at the time as ' one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of late nineteenth century china ever written
' in response to sir austen criticism , ireland writes : ' not bad for an account of a journey " undertaken for recreation an interest solely " or " but to satisfy her curiosity and love of travel "
' and what about isabella bird 's legacy ? ' never give up ! and do n't think you 're ever too old to do anything , ' ireland tells us
' if you want , it 's possible to have a new career at 60
' isabella bird : a photographic journal of travels through china 1894 - 1896 by deborah ireland will be published by ammonite press later this month .
