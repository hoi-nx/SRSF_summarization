a coffin measuring almost 8ft long that has been specially made for britain 's former tallest man will be carried by ten pallbearers at his funeral
greener , of bromley in south london , grew to 7ft 6ins tall before surgical intervention stopped him growing
he held the record as the uk 's tallest man for four decades
the 71 - year - old , who weighed 30 stone , had to have a bespoke coffin made after he died last month and will be buried in a double plot of land near to his home
greener , formerly britain 's tallest man , will be buried in a bespoke coffin measuring almost 8ft that will need to be carried by 10 pallbearers funeral directors have calculated that mr greener 's coffin will need at least 10 pallbearers to carry it because of the size and weight of the casket
usually there are four pallbearers to carry a coffin
they estimate the coffin will just about fit into the hearse , with less than two inches of space left
matthew uden , funeral director at hayes - based w. uden & sons , said : ' we 've had to have the coffin specially made
' they are normally about 6ft 2ins but this is just under 8ft - it 's quite a difference
' but the real struggle is making sure it 's tough enough as he was quite a heavy chap too
' we measured everything before we ordered the coffin and it just about fits into the hearse by about 2ins
' because of its size mr greener 's coffin also has extra handles fitted so it can be carried by the extra pallbearers
mr greener was diagnosed at 27 with a condition known as pituitary gigantism where a tumour had grown on his pituitary gland , an organ that controls bodily functions including release of growth hormones
funeral directors said more pallbearers will be needed to carry the coffin because of its length and weight mr greener held the title of britain 's tallest man for four decades and is pictured in 1996 outside the market weighton house once owned by yorkshire 's 7ft 9ins giant william bradley and later by sylvia france ( left ) surgeons removed the tumour when he was already in the record books for being uk 's tallest man and he would have continued to grow if they had not
he played basketball internationally for britain in the late 60s and early 70s and played the circus giant in david lynch 's film the elephant man
barry tolson , who lives in spain after emigrating from croydon , south london , was mr greener 's friend for more than 20 years and is helping to arrange the funeral
he said : ' chris , as my wife would say was a gentle giant
he was very funny , caring and kind and our whole family will miss him terribly
' he struggled towards the end of his life with his health and found it increasingly difficult to get around
' mowing the lawn and day - to - day chores were extremely difficult for him being so extremely tall but he was always cheery and never stopped making us laugh
mr greener lost his title as britain 's tallest man in 2007
the 71 - year - old spent the majority of his life towering over friends and family
he is pictured above at a friend 's wedding mr greener 's height afforded him roles in films
above , he is prepared for an appearance by a make - up artist ' he even joked to irene , my wife , that he expected getting a coffin to fit him could be difficult and that he would n't mind if we just got someone to " break his legs "
' greener will be buried at st mary 's cemetery in hayes , bromley , on march 9 , after he died on february 11 at nearby princess royal university hospital
mr greener lost his title of britain 's tallest man when he was replaced in 2007 by fingleton , who measures 7ft 7.56ins tall
mr fingleton , from durham , also played basketball and is now an actor , having recently starred alongside mila kunis in jupiter ascending
neither however beat the record of william bradley , who at 7ft 9ins tall , was known as the yorkshire giant until his death in 1820
last year stadnyk , believed to be the world 's tallest man at an estimated 8ft 5in tall , was carried to a graveyard on the back of an open truck because his remains were too large for a hearse
