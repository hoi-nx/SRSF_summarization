it sounds like the ideal solution for older women wanting to have children
a controversial method to improve the health of an old egg is being used by a massachusetts - based fertility company
the firm , ovascience , says its technique involves rejuvenating an egg 's mitochondria , which are the tiny structures that create energy to run a cell
massachusetts - based fertility company , ovascience , says its technique involves rejuvenating an egg 's mitochondria , which are the tiny structures that create energy to run a cell studies suggest that 23 - 33 is the ideal time to conceive , as a healthy woman is still fertile and may be more psychologically prepared to have a baby
but fertility does begin to diminish slowly from the age of 25 as a woman 's eggs decrease
one report claiming that women are 10 per cent less fertile at 27
this is because they now have fewer eggs to fertilise - a few thousand - which are also older
but according to a report by tia ghose in livescience , experts advise caution over those claims
' they 're quite private and secretive about what they 're doing , ' dr aimee eyvazzadeh , a fertility specialist told livescience
the technique , dubbed augment , takes energy - producing mitochondria from a patient 's own ' eggpc cells '
these are immature egg cells found in the protective ovarian lining , which are added to the patient 's mature eggs to supplement the existing mitochondria
' a key component of egg health is the number of functioning mitochondria in the egg since mitochondria are the source of energy that helps an egg develop , ' ovascience co-founder , michelle dipp , told dailymail.com the idea is that immature cells with their healthy mitochondria could rejuvenate ageing eggs

the augment treatment is not available in the us as the fda ( fda ) has n't approved the method
it is , however , available in some in vitro fertilisation clinics in canada , the uk , the united arab emirates and turkey
so far , more than 150 patients have received the augment treatment
but there are still problems with the method
for instance , kateryna makova , a genomicist at pennsylvania state university in state college told livescience that the follicles in the ovary are unlikely to be in any better condition
as yet , there are no any published studies proving the existence of the precursor cells the company says it uses
ovascience has yet to respond to dailymail.com regarding criticism of its procedure .
