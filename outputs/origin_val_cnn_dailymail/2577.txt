three quarters of us drink tea every day but many of us are too impatient to let it steep properly
steeping is the act of letting the flavour of the tea infuse into the water , and scientists claim it should be left for a minimum of two minutes
but a study has found that 80 per cent of tea drinkers ca n't wait that long - and 40 per cent of us drink it immediately meaning we do n't get the best flavour from our cuppa
researchers asked 1,000 people about their tea - drinking habits and found that only 16 % of people let the water brew , or steep , for the recommended time of between two and five minutes
nearly half ( 47 per cent ) leave their tea to cool for five minutes after they have removed the tea bag before drinking it the study was commissioned ahead of british science week - a 10 - day programme of science , technology , engineering and maths events across the british that started on 13 march
researchers asked 1,000 people about their tea - drinking habits and discovered that english breakfast made without sugar and drunk from a ceramic mug is the most popular method
only 16 per cent of people let the water brew for the recommended time of between two and five minutes
but this time varies depending on the type of tea
and nearly half ( 47 per cent ) leave their tea to cool for five minutes after they have removed the tea bag before drinking it
herbal teas ( stock image ) should be steeped in water with a temperature of 95 â° c ( 203 Â° f ) steeping tea is the process of soaking a solid - in this case tea leaves - to extract flavours and soften it
for standard black tea , freshly boiled water should be used - with temperatures above 95 Â° c ( 203 â° f )
water should be left to cool down for at least 30 seconds when making green and white tea , with a recommended temperature of 74 Â° c to 85 â° c ( 160 Â° f to 203 Â° f )
oolong tea is best steeped in 85 â° c ( 185 Â° f ) water
herbal teas should be steeped in water with a temperature of 95 Â° c ( 203 Â° f )
regardless of the temperature , the standard explained that tea should be steeped for six minutes
elsewhere , the age - old debate of water or milk first was found to vary depending on how the tea is being drunk
if the tea is being made in a cup or mug the milk should be added last , and more than two thirds ( 69 per cent ) of tea drinkers use this technique
but when made using a tea pot , the milk should be added to the mug before the tea - infused hot water is poured into it
the study additionally found that the over 65s are more likely to add milk first
miodownik , professor of materials and society at university college london said : ' this may be controversial , but the british do not understand how to make tea ! or at least they âre not doing it properly
' and it âs because they do nât understand the variables
expediency is causing us to throw chemistry out of the window ; we âre not allowing our tea to brew for long enough , to release the flavours properly
' the decline in use of the teapot is another factor , ' professor miodownik added : ' what you make tea in , and drink it out of , is also important
' these findings follow reports last month that said to make the perfect cup of tea - according to the bsi guidelines - the milk should be put in the cup first , the pot must be made of porcelain , there must be at least 2g of tea for every 100ml and the water must not exceed 85 â° c ( 185 Â° f ) when served
and these guidelines explained that black tea should be steeped for at six minutes

elsewhere the experts said that if tea is being made in a cup or mug the milk should be added last , and more than two thirds ( 69 per cent ) of tea drinkers use this technique
but when made using a tea pot , the milk should be added to the mug before the tea - infused hot water is poured into it to a tea : experts say many of us brits are not leaving our tea to steep for long enough the institution 's best practice when it comes to making a cup of tea is called ' preparation of a liquor of tea for use in sensory tests
' according to this standard , two different sized pots made of porcelain or glazed earthenware are recommended , alongside two corresponding small and large ' bowls ' - or cups
the first , large pot should measure be between 74mm and 78mm wide and stand between 83mm and 87mm tall
it should also have a lid
the ideal smaller pot should be between 61mm and 65 mm tall and ideally 64mm wide
the larger cup is should be between 57mm and 63mm tall by 109mm - plus or minus 3mm - compared to 49mm and 55mm wide
either way , the large pot should not exceed 318ml , and the small pot must have a maximum capacity of 159ml
these findings follow reports last month that said to make the perfect cup of tea - according to the bsi guidelines - the milk should be put in the cup first , the pot must be made of porcelain , there must be at least 2g of tea for every 100ml and the water must not exceed 85 â° c ( 185 Â° f ) when served on average , a teabag weighs 2g but contains around 1.5g of tea leaves so at least two should be used for a small pot and at least four should be used for a larger pot. when being made with milk , the tea should be made and brewed in the same way and then added to at least 2.5ml milk in the bowl to make tea without milk , 2g of tea should be used for every 100ml of water
pour freshly boiled water into the pot up to 4mm and 6mm below the brim
the tea should then be left to infuse for six minutes
lyons tea recently released this tongue - in - cheek colour chart to help friends and family make tea to a person 's preferred strength on average , a teabag weighs 2g but contains around 1.5g of tea leaves , so at least two bags should be used for a small pot of tea and at least four should be used for a larger pot. when made with milk , the tea should be made and brewed in the same way and then added to milk in the cup
at least 2.5ml milk is recommended for use with a smaller pot , and 5ml milk is advised for the larger pot. this helps the milk mix more evenly though the ' liquor ' when the tea is added to the bowl
to make sure the water does n't scald the milk , the bsi explained that its temperature should not exceed 85 â° c ( 185 Â° f ) , but should be above 60 Â° c ( 140 â° f ) for optimum flavour and sensation
the standard does explain that different sized pots can be used , but these measurements are recommended
if milk is added first and the teabag is dropped into the milk before it has infused with the water , then the steeping process is affected
it does n't affect the brewing process , but it will cool down the liquid which will directly impact the effectiveness of the steeping
dr. stanley segall at drexel university , philadelphia said : ' when you steep tea leaves in hot water , water - soluble materials are extracted to produce the tea
' changes in brewing temperature affect extraction of colour - and flavour - responsible chemicals exponentially
' he explained that reaction rates generally double for every rise in temperature of 18 Â° f , and decrease by the same factor when the temperature is lowered .
