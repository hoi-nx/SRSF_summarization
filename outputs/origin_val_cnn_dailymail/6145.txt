mccall has agreed to make an emotional return to rangers after answering the call to salvage their promotion campaign
the nine-in-a-row legend will take over as manager until the end of the season in a bid to steer the ibrox club back to the top flight via the championship play - offs
caretaker boss kenny mcdowall , who handed in his notice in january , is not expected to play any role in the new first - team coaching set - up
mccall is a former manager of motherwell and played for rangers for seven years that could open the way for mccall to bring in kenny black , his assistant during a successful stint in charge at motherwell
kenny mcdowall admitted after tuesday âs 1 - 1 draw with queen of the south that there was now a danger of rangers missing out on the play - offs altogether if they did nât find form
they have won just one of their last seven matches , dropping to third place in the table behind hibs
that dismal sequence convinced dave king and the new ibrox board that they had to act , with mccall approached to see if he would be willing to agree a short - term contract
an extended deal contingent upon winning promotion could also be a possibility following a day of discussions
no official confirmation on mccall âs appointment was forthcoming from rangers on wednesday night but that is expected to follow on thursday
mccall achieved back - back top - flight finishes during his time at fir park it is also understood the players were told to report back to murray park early on friday morning â after a day off â in preparation for meeting their new boss
mccall , who won six league titles in seven years as a rangers midfielder , has been out of work since resigning at fir park last november after a slump in form
however , his overall record in lanarkshire was hugely impressive , including back - to - back second - place finishes and a scottish cup final
the 50 - year - old is also currently a member of gordon strachan âs scotland backroom staff but admitted last month it may be an â impossibility â to combine that role with managing a club of rangers â size
dave king flew back to south africa via heathrow on wednesday , admitting in an interview en route that â the playing side is in need of a huge injection of energy â
he also added that the new regime would do â whatever it takes to give the club the best chance of promotion this season â
mccall is the man they have turned to for that purpose , with saturday âs home game against livingston set to open his tenure
gordon strachan has also used mccall as part of his coaching set - up with the scotland national team dave king seized control of rangers after a landslide victory at the club 's most recent egm speaking last week , rangers midfielder and ex-motherwell player law welcomed the prospect of a mccall appointment
â for me personally , it would be great , â said law
â not just for me , but for the club as well
â he âs a legend here and he knows about the club and the expectations
there would be no trouble with him there
' with his character , it â s something he would relish
it would nât worry him at all
i âm sure he âd get a positive reaction straight away just with his demeanour and the way he is
if he âs lucky enough to get it i âm sure he âll do a great job
â meanwhile , sandy easdale has agreed to step down from his position as football board chairman and will make an â amicable â exit from rangers
the ibrox club announced on tuesday that easdale , derek llambias and barry leach had been suspended from their duties â pending investigation â
any proceedings relating to the greenock - based businessman have , however , been dropped .
