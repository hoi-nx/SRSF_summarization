police officers failed to spot that an elderly widow whose throat had been cut had been murdered
una crown , 86 , was repeatedly stabbed in the neck and then set on fire in the horrific attack at the bungalow where she lived alone
but detectives , paramedics and firefighters trampled through her home , â severely contaminating â the murder scene , after concluding that she had somehow set herself alight after falling on her cooker
police had found the body of the retired postmistress , pictured with late husband jack roland crown , covered in blood and with her clothing ' burnt to a crisp ' in the hallway muddy footprints were left on the floor , a detective touched her front door key with his bare hand and her grieving family was even allowed into the property to clean it up
concerns were only raised two days later by a mortuary technician
it was another two days before a pathologist examined the body and confirmed the fatal injuries , along with multiple defensive wounds on mrs una crown âs hands
detectives are still hunting the killer two years after her brutal death
coroner william morris yesterday attacked the services involved for allowing vital clues to be lost as he recorded a verdict of unlawful killing
â i have to say the handling of evidence by the police has been unfortunate , â he said
a theory was formed relatively early on by acting detective sergeant gledhill that una crown had fallen on the hob or cooker and somehow set fire to herself and panicked , and had a heart attack and collapsed in the hallway
â in this suspicious death , foul play was too readily dismissed by police officers
â not treating the area as a full crime scene prevented a â proper forensic examination â from being carried out
mrs crown âs niece , judith paynes , told the hearing she was lost for words
â i can not understand why this evidence was nât picked up , â she said

â i concluded that she died from multiple stab wounds to her chest and neck

â a paramedic had prodded the body and transferred mrs una crown âs blood to a light switch before rummaging through a chest of drawers
mr gledhill used latex gloves during his time at the house but admitted washing a bloodstained key under a tap after he touched it
assistant chief constable mark hopkins said the family âs complaints had been upheld in a review by the bedfordshire , cambridgeshire and hertfordshire professional standards department in june 2013
officers were provided with extra training as a result but none faced formal disciplinary procedures

several people have been arrested in connection with the murder , but all have been released without charge
home office pathologist nat cary found the death was ' clearly homicide ' and ' said that the police 's delay had meant that the crime scene had been ' severely contaminated '
