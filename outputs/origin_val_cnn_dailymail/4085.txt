the nhs has been forced to ask uk doctors in australia to come home due to a major shortfall in numbers
around 1,000 more gps are urgently needed in england , according to new figures released by the house of commons library
it is thought that nearly 1,500 doctors - who cost the taxpayer up to Â£ 610,000 to train - move to australia every year
to bridge the gap they have been offered a place on a ' fully funded ' programme , which they can choose to be either full or part time , if they return
around 1,000 more gps are needed in england
an advert has been placed in two medical magazines asking doctors in australia to come home to bridge the gap ( stock picture ) an advert was placed in the australia doctor and the observer by england 's shropshire and staffordshire area team and health education midlands earlier this month
it said : ' this scheme will help you rediscover and enhance the skills you need to return , or start to practise in the uk
' it 's fully funded , so you will be supported whilst you complete the programme
' the nhs has simultaneously announced a Â£ 10million strategy to further tempt graduates and experienced medical staff
under a quarter of trainees chose to go into general practice last year - with just over 5,000 applicants in total
but cash will now be offered if they work in an under - staffed area for three years
andy burnham ( above ) , shadow minister for health , said the figures prove the nhs is suffering from a gp recruitment crisis andy burnham , shadow minister for health , said the figures prove the nhs is suffering from a gp recruitment crisis
' gp services have gone into freefall under this government
david cameron promised to put gps at the heart of the nhs , but instead caused a new gp recruitment crisis , ' he told the observer
but gp leaders have said that the advertisements will not solve the staffing crisis
dr ken deacon , medical director of the north midlands at england , said that the problem was newly qualified gps being outnumbered by those nearing retirement
the advert promised doctors currently working in australia ( sydney opera house above ) that the scheme would ' help you rediscover and enhance the skills you need to return ' a female - heavy workforce has also been blamed for the gap
the ' feminisation ' of surgeries has led to the uk needing more trainees because women are more likely to work shorter hours than men , a report released by the migration advisory committee last week claimed
this has contributed to an annual shortage of 450 to 550 gps , the committee warned
it suggested that more needed to be done to recruit family doctors - including hiring extra foreign doctors from across the eu
a spokesperson for england said that the central team had not previously been aware of the advertisement , but described it as a â positive scheme â .
