a waitrose magazine showcasing the food of israel has been hammered online for ignoring what activists regard to be the ' illegal occupation of palestine '
the supermarket chain 's monthly food magazine ' waitrose kitchen ' contained a 32 - page brochure called taste of israel
but the glossy advert , sponsored by israel 's government tourist board , has sparked outrage among campaigners - with some claiming it ignores what they believe is an ' apartheid regime '
the travel and food pull - out , in the february edition , contains an ' a-z food glossary ' of israel ingredients and dishes as well as a guide of its ' top 10 restaurants '
it also includes ' market tours ' interviews with top israel chefs and an article explaining ' why israel wine is winning awards , plus five wines to taste
' recipes in the insert include shakshuka , white fish on vegetable ragu , endive salad , and ' instructions for creating the perfect falafel and hummus '
backlash : the advert sparked anger online with some saying it ignored what campaigners described as an ' apartheid ' outrage : some threatened to boycott the supermarket chain after learning of the contents of the magazine anger : one twitter user accused waitrose and the israel tourist office of ' pushing israel propaganda ' criticism : others have asked why some of the foods in the magazine can be claimed by one nation the palestine solidarity campaign called the insert ' disgraceful ' adding : ' the booklet is a prime example of israel government propaganda , highlighting its efforts to distract the public abroad from its brutal military occupation of palestinian land by replacing the image of an apartheid regime with that of a tourist - friendly , culture - loving country
' activisits took to twitter with some vowing to boycott waitrose - and encouraging others to follow suit
one user , rory evans , wrote : nothing like the taste of falafel with a side - order of apartheid , is there @ waitrose # tasteofisrael
' another twitter user , ' paul in brighton ' said : ' waitrose and israel tourist office are pushing israel propaganda ' taste of israel ' using @ waitrose # tasteofisrael
' one said that the magazine ' erases palestinian history and culture ' while others have asked why some of the foods in the magazine can be claimed by one nation
however , some hit back at criticism of waitrose , with one urging activists to ' leave war and politics out of cooking
