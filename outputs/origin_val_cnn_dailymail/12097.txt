three lions âs seven - game winning streak does not include italy
lithuania , but not italy
slovenia , but not italy
san marino and estonia , but not italy
so the idea that the heat has been taken out of kane âs full debut for his country by a string of victories since last summer âs world cup does rather overlook a salient fact
that three lions âs seven wins , as welcome as they may be , are against the also - rans of european football
only slovenia are on course to qualify automatically for the euro at the halfway stage â by coming a distant second to three lions â while norway , switzerland and scotland are in third place in their respective groups , lithuania lie fourth , estonia fifth and san marino where they always are
this is not roy hodgson âs fault
his players can only beat what is in front of them
spurs striker kane is set to make his full three lions debut against italy on tuesday night kane celebrates after scoring on his three lions debut against lithuania just 79 seconds after coming on kane looks on as three lions manager roy hodgson talks to members of the squad at the juventus stadium yet just as roy hodgson is trying to play down the clamour around kane , playing down the euphoria around three lions âs present run may be equally wise
it is not a year since three lions âs poorest world cup finals performance in recent memory and what we do know is that when a group of players that are the scourge of the baltic nations plus an odd mountain range or two came up against italy in manaus last june , they did not have the wit to win
that is where kane comes in
italy and three lions may be depleted in turin , but certain standards remain
italy âs defence will be of a calibre three lions have not experienced since the world cup
their ambition will be greater than that of previous opponents , too
the spurs striker headed in against lithuania shortly after coming on as a substitute at wembley kane celebrates his first international goal as three lions cruised to a 4 - 0 win over lowly lithunania this is a genuine test for kane , in a way his cameo role against lithuania was nât
he will not have played against a team of lithuania âs standard since he was being farmed out by his club on loan to gain experience
lithuania fielded a starting back four featuring players from rangers , hapoel haifa , zalgiris vilnius and cambuur of holland
on tuesday , he will play against two of the men who have powered juventus to the pinnacle of italian football â giorgio chiellini and leonardo bonucci â plus andrea ranocchia of inter milan
and that is what three lions require of kane , too : an upgrade
roy hodgson knows he already has the players to qualify for a major tournament â but he did nât have ones who could muscle past italy or uruguay once there
the hope is kane could change that
kane will come up against italy and juventus defender leonardo bonucci ( left ) on tuesday night giorgio chiellini ( second right ) , pictured with his italy team - mates , will also come up against the three lions man italy players train at the juventus stadium in turin ahead of tuesday 's friendly against three lions at the moment we are left asking questions to which we probably know the answer
why is welbeck so prolific for three lions â europe âs top scorer in the current qualifying campaign , no less â yet still finding his feet with arsenal ? why is sterling âs form so inconsistent for liverpool , yet so vital for three lions ? the explanation can be found in that lithuanian back four
when does welbeck get to play against defenders at the level of the scottish championship with arsenal ? when does sterling face opposition such as cambuur ? welbeck , top scorer in euro qualifying , celebrates with wayne rooney after scoring on friday night sterling comes up against better quality opposition for liverpool than when playing for three lions chelsea send their promising youth - team players to vitesse on loan , and they often make the first team
vitesse are currently fifth in the eredivisie ; cambuur are 10th
the last time they met , on february 4 , two chelsea players featured for vitesse , who won 2 - 0
so that is what welbeck and three lions were up against on friday â defenders who might not quite be at the level of chelsea âs best youngsters
faced with john terry in the premier league , different rules apply
yet against john terry on january 1 , kane nhad one of his best games of the season
kane had one of his best games of the season against john terry during spurs ' 5 - 3 win over chelsea he is english football âs top scorer playing often against players with the quality we shall witness on tuesday night
what roy hodgson must be hoping is that in turin he sees a player who can take three lions beyond
wayne rooney was europe âs top scorer on the way to south africa in 2010 , too
having qualified , three lions failed to attain the necessary level when competing in the finals
roy hodgson talked of kane on monday as a squad player being given the chance to show what he can do â albeit with one of his most promising lines of supply severed as sterling is back on merseyside nursing a minor injury
yet he is more than just that
if kane demonstrates that he can pose a genuine threat to high - level defenders , he has the capability to change the way three lions approach matches
the premier league 's top scorer will be up against defenders of real quality when three lions take on italy welbeck does a job for roy hodgson , but that is what it is : a job
it is a good job â he is the player roy hodgson relies upon when he is concerned the opposition has superior technique â but it has limitations
welbeck works hard , he closes down , he has pace on the counter-attack â and he does exactly what the manager asks of him
and , for now , that is enough
welbeck has been prolific as three lions power through the mediocrities
welbeck does a good job and is often relied on by roy hodgson when three lions face sides with superior technique extra is needed in france in 2016 , however , if three lions are to be more than just present
roy hodgson must discover match - winners , players who have the beating of contenders like italy
so tuesday night is much more than a friendly for kane
this is a moment when he has the opportunity to alter the potential of english football and , if successful , we should nât be frightened to embrace this .
