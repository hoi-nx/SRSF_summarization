john moore has been awarded Â£ 400 after being put up in a club 18-30 hotel by thomas cook a parish councillor has won a Â£ 400 payout from thomas cook after booking what he thought was a ' relaxing holiday ' to a greek party island where he was housed with ' boozed up ' youngsters at a club 18-30 hotel
john moore , 56 , from herne in kent , planned to spend a week on the island of zante with his partner angela , 51 , in september
rather than the peaceful break they were hoping for , the couple , who run a sweet shop in herne bay , kent , were booked into christina studios in the resort of laganas in zante , advertised as an 18 - 30 clubbing destination
after spending two nights in the hotel where youngsters were ' banging on the walls and screaming and shouting ' , the couple abandoned the package holiday for something more quiet
they have since been awarded Â£ 400 in compensation by the holiday company
while being advertised by club 18-30 , christina studios is described on the thomas cook website as ' one of the best chill - out zones ' in zante
upon their arrival however mr john moore found ' boozed up ' youngsters who ' did n't seem to sleep '
' when we got there i asked the rep if he really thought i would book an 18 - 30 holiday , ' the parish councillor said
' when i go on holiday i do n't care really where it is , i want to just have a good time but it was n't made obvious to me that it was a holiday for young people
' it was an official 18 - 30 resort
it was packed with youngsters banging on the walls and screaming and shouting , so we decided to find somewhere else more to our liking
' after complaining to the thomas cook rep at the resort , the couple were told in order to be relocated they would have to pay extra on top of the Â£ 600 they had already spent
they would also have no other choice but to go to another club 18-30 , said mr john moore
' we were just speechless really , it was n't what we wanted or what we were expecting and angela was horrified
' while the couple were dismayed at having to share their accommodation with ' rowdy ' youngsters , they were least impressed with the owner of the hotel 's treatment towards them
' the apartments did n't have hot water but when i complained the owner used very , very rude language
' at that mr john moore and his partner packed their things immediately and , they say , waited outside the hotel for their rep to find them new accommodation
eventually they decided to find themselves somewhere else to stay and filed a complaint with the company upon their return to the uk
mr john moore decided to launch legal action when they failed to act , and was recently offered Â£ 400 after requesting a summons from a judge
the hotel where mr john moore and his partner stayed was advertised as being 600m from the laganas strip ( above ) , hailed as one of zante 's biggest nightlife spots the 56 - year - old parish councillor said christina studios ( above ) where he was placed was ' packed with youngsters ' who ' screamed and banged on walls ' ' i 'm not surprised at all ( that they 've offered me money ) , they did n't have a leg to stand on , ' he said , speaking of the offer
' they sent us to an 18 - 30s hotel having seen how old we looked
' among reviews of the apartments online is one which warns : ' do n't bother if you are over thirty as it 's too noisy
' the apartments are a five minute walk from the laganas strip , described by thomas cook as zante 's ' party resort ' whose nightlife is ' in the same league as ibiza '
but mr john moore claims he was sold a relaxing holiday , with the resort also described as suitable for family trips
among tripadvisor reviews of the hotel are some which describe it as ' filthy ' and ' noisy '
one positive comment was left by a young woman who described it as the ' ultimate ' place for a boys or girls ' holiday
thomas cook apologised for the couple 's experience in september
' we would like to apologise to mr john moore for any inconvenience he may have experienced while staying at the christina studios in zante with our escapades brand in september 2014 , ' a spokesman said
' it is never our intention to disappoint our customers and we are happy to say this matter has now been resolved to his satisfaction
' the accommodation is advertised as being provided by club 18-30 on the thomas cook website ( above )
