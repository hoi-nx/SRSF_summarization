things took a turn for the worse when jean began to suffer memory loss in 2013
she was diagnosed with early onset dementia in 2014 emily - who has not revealed her birth name - will stand by jean , who was diagnosed with early onset dementia in 2014
the former it worker said : ' i always promised jean we would be best friends and that will never change
i will never leave her
' jean , a former financial advisor , discovered her then 55 - year - old husband needed to live as a woman and stayed by her side , helping emily through gender reassignment surgery in february 2011
the couple , from helston , in cornwall , were so close after the operation jean helped the woman who had been her husband with some wardrobe advice
emily said : ' jean was amazing
once i was well enough after the operation , we went shopping together and she 'd pick out outfits for me
' she even helped me enrol for online dating
our relationship is now like close sisters
she 's my best friend
' emily spoke candidly about life before the operation
' i had felt like a woman trapped in the body of a man and the only time i felt happy was when i was wearing women 's clothes and make - up ' - emily ( pictured ) was tired of living a double life ' to the outside world , including jean , i was a guy who liked diy , football and a pint with my mates of an evening , but actually , that was n't me at all
' - emily shocked wife jean with the revelation that he wanted to live life as a woman she said : ' to the outside world , including jean , i was a guy who liked diy , football and a pint with my mates of an evening , but actually , that was n't me at all
' i had felt like a woman trapped in the body of a man and the only time i felt happy was when i was wearing women 's clothes and make - up
' i kept it all hidden in the loft and would only get it out if i was sure jean was going to be out for a while
' but living a double life was not easy and after 20 years of marriage , emily decided to come clean
jean said : ' it was a huge shock when my husband told me how he wanted to live as a woman
he came into the living room wearing a skirt
i nearly had a heart attack
' initially , she thought it was a joke
but after a lot of discussion , mrs jean gave her blessing , as long as her husband did n't dress in women 's clothes in front of her
before and after : emily underwent gender reassignment surgery and wife jean helped her shop for new clothes and enroll on online dating sites emily said : ' at first , that was okay
i 'd lock myself in the spare room , put on one of my favourite dresses and read a book for an hour
it felt so good to finally be myself , but when i wiped off the make - up and put on a short again , it did n't feel right
' eventually i knew that would never be enough for me and i plucked up the courage to tell jean i wanted to live as a woman full time
' jean said she did n't want to lose me and she wanted me to be happy , ' she said
' it meant the world to me
' with her approval , ms emily changed her name to emily and started taking female hormones
she had gender reassignment surgery and breast augmentation on the nhs in february 2011
' i spent eight days in the hospital afterwards but it was worth it , ' she said
' when i looked in the mirror i was in the body i was always meant to be in
still best friends : emily ( left ) is repaying jean 's loyalty by becoming her sole carer , and has put finding a man to share a life with , on the back burner ' jean fully accepted the new me too
we 'd go clothes shopping together , get our hair and nails done and gossip over coffee
but soon i realised something was missing
i wanted to experience every aspect of being a woman
' she wanted male company â and emily encouraged her to explore this
jean said : ' i knew i 'd already lost my husband , so letting emily see other people was almost inevitable
emily says she 'll never leave me and i believe her
' she vetted emily 's potential dates and helped her choose what to wear
emily met up with several men and also had a brief relationship with mrs jean 's knowledge
she said : ' jean knew all about them and spoke to the guy on the phone
it was only brief but none of it was behind her back
' sadly , in 2013 emily started to notice jean was suffering some memory loss
she said : ' jean would ask visitors if they wanted a cup of tea then go into the kitchen and come out and ask again
' she could n't keep up with television programmes and struggled to use the remote control
' emily alerted the doctor and two health care workers came to the house to conduct a memory test
emily now also runs a support group for people considering genital reconstructive surgery after her results came back below average , mrs jean had a brain scan and was subsequently diagnosed with early onset vascular dementia
this means there is a reduced blood supply to the brain due to diseased blood vessels , causing brain cells to die and reduce cognitive function
emily has since been her sole carer and consigned finding a man to share her life with , on the back burner
she said : ' i 'm always worrying i 'm not doing the right thing for her , so for now dating is on hold
' meeting someone does cross my mind from time to time
if it happened , it would be nice , but i 'm not going looking for it
' emily also runs a support group and advises other people who are planning on having genital reconstruction surgery
now the couple , who have been together 39 years , are taking things a day at a time
emily said : ' it 's very hard as i do n't know how jean will be from one day to the next
but i do know one thing - jean will always come first
