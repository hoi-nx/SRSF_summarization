ireland are chasing down a possible second grand slam in six years and , instead of the narrative being exclusively about how joe schmidt 's side will fare in jumping hurdle number four at the millennium stadium on saturday , the skipper 's 100th cap for his country is providing a smokescreen for teammates glad of a diversionary topic
o'connell would n't be of a mind to mention his milestone within camp himself
but still , as a topic for his comrades to pass the time with during short media sessions , it falls into perfect , anything - but - wales , territory
take toner , the leinster giant who has become o'connell 's regular second - row sidekick over the past few seasons
o'connell is preparing for his 100th cap for his country at the millennium stadium on saturday joe schmidt are chasing down a possible second grand slam in six years at the millennium stadium ask about the general mechanics of the irish lineout and the response is brief
' i do n't want to give anything away about lineout strategies , ' he says
enquire about the centurion , though , and there 's , eventually , much greater pep to his patter
' there 's not much more to be said that has n't already been said about paulie
he 's a world - class player and i do n't think i 'd be the player i am today without having played with him
' i 've learned so much from all the second rows i 've played with , especially leo cullen and o'connell
he 's a massive leader in the squad , just a massive player on the pitch and players look up to him , ' says toner , who admits to closely watching o'connell 's ruck clear - outs as something he 'd like to replicate
o'connell gets angry during the ireland training session at kingspan stadium in belfast , northern ireland ' just to get to 100 caps is a huge testament to how he has looked after himself and to play at the top level for that long ( since his debut against wales in 2002 ) is unbelievable
' it was more intimidating playing against him for the first time because i did n't really fancy it to be honest , ' continues toner , adding that this provincial level fear has eroded now that they are test colleagues
' he would n't be in my head now â¦ but he 's kind of like joe schmidt ( joe schmidt ) in that you need to know your detail or he gets on top of you
that 's a hugely good thing
' more players should be doing it
he has driven standards along with joe schmidt â¦ the two of them just drive the squad
you do n't want to disappoint either of them
' ross is another not shy about chipping in his tuppence - worth about the ireland captain who lifted the six nations trophy in paris last year
james haskell on the loose ball ahead of toner and jordi murphy during the six nations o'connell looks on after his teams victory during the six nations match between northern ireland and england ' he has always led from the front
he might look a bit mad from the sidelines but he has always got this calm head
if things are going south , paulie is a good man to bring everything back under check , ' says the veteran tighthead about his fellow 35 - year - old
' when he was playing for munster , i was over in fermoy playing junior two or something like that
the first time i came into contact with him was at a munster under 20s training session
he has always stood out , ' recalls ross
' i remember watching him take the park for a pre-season friendly , coming on for mick o'driscoll
he was an impressive physical specimen even then
' then he makes his debut against wales and scores a try that he does n't remember ( due to concussion )
ireland captain o'connell during the ireland training session at kingspan stadium in belfast , northern ireland ' he has always made an impression whenever he gets the chance
it 's a testament to the career he has had and the esteem in which he is held that he will now get his 100th cap
' he 's always looking for more at training sessions
' he was questioning me this week on what bind feels best in a particular scrum
even now he 's still looking for new things
' the o'connell theme done and dusted , it 's on to the more serious business at hand - successfully defending the championship
this time last year , ireland were picking up the pieces following their lost triple crown match at twickenham which left them gunning for just the six nations title
italy 's prop martin castrogiovanni is tackled by toner during the six nations clash at the olympic stadium however , while they now still have everything to play for after three championship wins stretched their overall unbeaten run to a record equalling 10 matches , toner does n't feel there is a different dynamic to 2015 's round four preparations - even though ' grand slam ' is the phrase on every ireland supporter 's lips
' i do n't think there is much difference
if we look at it now , it 's semifinal and final time , so we are in a good place
' it 's similar to last year
if we win the two games , we win the championship and the grand slam , ' says toner , adding that the growing hype outside their secluded carton house base is largely passing him by , save for last sunday 's visit to his old north kildare stomping ground
' i do n't really read the newspaper or see much that goes on
obviously people want to talk about it but i 'm just naturally relaxed about it
it does n't really faze me
' i do n't really get hyped up at all
