the deaths of three people who developed a foodborne illness linked to some blue bell ice cream products has prompted the texas icon 's first product recall in its 108 - year history
five people , in all , developed listeriosis in kansas after eating products from one production line at the blue bell creamery in brenham , texas , according to a statement friday from the fda
the fda says listeria bacteria were found in samples of blue bell chocolate chip country cookies , great divide bars , sour pop green apple bars , cotton candy bars , scoops , vanilla stick slices , almond bars and moo bars
there appeared to be some uncertainty as to where the patients acquired the listeria bacterial infection
according to a friday statement from the cdc , all five of the people sickened were receiving treatment for unrelated health issues at the same kansas hospital before developing listeriosis , ' a finding that strongly suggests their infections ( with listeria bacteria ) were acquired in the hospital , ' the cdc said
of those five , information was available from four on what foods they had eaten in the month before the infection
all four had consumed milkshakes made with a single - serving blue bell ice cream product called ' scoops ' while they were in the hospital , the cdc said
' scoops , ' as well as the other suspect blue bell items , are mostly food service items and not produced for retail , said paul cruse , ceo of the brenham creamery
blue bell says its regular moo bars were untainted , as were its half gallons , quarts , pints , cups , three - gallon ice cream and take - home frozen snack novelties the cdc said the listeria isolated from specimens taken from four of the five patients at via christi st. francis hospital in wichita , kansas , matched strains isolated from blue bell products obtained this year in south carolina and texas
the five patients became ill with listeriosis during their hospitalizations for unrelated causes between december 2013 and january 2015 , said hospital spokeswoman loving
' via christi was not aware of any listeria contamination in the blue bell ice cream products and immediately removed all blue bell products from all via christi locations once the potential contamination was discovered , ' loving said in a statement friday to the associated press
via christi has eight hospitals in kansas and oklahoma
blue bell handles all of its own distribution and customer service , cruse said , so it moved to pull suspect products from shelves , most of them institutional , as soon as it was alerted to the south carolina contamination feb. 13
cruse did not suspect handling of those products after they left the texas creamery
' the only time it can be contaminated is at the time of production , ' he said
that contamination has been traced to a machine that extrudes the ice cream into forms and onto cookies , and that machine remains off line , he said
all products now on store and institution shelves are safe and wholesome , cruse said
however , ' contaminated ice cream products may still be in the freezers of consumers , institutions , and retailers , given that these products can have a shelf life of up to 2 years , ' the cdc statement said
blue bell handles all of its own distribution and customer service , cruse said , so it moved to pull suspect products from shelves , most of them institutional cdc recommends that consumers do not eat products that blue bell removed from the market , and institutions and retailers should not serve or sell them
listeriosis is a life - threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called listeria monocytogenes , the cdc said
the disease primarily affects pregnant women and their newborns , older adults , and people with immune systems weakened by cancer , cancer treatments , or other serious conditions ( like diabetes , kidney failure , liver disease , and hiv )
rarely , people without these risk factors are affected
a person with listeriosis usually has fever and muscle aches , sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms
almost everyone who is diagnosed with listeriosis has invasive infection , meaning the bacteria spread from their intestines to the blood , causing bloodstream infection , or to the central nervous system , causing meningitis
although people can sometimes develop listeriosis up to 2 months after eating contaminated food , symptoms usually start within several days
listeriosis is treated with antibiotics , the cdc said .
