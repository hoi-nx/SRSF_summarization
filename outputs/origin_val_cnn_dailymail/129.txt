ramage , 35 , had nine organs removed in an operation dubbed the ' mother of all surgeries ' after doctors discovered she was suffering a rare form of cancer over the course of a gruelling nine - hour operation , surgeons meticulously removed 10 organs from ramage 's cancer - ravaged body
one by one they worked to rid the then 32 - year - old 's abdomen of a rare and aggressive cancer invading her stomach cavity
her right colon , spleen , gall bladder , ovaries , fallopian tubes , appendix and umbilicus or belly button were removed in their entirety
parts of her liver and diaphragm followed
the drastic operation , dubbed the ' mother of all surgeries ' , left ms ramage with a 14 - inch scar running down the centre of her body - her ' survival trophy '
she repeatedly consulted doctors complaining of painful stomach cramps
and she was repeatedly dismissed , the finger pointed at period pains , bloating , appendicitis and irritable bowel syndrome
but the true diagnosis was a grave one - a rare and aggressive cancer was invading ms ramage 's body
a doctor finally noticed a tumour on her appendix , which had burst , and covered her internal organs with jelly - like cancerous cells
experts diagnosed the rare disease pmp ( pmp ) - the same disease which claimed the life of hollywood icon audrey hepburn
she spent three weeks in hospital but has stunned medics , after making a full recovery
ms ramage , now 35 , and from bristol , said : ' the scar does n't really bother me - i see it as a survival trophy
' i have been very lucky , i have made a full recovery
' there 's nothing i ca n't do , nothing i ca n't eat or drink
' but obviously my fertility was compromised , but i still hope to have children someday with the eggs that were frozen just in time
' ms ramage 's ordeal began in the spring of 2011 when her periods became very irregular
in late summer of that year , she became very constipated and had a constant feeling like trapped wind on her right side , around her appendix
she later discovered this was the tumour on her appendix pressing against her insides
surgeons removed her colon , spleen , gall bladder , ovaries , fallopian tubes , appendix and umbilicus or belly button as well as part of her liver , kidney and diaphragm she spent three weeks in hospital but has stunned medics , after making a full recovery she went to see a doctor several times but was given a range of different diagnosis - including trapped wind and bad digestion
' i kept on being fobbed off and told it was ibs , they did n't really know what was wrong with me , ' she said
' one day i took myself to a&e , because i thought i might have appendicitis
' they said it was probably just wind , and so i felt silly , as if i was a hypochondriac
' the cancer was finally discovered after a doctor noticed dozens of abnormal white spots covering her insides during a keyhole investigative test
she said : ' then doctors thought my pains were caused by ovarian cysts , so i had scans which showed i did have cysts on my ovaries
' but it turns out that 's part and parcel of the disease
' then they inserted cameras into either side of my tummy to see what was in there
' when i came around after the procedure , i saw little white spots on the pictures , all over my bladder , uterus and bowel
they were everywhere in my body
hollywood icon audrey hepburn died from the rare disease in switzerland in january 1993 ' but after that , i did n't hear anything , so i thought it had just been the ovarian cysts , which were removed
' i was still feeling funny and not well , but i thought it must be nothing
' i went to the follow up appointment months later and the doctor said it was nothing , but about 30 minutes later i got a frantic call from him
' he said nurses had been chasing me down the corridor to catch me before i left
' he had spotted the photographs and noticed the white spots , luckily he 'd seen them
' for noticing them , i owe him my life really
it all happened very quickly after that
' ms ramage went under the knife at basingstoke hospital , one of only two hospitals in the country that specialise in treating pmp
' they discovered when they opened me up that the extent of my disease was much greater than the ct scan had suggested - the tumour was scattered everywhere , from my diaphragm , right down to my bladder , ' she said
the 35 - year - old now lives a normal life
but she faces the prospect of not being able to have children , after her fallopian tubes were removed ' they removed all the visible tumour along with the worst - affected organs including my spleen , half my large bowel , my appendix , gall bladder , ovaries and fallopian tubes , the peritoneum , a bit of my liver and they stripped the surface of my diaphragm
' they scraped some bits of disease off my bladder and uterus
' they then pumped a heated chemotherapy solution into my abdominal cavity to kill of any remaining microscopic cancer cells
' the organs removed in their entirety are not essential to sustain life
pmp ( pmp ) is a rare cancer , affecting around one in 500,000 people a year
it typically begins in the appendix , presenting as a small growth , known as a polyp
in more rare cases it is first detected in other parts of the bowel , the ovary or bladder
the polyp eventually spreads through the wall of the organ from where it has orginated
the disease spreads cancerous cells to the lining of the abdominal cavity - the peritoneum
the cancerous cells produce mucus , which collects in the abdomen as a jelly - like fluid called mucin
that fluid invades the abdominal cavity , causing tumours to spread
there are a number of possible origins of pmp , but the most common source is appendix cancer
there is no known underlying cause of pmp
many patients lack clearly defined symptoms , making the disease difficult to spot until the later stages
the most common symptoms are : source : pmp research foundation and from the critical and affected organs , the liver , kidney and diaphragm , doctors only removed what was absolutely necessary
following the surgery , ms ramage underwent another radical procedure , a chemotherapy bath
this is where the stomach cavity is filled with hot chemotherapy liquid for around 90 minutes , while the patient remains under anaesthetic
bathing the inside of the stomach with the heated chemotherapy increases the chances of the cancer cells being killed
heat at 42 â° c kills cancer cells without affecting normal , healthy cells
the 35 - year - old has made a full - recovery and now lives a normal life
but she faces the prospect of not being able to have children , after her fallopian tubes were removed
as a precaution she did have two sets of eggs frozen a few weeks before her life - changing surgery
determined to help others afflicted by the rare disease , ms ramage has now turned her focus to raising awareness of the condition
she warned the bloating of the abdomen that is one of the symptoms caused as the tumour spreads can be mistaken for ' middle - aged spread '
' the more people who know about pmp the more lives can be saved , the more people can be diagnosed and get treatment
it 's all down to a lack of awareness , ' she said
' if i had n't been diagnosed , it would have suffocated my organs and i would have died
it can be a slow growing cancer or it can kill quite quickly , it depends person to person
' ms ramage is releasing a music video which she has filmed with other pmp survivors and supporters of the condition
her creation is a 21st - century version of billy joel 's we did n't start the fire
the video will be released on youtube next week and her story can be followed on twitter with the hashtag # pmponeinamillion
