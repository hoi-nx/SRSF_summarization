parliament ended with the most tremendous , tetchy â tearful ! â squabble : should speaker john bercow 's future be decided by secret ballot ? it became a day of wondrous hysteria , tantrums , moist hankies and survival for this stinker of a speaker
labour mps and a handful of men on the right insisted that a secret ballot would be ' undemocratic '
moderate tories and lib dems argued that labour mps openly voting against john bercow feared the squeaker 's tyrannical vengeance crashing about their ears
by the end , john bercow was blubbing with relief , while his friend ( and possible successor ) walker was wailing that some beastly , beastly men had not been entirely clear with him beforehand
boo hoo ! mr walker is so widely seen as a john bercow stooge , it may not be surprising that he was kept out of the loop by john bercow 's enemies
his chin - crumpling speech , in which he said he preferred to be thought an honest fool than a clever schemer , was greeted with frenetic clapping from labour
it was soon being compared to the gettysburg address , churchill 's ' fight them on the beaches ' speech , the sermon on the mount
labour mps and john bercow 's tories nutjobs waved their order papers and accused commons leader william hague of being a soviet union dictator
bercowites leapt in the air , brandishing their pleasure and accusing the secret ballot crowd of being ' grubby ' and ' partisan '
bercow supporters had been taken by surprise on wednesday evening by a cunning ploy from westminster 's very own baldrick , government chief whip michael gove
a secret ballot may have looked harmless
we all have one in the coming general election
' labour mps and john bercow 's tories nutjobs waved their order papers and accused commons leader william hague ( pictured ) of being a soviet union dictator ' but labour â which regards john bercow as a client speaker â saw that a secret ballot would give its own mps the cloak of anonymity
that would make them impossible to whip
labour mps were therefore hauled back from the furthest ends of the kingdom to save the speaker for socialism
at this point you will say ' well , naturally john bercow must have let one of his deputies chair the debate , as it would have been improper for him to supervise it himself '
you do not know this man
of course he chaired it ! and he did so in the most hilariously biased fashion , calling a succession of his mates
labour delayed the debate , thus allowing its troops to get back from their constituencies
how did they do this ? by asking the speaker to give them urgent questions
three , to be precise
each of these devices use up precious time and made john bercow 's survival more likely
a tories moderate , barker ( bexhill & battle ) , muttered ' oh , rubbish ' while one of mr john bercow 's supporters was speaking
a smiling john bercow snarled at mr barker that ' it is better to remain silent and look a fool than to remove any doubt '
this was an authentic bercow moment â that combination of sneer and fake amusement catching his character perfectly
sir gerald ( lab , gorton ) , in a prince of wales - check suit that will have made tv screens wobble , made a pro-bercow speech of such acidity , it must have corroded the pinky gums at the bottom of his ancient , yellowing fangs
sir gerald is likely to be the next father of the house and will therefore be in charge of the house when it has a chance to approve john bercow 's continued existence in the chair
how convenient ! was yesterday 's plot driven by partisanship ? it was certainly driven by hatred of john bercow , who was elected in 2009 amid sly partisanship by labour
the once great chair of our elected legislature has never looked so tawdry
the tories should run a candidate against bercow in buckingham
