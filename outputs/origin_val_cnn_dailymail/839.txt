zachary chesser now lives in the supermax prison in florence , colorado
his wife , a ugandan diplomat 's daughter named nzabanita , had to leave the us in early 2011 after pleading guilty to lying about his plans the year before
the fate of their baby , talhah , now five , remains at the center of a dispute being heard in federal appellate court this week
zachary chesser is suing the fbi and his own mother , alleging that agents interfered with his parental rights by conspiring with his mother and her partner to ensure that the boy could not travel to jordan to live with his wife
instead , the boy is being raised by his mother , barbara chesser , a senior lawyer in the office of the attorney general in the dc. , and her partner , who is also named as a defendant
zachary chesser was behind bars and nzabanita was facing deportation when his mother initiated custody proceedings , but both still enjoyed full parental rights , and they ' opposed placing the young boy with his grandparents , who did not share zachary chesser and his wife 's conservative islam beliefs , ' his court - appointed attorney , lafond , says in their appeal
but zachary chesser is not seeking custody
instead , he wants monetary damages
zachary chesser and his wife planned to travel together to somalia where he would join al-shabab extremists ( file picture of al-shabab fighters ) talhah was born in november 2009 to zachary chesser and his wife , a woman he met at a mosque in dc. , dc. they planned to travel together to somalia where he would join al-shabab , but nzabanita 's mother hid her passport
then , in the summer of 2010 , they tried again
this time , nzabanita dropped off zachary chesser and the baby to make the trip without her
soon , they were both arrested
zachary chesser was facing a lengthy prison sentence , and nzabanita struck a plea deal requiring her to leave the country , likely for good
according to zachary chesser 's complaint , agents monitoring his prison conversations in january 2011 tipped off barbara chesser that the young couple was making plans for a friend to take the boy to jordan and join nzabanita there
zachary chesser 's complaint states that agents went to the airport to stop that trip
soon thereafter , barbara chesser won full custody of the boy after a judge declared zachary chesser and nzabanita to be unfit parents
lafond argues that the fbi had no business disclosing the content of his conversations to intervene in a family custody dispute
' prisoners largely lose the right to keep secrets from the government , ' he wrote , but ' they retain the right to keep those secrets from those outside the government
' jailed : zachary chesser ( pictured ) now lives in the supermax prison in florence , colorado zachary chesser was acting as his own lawyer when he first sued , in 2013
judge o'grady dismissed that complaint , which remains under seal , as delusional and irrational
zachary chesser then amended his complaint , saying the essential facts remain accurate
' it might not be particularly normal for the fbi to become so involved in a child custody proceeding ... but the scenarios described in the amended complaint are far from fanciful , ' he wrote
o'grady again dismissed the lawsuit , saying zachary chesser had no expectation of privacy for conversations that occurred in a prison setting and therefore no reason to object when the fbi disclosed the conversation to his mother
the 4th us circuit court of appeals in richmond appointed lafond to handle zachary chesser 's appeal
' nothing alleged by zachary chesser is irrational or incredible
zachary chesser 's complaint alleges that government agents misused confidential information they had gathered about him , ' lafond wrote
lawyers for the fbi agents want a ruling that their actions are completely legal
they wrote that no precedent exists ' remotely suggesting that the disclosure of a parent 's travel plans for a child can violate the parent 's constitutional right to privacy , ' especially when the disclosure revolves around plans to relocate a child out of the country ahead of a custody hearing
barbara chesser did not return calls seeking comment
this damages dispute is just the latest turn in the saga
addressing zachary chesser at his sentencing in 2011 , o'grady said he ' took just a shocking leap from a high - school athlete to a highly energized traitor
' zachary chesser 's lawyers described a young man casting about for an identity , throwing himself headlong into whatever hobby consumed him
he joined a korean breakdancing team , and became so fascinated with japan anime that he spent four years studying japan and traveled to japan on a school trip
then , he converted to islam after becoming infatuated during his senior year with the daughter of somalia immigrants
that ended when he demanded they marry
zachary chesser 's divorced father said his son became so radical , he was ' even wearing some type of loin cloth in place of underwear
' zachary chesser 's name resurfaced earlier this year when the fbi named a ' close associate ' of his in northern virginia , liban mohamed , to its list of most - wanted terrorists .
