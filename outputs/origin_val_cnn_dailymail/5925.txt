children are suffering damage to their hearts as early as 12 due to poor diets , a study has warned
researchers found most people start life with robust heart health , but can lose it quickly through unhealthy eating habits
the us study showed few children under the age of 12 had an ideal diet and almost a third ( 30 per cent ) were overweight or even obese
the researchers said the better equipped children are to make healthy choices , the healthier their hearts will be in adulthood
study senior author lloyd-jones , professor and chair of preventive medicine at the northwestern university feinberg school of medicine in chicago , said : â our findings indicate that , in general , children start with pretty good blood pressure
they said few children under the age of 12 taking part had an ideal diet , and almost a third were overweight or even obese ( file picture posed by model ) â but if they have a horrible diet , it will drive a worsening body mass index ( bmi ) and cholesterol levels
â the better we can equip our children to make healthy choices , the more cardiovascular health will be preserved into adulthood
â and those who preserve their heart health into middle age live much longer and are much healthier while they live
â researchers examined bmi , healthy diet , total cholesterol and blood pressure â four of the seven components of heart health â in children aged two to 11
in the sample of 8,961 children , the researchers found that all children had at least one ideal measure , but none had all four
an ideal diet score was the least prevalent health indicator , with less than one per cent of children having four or five of the five components of a healthy diet
the experts warned people are losing a lot of ' intrinsic ' heart health very early in life , setting them up to be unhealthy adults the five indicators of a healthy diet include low intake of sugar - sweetened drinks and salt , and high intake of wholegrains , fish , plus fruit and vegetables
fewer than 10 per cent ate the recommended amounts of fruit and veg of more than 4.5 cups or more per day or fish , and wholegrains were the least frequently achieved component with just three per cent of boys and 2.4 per cent of girls hitting the target
ninety per cent ate more salt than recommended , and more than half consumed more than the recommended number of calories from sugar - sweetened drinks
around four out of ten of the children had â poor â or â intermediate â cholesterol levels , according to the findings published in the journal circulation : cardiovascular quality and outcomes
researchers found ideal blood pressure was the most common favourable measure of cardiovascular health , ranging from 88 per cent to 93 per cent across sex and racial groups
previous studies have shown worsening indicators of cardiovascular health , starting in adolescence and continuing through adulthood
dr lloyd-jones added : â we really need better surveillance data , especially in children
â information on physical activity , blood glucose and smoking or exposure to second - hand smoke are not available for younger children
â without knowing how much physical activity a child is doing , and therefore how many calories are needed , we ca nât scale the diet metrics to a child âs needs
â so we used the adult metrics , but understand that it would be difficult for a five - year - old to take in as many fruits and vegetables as an adult
â the bottom line is that we need even better data , but what we do see is that we are losing an awful lot of our intrinsic cardiovascular health very early in life , which sets us up to be unhealthy adults
