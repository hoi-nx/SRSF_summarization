a beautiful snowy owl has been captured scouring a snow - covered field in the hunt for food

the stunning set of images was captured by photographer rick dobson
a beautiful snowy owl was captured gliding inches above a snow - covered field in ottawa , canada , in the hunt for food , with her bright yellow eyes just visible above the wing the 57 - year - old said : ' she had in fact spotted her prey and was coming in silently for the kill
' snowy owls are diurnal so they hunt and are active both during the day and night
' when they are resting they often sit in a snow - covered field motionless , making themselves very hard to spot
' when they are hunting they will perch on a lump in a field , a fence post , or a hydro - pole where they have a lookout from which to spot their prey
' as the owl came over the top of a ledge she pulled her wings back so she could soar across the field the stunning set of images was captured by photographer rick dobson who said : ' she had in fact spotted her prey and was coming in silently for the kill ' the owl flew silently just millimetres above the snow - covered floor , keeping her bright eyes on the prey to get close enough to the owls , mr rick dobson had to make sure he approached slowly and did not walk directly towards the birds
he said : ' every winter i go out with my binoculars and scan the farmers ' fields to see if i can locate wintering snowy owls
' when i locate an owl i have to spend time slowly approaching it to get within a good distance to take photographs
when the owl got close enough she used her sharp talons to catch her prey
snowy owls will usually fly a short distance before landing to eat snowy owls often approach their prey from a low angle to ensure a shadow does not give the game away ' some owls are much more approachable than others
' upon repeated visits the owls come to realise that i am not a threat and will ignore me , providing i move slowly , and carry on with its business
' mr rick dobson described the owls as ' one of the most magnificent creatures on earth '
' i think of them as snow ghosts or snow angels , ' he said
' they are very large birds but fly silently and gracefully and can endure the harshest of habitats
happy with its work : mr rick dobson added : ' snowy owls are one of the most magnificent creatures on earth '
the beautiful bird is pictured after the hunt ' they are powerful and regal and , to me , symbolise the arctic
' snowy owls fly silently when they hunt and often approach their prey from a low angle
they use their sharp talons to catch animals and will usually fly a short distance before landing to eat
snowy owls tend to swallow their food whole and will return to hunt after eating .
