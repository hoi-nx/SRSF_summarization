an indiana jury sentenced a woman who says she had a miscarriage to 20 years in prison
in 2013 , purvi patel showed up at a hospital emergency room suffering from severe vaginal bleeding
according to court documents , at first she denied that she had been pregnant but later told doctors that she had a miscarriage and delivered a stillborn fetus which , she said , she placed in a bag in a dumpster
purvi patel was later charged with feticide and felony neglect of a dependent , though these charges are decidedly contradictory
" feticide " would require purvi patel to have terminated a pregnancy while the fetus was still in the womb
on the other hand , " felony neglect of a dependent " requires delivering a live fetus and then neglecting it
as amanda marcotte of slate pointed out in february , purvi patel " was convicted both of killing a baby and killing a fetus
" the only thing more preposterous than this is that purvi patel was charged in the first place
the evidence against her has been shaky from the start
initially , police questioned purvi patel when she was still in the hospital without an attorney present
prosecutors would later introduce text messages indicating that purvi patel had purchased miscarriage - inducing drugs , but there was no evidence purvi patel took the drugs
in fact , they did n't show up in blood tests just after she miscarried
nonetheless , after five hours of deliberation , a jury convicted purvi patel of two entirely contradictory crimes based on entirely circumstantial evidence
and on march 30 , 2015 , she was given a 30 - year - sentence on the felony neglect charge , 10 of which were suspended
she 'll serve a concurrent six - year sentence for feticide
purvi patel is the second pregnant woman to be charged under indiana 's anti-choice " feticide " law
in 2011 , shuai was charged with feticide after she attempted to commit suicide when she was eight months pregnant
in 2013 , lawyers announced shuai had reached a plea agreement just before her trial was set to begin
still , both cases presented troubled pregnant women who needed help from medical authorities and their government
but indiana 's harsh anti-abortion laws , and the broader culture that seeks to control the decisions pregnant women can make about their own bodies , make women far less likely to reach out for this help
conservatives like to say that women are the " victims of abortion " and that laws such as the indiana " feticide " measure are intended to " protect " them
years ago , the president of the anti-choice susan b. anthony list made assurances that the specter of women being prosecuted and jailed under anti-choice laws was nothing more than fearmongering by pro-choice activists
the website of the ohio right to life association similarly argues that " no one is interested in sending women to jail
" and in fact , the indiana " feticide " law was plainly intended to criminalize " knowing or intentional termination of another 's pregnancy
" but there 's no escaping the reality it has been used to turn pregnant women into criminals
so much for not sending women to jail
those who care about the rights of pregnant women should be deeply concerned
after all , purvi patel was convicted based on text messages about miscarriage - inducing drugs , not evidence she had used or even purchased such drugs
in shuai 's case , it was presumed that the intent of her attempted suicide was to terminate her pregnancy and thus she was charged with feticide
so what else might be considered a " deliberate attempt " to terminate one 's own pregnancy ? if a woman knew about the risks of too vigorous exercise and miscarriage but exercised anyway ? merely googling abortion - inducing drugs ? telling a friend you 've thought about having an abortion ? the message from purvi patel 's conviction is clear
after all , there have always been and will always be women who try to terminate their pregnancies
laws like indiana 's and cases like purvi patel 's do n't change that
what they do is make women hide , avoid medical attention and put their lives at even greater risk
in texas , which last year enacted some of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in the nation and shuttered the majority of its abortion services clinics , abortion rates have indeed declined but not in proportion to the severity of such measures
researchers suggest that 's partly because rates of self - abortion , which then go unreported in the statistics , are increasing
and anecdotal evidence suggests this is the case
before roe v. wade made abortion legal in the united states , according to the guttmacher institute , the number of illegal abortions in the 1950s and 1960s ranged from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year
new anti-choice restrictions and prosecutions wo n't change the fact that women will sometimes choose to terminate their pregnancies
it simply restricts their options to do so
ask yourself : in the case of purvi patel , even if she did intend to self - abort and used black market drugs to do so , and if she indeed delivered a live fetus , would n't we want to live in a society where she would bring that baby to the hospital for life - saving medical attention rather than be so afraid of prosecution that she threw it in a dumpster ? purvi patel is reportedly appealing her conviction
we should all appeal to logic and sanity and compassion and repeal these horrid anti-choice , anti-pregnancy laws .
