how refreshing it was to see welbeck properly celebrate scoring for arsenal against former club man united on monday night
the striker 's passion was clear to see as he bounded backwards across the old trafford turf , letting out a roar of celebration as alexis sanchez and santi cazorla rushed over to celebrate the moment
' the emotion takes over , ' he said afterwards
' it was difficult to keep it in
welbeck had every reason to celebrate and let all that pent - up frustration out
a pumped - up welbeck celebrates his winner for arsenal at former club man united the arsenal striker celebrates with team - mates alexis sanchez and santi cazorla after scoring at man united since the age of eight , he was booted out the door in the summer by louis van gaal , who claimed he was n't good enough to be a first team player at man united
so , on his first return to old trafford , welbeck had a major point to prove and when antonio valencia under - hit a back pass to goalkeeper david de gea , he seized his chance
skilfully taking the ball around the spaniard , he passed it into an empty net before celebrating whole - heartedly but still with plenty of respect for the man united fans
welbeck could certainly teach these players , who took the whole not celebrating against a former club thing a little too seriously
shaun wright-phillips ( chelsea vs qpr , january 2013 ) shaun wright-phillips was n't wanted by chelsea
they spent Â£ 21m to sign him and then kept him as a bit - part player until finally ditching him three years later having wasted the best years of his career
so when the winger earned qpr an improbable win at stamford bridge during their 2013 relegation struggle , with his first league goal in nearly three years , you 'd expect him to be thrilled
shaun wright-phillips looked downright miserable , an island of indifference as his team - mates celebrated jubilantly around him
shaun wright-phillips ( third right ) looked downright miserable after scoring for qpr at old club chelsea adam johnson ( sunderland vs city , december 2012 ) likewise with adam johnson , who had great expectations when he joined city from middlesbrough in 2010 but was barely given a chance by roberto mancini
indeed , adam johnson revealed when he escaped to sunderland that he was barely on speaking terms with the italian manager towards the end , having been dropped without explanation on a number of occasions during a turbulent two - and - a - half years
so when adam johnson gained his revenge by scoring the winner against city a few months after leaving , you 'd expect something a bit more animated than just a raised hand of apology
adam johnson consoles his former team - mate joe hart after scoring against him in december 2012 lukaku ( west brom vs everton , september 2014 ) opening your account for a new club , especially after a Â£ 28m move , should be kind of a big deal
but lukaku looked embarassed that his maiden goal for everton had come at west brom , the club where he spent the 2012 - 13 season on loan from chelsea
still , at least he earned an appreciative round of applause from the hawthorns crowd for his sheepish raised hand ' celebration
' lukaku holds his hands up after scoring for everton against west brom , where he spent a year on loan jonjo shelvey ( liverpool vs swansea , february 2014 ) jonjo shelvey made 47 league appearances for liverpool over the course of his three seasons there , scoring two goals
hardly the stuff of kop folklore
but the midfielder felt the need to apologise to the anfield crowd after scoring a lovely 20 - yard goal on his return there with swansea last year
it did earn him a round of applause from the liverpool fans though
