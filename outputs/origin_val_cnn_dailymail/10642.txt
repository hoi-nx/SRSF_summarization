maybe something slipped out of disneyland 's haunted mansion ? that 's one explanation for a video of happy ' ghost ' playing around after - hours in the park 's surveillance footage
as the footage suggests , the ghost is able to walk across grass and sidewalks without tourists in the way
the video originally went up on youtube in 2009 , but is drawling speculation again in a new reddit thread from user _ littlehelll
' maybe they were still re-using vhs tapes and the static image came through from previous recordings
like a lone janitor or something
it is compelling in any case , ' speculated reddit user macaface
' if i become a ghost when i die i 'd probably cruise walt disney for a couple years too , ' offered ricdan
still others think it 's the specter of walt disney
some believe it could be the ghost of walt disney
