isis apparently claimed responsibility thursday for the deadly terrorist attack at a landmark museum in the heart of that country 's capital , a mass shooting that has shaken the birthplace of the arab spring and stirred questions about militants in the country
in an audio statement posted online thursday , isis identified two men -- abu zakariya al-tunisi and abu anas al-tunisi -- it said used " automatic weapons and hand grenades " to kill and injure what it called " crusaders and apostates " in the bardo museum in tunis
tunisian health minister aidi said 23 people are believed to have been killed , including at least one who died at a hospital overnight
and that bloodshed , the isis message warned , is " just the start
" cnn can not independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement
a u.s. official told cnn there is no reason to doubt the claim 's authenticity
that said , u.s. officials are checking the platform that the statement went out on , including the extent to which it 's tied to the group calling itself the islamic state
the current u.s. thinking is the attack may have been carried out by local " franchise " adherents to isis , rather than centrally directed by the islamist extremist group 's leadership , which is now thought to be in syria
the two attackers were carrying explosives , tunisian president beji caid essebsi said in an interview thursday with the french broadcaster tf1
he credited tunisian security forces for responding so quickly to the attack to avoid a larger tragedy because " terrible explosives were found on these ( attackers ) and they did n't have time to use them
" tunisian has been viewed as the lone democratic success story in the arab spring
but the north african nation is not without its issues , including an uneven economy and the distinction of having more citizens -- up to 3,000 tunisian -- thought to have gone to iraq and syria to fight as jihadists than any other country , according to the international centre for the study of radicalization in london
authorities there have already arrested nine people in connection with wednesday 's attack , including four directly linked to the bloodshed , according to a statement from essebsi
earlier thursday , tunisian prime minister essid identified two suspects , labidi and saber khachnaou , in an interview with french radio station rtl
it 's not clear if those two men were the pair killed at the museum by tunisian security forces , or if it 's possible they 're the same people as those identified -- using new names -- in isis ' audio statement
labidi was " known to the security services , he was flagged and monitored , " essid said
but he added the man was n't known or being followed for anything special
the siege took place just days after a tunisian jihadist tweeted that a pledge of allegiance to al-baghdadi , the leader of isis , was coming soon , according to the site intelligence group , which monitors terrorist propaganda
in his message , the jihadist claimed to belong to jund al-khilafah in tunisian , a group that in december pledged allegiance to isis , even though that vow had n't seemed to have fully registered with the islamist extremist group
his post comes after an isis fighter in the extremist group 's stronghold of raqqa in syria recently appeared in a video questioning why militants in tunisian had not pledged fealty
" this raises the possibility that the museum attack could be isis ' debut on the tunisian stage , timed to precede a pledge of allegiance from tunisian jihadis for maximum impact , " cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank said
the attack may have been in and about tunisian , but the vast majority of the victims were foreigners
they came from various backgrounds , from a spanish couple to a colombian mother and son
in addition to those pairs , the dead included three italians , three japanese , two french , two poles , a belgian , a russian and a briton , according to cruise ship companies and their respective governments
three tunisian , one of them a security officer and another a job applicant , also were killed , according to aidi
twelve of those killed had been aboard the splendida , a cruise ship with more than 3,700 passengers and nearly 1,300 crew that docked in tunis hours before the bloodshed , its parent company said in a statement
five more victims came from a similar vessel , the fascinosa , which was at port in the tunisian capital at the same time , according to costa cruises
another 36 people remain hospitalized , while eight others were treated and released
the bardo had been a logical stop for these tourists , housed next to tunisian 's parliament in a 19th century palace and cast as a " jewel of tunisian heritage , " with its exhibits showcasing the country 's art , culture and history
its prominent place in tunisian 's economy -- which banks heavily on tourism , with millions visiting the country each year -- also made it a logical target for terrorists
" they hit the heart of our livelihood , " said mohammed ali troudi , a taxi driver in tunis
it 's too early to tell how tourists will react to the attack
both the splendida and the fascinosa have since left tunis , even as the search continues for some of their missing passengers -- at least four from the splendida and two from the fascinosa , according to their respective companies
the question is whether more passenger - packed cruise ships , as well as commercial airliners filled with tourists , will come to tunisian in the future
travelers warned of risks as tunisian reels from attack the economy and terrorism are linked in tunisian , in the sense that high youth unemployment and sparse opportunities are thought to have contributed to the large numbers becoming jihadists -- whether abroad or at home
attacking what tunisian lawmaker ghoubantini called " a symbol of sovereignty in tunisian " likely wo n't help
" it 's really sad , " ghoubantini told cnn from tunis , " and i hope that it wo n't really affect our economy
" the government has been battling a jihadist presence in the chaambi mountains
and in february , the country 's interior ministry announced the arrests of about 100 alleged extremists and published a video allegedly showing that the group possessed a formula for making explosives and a photograph of isis leader al-baghdadi
mehrezia labidi , another parliamentarian , says it 's imperative that the message gets across to would - be jihadists that " life in democracy is better than " what terrorist recruiters are telling them
" we have really to work on the culture , the level of ideas , " she said
meanwhile , she and others stressed that the vast majority of tunisian -- including secular - minded citizens and moderate islamists -- need to come together for their country and against these extremist views and tactics
" they are trying to terrify us
but the whole tunisian people is unified -- all the parties , all the civil society organizations , all the countries are unified , " ghoubantini said
" ... i 'm sure that we will fight terrorism and that we will really eradicate it from our country
