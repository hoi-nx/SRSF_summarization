sunderland boss advocaat will not come up against old adversary louis van gaal during the final nine matches of the premier league season
it is thought the dutch pair - who famously posed with models painted in their clubs ' respective strips during the 1995 - 96 eredivisie season - have a good relationship despite a rivalry which dates back to the mid-nineties when advocaat âs psv and van gaal âs ajax were vying for domestic honours
but the new sunderland coach has had his say on his compatriot âs first season at man united
advocaat and louis van gaal , pictured posing with models in 1995 , are said to have a good relationship advocaat and van gaal were in charge of dutch giants psv and ajax respectively twenty years ago advocaat , pictured celebrating an az alkmaar goal in 2013 , has been named the new sunderland manager speaking on studio voetbal in holland last month , advocaat said : â firstly , let âs be clear , louis is a fantastic coach
â but after spending â¬ 200m in the summer , he should not be complaining and should have made sure that his team were in the top two
â and it has nât happened
â it was advocaat who replaced van gaal as national - team boss when holland failed to qualify for the world cup in 2002 , subsequently guiding them to the semi-finals of euro 2004
but it is the old trafford chief who has the edge when it comes to silverware in their homeland
van gaal has four titles and one dutch cup , while advocaat has just one league crown and one cup success
they have each won the johan cruyff shield three times
man united are in the race for a top four spot but advocaat believes the club should be in the top two advocaat insists van gaal can not complain this season having spent big at old trafford this summer
