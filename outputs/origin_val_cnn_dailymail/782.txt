khan , who has yet to agree his next opponent after missing out on securing a bout with floyd mayweather , believes the american will emerge victorious against manny pacquaio on may 2
khan told sky sports news : ' it 's going to be a great fight and i think five years ago it would have been ever better because they were both at their peak and it was a fight that everyone was dying to see
khan trains in the gym as speculation continues over who his next opponent will be khan hits devon alexander during their welterweight bout at the mgm grand garden arena last year ' since then manny pacquaio has had two defeats
he âs been knocked out once by ( juan manuel ) marquez and then he got beat by ( timothy ) bradley which was a little controversial , but i think floyd mayweather will take the fight
' he will be much smarter and he âll pick his shots a little bit better
he âll make it a little boring at times because manny pacquaio , as we know , is a come - forward fighter who likes to do a lot of punches
' but floyd mayweather will try to avoid all those punches and just maybe throw that one shot that will count and then move away again
' i âve been watching floyd mayweather train on social media and he has been training very hard so he might come up with a different gameplan this fight , something that we have not seen before .
