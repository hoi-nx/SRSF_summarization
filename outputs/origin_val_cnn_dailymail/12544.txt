kuala lumpur , malaysian jaquita gonzales still tries to call her husband on his cellphone
a pair of work shoes still sits outside the front door of their home in kuala lumpur waiting to be reclaimed
his uniform still hangs in a cupboard
twelve months after mh370 vanished without a trace , jaquita gonzales has n't given up hope
neither can her children , other family members and friends
not until there is some conclusive evidence on the fate of the airliner -- one way or another
" now and then , every once in a while i call his phone and it goes to voicemail , " she says
" you never know , he might pick it up , or someone who has them would let them have the phone and you know , the hope is still there
" she 's not alone
families of victims we spoke to hold on to the slimmest belief that mh370 , which disappeared barely an hour into its flight from kuala lumpur to beijing on march 8 last year , did not crash and that the 239 passengers and crew on board are alive
" no evidence means there is still a little bit of hope
we tap into that hope in order to go on day by day , " says jaquita gonzales
but she lives a life in limbo
neither able to move on , nor go back
her comfortable home in the suburbs of malaysian 's capital remains virtually the same since her husband of nearly 30 years , patrick , left for work on the evening of march 7 as lead purser on the mh370 red - eye bound for the chinese capital
the only real sign that time has moved on , amid the family photos and plaques celebrating her husband 's work achievements is a newspaper on top of a stack in the living room with the word " lost " splashed across its front page
gonzales ' lifeline , apart from family , is her work
she runs a private school and daycare center for about 70 children and spends about 12 hours a day there
keeping busy , she says , keeps her sane
but not a day goes by without her thinking of patrick
" i can be driving and i just have to pull off the road and weep
everywhere i go i see patrick , " she says
" in our home , with my children , with our friends
there are so many times around the home when i say patrick you are supposed to be doing this for me , where are you
he helped me with ironing , with cooking
" like jaquita gonzales , many other families cnn has spoken to say they live in hope that their loved one are still alive even though it seems now a virtual impossibility
but along with hope and the pain , many families also share a deep anger
anger at the malaysian authorities and malaysia airlines who , jaquita gonzales says , are ignoring them
requests for information are unanswered and attempts to talk to key officials are rebuffed , she says
grace 's mother was on mh370
for almost a year she and her family grieved in private
but now she has gone public after what she describes as the malaysian authorities continued " mishandling " of the disappearance
" there is a lack of transparency , a lack of communications between us and the relevant authorities , ' she says
" whenever we 've written to them or asked them for answers they have never replied
" it 's not like they have n't learned
i would put it that they just do n't care
they just want to move on
they do n't really care about what we feel or what we have to say
" one recent decision by malaysian authorities has caused bitter resentment among many families
in late january , the government televised a pre-recorded announcement from the civil aviation chief that the passengers and crew of mh370 were " presumed lost " after the plane crashed as a result of an accident
families were not been given any advance warning of the announcement and , even though it clears the way for compensation claims , they say there is just no evidence to support the statement
it also came just before chinese new year , a time of celebration
more than 150 passengers on the flight were chinese nationals
to add insult to injury , families say , the government had planned to make the announcement at a press conference but canceled the briefing when next - of - kin rushed to the venue
nathan says she only heard that the government was planning to make the statement when local media rang her
" they rang to say ' can we come and record your reaction when this declaration is made ? ' our reaction was ' what declaration ? ' we did n't know anything about it
" i have n't spoken to the media at all since the accident happened but after that treatment i decided it was time that we said something
it was a group decision that we speak to the media because ( the authorities ) never respond to anything we write to them or ask them about , " she adds
cnn contacted both the malaysian government and malaysia airlines for a response to the families ' claims , but did not receive an answer
for relatives like jaquita gonzales and nathan , each day is a struggle , a struggle to stop being overwhelmed by memories
" i am just going through the motions , ' says grace
" i am dead inside , i have stopped being happy
every day basically i just force myself to get through the day
