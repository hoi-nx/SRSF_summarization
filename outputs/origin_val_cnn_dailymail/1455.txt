' every time we lost the ball it was sent up to the edge of our box so we had to fight and scrap for second balls
' it was a scrappy match defensively but we proved we can do that side of the game and then once you 've done that , you have the opportunity to hit teams on the counter attack , which we tried to do
' there was probably not as much football played as we usually like but there 's no problem winning like that as well

i thought he was at his best and we dealt with all their situations quite well
the winger slots home the crucial goal to move the toffees closer to safety with the win at loftus road ' it was always going to be difficult with the pitch as it is and with the way they played
