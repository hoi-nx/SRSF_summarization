looks - based dating website beautifulpeople.com hit the headlines recently when it ejected 3,000 members for letting themselves go
and now the site obsessed with beauty is facing an ugly backlash after thousands of people have started trolling the site in a bid to take revenge on their elitist policies
in an attack coordinated via social media , uglies wanting to take revenge on the site have been using fake profile pictures to become members of the exclusive dating community before then attempting to subvert the system by voting in ' ugly ' people and voting out any good - looking potential members
uglies wanting to take revenge on the site have been using fake profile pictures to become members of the exclusive dating community before attempting to subvert the system last week it was revealed that beautifulpeople.com had expelled over 3,000 people for not maintaining the appearance necessary to meet the high standards expected on the site
the move was welcomed by most of the member - but angered outsiders who disagreed with the site 's selective policy
the ' ugly ' troll attack originated in russia where over 2,700 applications were made to the site in a few hours
over half of these were fake profiles and part of the ugly troll army
similar coordinated attacks have come from the united states and the uk with 1,435 united states ' trolls ' removed from the site and 400 from the uk in the past few days
beautifulpeople.com is a site that is designed only with beautifu lpeople in mind where users vote for those they think are the most attractive to stay on the site 2,700 of the recent surge in fake profiles were from russia , where the revenge campaign began greg hodge , the managing director of beautifulpeople.com , said : ' we had large spikes in numbers applying to join the site using profiles which immediately raised the suspicions of our administrators
' initially the scale of applications from specific geographical areas â russia , the united states and the uk in particular â caused concern , when we examined the applications in more detail , we noticed a large number of what appeared to be fake profile pictures
' we then traced this back to various social media sites calling for an attack on our site
' ' people had come together on forums such as reddit to discuss the site and how they could hijack it by creating the fake profiles
' this is not the first time the site has been under attack
beautifulpeople.com has been hit with ' denial of service ' attacks , and had their rating system sabotaged in 2011
in response the site has introduced new measures to verify profiles and wannabe members must now take a webcam picture of themselves holding up a piece of card with their name and date written on it recently 3,000 members were removed because organisers felt they had let themselves go
this chap is an example of somebody who would make the beautifulpeople.com grade the site introduced a system of validated membership in 2012 , whereby entrants are encouraged to take a webcam picture of themselves holding up a piece of paper with their name and date handwritten on it to prove that their pictures are genuine
validated members get a ' verification stamp ' on their profiles
prior to the attack this feature was optional , but the makers have been forced to make profile verification mandatory
beautifulpeople.com is the first dating site to force all users to prove they are genuine
greg hodge said : ' fake profiles are the number one problem in the online dating market today
' we have always led the field in combating this
in taking this next step , we believe we will all but eliminate disingenuous profiles on our site and set the example for the online dating market as a whole
online daters do not want their time wasted with fraudulent profiles
' the creators of beautifulpeople.com are husband and wife duo genevieve and greg hodge he added : ' having an exclusive dating site is not without controversy
there will always be a degree of jealousy from those who do n't make the cut
' thankfully , through swift action by our administrators , vigilant members and the introduction of an extra level of verification has meant that we have been able to root out the attackers and ensure that our site remains beautiful and exclusive
' entry to beautifulpeople.com is only possible after passing a democratic rating process , where members of the opposite sex vote ' yes definitely ' , ' hmm yes , o.k ' , ' hmm no , not really ' and ' no definitely not ' based on photographs and a brief profile submitted by new applicants
after the recent cull , over 800,000 members remain on the site , representing 190 countries and almost every ethnic and cultural background
a global average of one in ten applicants that apply to the site are accepted .
