a pub landlord has been fined Â£ 15,000 for employing an ' illegal immigrant ' - despite the barman having a british mother and having lived in the british for more than 50 years
hill , 50 , had been paying 56 - year old former postman jordan - a family friend over 30 years - to serve drinks and collect glasses at his manchester pub since 2009
but unknown to mr hill , mr jordan had been living in the british ' illegally ' since 1962 as he was born in the us and moved to british with his british mother when he was just three
jordan , 56 , ( right ) has lived in british since he was three years old but could be now be deported after it emerged he does n't have british citizenship
his employer , landlord hill ( right ) , has also been fined last december , eight immigration officers acting on an anonymous tip off swooped on mr hill 's pub the bay horse in denton , manchester and arrested mr jordan as he was working behind the bar
father - of - three mr jordan , known to his friends as carl , was warned he would be deported back to his birthplace , licensee mr hill was meanwhile shocked to be issued with a civil penalty notice by immigration officials for ' employing an illegal immigrant '
the fine has since been reduced to Â£ 10,000 on appeal
mr hill said : ' the whole thing is ridiculous but we do n't blame carl for any of it
he has lived here for 53 years and worked and paid his taxes since he was a teenager
how anyone can brand him an illegal immigrant is beyond me
' it would be devastated for us as this bill could send us under but it is of course more devastating for carl too if this all went through
his daughter was in here crying her eyes out the other day in the pub and he 's a loss as to what to do about it
' you hear stories of illegal immigrants being allowed to stay in the british under some crazy human rights law yet carl who has been paying his taxes all his life has been told he has to go
there seems to be no common sense about it
mr jordan ( pictured in blackpool aged six ) was born to a british mother and an us father in the us - but after his parents split up , his mother brought him back to the british now - 56 - year - old mr jordan ( pictured , centre , in blackpool aged 10 ) has lived in british ever since mr hill added : ' when you have known someone 30 years you do n't think they 're us or whatever country they come from
i just think it could have been totally avoided and handled in a different way by the home office and whoever else
' this must have cost thousands already - even to send eight enforcement officers and lock him up overnight
' mr jordan had been born in 1959 as the son of an us soldier and a british ' gi bride '
but when his parents split up three years later , he and his mother moved back to her native manchester
he was later given an us passport but did n't realise he needed british citizenship to stay in the british
after previously working as a railway guard , he has been working in mr hill 's pub since 2009
mr hill said : ' i had no knowledge at all of carl 's immigration status
it was just a bit of a joke between people that he had an us passport
' i have known him for 30 years and no - one ever thought anything of it
he explained he had an us passport because he was born over there and that 's it
he never applied for dual nationality because he did n't think he had to
' when he started working here we photocopied his british driving licence as photo id and had a p46 from his last job which had his national insurance number on
they were the only checks we thought we had to do
' he has been left facing potential deportation after immigration officials told him he has no right to live here his employer , pub landlord hill , is furious after he was hit with a Â£ 10,000 bill for employing him mr hill added : ' i was at the bank on the day carl got arrested and got phonecall off immigration saying i needed to go back to the pub. ' when i got back there were eight immigration officers there and four of them were interviewing carl
they shut the pub because they said they had to secure the building then interviewed me
' they asked me how long he had worked there and it seemed we should have got a copy of his passport and a photocopy of his birth certificate
we thought we had done everything by the book
' they say they have reduced the fine from Â£ 15,000 to Â£ 10,000 because i have " co-operated " but i ca n't even afford to pay Â£ 10,000 - we are a small business
' carl 's worked for big international companies but it 's me getting the brunt
i said to the police ' what about fining royal mail ? he worked there for 14 years '
they said it 's nothing to do with them it was me who was employing him at the time
' it 's just ridiculous
it 's pathetic when you realise he has paid all his taxes all these years and in two weeks time they could send him back to us where he does n't know anybody
' it 's unbelievable when you have known someone that long to hear them being called an illegal immigrant is bad enough but then to be accused of employing him as one is even worse
' the home office has defended its actions insisting mr jordan should have sorted out his immigration status mr jordan now has to report regularly to an immigration centre in salford
he said : ' i have lived here nearly all my life
i went to school here , i 've worked here for 40 years - but now i 've been told i 've been working illegally all that time , even though i 've got a national insurance number and paid my taxes
' i 've not been sleeping or eating
every time i see my daughter she cries and that sets me off
' i thought it would be alright because i 've been married here , i 've got three kids and all my family are here
i did n't think it was going to get this serious
' i was only working part time at the pub anyway but hill has had to let me go as he will get another fine if he keeps me on
' home office officials said mr jordan was warned in 2007 he needed to apply for residency but he had failed to provide enough evidence
a home office spokesman said : ' people born overseas to a british parent do not gain an automatic right to long term residency in the british , and the onus is on the individual to ensure their immigration status is free of time restrictions
' we are satisfied the penalty has been correctly issued to mr hill as mr jordan has not currently or at the time of the visit established he had permission to work in the british
' the matter of mr jordan having been employed by other organisations before taking up employment at the pub did not exempt mr hill from complying with the requirement for employers to conduct right to work checks
