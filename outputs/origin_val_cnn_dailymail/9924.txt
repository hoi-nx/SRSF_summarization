thanks to missions like nasa 's curiosity rover , we know mars once had water - but until now we did n't know how much
scientists have provided the best estimates yet , claiming it once had more water than the arctic ocean - and the planet kept these oceans for more than 1.5 billion years
the findings suggest there was ample time and water for life on mars to thrive , but over the last 3.7 billion years the red planet has lost 87 per cent of its water - leaving it barren and dry
nasa scientists in maryland have calculated how much water was once on mars
they found that 3.7 billion years ago it had more than the arctic ocean
most of this would have been in the northern hemisphere of the planet ( illustrated )
since then , 87 % of the water has been lost to space , with the rest stored in ice at the poles the study by scientists at nasa âs nasa goddard in greenbelt , maryland , is the first to determine just how much water mars had in its past
during its wet noachian period - 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago - it is estimated that it had enough water to cover the entire surface in a liquid layer 450 feet ( 137 metres ) deep
however , it âs likely that most of the water formed an ocean that occupied the northern hemisphere of mars , which would have been as deep as one mile ( 1.6km ) in places - comparable to the mediterranean sea on earth
published in the journal science , the research estimates that , in total , what is now the planet âs arid northern plains would have contained at least 12.4 million cubic miles ( 20 million cubic kilometres ) of water
microsoft âs â hololens ' headset , which allows wearers to see 3d images superimposed over their vision , may look like it belongs in a sci - fi film
and now nasa has revealed the prototype technology will be used to enable its scientists to work virtually on mars
the headset will work with onsight software to give scientists a means to plan experiments on the red planet , with the help of the curiosity rover
the software was developed jointly by the two companies , including a team at nasa âs jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california
â our study provides a solid estimate of how much water mars once had , by determining how much water was lost to space , â said dr geronimo villanueva , first author of the paper and a scientist at nasa âs nasa goddard
â with this work , we can better understand the history of water on mars
â it is thought that while 87 per cent of the water has since been lost to space , owing largely to the planet losing its atmosphere , the remaining 13 per cent resides in the ice caps
but in the past , the ocean would have covered about 20 per cent of the planet âs surface area
the most interesting conclusion , though , is that mars stayed wet for longer than previously thought , which means it was habitable for longer
â we now know that mars was wet for a much longer time than we thought before , â said dr michael mumma , co-author of the study and senior scientist at nasa goddard
â curiosity rover shows it was wet for 1.5 billion years , already much longer than the period of time needed for life to develop on earth
â and now we see that mars must have been wet for a period even longer
â during its wet noachian period , 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago , it is estimated that mars had enough water to cover the entire surface in a liquid layer 450 feet ( 137 metres ) deep
however , it âs likely that most of the water formed an ocean that occupied the northern hemisphere of mars ( illustrated ) as deep as one mile in places it is thought that while 87 % of the water has since been lost to space ( illustrated ) , owing largely to the planet losing its atmosphere , the remaining 13 % resides in the ice caps
but in the past , the ocean would have covered about 20 per cent of the planet âs surface area the research was carried out using two telescopes at the keck observatory on hawaii and the european southern observatory âs very large telescope in chile
to make the discovery , the scientists produced maps showing the distribution of normal water in the mars atmosphere and ' heavy ' water containing deuterium , a more massive form of hydrogen
by analysing the ratio of ' heavy ' to regular water they showed that mars must have lost a volume of water 6.5 times larger than the amount trapped in the present day polar ice caps
an ancient ocean containing the lost water would have covered 19 per cent of the planet âs surface
it would have had a greater volume than the arctic ocean , which contains 18,750,000 cubic kilometres ( 11.7 million cubic miles ) of water
by comparison , the atlantic ocean covers 17 per cent of the surface of the earth and contains more than 310 million cubic kilometres ( 192.6 million cubic miles )
it is possible that mars once had even more water , some of which may have been deposited below the surface
because the new maps reveal microclimates and changes in the atmospheric water content over time , they may also prove to be useful in the search for underground water
an ancient ocean on mars containing the lost water would have covered 19 per cent of the planet âs surface
it would have had a greater volume than the arctic ocean ( shown ) , which contains 18,750,000 cubic kilometres ( 11.7 million cubic miles ) of water missions like the curiosity rover ( illustrated ) have shown that mars was once wet for 1.5 billion years , but the scientists now think it had water for even longer
this is longer than the time it took life on earth to arise , providing tantalising hints that mars might once have been habitable
