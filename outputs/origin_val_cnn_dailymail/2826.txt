out there in celebrity land , in the mink - lined nurseries of the filthy rich , a new breed of fearsomely spoilt children are being raised by their fearsomely spoilt parents
these indulged tots are hatched into a world where budgets have no bounds and reality is a misty blur on the ever - golden horizon
they are in furs before they are five , chanel before six and in bed by seven
and while dressed in the finest of clothes , they eat in the best restaurants , are entertained like emperors and hot - housed in luxury that would make a sultan blush
meanwhile , the gruesome irony of being given designer shoes before they can walk and expensive birthday parties before they can talk seems to be lost on their crazed , doting , cash - scattering parents
you can always depend on tams to raise the pamper bar to hitherto unheard of heights of deluxe lunacy â and this week she did not let us down
the 30 - year - old daughter of formula one billionaire bernie ecclestone and her husband , jay rutland , have just returned from a holiday in italy to celebrate his birthday
before their next holiday , they had the small matter of celebrating daughter sophia âs first birthday this week â and tamara ecclestone was determined it was an event that would never be forgotten
not by sophia , who is too young to have a coherent thought running through her gorgeous little head
but by everyone else who goggled at the Â£ 70,000 or so spent on turning the front courtyard of their london home into sophia âs very own petting zoo , complete with puppies , shetland ponies and a baby zebra
a rather glum - looking zebra , to be honest , but in terms of competitive party - throwing , the little critter certainly earned his stripes
there was also a real live princess , complete with a wimple , and a platoon of security men delivering gift - wrapped presents for the lucky baby
in pride of place was a rather garish gazebo made entirely of pink balloons with sophia âs initials picked out in white
as well as a petting zoo with puppies , shetland ponies and a baby zebra , sophie was also lucky enough to have a decadent princess palace created out of pink and white balloons if you have ever wondered what a doctor would see while performing liver surgery on mr , wonder no more
tamara ecclestone also posted photographs on social media of sophia enjoying her birthday breakfast in her couture pyjamas , surrounded by giant soft toys and a whispering forest of helium balloons
another gift , wrapped with a pink velvet ribbon , awaited her perusal on her high chair tray
what and who was all this lavish fuss for ? certainly not for the child , who would have been as puzzled as the zebra about what was going on
however , events like this somehow seem to be more about making an affluent statement than celebrating a birthday
that âs not to say tamara ecclestone is not a lovely mother
her utter joy and delight in her baby is clear for all to see
yet one wonders what will happen to all these poor little rich kids , barely out of the crib before they are bombarded by all the good things in life â and then some
this torrent of luxury is supplied by no doubt well - meaning parents who seem not to know the meaning of restraint , the value of a pound or the concept of modesty
few of them have ever had to worry where the next million is coming from and sometimes there is the uncomfortable thought that children are just another accessory , a toy to pamper , a blank canvas upon which they can express how very , very rich they are and how very , very different their lives are from ours
a few years ago , women like paris hilton indulged themselves by carrying around teacup dogs in their handbags ; now we have the likes of kim dressing her little girl north â she was nât even given the dignity of a decent name â as a mini-me version of herself
and you do nât have to look far to see where tamara ecclestone found inspiration for her sumptuous birthday party
last year north â the child of kim and her husband , the rapper kanye west â had a first birthday party themed on california âs annual coachella rock festival
there was a karaoke stage , a ferris wheel , a groovy three - tier birthday cake decorated with tie - dyed icing â and a very confused little birthday girl herself , togged out in hippie fringes and a headband
not only was sophia treated to a fancy birthday breakfast in couture pyjamas but she even had a real zebra attend her first birthday party elsewhere , jay-z and beyonce gave their daughter blue ivy a horse for her second birthday
not just any old nag or cute shetland pony
blue ivy was given a full blood arabian stallion â and you do nât get many of them for sixpence
â blue expressed an interest in having a horse , â said an insider , explaining why mr and mrs z went to such extravagant lengths
did she really ? the kid probably just shouted â horsey - horsey ! â at something on the tv â and the rest is birthday history
what on earth are they going to do if she shows an interest in dinosaurs ? the beckhams â perhaps the uk âs answer to the kardashians â once spent a spent a six - figure sum on building son brooklyn a brick castle playhouse , complete with drawbridge and tower , at their old beckingham palace estate , just outside london
for daughter harper âs first birthday , they bought her damien hurst âs daddy âs girl painting costing Â£ 600,000
the pink heart - shaped artwork , complete with butterflies , now hangs in her bedroom , squeezed in beside her designer wardrobe of gorgeous kidult clothes
the beckham children , particularly little harper , always look like they have stepped off a kiddie milan catwalk â but what else are rich , fashion - conscious millionaire parents going to spend their money on ? at least they are beautifully turned out â and genuinely look like a loving , well - adjusted family
somehow they have negotiated their way through the wealth maze with sense â not everyone is quite so smart
when the singer j.lo and her then partner marc anthony had twins , their godfather tom cruise threw a â welcome to the world â party for them
the bash cost more than Â£ 100,000 , not including the diamond rattles he gave them as gifts
and there is no shortage of excess with his own daughter suri , the child he had with ex-wife katie holmes
suri was wearing high heels before she went to school and has a wardrobe of designer clothes that would make naomi campbell jealous
when her parents split in 2012 , her father bought her a mansion in manhattan
not a place for suri , now eight , to live , but as a kind of luxury warehouse to stash and store all the presents and toys he has bought for her over the years
tamara ecclestone and husband , jay rutland ( pictured ) , threw a lavish bash this week to celebrate their daughter sophia 's first birthday as a temple to parental excess , it has no peer
still , the new breed of wealthy celebrities are hardly going to be counting out the maltesers and wondering if they have buttered enough marmite sandwiches for their darling little one âs birthday party , are they ? the impulse of any parent to spoil children and give them the best is understandable â but some extravaganzas go too far
once upon a time , in a world long gone , a child âs birthday party was a simple affair
sandwiches and cake , balloons and smarties , musical chairs and then home before bedtime
younger readers may be astonished by this , but we did nât even get a party bag
if you got a clip on your ear on your way out the door , you would consider yourself lucky
look at these children , as the diamonds rain down on their tiny shoulders and zebras clop up to their front doors
it might be fun for the doting parents to show off and bask in all the luxury â but what chance do these children have of growing up normally , with even a faint grasp of reality ? answers on a birthday card , please
