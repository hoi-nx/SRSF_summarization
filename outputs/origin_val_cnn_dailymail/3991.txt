moments after announcing his imminent change of codes , sinfield was asked if he had ever played a game of rugby union before
â no , â he said , emphatically
there was a pause , as if the league icon was trying to fathom whether the question had been a joke , before he added : â they do nât play much rugby union in oldham
â that is undoubtedly true , but the current england fly - half , george ford , also grew up in the lancashire town , as did his bath team - mate , kyle eastmond
rhinos captain sinfield is to switch codes and join yorkshire carnegie at the end of the season sinfield ( centre ) lifts the super league trophy after rhinos beat warrington in the grand final in october 2012 now , at the age of 34 , sinfield is aiming to follow those younger converts across the rugby divide , having opted to leave rhinos at the end of their season , to join sister club yorkshire carnegie
the former england captain is a record - breaking legend in the 13 - man game , but he wanted one last career challenge ; a late shot at union
â it âs something that excites me and i âve wanted to do for a long time , but i never thought that i would get the chance to do it , â he said , shortly after informing his rhinos team - mates of his impending move
â the club has set targets to get back to where it belongs in the premiership and that is something i want to be part of
â i did nât want to get to the end of my career and look back with regrets about missed opportunities
so when this opportunity came up , my gut was telling me it was the right thing
sinfield is tackled during a match between rhinos and leigh centurions last year sinfield ( left ) in action for england against france during the 2013 rugby league world cup quarter - final â i âm very respectful of the game ( union ) and i like watching it
a lot of rugby league people look down on union and a lot of rugby union people look down on league , but i like both games
as a sportsman , the opportunity to play another professional sport really appeals to me
â sinfield has no intention of making life easy for himself , when he tries to translate his enduring talents to union
many of the converts who have fared best have been outside backs such as jason robinson , but his hope is to occupy the primary decision - making role
â i âd very much like to play fly - half â that âs the position that would suit my skills - set the best , â he said
â i understand the challenge that is in front of me ; the difficulties that rugby league players have faced coming over
â sinfield and his rhinos team - mates celebrate after beating melbourne storm in the 2008 world club challenge sir ian mcgeechan was present for the announcement in rhinos , in his role as yorkshire carnegie âs executive president , and the man synonymous with the lions appeared visibly elated about the championship club âs recruitment of such a pedigree figure , on an 18 - month deal
â this is fantastic news , â he said
â it is a great opportunity to get someone of sinfield âs quality , not just as a player but as a captain and someone who is an exceptional role model
â there was a change of ownership at yorkshire carnegie at christmas and the ambition is for premiership rugby
to have sinfield involved is a great acquisition for us and a statement of intent
we âve got a lot of young men willing to learn from a natural leader
i for one am very excited
