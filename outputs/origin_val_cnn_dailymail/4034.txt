the mother of murdered british student meredith kercher is ' surprised and very shocked ' by an italy court 's decision to overturn the convictions of knox and sollecito
the decision by the supreme court of cassation , which was announced late last night , is the final ruling in the case , ending the long legal battle waged by ms knox and her ex-boyfriend
ms kercher , 21 , from coulsdon , surrey , was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her bedroom in 2007 while studying in perugia , italy
kercher said she was ' surprised and very shocked ' at the italy court 's decision
here she is pictured during a press conference in perugia , italy , following knox and sollecito 's original convictions in 2009 knox and sollecito were originally convicted of murder and sexual assault in december 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in jail respectively before their convictions were overturned
kercher , meredith kercher 's mother , said she had heard little more about the decision other than the verdict
she said : ' i am a bit surprised , and very shocked , but that is about it at the moment
they have been convicted twice , so it 's a bit odd that it should change now
' asked whether she had any plans following the ruling , she said : ' i really do n't know at the moment , i have n't got any plans
' i ca n't see how evidence that was once deemed evidence is now no longer thought to be evidence
' talking about the italy legal system she said : ' it is a long drawn out process
' she then added : ' if you write anything , never forget meredith kercher
' meredith kercher 's father john declined to comment this evening
ms kercher ( pictured left and right ) was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her bedroom in 2007 following knox and sollecito 's original conviction , the two served four years in prison before a court in perugia threw out their convictions and declared them innocent
knox returned to the us before another u-turn in the sensational case in january last year when a court in florence reinstated the original 2009 conviction and increased knox 's sentence to 28 - and - a - half years
now italy 's highest court in rome has overturned the second convictions and declined to order another trial
both knox , who was awaiting the verdict in her home town of seattle , and sollecito have long maintained their innocence .
