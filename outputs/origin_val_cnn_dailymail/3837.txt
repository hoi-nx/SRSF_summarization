figures gathered by piracy tracker excipio and reported by variety revealed 681,889 unique browsers illegally downloaded the highly anticipated third season of house of cards on the day after it was released according to the overall statistics china had the most nationals obtain the season 3 illegally , with a figure of 60,538 just last week a consumer advocacy group slammed new proposals to reduce online piracy as ' truly frightening ' , as its revealed they could expose australians internet users to unlimited damages payout to hollywood studios
under the new copyright notice scheme industry code , anyone with an internet connection could potentially face legal threats from hollywood studios for illegally downloading movies , tv shows , and music
consumer group choice labelled the plan , which was compiled by australians 's largest internet service providers ( isp 's ) at the request of the federal government , as ' medieval ' and said it ' reads like a horror movie script '
the scheme could come into affect as soon as september this year
under the proposed code , a three - strikes system would be introduced for illegal downloads
customers suspected of illegally downloading content will be sent a series of notices from their isp 's - a warning , an ' education ' notice , and a final notice
consumer advocacy group choice has slammed the code as ' frightening ' and is calling for amendments the breaches will be identified through technology which tracks activity on internet protocol addresses , and a notice will then be sent to the account holder to advise them of the suspected infringement
if offenders receive a a third warning , isp will be allowed to provide the customers details - a move that would allow the copyright holder to target the user directly
choice campaign manager turner said that the new code could funnel average australians into a frightening and confusing court battle
' the code means that anyone with an internet connection could be under threat from legal action
often consumers share with flatmates , partners , or family , which means that even those who do n't download illegally could be taken to court , ' ms turner told daily mail australia
the communications alliance , the industry body backing the proposed code , released a statement last week emphasising the ' public education ' elements of the code , but noted that the scheme did provide a process of ' facilitated preliminary discovery '
' ultimately we âre trying to strike a balance
we âre trying to ensure privacy and that personal details are protected , that any allegation ( of copyright infringement ) will be independently reviewed , that customers do nât face sanctions , ' john stanton from the communication alliance told news.com.au
the discovery process means that isp 's would be obligated to aid ' rights holders ' - such a hollywood studios - to locate and take legal action against those suspected of illegally downloading content
in australians , piracy levels hit a peak last year when 1.5 million people downloaded the season finale of game of thrones
piracy levels hit a peak last year when 1.5 million people downloaded the season finale of game of thrones foxtel has exclusive rights to the fantasy series leading to criticism by consumer groups 55 % of australians who downloaded content illegally , including breaking bad spin - off better call saul ( above ) said it was because of a lack of access while the statement also said that the code ' contains strong safeguards against any threat to the privacy of internet users ' and that the consumer could appeal the final notice , ms turner said that choice had serious concerns about the consequences for consumers
the isp 's - including telstra , optus , and isp iinet - are obligated after the final warning to co-operate when rights holders wish to locate the consumer suspected of illegally downloading content
in a case earlier in february , the rights holders of the oscar - winning film dallas buyer club demanded that isp iinet hand over the contact information of customers who had illegally downloaded the movie
the isp expressed concerns the rights holder would send invoices to customers demanding they pay fines in the thousands of dollars to avoid going to court over the matter , reported news.com.au
' they ca n't oppose it , they have to participate when the rights holders want to take consumers to court
we are very worried about the lack of protection provided to everyday australians , who could face huge fines that do n't match the crime , ' said ms turner
' the code is an uncapped system of fines , which means that there is no limit to what someone could be made to pay under the scheme , ' she said
ms turner said that 55 % of those that downloaded illegally had tried to obtain content through legal sources in feburary , the rights holders of the oscar - winning film dallas buyer club ( above ) demanded that isp iinet hand over the contact information of customers who had illegally downloaded the movie the isp expressed concerns the rights holder of the dallas buyers club ( above ) would send invoices to customers demanding they pay fines in the thousands of dollars to avoid going to court over the matter unlike in new zealand , australians has no limit to fines under the copyright act , and it is up to the judge 's discretion as to what the consumer is fined
' in the us , which also has an uncapped system , a consumer was sued by sony bmg and fined $ 675,000 for downloading and uploading 30 songs , ' said ms turner
' this is why we are worried , this is a completely disproportionate system
we are not talking about a slap on the wrist , the punishment nowhere near fits the crime , ' she said
the communication alliance maintains that while the scheme may not be a popular move with some customer , the industry body made genuine efforts to provide a reasonable balance between education and preventing further illegal downloading
ms turner said that while it was fantastic to see new streaming service such as stan available in australians , the country was still very behind the kind of access others around the world enjoyed ' consumers find it very frustrating when they know the content is online , but that they are blocked from accessing it
it makes very little sense to them , ' said ms turner ' i do nât expect there to be universal acclaim , but it âs a scheme that âs fair , that âs not punitive and that balances competing interests , ' he said
choice has been vocal about providing consumers with a greater range of legal options to download the content they are seeking so that they do n't resort to illegal content
' we did a survey last year which found that a third of australians download illegally , and more watch the illegal content , ' said ms turner
' when we asked people the reason they downloaded , 55 % said it was because of a lack of access , and that they had first tried to obtain the content through legal sources , ' she said
choice is calling on communications minister malcolm turnbull to intervene and ensure proper protection for consumers under the code ' consumers find it very frustrating when they know the content is online , but that they are blocked from accessing it
it makes very little sense to them
' the code indicates that rights holders need to be working towards initiatives which ' include continuing efforts of rights holders to ensure timely and ready availability to australians consumers of lawful content alternatives
' however , ms turner said that while it was fantastic to see new streaming service such as stan available in australians , the country was still very behind the kind of access others around the world enjoyed
choice is calling on communications minister malcolm turnbull to intervene and ensure proper protection for consumers under the code , and have launched a campaign urging him to take responsibility for the internet policy .
