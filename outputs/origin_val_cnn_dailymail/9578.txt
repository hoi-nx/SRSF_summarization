milovan farronato , pictured outside court today , has been cleared of racially aggravated assault a cross-dressing art curator accused of punching a manager at the groucho club and calling her a ' f * * * ing fat , polish b * * * * ' has been cleared of racially aggravated assault
milovan farronato was alleged to have punched sikorska when she refused him entry to the trendy central london nightclub because he was n't a member
the 41 - year - old italian art curator denied the charge and was today acquitted at westminster crown court after a one day hearing
speaking afterwards he said he was ' delighted ' the case had been settled
ms sikorska claimed she was left with a cut nose after being punched by mr milovan farronato , who is the director of the fiorucci art trust , on may 9 last year
the court was told the 41 - year - old had tried to gain access to a section of the bar that had been reserved for members only when the incident occurred
he and some friends had earlier attended a party at the soho nightclub when they tried to enter the restricted bar , the prosecution claimed
mr milovan farronato denied her allegations , instead claiming he had been told to leave the exclusive nightclub because he was wearing women 's clothes , full make - up and 12inch high heels
he admitted slapping the polish manager as an act of ' instinctive ' self - defence but denied racially abusing her beforehand
he also accepted possibly causing the cut on her nose with the ' thick ' he was wearing at the time and said he told the woman she had ' terrible hair '
passing sentence district judge tan ikram said he could not be sure which party was telling the truth and so found the defendant not guilty
' the prosecution called only one witness and what they are saying to me is that i can exclude the possibility that she was n't telling the truth
' they are saying that this woman had been working there for 10 years and she would nât lie , ' he said
' i can not do that in this case because i have inconsistent evidence and i think it is significant inconsistent evidence
' what probably happened i would not like to say
can i be sure it happened the way the crown say it happened ? the answer is no. ' because i can not be sure that you did n't act in self - defence i find you not guilty
' speaking after the hearing mr milovan farronato said he was relieved to have been acquitted
self - defence : the art curator says he was discriminated against because he was wearing women 's clothing ' i âm delighted , it âs been a very difficult day for me
' this sort of thing has never happened to me before - thank god it âs over
' i was confident that what i was saying was real and this was reflected but i could n't be sure i would be believed
' the groucho club - named after groucho marx - was founded in the 1980s as an alternative to london 's traditional gentlemen 's clubs
it is known for the hell - raising behaviour of members including lily allen , tracy emin , noel gallagher , stephen fry and rachel weisz
earlier ms sikorska wept as she claimed that milovan farronato punched her ' two or three times ' on the nose after calling her a ' f * * * * * * polish fat b * * * * ' during the 1am confrontation
she said that the curator and his friends were ' quite loud and noisy and not very nice to staff ' , so she asked them to leave but they said they had to get a drink of water first
after she again insisted that milovan farronato leave , she said , ' he grabbed my hair and there were two or three hits
i did n't know what was happening
' ms sikorska added : ' the next thing i remember i was behind the bar with two guys who were cleaning my face and putting a napkin with ice on it
' ms welsh asked : ' were you able to see how the defendant hit you ? was it open or closed ? ' the witness replied : ' i think it was closed
' the court was shown a picture of ms sikorska 's bloody nose and swollen eye following the attack
' when i was a kid i lost my eye , so i already have got half of my face looking this way , ' she said
' after being attacked i have more scars and look worse than i already did
' milovan farronato , who appeared in court wearing red lipstick , eyeliner , a leather jacket decorated with hearts and high heels , said he felt ' discriminated ' against because of the way he was dressed
venue : the fight took place at the groucho club in soho , known for members ' hell - raising antics he denied that he had asked where she was from or called her a ' fat b * * * * ' , claiming that he slapped her in self - defence after she hit him when he insulted her hair
the defendant told the court : ' i said she had terrible hair since it was covering her face and that it was difficult to speak to her
' asked what happened next , he said : ' she slapped me immediately just after i said that sentence , on my left cheek
i slapped her back in self - defence
it was an instinctive , defensive reaction just to say , " stop please , do n't go further
" ' milovan farronato accepted that he was responsible for the cut on the bridge of ms sikorska 's nose , but claimed it had probably been caused by a large silver ring he was wearing
' it is very thick - i was not targeting anything , i was just responding instinctively and probably the back of the ring touched her nose and because of that she was injured , ' he said
the defendant said that he had had one glass of wine and two vodka tonics before the incident and accepted he was not entirely sober , but he denied that he lost his temper or that he had hit ms sikorska with a closed fist
' i have never lost my temper in my life , i am a university professor and i get on well with people , ' he told the court
asked about his work , milovan farronato said he curates art exhibitions and lectures on art at a university in venice .
