taco bell has launched a new advert for their breakfast menu where they appear to compare competitors mcdonalds to a communist dictatorship
the fast food restaurant launched its new ' biscuit taco ' this week in a bid to build on its breakfast business , which started one year ago
but in their new ad campaign , they once again go after dominant morning player mcdonalds by depicting a brainwashed society , where miserable people eat the same egg mcmuffin - type sandwich
the new advert for taco bell 's ' biscuit taco ' shows a man waking up to be told by his tv that ' happiness is the same breakfast ' the two and a half minute tv ad then shows people lining up behind each other while waiting to be given breakfast when they get to the front of the queue , they are then given egg mcmuffin - type sandwiches , while looking bored and miserable the two and a half minute tv ad shows a man waking up and being told repeatedly that ' happiness is the same breakfast '
it then shows him lining up with other people and as they get to the front of the line , they are handed a muffin - type sandwich
the ad then cuts to a shot of a dictator dressed in similar clothes to ronald mcdonald , with his men also wearing similar clown make - up
however , the man featured at the start of the ad then decides to break away from the line along with a woman and they then escape
the ad also features a dictator - type character , whose make - up and clothes seem to resemble ronald mcdoanld the new ad is similar to a campaign last year that featured real - life people named ronald mcdonald professing their love for taco bell offerings after running through the streets , they climb through a hole in the wall and reach a castle , where they are given a biscuit taco
the ad then finishes with the website breakfastdefectors.com flashing up on the screen
even though mcdonalds is not mentioned explicitly , it is clear which company they are poking fun at
in addition taco bell is running a poster campaign in new york and los angeles , with one featuring a demonic looking clown holding what looks like an egg mcmuffin with the words ' routine rules ' a man and a woman in the queue then decide to break free and run to the edge of the city where they climb through a hole in the wall the ad then finishes with the couple being handed a biscuit taco with the website breakfastdefectors.com flashing up on the screen one of the new posters , which are being put up across new york and los angeles promoting taco bell it is a continuation of an ad campaign last year that featured real - life people named ronald mcdonald professing their love for taco bell offerings
this prompted mcdonalds to tweet a picture of ronald mcdonald kneeling down to pet a frail chihuahua , which was once the mascot for taco bell
the launch of the taco bell breakfast menu has helped to drive up sales at the chain , with ceo brian niccol saying breakfast has been holding steady at six per cent of sales
it is not clear what impact this is having on mcdonalds , which has been struggling to hold on to customers amid intensifying competition
but others have also been pushing into the breakfast category more aggressively , including starbucks , which revamped its sandwiches last year .
