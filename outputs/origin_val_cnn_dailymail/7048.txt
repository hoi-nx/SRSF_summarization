gianluigi buffon was taken ill with flu shortly before the game but the legendary juventus goalkeeper was seen back in training on monday as the italy stepped up their preparations for the visit of roy hodgson 's england in turin
the friendly is a repeat of the 2014 world cup group match which italy won 2 - 1 and conte will want his team to repeat the result as he looks for a response to the draw that kept italy second in euro 2016 qualifying group h. gianluigi buffon missed italy 's bulgaria match with illness but was back in training on monday the return of gianluigi buffon ( right ) provided a major boost to italy ahead of their encounter against england gianluigi buffon appeared to be over the worst of the flu , which ruled him out of playing against bulgaria simone zaza ( centre ) attempts to intercept andrea ranocchia 's ( left ) pass during italy training alessio cerci ( right ) controls the ball with his chest as matteo darmian closes him down ignazio abate ( right ) controls the ball under pressure from ciro immobile during training in turin southampton striker graziano pelle could be in line to start for italy against england on tuesday conte ( left ) watches on as his italy players warm up at the beginning of training italy midfielder antonio candreva ( second left ) controls the ball as italy prepare to take on england conte ( fourth right ) addresses his team as they look to put an end to england 's seven wins eder ( left ) runs to conte after scoring italy 's equaliser in the 2 - 2 draw against bulgaria croatia lead the standings on 13 points , two ahead of italy , who like england were left praising a goal from a debutant after the game
brazilian - born eder , a 58th minute substitute , marked his first appearance for italy with a goal in the 83rd minute to rescue a point for conte 's team
but england and italy failed to qualify from group d in the 2014 world cup , which resulted in a managerial change for the italy as conte replaced cesare prandelli
and conte could be tempted into rotating his squad for the visit of england , with southampton 's graziano pelle potentially starting while eder could get his second cap after marking his first with a goal .
