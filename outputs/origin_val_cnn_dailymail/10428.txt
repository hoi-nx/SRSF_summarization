health secretary jeremy hunt is to issue a humiliating apology after mail on sunday exposed him for misleading the house of commons over who will foot the huge compensation bill for victims of savile
in a statement to the house of commons last week , mr jeremy hunt pledged that savile âs charities are responsible for paying up to Â£ 40 million due
but this newspaper can reveal that the charities are exempt â and that it is the nhs which is liable
the mail on sunday has also learnt that a further bill , which may eventually be as large , will be met by bbc licence fee payers
â he will be writing to the opposition to correct it , â she said
she said the nhs had not set aside a â specific pot â of money , but added : â we are committed to picking up any claims the estate can not cover
â the savile estate is already effectively bankrupt
mr jeremy hunt addressed the commons after the publication of reports which detailed savile âs abuse of victims at stoke mandeville hospital in buckinghamshire and elsewhere
he told mps that a total of Â£ 40 million was still â under management â in two charities savile established and â that money will be made available to meet claims made by savile âs victims â
mr jeremy hunt added : â if it is not enough , the government will meet any further claims through the nhs litigation authority
â savile founded the charities , mainly to fund healthcare , they were run by independent trustees and formed no part of his estate , which is already effectively bankrupt however , although savile founded the charities , mainly to fund healthcare , they were run by independent trustees and formed no part of his estate
last year the high court and the court of appeal made clear that they can not be asked to meet any compensation costs or damages
and yesterday it emerged that neither charity held anything close to Â£ 40 million anyway
the savile stoke mandeville hospital trust had around Â£ 1.75 million when it was wound up in 2013 , and the accounts to december 2014 show the savile held Â£ 3.4 million
summers , the charities â solicitor , said : â there is no way funds in a charity can be used to pay compensation to victims , as this is not permitted by charity law
the only funds that can be used to pay compensation are the estate funds
â the bbc has also agreed to pay the legal costs and damages for those abused on its premises
yesterday a spokesman refused to reveal how much the corporation had earmarked , saying only : â the terms of the scheme were agreed with lawyers for the victims , as well as the nhs and the savile estate
â as of november last year , the savile estate was worth Â£ 3.2 million
but almost all of this is certain to be eaten up in fixed payments to lawyers agreed under a â fast track â compensation scheme for which about 200 people have applied
so far just 39 claims have been rejected
as this newspaper reported last year , under the scheme each claim will trigger payments of up to Â£ 16,000 to lawyers
further payments will be made to law firm osborne clarke , which runs the scheme on behalf of savile âs executors , natwest
the firm had already been paid Â£ 500,000 when the scheme was approved by the court of appeal in november , and will be due more
in many cases , the damages paid will be less than the legal costs
the savile stoke mandeville hospital trust had around Â£ 1.75 million when it was wound up in 2013 , and the accounts to december 2014 show the savile held Â£ 3.4 million but this is not the end of taxpayers â liability
as well as claiming under the fast track scheme , alleged victims can also sue savile âs estate directly in the high court
in last year âs court hearings it emerged that numerous actions are being considered â with damages and costs likely to be higher
however , bedevilling these is a lack of documentary records , and evidence of some false claims by individuals
ms summers added : â it seems impossible to quantify the potential bill
the number of abuse allegations greatly outweighs the number of claims being brought under the scheme
it could be years before the nhs knows the total cost
â shadow health secretary andy burnham said : â it is of great concern that jeremy hunt could give such misleading information to victims and the commons on a matter of this significance
he needs to return to the commons at first opportunity to apologise to victims and correct the record
