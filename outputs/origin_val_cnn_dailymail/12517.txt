new delhi thankfully , no one was wounded after crude bombs were hurled at a tamil news station in india on thursday
but the loud explosions injured a vital part of the world 's largest democracy : free speech
last week , when india 's government and a british documentarian faced off over a film featuring a man imprisoned for a 2012 gang rape in south delhi , a little - known channel hundreds of miles away in southern india was waging its own battle
hardline hinduism groups were angry with broadcaster puthiya thalaimurai for filming a show about the relevance of a traditional necklace -- called mangalsutra in hindi and thaali in tamil -- worn by married india women
for them , the contents , as shown in the promos , were offensive to hinduism culture
the station planned to release the program sunday , international women 's day
but it canceled the telecast after demonstrations took place outside its office
protesters allegedly attacked one of its cameramen
four days later , the channel came under fire again , when four men on two motorbikes threw bombs into its compound in a predawn attack , authorities say
six people involved in the bombing have been arrested , said s. george , the commissioner of the southern india city of chennai
their leader turned himself in separately , claiming responsibility for the attack , police said
" the show wanted to give women a platform
we welcome all opinions and thoughts
but you can not strangle freedom of free expression by violent means and threats , " said kumar , the ceo of new generation media , which runs puthiya thalaimurai
" we condemn the attack in the strongest possible terms , " he told cnn
' india 's daughter , ' the film banned by india : what did it show ? but india is no stranger to censorship imposed legally or forced by rowdy protesters
the country 's constitution guarantees freedom of expression , but not without restrictions
communities or people claiming their religious sentiments were hurt by anyone else 's opinion can file a lawsuit
authorities can seek restraining orders from local courts -- as they did to ban the recent bbc documentary " india 's daughter " -- by citing potential disorder
earlier last year , penguin india withdrew " the hindus : an alternative history , " a book by american academic wendy doniger , after a local advocacy group accused the writer of denigrating hinduism
in december , a bollywood movie , " pk , " came under attack over similar accusations when mobs tore apart its posters in parts of india
a satire on religious rituals , " pk " became a roaring success by being one of the country 's highest - grossing movies
but india , home to one of the world 's largest film industries , has blocked several movies from screening
at least two films were not allowed last year
one of them featured the lives of the sikh assassins of prime minister indira gandhi , and the other centered on the violence in sri lanka in the closing months of its civil war
hounded by protests over his novel , perumal murugan , a tamil author , announced quitting writing in a dramatic post on facebook in january
" perumal murugan , the writer is dead
as he is no god , he is not going to resurrect himself
he has no faith in rebirth
as an ordinary teacher , he will live as p murugan
leave him alone , " he said on facebook two months ago
religious and caste - based organizations had slammed his novel " madhorubhagan , " which depicted a childless wife taking part in an ancient festival allowing consensual sex between strangers
just last week , india blocked the bbc from airing " india 's daughter " because it included comments from one of the men convicted of raping a young student in a moving bus in new delhi in 2012
the reason : the inmate 's views could create unrest
" there 's a growing intolerance towards different shades of opinion
it 's a medieval mindset
what india needs is a concerted effort to move beyond it and embrace free expression in totality , " said kumar , the new generation media chief executive .
