technology now in use by the nypd may be picking up stray conversations
three hundred shotspotter microphones are being placed in high crime areas of the bronx and brooklyn , with the aim of alerting police immediately when they overhear the sound of gunshots
however , the devices pick up more that just the bang of shots being fired in potential crimes , and evidence from conversations they 've listened in on has been used in court
above , mayor blasio speaks about the system the shotspotter system works by sending a few seconds of audio to police departments along with location information after a potential gunshot system makes it through a filtering process audio recordings from shotspotter have been used to corroborate testimony that led to convictions in a 2011 massachusetts murder where a voice was heard shouting ' no jason , no jason ! ' before shots were fired
nypd officials and new york city mayor blasio announced a pilot program for the microphones earlier this week
sensors in seven districts of the bronx have already begun working , and the devices will be turned on in ten districts of brooklyn on monday , according to the new york times
' this gunshot detection system is going to do a world of good in terms of going after the bad guys , ' de blasio said
the devices are thought to help police respond more quickly and help authorities pin point the exact location of shootings after potential gunshot recordings are sent through the company 's headquarters in california
shotspotter says that its devices ' are specifically designed to be triggered by loud explosive or ' impuslive ' sounds only
' three microphones must be triggered to start an alert and triangulate a location
the company says that human voices , slamming car doors and loud music will not trigger the microphones , which then send summary data about a sound to the company
the shotspotter system ( above ) filters out noises such as car door slams and yelling before sending alerts to the police recordings of a human voice captured by the shotspotter system were used to get a conviction in a massachusetts murder case it states that there is no ' live streaming ' of any microphones apart from the few seconds of regular audio sent to its employees for further analysis about whether the sound may have been a firecracker or a gunshot
an alert , location data and a few seconds of audio are then sent to local police
the restrictions on triggering events have not stopped some privacy advocates from saying that evidence procured by the shotspotters may violate the fourth amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures
' if [ shotspotter ] is recording voices out in public , it needs to be shut down , ' the aclu 's jay stanley told take part
he said his organization is ' always concerned about secondary uses of technology that is sold to us for some unobjectionable purpose and is then used for other purposes
' de blasio has adopted a two - year pilot program for $ 1.5million after shotspotter was used in other us cities such as washington and san francisco concerns have also been raised about the intrusiveness of audio recording being combined with surveillance video , according to the south coast today
shotspotter 's website said that ' 3 out of approximately 3 million incidents ' have been latched onto by ' privacy zealots ' and that the voices in those cases were yelling loudly in a public street during a shooting rather than having a private conversation
the company 's technology is already being used in major cities such as washington , boston , oakland , san francisco and minneapolis
its use has revealed that the vast majority of verified gunshots it picks up are never reported to police
however , it has also been accused of wasting police resources
seventy - five per cent of the alerts issued in newark , new jersey , were false alarm , according to wnyc
the two - year new york city pilot program for shotspotter will cost $ 1.5million
sensors are often placed on buildings and poles .
