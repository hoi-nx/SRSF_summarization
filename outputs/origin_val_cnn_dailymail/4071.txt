for one final time , the greatest ever jump jockey will grace his sport âs most spectacular and exciting stage
i urge you not to miss him
ap. nineteen - time champion jump jockey and the most recognisable initials in sport
the 2015 cheltenham festival boasts a glittering cast of equine and human stars but the spotlight is on one man
walsh ( right ) will ride willie mullins - trained faugheen in the champions hurdle at cheltenham festival the one who will finally walk away from the sport by the end of this season after announcing his abdication following an unchallenged 20 - year reign
he is the phenomenon whose record - smashing , off - the - scale achievements have transcended the parochial boundaries of horse racing , the patron saint to millions of punters and sworn enemy of bookmakers
but both sides of that age - old skirmish will probably be praying that the 40 - year - old from county antrim has a final festival to remember
the next four days for ap mccoy are not the last time he will ride
it will probably not even be the last time he rides at cheltenham festival
ap mccoy celebrates winning the gold cup with synchronised in 2012 but it seems like the equivalent of roger federer âs last game on wimbledon âs centre court , ronnie oâsullivan playing his final frame at the crucible and â should liverpool make it through â steven gerrard stepping on to the wembley turf in an fa cup final
but none of those icons can boast the domination of their own sport like ap mccoy has ruled racing
he is arguably the best pound - for - pound sportsman around â something crucial in a sport where weights and measures equate to short - head victories or defeats
and nobody loves winning and hates losing more than ap. thirty festival wins started with kibreet in the 1996 grand annual chase
look back a further 12 months and no - one would have guessed the shape of the last 20 years
his first meeting , then held over three days , consisted of seven rides , three of them 100 - 1 shots
first up was supreme master , who was 16th of 20 in the supreme novices â hurdle
champion jockey ap mccoy will be competing his his last cheltenham festival before retirement there was a seventh place finish on veteran beech road behind master oats in the gold cup and his best was sixth place on brave tornado in the triumph hurdle
the middle wednesday he was riding at nottingham â a track that does not have a jumps course any more â where he rode a winner
that first experience of the cheltenham festival probably taught the young ap mccoy that cheltenham festival is great when you are successful but miserable when it goes wrong
losing can tear you apart
it is a feeling i know well and ap mccoy probably enjoyed that nottingham winner far more than merely being able to play a bit part at the cheltenham festival
just taking part has never been enough for him
there have been times when his pain has been plain for all to see
he got plenty of stick for not smiling even when he won , never mind when he lost
there have been agonising defeats and seasons when his lack of big race cheltenham festival ammunition has been tough to take
the fatal injuries to gloria victis in the 2000 gold cup and valiramix in the champion hurdle deeply affected him
jump jockey ap mccoy has always been a fans ' favourite at cheltenham festival as he has got older , he has become better equipped to cope with the cheltenham festival roller - coaster of emotions
there will be plenty who point to the tally of 41 cheltenham festival wins for walsh â a total fuelled by his alliance with irish powerhouse trainer willie mullins and his former tie - up with british champion trainer paul nicholls â and ask what the ap mccoy fuss is all about ? who is the better jockey ? who has the best technique ? these are subjective assessments which will never be finally settled
i can not tell you ap mccoy has some peerless faultless technique others can only dream of
but i can write of the single - minded drive the like of which i have never known
the bloody - minded determination that can make the impossible possible , just as he did when lifting home wichita lineman to win on the opening day in 2009
there is the massive physical strength and resilience to inevitable injury
and i can tell you of the unparalleled professionalism he brings to every ride , an unmatched ability to get off a horse and accurately assess its ability and future career direction as well as his encyclopaedic knowledge of rivals â strengths and weaknesses
over the next four days , the chances are walsh will ride more winners than ap mccoy , who is 10 - 1 to be top jockey at the meeting
but ap. will view those odds as a challenge
he has sound claims in today âs champion hurdle on title holder jezki , a clutch of handicap possibilities and a strong chance with hargam in friday âs triumph hurdle
later that day , carlingford lough will be his mount to win a third gold cup
the irish hennessy gold cup winner , who runs in the colours of his boss , owner jp mcmanus , and is trained by john kiely , has solid claims in an open year
victory would be a fairytale ending for both ap. and the sport
and you would not bet against it
you never bet against ap.
