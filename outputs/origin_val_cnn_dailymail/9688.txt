the allegations were as vindictive and damaging as they were utterly false
yet they all but destroyed primary school teacher brendan
brendan , 45 , had for 16 years been an exemplary teacher : popular with pupils and respected by colleagues
yet in just a year his reputation was shattered , he lost his job and became clinically depressed , prey to anxiety and panic
brendan o'brien ( pictured with his wife , jane ) had 18 charges made against him concerning child abuse a Â£ 25,000 legal bill exhausted his entire savings and ate into those of his parents
his reputation unjustly besmirched , he and his wife jane â who has two grown - up daughters by a previous relationship â had to give up their dream of adopting a child
and this awful ordeal was caused by five boy pupils from his west yorkshire primary school who accused him of sexual abuse
it âs the worst accusation that could be levied against a teacher
and in today âs climate , where historic cases of the abuse of children are as prolific as they are disturbing , the police , quite rightly , had to act
yet the most cursory of checks would have revealed that his accusers were troublemakers : disruptive , aggressive , defiant and precociously sexualised
but once the boys â present and past pupils aged ten to 12 â had made the allegations that their teacher had inappropriately touched them and instigated sexual activity , the machinery of the law was set in motion
and despite the complete absence of evidence , it would destroy the name of a good man in the process
in january , a year after brendan was first arrested , a jury at leeds crown court acquitted him , swiftly and unanimously , on all charges
he had pleaded not guilty to 17 counts of sexual assault on a male child under the age of 13 and one count of causing or inciting a male child under 13 to engage in sexual activity
brendan and jane 's ( pictured ) lives were destroyed when the allegations against brian were made so how could brendan be left with a life in tatters while five malicious trouble - makers are carrying on with their lives , without so much as a telling off ? these are questions brendan and jane , 43 , a reflexologist and sales assistant , are asking themselves
brendan says : â when i was charged , i was no longer mr brendan , a respected village primary school teacher
instead , i was a pariah
i was too scared to leave the house
i became introverted , and i lost 2 st. yet the boys who accused me have been able to hide behind a curtain of anonymity while my name was publicised
â my accusers should be punished for making false and damaging claims against me
but they are all carrying on as though nothing has happened while i have to piece together my shattered life
â shattered is the correct word : brendan âs teaching contract was terminated in july
â i do nât know if i can ever face standing in a classroom of pupils , wondering if one of them is about to make a complaint , â he says
brendan âs nightmare began in january last year
he had driven to school and by 6.45am was sitting at his desk , planning his lessons
one matter was preying on his mind : how to deal with a particularly disruptive pupil
brendan had already spoken about him to the school âs headteacher
the day before , he had called the ten - year - old âs mother , inviting her to school to discuss her son âs behaviour
it was getting virtually impossible to teach with him interrupting , shouting wisecracks and refusing to do any work
then an hour later , he was summoned to his head âs office
facing him were two police officers
â i was told i was being arrested on suspicion of sexual assault on a minor , â he recalls
â and the child making the accusations was the same pupil causing problems
brendan ( pictured ) had , for 16 years , been an exemplary teacher : popular with pupils and respected by colleagues â i was completely , utterly dumbfounded
but my first thought was : â this will all be dismissed when the police investigate it and realise there is absolutely no foundation in it at all
â â but in the space of 12 months his life would be thrown into tumult as 18 charges were made against him concerning the children , the first boy and four others the ten - year - old knew
on that january day , brendan spent nine hours in police custody where every aspect of his teaching style was scrutinised
he had , on his own admission , a tactile approach
he explains : â i would often praise children by giving them a pat on the back or a tap on the knee
i âd never questioned that it was inappropriate
but this boy claimed i had touched him in a sexual manner
â child sexual abuse costs the uk an estimated Â£ 3.2 billion a year because of social care , health problems and legal bills jane , his wife of ten years , was by now dealing with her own shock
two - and - a - half hours after her husband was arrested , two officers arrived at their four - bedroom terrace house in barnsley
jane recalls : â my initial thought was that brendan had been in an accident
i asked if he was dead
â but when they said he had been arrested for sexual assault , i was floored
the officers had come to search our home for possible evidence and to seize electronic equipment
â my legs would hardly hold me up as the police rooted through our bedroom
although i knew brendan had done nothing wrong , i felt as though we were criminals
â they looked through my work files and took away our ipad , mobiles , a kindle and memory sticks
they spent months examining them , but did nât find a single suspicious thing
â when brendan arrived home at 6.30pm , he was exhausted and bewildered
jane says : â he could barely speak
but i never once doubted his innocence
â both he and jane were confident a short investigation would swiftly exonerate him
they told only close friends and family of the accusations
jane ( pictured ) says : â i never once doubted his innocence
' but the nightmare escalated
last march , brendan was arrested again
a further four ex-pupils who knew one another in some way claimed he had inappropriately touched them and instigated sexual activity
â i had no idea why they would make up such malicious and despicable lies , â he recalls
in april , he was formally charged with the sexual assaults against five boys : a ten - year - old current pupil ; three 11 - year - olds and a 12 - year - old
but their stories were inconsistent
some attested the assaults took place while he was teaching , others said it was while he was alone in his classroom talking one - to - one with them
and evidence read out in court supported the fact that each of the accusers was a known troublemaker
the youngest had boasted he would â get mr brendan fired â
one of the 11 - year - olds had grabbed another boy âs genitals , exposed himself and pinned down a female pupil until she cried
even his own mother admitted in a meeting at his school , after brendan âs arrest , she âd seen nothing in her son âs behaviour to indicate he had been abused
jane recalls the fallout of the allegations
â brendan had always been so full of life and very jovial , but overnight his character changed
â her husband â a caring step - father to her two daughters â barely spoke and became consumed by fear
he suffered from anxiety and tremors , and his gp prescribed antidepressants
â i felt utterly useless , â says jane
â but i had to be the strong one
â brendan endured further distress when a local radio station misinterpreted the charges against him and broadcast that he âd had sex with young boys
and the case brought one devastating side - effect
brendan and jane â whose daughters are 19 and 22 â had long dreamt of having a child of their own
jane had , however , suffered from fertility problems , and they had enquired about adoption
â but with abuse charges hanging over brendan , we would never be considered , â says jane
the legal proceedings consumed their savings , and brendan âs parents â in no doubt of their son âs innocence â chipped in
brendan ( pictured ) says he became consumed by fear and was prescribed antidepressants for his anxiety and tremors as the case approached , a swell of support buoyed them up
brendan recalls : â parents of ex-pupils would stop me in the street and give me a hug , all of them telling me they did nât believe a word of the claims
â but i still felt terrified
my solicitor had warned me if i was found guilty i faced up to seven years in prison and my name would be tarnished for ever
mercifully , the jury took just an hour to dismiss each of the charges against brendan
jane was with her daughters in court and when the verdict came , she was euphoric
â i squeezed my daughters â hands , â she recalls
â i just wanted to run to brendan and hug him
â justice had prevailed , but at what cost ? â i do nât know whether i will ever completely recover , â says brendan
â everyone who knew us supported me , but there will always be strangers who believe there âs no smoke without fire
â jane adds : â i can never forgive brendan âs accusers
i truly believe the youngest of them was acting in revenge , and then the other boys joined a nasty , ill - conceived vendetta to try to destroy him
â and if this is what teachers face â and we are told that false sexual accusations against them are not uncommon â the whole profession must feel under threat
â and one thing is certain : i do nât want brendan to return to a classroom ever again
