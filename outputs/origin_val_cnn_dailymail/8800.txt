the 21 - year - old star of jessie and the suite life on deck told people how the friend , whose identity is not known , was ' emotionally and mentally abusive ' - and how she finally decided enough was enough
' i was like , " i 'm a powerful woman and i 'm a producer " , ' she said
' i never thought that this [ would be ] happening to me , and it was absolutely happening to me
it was kind of late in the game by the time i realized that this was not healthy
but she says one of her close friends began growing increasingly jealous and demanding of her time and attention
the star described how on one occasion , her obsessive friend followed her to her car , grabbed her wrists , and took her keys , before crawling into her passenger side window so debby could n't leave to see her other friends
false friends : debby says her friend would call her phone up to 40 times a day and would grow angry if she did n't answer his calls immediately the abusive friend - who debby insists is not her ex-boyfriend , twenty one pilots drummer josh dun - also tried to move in with her , so debby paid for a nearby hotel room to to give him another place to stay
' that was literally just for sleeping , ' she explained , adding that the pair would still see each other ' every day , hours a day , month on month on month '
when her friend threatened to kill himself if debby did n't spend more time with him , the actress realized that it was time to put an end to the relationship once and for all
on top of her game : few of her other friends knew about debby 's struggle ; most of the time , like on the set of her show jessie , the star 's life seemed carefree back to normal : now free of her destructive friendship , the actress was all smiles at her show 's 100th episode party on february 12 ' i realized i 'd done everything that i could do , ' she said
' it 's not my purpose to sacrifice my own happiness and sacrifice my own mental health so that this guy does n't overdose
' i called someone and had someone go and be with him , and i removed myself from the situation and realized he 's no longer mine to deal with
' now , debby has decided to speak up to help other young people cope with abusive relationships
she has teamed up with mary kay and love is respect 's do n't look away campaign , which offers abusive relationship counseling over text message to those who text ' loveis ' to 22522 .
