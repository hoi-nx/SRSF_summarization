next time someone asks you how wide the milky way is , you might want to rethink your answer of ' 100,000 light - years '
astronomers have discovered that a strange ring of distant stars may actually be part of our galaxy , making it 50 per cent bigger at 150,000 light - years wide
this is based on re-analysis of a distant ring that surrounds our galaxy , which the astronomers think is now actually part of the milky way
astronomers in new york have revised the size estimate for our galaxy ( shown )
they now say it is 50 per cent bigger in size at 150,000 light - years wide , not 100,000 light - years
this is based on re-examining a ring of stars in the so - called monoceros ring the team of scientists from rensselaer polytechnic institute in new york studied the monoceros ring , which is a long ring - like filament of stars that â wraps â around our galaxy three times
it is located 65,000 light - years from our galaxy âs centre , and in total is 200,000 light - years in length
previously it was thought to be a stream of stars torn from the nearby canis major dwarf galaxy due to interactions with the milky way
the milky way is thought contain more than 200 billion stars
this makes it a â middleweight â galaxy with the largest galaxy known , ic 1101 , containing more than 100 trillion stars
on a clear night , when you look up into the night sky the most you can see from any one point on the earth is about 2,500 stars
like more than two - thirds of the known galaxies , the milky way has a spiral shape
at the centre of the spiral , a lot of energy and , occasionally , vivid flares are created
astronomers believe the milky way was nât always a stunning barred spiral
it formed into its current size by â eating â other galaxies
now , however , it seems that the ring may actually be part of our own galaxy , and could have been disturbed by other dwarf galaxies
â it looks to me like maybe these patterns are following the spiral structure of the milky way , so they may be related , â dr heidi newberg , from the rensselaer polytechnic institute in new york , told discovery news
â it now looks to me like it âs part of the disk , â she added
the latest discovery was made using the sloan digital sky survey , a projecting to map parts of the universe in three dimensions
the results will be published in the astrophysical journal
another ring , known as the triand ring , may also be part of the milky way , further increasing its size
to verify their theory , astronomers will use data from europe âs gaia telescope , which is also mapping stars in the milky way
previously the monoceros ring was thought to be a stream of stars torn from the nearby canis major dwarf galaxy due to interactions with the milky way ( illustration shown )
now , however , it seems that the ring may actually be part of our own galaxy , and could have been disturbed by other dwarf galaxies
