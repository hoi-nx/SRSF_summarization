it 's the biggest week of the year for chocolate sales , eclipsing demand at christmas and even valentine 's day
and just in time for easter , one of the world 's foremost food scientists - bernard lahousse - has explained why easter eggs taste so good
according to mr bernard lahousse , it 's all down to smell of chocolate which , when presented in easter egg form , is enhanced
happy memories associated with easter firmly anchor positive feelings towards chocolate eggs mr bernard lahousse told femail : ' the smaller the chocolate layer is , the easier the chocolate will melt
' so that is the advantage of easter egg ; they melt easily and the aromas of the chocolate come into your nose quite fast
' there are a number of reasons why chocolate tastes so good - and like mr bernard lahousse explained - the majority of them have to do with the way chocolate smells
' chocolate contains a lot of different aroma molecules , ' he said
' it has roasted molecules and fruity molecules
' these molecules contain a lot of complexity which makes it possible for chocolate to be paired with a lot of ingredients
and it 's not just the smell of chocolate that makes it so appealing
' there are a lot of taste components contained within chocolate , ' mr bernard lahousse continued
' we have sweetness , bitterness and sourness
plus we ca n't disregard the fat component
this melts at body temperature and provides a nice sensation and fresh mouth feel in the mouth
so what happens to us when we eat chocolate ? why does it make us feel so good , so content ... so happy ? the small chocolate layers in an egg means we get an intense whiff of chocolate when we first bite into it ' chocolate contains a molecule called phenylethylamine , which chocolate is loaded with , ' the scientist continued
this molecule is said to inspire feelings of love , which is why we feel good when eating it
' pairing chocolate with extra ingredients will enhance the feeling , ' mr bernard lahousse said
' for instance , by adding long pepper or black pepper it [ the molecule ] will have more effect
' and finally it all goes down to pleasurable memories and the way your egg is presented to you
' if you look at food more than half of experience lies outside of the taste
' you taste what you make out of it ; when you wrap it in a nice package , and it is presented to you by the people who love you , it will make the experience much better
' if you do n't have the time to make chocolate from scratch , you can simply melt down any chocolate bar you have to make your own eggs
once your chocolate is melted , it will need to be tempered
the cooling down process will take some time but if you want to hurry things along , just pop your chocolate into the freezer ( no longer than 30 seconds )
place a stainless steel bowl over a bowl of hot water and add half of your chocolate to it
keep aside the a quarter of the amount for the last bit of the process
stir your chocolate so it melts - and remember to check the temperature
bittersweet / dark chocolate should reach a temperature of 28c-29c ; milk chocolate should reach 27c-28c ; and white or coloured chocolate should reach 26c-27c
once the first batch has melted , add more chocolate to your bowl , stirring as you go along
as soon as the correct temperature is reached , start building your easter egg layers
spoon some chocolate into a mould ( you can get them from lakeland , denny craft moulds or party delights ) and rotate it so the liquids coats the bottom of the mould
you can make it as thick as you like , building each layer as the previous one cools
once the final layer has been built , leave aside to cool and harden before decorating .
