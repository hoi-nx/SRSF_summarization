veteran bbc dj gambaccini has accused the police of launching a ' witch hunt ' against innocent celebrities to cover up their failures over savile
the 65 - year - old said he had suffered ' a year from hell ' as officers tried to drum up their case against him after he was arrested in 2013
he was finally told he would not face any sexual assault charges in october
mr gambaccini also claimed he had been ' left out to dry ' on bail for months longer than necessary because the police did not want people to see a former radio 1 dj cleared before their case against his former colleague travis had concluded
mr gambaccini blamed his arrest on the ' moral panic ' sparked by the revelations over savile which exposed the police 's own failures to stop the prolific paedophile
' i faced the full weight of the state with unlimited financial resources for 12 months for no reason - it was a completely fictitious case , ' he told the home affairs select committee
he said : ' someone whose identity we do not know , who i call the wizard of oz , the person sitting behind the curtain , pulling the levers , setting off smoke and light shows , decided " i 've got a great idea , let 's have a witch - hunt , let 's divert the attention of the public from the police who knew about but failed to stop savile in his lifetime and shine that spotlight instead on his contemporaries and we 'll get perverts from show business in the 1970s and 1980s ''
' the furious bbc dj added : ' when you open a website and a phone line - as the police did - for the dedicated purpose of accusing celebrities , then you are going to get some people who are responding to the offer of money and attention
' he told mps there was no excuse for his treatment and urged them to overhaul the law to protect innocent victims from spending months on bail
' it 's obvious they wanted to keep me in the frame , because my name got out to the press ' [ but ] there is no possible excuse for leaving someone out to dry
' he added : ' you do n't need a witch hunt to enforce the law
' he also accused the cps of carefully timing the extensions of his bail to coincide with big sex abuse cases , such as the rolf harris trial , in order to avoid public scrutiny over their flimsy case against him
mr gambaccini blamed his arrest on the ' moral panic ' sparked by the revelations over savile which exposed the police 's failure to tackle abuse over decades mr gambaccini told mps he was ' left out to dry ' until the end of the case against travis
he also said he was re-bailed to coincide with the case against rolf harris ( right ) while mr gambaccini was making the accusation it emerged rolf harris had been stripped of his cbe , awarded to him by the queen the 84 - year - old australian was awarded the cbe in 2006 for his services to entertainment but it has now been retracted following his sentencing to six years in prison after being found guilty of sexually assaulting girls as young as seven - years - old
mr gambaccini said he had lost faith in the uk justice system and revealed he had lost Â£ 200,000 in wages and legal fees after his arrest
the us - born dj was re-bailed several times during his ordeal â and only found out about one after it had been reported to the bbc and itv
mr gambaccini accused the cps of having ' sat on the case ' for eight months and said he ' enthusiastically ' supports 28 - day bail limit
he said the only reason for delay is to ' get someone else to accuse you '
mr gambaccini had his bail extended when publicist max clifford was sentenced for indecent assaults he told the committee that during that time , his bail was extended on seven occasions with only ' vague ' explanations from police , but he gradually realised that the dates often coincided with important developments in the yewtree investigation
bail was extended on may 2 , when publicist max clifford was sentenced for historic indecent assaults , on june 30 , hours after the conviction of rolf harris and on september 12 , when former stoke mandeville doctor michael salmon appeared in court charged with rape , he said
' you know what they say
twice is a coincidence , three times is a trend , ' said mr gambaccini
' it was kind of interesting when i was rebailed the same day max clifford was sentenced
it was kind of infuriating when i was rebailed the same day rolf harris was convicted
but then when i was rebailed again when michael salmon was charged , i thought ' ok , what they are doing here is trying to bury the news of my being rebailed forever , because if anybody wanted to write an article about yewtree on those days , it would n't be about me , it would be about the other suspects '
' when his bail was extended to september 15 , he suspected a link to the trial of travis , which was due to end on that date
' i thought , ' this is the most obvious thing in the world
they are sitting on me until they are finished with travis , because they do n't want the travis jury to know that a former radio 1 dj can be innocent '
' i do believe - though i do n't have any evidence for this - that they were just sitting on me until travis was finished , ' he said
the veteran disc jockey told mps that no one was above the law , but said celebrities were more vulnerable to false allegations because more people know them
he added : ' this person went after me because i was the famous person in his neighbourhood
' after dropping their case against him , the cps revealed that the allegations against him involved two underage boys who were around 14 and 15
other celebrities including comedians jim and jimmy tarbuck have had their names dragged through the mud after yewtree investigated them over decades - old allegations
gambaccini accused the police for launching a ' witch hunt ' against innocent celebrities dubbed the professor of pop for his encyclopedic knowledge of music , gambaccini had been a bbc radio dj for 16 years when he was arrested last year

he read politics , philosophy and economics at oxford university as well as studying at dartmouth college in new hampshire
despite his success , mr gambaccini said he was victim to homophobic treatment within the bbc where his personnel file was reportedly marked with a christmas tree as he was ' camp as christmas '
he entered into a civil partnership with model christopher sherwood in 2012
following an itv documentary in 2012 which exposed the depraved paedophilia of savile , gambaccini publicly condemned the jim 'll fix it star , describing him as ' an enigma '
' he was not all good , he was not all bad , he was an enigma. , ' he said on daybreak
' you just did n't mess with jim
' he was the governor , because after all he had been the first great club dj , he had been the originator of top of the pops and you just let him have his turf
' and none of us were interested in going there
' at social occasions we would all be together , but jim would not be
he had his own life , ' he said on live television
he added he had been waiting for 30 years for the public to be made aware savile 's abuse
' i 've been waiting for this to come out for 30 years , but then he did raise millions for charity
' this comes out when he 's dead because he had an imperial personality in showbiz , and i 'm not talking about personal life
' ' once he was phoned and he said , ' well , you could run that story , but if you do there goes the funds that come in to stoke mandeville hospital
' do you want to be responsible for the drying up of the charity donations ? ' and they backed down
