indiana is set to declare a public health emergency to county an alarming increase in the rate of hiv infections
governor pence said wednesday he 's mulling a needle exchange and other programs aimed at curbing the rise in infection rates that has been tied to intravenous drug use in southern indiana
hiv cases have ballooned in the state recently , with 72 cases confirmed and 7 others that preliminary tests say are positive , all coming out of scott county
a centers for disease control and prevention report in 2005 on syringe exchange programs found those types of interventions were cost - effective ways of preventing blood - borne infections like hiv
' the cost [ of preventing one ] hiv infection by seps has been calculated at $ 4,000 to $ 12,000 , considerably less than the estimated $ 190,000 medical costs of treating a person infected with hiv , ' the report stated , with dollars calculated in their 1997 values
needle - exchange programs allow intravenous drug users to bring in used needles in exchange for clean syringes , which is believed to suppress transmission of diseases such as hiv and hepatitis
those exchanges are barred by the state of indiana , though a bill up for debate in the legislature would allow them under a temporary provision
dr cooke , who runs a clinic in austin , says his town has borne the brunt of growing intravenous drug use , seeing hepatitis-c cases be replaced by bigger issues
mulling it over : governor scott pence appeared in scottsburg , the county seat , to meet with local officials wednesday about the crisis , and plans to institute new policies to combat a public health emergency state response : indiana state health commissioner dr jerome adams said that an awareness campaign has been launched , along with mobile teams sent into the area ' we 've seen an increase in overdoses , ' cooke told nbc
' we 've identified that most of our iv drug users are hepatitis-c positive
we knew it was a only matter of time until hiv set in
' ' we need help
my clinic serves the poorest people in indiana , potentially the poorest in the country , ' cooke said
' we do a sliding scale here
if they can , they may pay us 10 dollars for care
i 'm hopeful this declaration provides the funding we have needed
' ' it 's overwhelming how much pain and suffering is going on here
we can provide a basic level of primary care
but some people ca n't even afford 10 dollars
' pence appeared in scottsburg , the county seat , to meet with local officials wednesday about the crisis
' this is a public health emergency and i 'm listening to my health department , i 'm listening to the centers for disease control and prevention , ' pence said after the meeting
' i 'll make my decision based on the best science and the best way we can stop this virus and stop this outbreak in its tracks , ' he added
in the last month , indiana has gone from 26 confirmed hiv cases , when officials first announced the outbreak , to 72 now
intravenous drug led to infection in almost all cases , according to state epidemiologist pontones
still , the number of hiv cases is estimated to rise in the coming weeks
indiana officials know of up to 100 people that may be connected to those with confirmed cases and are trying to contact them
indiana is running an awareness campaign through billboards and social media aimed at warning residents about the outbreak exploding in south indiana
dr jerome adams , the state health commissioner , said a mobile health unit is being sent with = resources that the state hopes will aid in the outbreak
pontones said staff from the centers for disease control and prevention , who arrived in the area monday , agreed with state officials that the outbreak ' is an indicator of a larger problem ' of drug use driven by poverty
' with the amount of drug use that 's happening and the intravenous needle - sharing that 's going on , if someone who 's highly infectious becomes part of that sharing network , that infection can transmit very rapidly , ' pontones said
she said the vast majority of the people who 've become infected during the outbreak shared a syringe with someone else while injecting a liquid form of the prescription painkiller opana
ed clere representative ed clere of new albany , who proposed the needle distribution and collection program wednesday at the statehouse , said a house panel considered similar legislation last year , but it did n't receive a hearing in the senate
' unfortunately we 're back here , not just with needle exchange as a hypothetical theory , but with a real situation where a needle exchange ( program ) could make a difference , ' he said .
