this is the moment a canoe sinks to the bottom of a riverbed during a father - son bonding trip
youtube user ' mnsterbruiser ' filmed the epic sailing fail take place on the black river falls in wisconsin
footage captured by a body camera shows him sat behind his father as rapids throw the boat off balance , causing water to tip in
as the canoe rocks from side to side , it slowly starts dipping below the surface
in little more than ten seconds , the vessel appears completely submerged
despite the accident , mnsterbruiser manages to retain a sense of humor
in the film , he is heard laughing throughout - even when he is underwater
luckily the two oarsmen managed to make it to the riverbank and tip their canoe upside down
they then continued on their journey , being more mindful to avoid the violent wash of the rapids
