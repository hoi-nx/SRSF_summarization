a dolphin who was found dead in a river was shot with a shotgun , an autopsy has revealed
the body of the female adult bottlenose , named graze , was discovered in the port river , north of adelaide before christmas last year , but was only examined this month by scientists
south australian museum senior research scientist kemper said four shotgun pellets were found in the dolphin 's body after she was found in the barker inlet area
' it appears graze did not die immediately after she was shot , ' ms kemper told daily mail australia
one of the four shotgun pellets was found on the deceased body of female adult bottlenose named graze graze pictured a decade ago when she was first sighted in 1992 by a whale and dolphin conservation group ' she was emaciated , and there were signs of disease that may have been related to the shotgun pellets entering her body
' we believe she died within weeks or even months
the shooting was n't a primary cause of death but it was a secondary - something else followed after she was shot
' dr kemper said there had been about 10 dolphins discovered dead after being shot in adelaide waters since 1998 , despite all mammals are protected by law
' we 're more annoyed and concerned than sad , ' ms kemper said
' it 's distressing to think someone would injure one and we do n't know why they 're doing it - either intentionally or accidentally but it 's animal cruelty because it 's not really a nice thing to do
' it 's an illegal act
we 're more concerned and we want to make sure people are obeying the law
' i also understand that the local people have not been happy with it either so i suspect someone will make a report soon if they see anything suspicious
' south australian museum senior research scientist kemper ( right ) dissecting another dolphin ms kemper said it was animal cruelty for a dolphin to be shot with a gun whale and dolphin conservation group dr bossley first sighted graze in 1992 and had since followed her movements and monitored her behaviour ever since
' it is clear that despite the implementation of the adelaide dolphin sanctuary in the area , these dolphins are still under threat , ' he told daily mail australia
' it is important that more resources are put into the sanctuary to improve its effectiveness
' dr bossley said when he first identified graze , she had suffered a major wound across the top of her back but fortunately , she survived and went on to have a number of calves
but this was not the first time a dolphin was killed by a shotgun in the local waters
two dolphins were killed in the barker inlet in 1998 and the calf of one of these died shortly afterwards
the south australian museum has subsequently found shot gun pellets in dolphins collected in the adelaide area on a number of occasions but the bodies were found just outside the sanctuary boundaries
anyone who kills or wilfully injures a dolphin ( stock image ) could face up to $ 100,000 or two years in prison the south australian museum government introduced the sanctuary in 2005 to protect adelaide 's resident bottlenose dolphins , and introduced heavy fines for those who attack the animals
in south australia , the maximum penalty for anyone who kills or wilfully injures a protected marine mammal could face a hefty fine of up to $ 100,000 , or two years imprisonment
adelaide dolphin sanctuary manager vicente told daily mail australia these fines are issued under the national parks and wildlife act 1972
' we would like to encourage anyone that may have information about the incident to contact us or the police , ' ms vicente said .
