the past few days have been turbulent , to say the least , for british middleweight , luke barnatt
when his upcoming fight against clint hester was scrapped from the ufc 's fairfax card on april 4 , after hester developed a foot injury , luke barnatt was on the hunt for a replacement opponent
' i heard from clint hester directly that he was injured and out of the fight
' i spoke to joe and he said there 's no - one on the roster who is free to fight you , so it might have to be a newcomer
but i did n't want to fight a newcomer who people knew nothing about
he had a few guys in mind but none of them could take the fight or would agree to it
british 's luke barnatt found the replacement he was looking for after his fight with clint hester was scrapped luke barnatt will be facing filipino - american fighter mark munoz in the ufc 's maiden event in the philippines ' i said , ' why do n't you give me mark munoz and let me fight in the philippines ? ' ' then joe called back and said he 'd made about 500 phone calls and that he could n't find anyone , so your wish is my command â you 're fighting mark munoz in the philippines
' i went from being very down , to being very happy , and now i have 10 weeks to prepare for the fight
' luke barnatt is looking to bounce back from two frustrating back to back losses , both of which the middleweight feels he would have won , were it not for poor judging decisions
mark munoz , meanwhile , who recently fell short of the ufc 's top 15 middleweight rankings , is a veteran of the sport and will present a dangerous challenge on the ground for luke barnatt
' obviously i have to pay a bit more attention to my wrestling now ' said luke barnatt
' mark munoz is a very , very good wrestler
there will be a bit more of a focus on , but i am going to implement my own game plan
' mark munoz ( front ) fought in ufc 184 but was forced into submission by brazilian fighter carneiro ( rear ) carneiro celebrates his win over mark munoz in their middleweight bout during the ufc 184 event at staples cente the bout will feature on the ufc fight night : edgar vs. faber vs. faber fight card , the ufc 's first event ever to take place in the philippines
' six years ago i was in thailand
' i lived there for 7 months and i always wanted to go to the philippines , so i 'm super excited
i 'm going to go out there about 10 days before to get acclimatized
the funny thing is , mark munoz trains about 3 hours away from me in california so we will both be going all that way
we will probably leave on the same flight to get out there ! ' when it comes to trash talk , we can expect to witness none of that in the lead up to this bout
' i know mark munoz ' said luke barnatt
' he 's pound for pound the nicest guy in the world
but this will probably be mark munoz 's last fight in the ufc
he 's wanted to fight in the philippines for so long so it 's great that he 's able to do that , but i think this will be the last fight for him
' it 's a fantastic opportunity that the ufc has given me , to allow me to be the one to retire mark munoz
' mark munoz was on the losing end against carneiro , but he 'll be hoping for a comeback against luke barnatt on may 16
