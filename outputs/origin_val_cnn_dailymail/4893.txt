accusations : a bearded cleric appears to read charges against the man - using a microphone and pa system to tell the gathered crowd of sadistic onlookers that the man has been accused of stealing painful : a final image shows the victim lying on his back in agony on a metal gurney while a man who appears to be a surgeon tends to the injury on his left hand the video comes just one day after isis released gruesome footage of the murder of a man the terror group accused of working as a spy
the video was filmed in halab and shows a man believed to be named muhammad being led out to a forecourt by masked executioners , who then shoot him in the head multiple times at point blank range
in a chilling sign of isis ' reach and influence , muhammad is understood to have been accused of working as part of a secret spy network based in neighbouring nato member state turkey before his brutal filmed execution over the border in syrian
titled ' a lesson to be learned ' , the three minute 40 second video has all the hallmarks of an official isis release - employing hd cameras , hollywood - style sound and visual effects and slick editing and direction
it also carries the logo of one of the group 's official halab - based propaganda arms , halab
the islamic state cherry picks sections of the koran and misinterprets the accounts of the prophet muhammad in order to wage jihad and sign up new recruits , experts say
it is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in iraq and syrian , where isis has proclaimed what it calls a ' caliphate ' , ruled by its often brutal version of muslim law
the group purport to recreate the conquests and rule of the prophet muhammad and his successors and maintains its worst brutalities - such as beheading captives - only prove its purity in following what it contends is the prophet 's example
but now muslims clerics and other experts are speaking out , saying that the group hand picks what it wants from muslim 's holy book , the koran , and from accounts of muhammad 's actions and sayings , known as the hadith
an isis member parades through the streets of raqqa in syrian waving an islamic state flag and brandishing a gun
experts have now said that isis misinterprets the koran in order to wage jihad it then misinterprets many of these , while ignoring everything in the texts that contradicts those hand - picked selections
writings by the group 's clerics and its english-language online magazine , dabiq , are full of citations from koran verses , the hadith and centuries of interpreters , mostly from hardliners
but joas wagemakers , an assistant professor of islamic studies at radboud university in the netherlands , says these are taken far out of context by isis
he explained that muslim scholars throughout history have used texts in a ' decontextualised way ' to suit their purposes and says that isis represent the extreme
he added : ' it would be a mistake to conclude the islamic state group 's extremism is the true islam that emerges from the koran and hadith .
