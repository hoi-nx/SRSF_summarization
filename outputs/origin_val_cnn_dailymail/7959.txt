homeopathy is no more effective than a placebo , a national medical review has found
national health and medical research council recently conducted a study into evidence on the effectiveness of homeopathy for treating health conditions , concluding that this method of therapy is ineffective
it further warned that those who choose homeopathy treatments over others ' may put their health at risk '
yet the australian homeopathic association has criticised the nhmrc 's ' biased ' review , saying homeopathy is one of the most used medical systems in the world - among them being about one million australians
homeopathy is a type of alternative and natural form of medicine , which is based on the notion that substances that may cause illness in a healthy person can treat those symptoms in a person who is unwell
consequently about $ 10 million is spent on homeopathy by australians , according to the world health organisation
although there were some studies which showed that homeopathy was effective , the nhmrc states they were assessed as being ' small or of poor quality '
' these studies had either too few participants , poor design , poor conduct and or reporting to allow reliable conclusions to be drawn on the effectiveness of homeopathy , ' it states
from the research , the nhmrc further warned that homeopathy should not be used as an alternative to treat health conditions that are chronic or serious
' people who choose homeopathy may put their health at risk if they reject or delay treatments for which there is good evidence for safety and effectiveness , ' the study states
' those who use homeopathy should tell their health practitioner and should keep taking any prescribed treatments
' about $ 10 million is spent on homeopathy by australians , according to the world health organisation nhmrc 's ceo professor anderson says all medical treatments should be supported by reliable evidence
' nhmrc 's review shows that there is no good quality evidence to support the claim that homeopathy works better than a placebo , ' he said
homeopathy is a type of complementary and alternative medicine , according to the nhmrc
it is based on two main ideas : homeopathic medicines include pellets placed under the tongue , tablets , liquids , ointments , sprays and creams
' from this review , the main recommendation for australians is that they should not rely on homeopathy as a substitute for proven , effective treatments
' but in an open letter to professor anderson , the australian homeopathic association accused the authors of the nhmrc review of being biased
' homeopathy is one of the most used medical systems in the world , with an estimated one million australians choosing homeopathy as part of their health care , ' the association said in a statement
' in europe over 30 million people use homeopathic medicine , in india over 100 million people depend solely on homeopathic medicine
' the association says homeopathy is not ideally suited to systematic reviews such as the nhmrc 's as the therapy is ' a holistic system of medicine that focuses on the unique situation of each individual 's overall health ' .
