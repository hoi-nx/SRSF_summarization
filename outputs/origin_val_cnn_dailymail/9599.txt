prosecutor shaun dodds said kingsley , from middlesbrough , intervened after the little girl had an argument with her daughter
' she appears with a knife , shouting at the child , ' he said
' while holding the knife she shouts , " do nât ever shout at my child , if you do i will cut your throat , " and various expletives

the court heard she had previous convictions for dishonesty and drugs offending , but no history of violence
scott taylor , defending , told the court kingsley had moved since the incident in july last year and she had no further contact with the family
recorder andrew dallas said : ' there is obviously a background here and she appears to acknowledge the stupidity of what she did
' brandishing a knife in a public place in these circumstances was a foolish thing to do
' it it had gone any further you would have been going to prison today
' i take into account it was never your intention to cause any harm , though undoubtedly the child of your neighbour would have been frightened by the way you were behaving and the things you said were wholly inappropriate
