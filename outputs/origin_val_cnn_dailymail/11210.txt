a fashion photographer who was asked by designer alexander to take a special series of backstage photographs 11 years ago is showcasing the images in a dramatic tableau for the first time
nick knight says the renowned designer invited him to take the snaps at his iconic black event in 2004
the london show featured an atmospheric showcase of black pieces , some from the archive and others designed specifically for the night
mr nick knight says he was asked by alexander to photograph each model backstage with a view to creating a composite image for the future , and now , more than a decade later , the designer âs vision has now been realised
mr nick knight said : â as a close collaborator and friend of alexander , i had the honour of filming many of his photo shoots from the mid-nineties onwards
â ' alexander was so excited as he neared the completion of the collection for the american express event , he insisted we found a way to shoot it behind the scenes at earls court where the show was being held
' he knew the black event was an important moment that should be preserved and shown to the world , so this project has been a great way for me to reflect upon and celebrate our working relationship
models including kate moss , lily cole and naomi campbell were all captured backstage wearing alexander costumes for the tableaux which has been broken down into four sections nick knight has turned the previously unseen pictures into a dramatic tableaux â we both knew we had the ingredients to make an incredible image
â the image , commissioned by american express , has been released to coincide with the alexander : savage beauty exhibition currently showing at the v&a
lisa gregg , vice president , american express , said : â alexander was renowned for pushing creative boundaries and this was always demonstrated through his legendary work
american express supported alexander in his early years as a trailblazing creative , and was privileged to accompany him on the meteoric rise from cutting edge designer to global name
â our partnership with the v&a and the alexander : savage beauty retrospective has given us an exciting opportunity to work with nick knight again and to commission this beautiful image , which is a wonderful tribute to our past collaborations with alexander
â alexander was one of the uk 's most controversial fashion stars , a man whose flamboyant public image concealed a private life blighted by depression and battles with drink and drugs
the retrospective of his work at the v&a features items taken from his ground - breaking 1992 ma collection shown alongside his last
savage beauty , which runs until august 2 , includes pieces from the unfinished 2010 collection as well as new pieces lent by alexander 's friends , among them stylist katy england
the tableaux , called black , have been released to complement the alexander : savage beauty retrospective at the v&a in london talented : alexander , pictured left , during his spring / summer 2006 show and , right , his friend and fashion photographer nick knight alexander , who was found dead on the 11 february 2010 , was one of the uk 's most influential designers at the time of his death and was the owner of a little black book that encompassed everyone from royals to first ladies and fashion editors
the son of a taxi driver and a social science teacher , the glittering world he came to inhabit was a far cry from the humble terraced home in lewisham , south london , where he grew up with his five brothers and sisters
after leaving school at 16 with a single o-level in art , the fledgling designer went on to do an apprenticeship at savile row tailors gieves & hawkes , before a stint at theatrical costumiers , angels and bermans
both would have huge influence on his later career
alexander 's big break came following a spell in milan working for romeo gigli
on his return to london , he applied to central st martins for work as a pattern cutter
impressed by his portfolio , bobby hilson , the head of the master 's course , persuaded him to enrol as a student instead
his faith in alexander paid off
the designer 's graduate collection earned him rave reviews and the entire thing was bought by isabella blow
spectacular : a curator puts the final touches to some of the dresses on display at the v&a striking : his pieces were adored by fashion press and fashion - buying public alike hard to walk in : his shoes were notoriously elaborate and hard to walk in , as several models discovered while on the catwalk finishing touches : a curator works on an exhibit ( left ) , while right , one of the structured gowns for which alexander became famous last pieces : these designs are taken from alexander 's s / s10 collection which was inspired by sea creatures from there , alexander went on to become one of the most influential designers of his generation , designing david 's tour wardrobe in 1996 and following up with his infamous ' bumsters ' - which then sparked a craze for low slung jeans
the same year , he was appointed creative director at givenchy , replacing fellow briton john galliano , and relocated to paris
but despite his success , alexander never forgot his london roots , often speaking of his love for the uk capital
indeed , he once spoke of how inspiring he found the v&a itself , saying : ' the collections at the v&a never fail to intrigue and inspire me
the nation is privileged to have access to such a resource ... it 's the sort of place i 'd like to be shut in overnight
' the museum repaid the compliment , first by including the designer 's work in cutting edge : 50 years of british fashion in 1997 , and then again in its fashion in motion series
but it is the new savage beauty retrospective that will be the largest retrospective of alexander 's work hosted by the museum , with more than 200 different pieces set to go on show
enfant terrible : one of alexander 's more shocking stunts involved spraying model shalom harlow with paint during his s / s98 show striking : a v&a assistant poses next to a dress taken from alexander 's the girl who lived in the tree a / w 2008 collection magnificent : as with his shoes , the headgear shown on the catwalk by alexander was usually difficult to wear changing times : alexander 's sea creature inspired s / s10 collection ( left ) and a dress from his a / w08 widows of culloden collection among the pieces included are gowns from his 1992 postgraduate collection , as well as some of his a / w10 designs - the last the designer would ever create
his final collection was never completed , with just 16 dresses shown to fashion editors in paris a month after he died
but while alexander might be gone , his brand lives on and , in the capable hands of his former assistant sarah burton , continues to go from strength to strength
' lee was a genius and a true visionary who pushed boundaries , challenged and inspired , ' she explains
' he believed in creativity and innovation and his talent was limitless
savage beauty is a celebration of the most imaginative and talented designer of our time
' ' i am thrilled to announce that the v&a will bring this wonderful exhibition to london to celebrate the extraordinary creative talent of one of the most innovative designers of recent times , ' adds v&a director martin roth
' alexander was brought up in london , studied here and based his globally successful alexander fashion brand here â by staging the exhibition at the v&a it feels like we are bringing his work home
' dramatic : alexander was famous for producing pieces that erred on the side of gothic such as these three dresses spectacular : victoriana and bold blooms were also recurring motifs , as these striking gowns make plain setting the scene : savage beauty opens at the v&a next month , with tickets due to go on sale on the 14th march the stars turned out in force for the party the v&a held this evening to celebrate the arrival of the exhibition
