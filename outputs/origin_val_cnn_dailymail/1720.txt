extreme skier ugo gerola is seen on his helmet camera hurtling down a slope in the alps moments before an avalanche sweeps across his path , nearly knocking him over the face of the 4,000m mountain danger : out of nowhere , the avalanche comes into shot from his left as he races down the slope averting disaster : mr ugo gerola uses his parachute to lift several feet in the air to dodge the avalanche 's path the extreme skier sails over the path of the avalanche as it sweeps out of view but mr ugo gerola uses his parachute to dodge its path and watches as the powder , ice and rocks drop hundreds of feet below him while he floats in the clear blue skies
he said : ' i was so lucky escaping the avalanche
i only just saw it at the last moment

freeriding , or speed flying as it is also known , involves skiing off off - piste , often with a winged parachute , much like paragliding
sometimes referred to as ' off - piste ' , there is a much higher possibility of there being avalanches as the snow is less stable
mr ugo gerola said : ' when i showed my friends the video , they were amazed
' some of them say i 'm crazy because of the dangers of freeriding but it just makes me feel alive
' i have been practicing for many years now so the risk of my rides is always carefully calculated
