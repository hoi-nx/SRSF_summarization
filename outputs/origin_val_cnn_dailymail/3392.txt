on an annual basis , lost and found cast members collect more than 6,000 cell phones , 3,500 digital cameras , 18,000 hats and 7,500 autograph books
according to long - time lost and found staffers , the most unusual items turned in have been a glass eye , a prosthetic leg and a potty trainer
each , incidentally , was claimed ( but not by the same person )
source : disney time management is vital there are four theme parks at the wdw , and if you have the time , a full day is advised to experience everything you can there
it is tempting to maximise your freedom and opt for a park hopper ticket , allowing entry into more than one park in a day
note : these tickets are more expensive , as you are paying for the luxury of park choice
if you have decided to use this , for example those on a limited time schedule , it is key to strategise your day before you arrive
look on the map and on a disney wait time app to see which attractions are the most popular and do them first , or last
easy wdw has dedicated maps for which rides to tackle first
your park ticket can act as a free fast track ticket for some rides , giving you a time to come back during the day to a faster queue line
eating during peak lunch hours will slow your day down if you are queuing in the restaurants , bring your own lunch for a cheaper , and quicker pit stop
do n't go during the summer the summer holidays are the peak time to go to disney , meaning higher prices and longer queue times
early summer is when the parks are busiest so consider going in the late summer months or in winter to take advantage of cheaper tickets
early september is a good time to visit as the temperatures are lower , and most schools will be back after the holidays
use disney dining cards to help budget for the trip
these must be bought in advance , but help to limit what you spend in the parks arrive at park opening to get all the hours you pay for
not only will temperatures and queues be lower , you will maximise what you can see during your day plan ahead and bring supplies the parks are set up to cater to your every need , but there is a hefty price attached to basic items
eliminate extra costs by bringing everything you require to the parks , so you are n't forced to fork out on essentials like toiletries , sunscreen , plasters , and snacks
get there earlyyou are paying for every hour the park is open , so maximise your time in the park , especially when the queues and temperatures are low
tasty treats : at every corner in disney is a new snack for guests during their stay
bring your own snacks to avoid splurging out , on top of your ticket price pushchairs if you are planning on hiring a pushchair when you are there , it can be extremely expensive if you are there for an extended stay
be prepared to pay about $ 15 ( Â£ 10 ) per day at the parks , and it could be worth buying a cheap one from walmart for $ 20 ( Â£ 13 ) for your holiday
souvenir refill drinks instead of forking out for a number of drinks , either bring your own bottles and refill at the water stations , or invest in a souvenir refill mug
these cost around $ 15 ( Â£ 10 ) and entitle you to free refills for your holiday
if you do n't mind sharing , why not invest in one for your group and split the cost , and all reap the free rewards during your stay
some hotels offer extra hours for their guests , it could be worth paying for these hotels instead of paying for another day 's ticket to see all the attractions bring your own food dining at disney is designed to accommodate a range of budgets , but a cheeseburger , chips and a drink will still cost about Â£ 10
bring snacks to last the day and maximise your time in the park
do n't fall into the souvenir trap it is so tempting to want to buy every item with mickey mouse 's face on it , but before you splurge on expensive goods , realise that it is not the only place to buy disney presents and goods
if you have eager children , the southern plate suggests stocking up on small merchandise from cheaper shops before you go , and producing them during the trip so they wo n't be tempted to want every product in the shops
a lot of children want to get their favourite character 's autographs , so make sure you come armed with one before you go
merchandise is available at cheaper shops , and presents and treats can be bought before you go to keep costs low remember you will pay for parking you will start forking out before you set foot in the park , so be aware of this , and factor it into your budget
many of the nearby hotels offer free shuttles to the park
but if you are staying further out , driving there will be your only option
currently automobiles , taxis , limos and motorcycles currently cost $ 17 ( approx Â£ 11 ) a day to park , with campers and and rv costing a dollar more
what is good to know is once you 've paid this at one of the parks , you do not have to pay again at the other disney theme parks that day
if you know people in the area , a free lift to the drop off zone is the best option to avoid paying
most importantly , relax and enjoy your trip
if you plan in advance you can have a great day and not break the bank at the same time
