the ' barkingham palace ' gold cup saw 10 dogs face off in race across london 's bedford square , with a pooch named alexandra taking first place
a dog called alexandra , a name that is currently running third in the betting , took the honours followed by camilla ( 100/1 ) and victoria ( 10/1 )
among the boys , spencer came first , despite boasting real - life odds of just 25/1 , followed by james ( 8/1 ) and boris ( 200/1 )
' alexandra romped to victory and it looks like duchess of cambridge will soon be giving birth to a little girl next month , ' said ladbrokes ' bridge , tongue firmly in cheek
prediction : the race was a tongue - in - cheek attempt to predict the name and sex of the new royal baby ready for action : the pets were put through their paces in a tiny parade ring beforehand and they 're off ! the dogs emerge from the traps with spencer ( fourth from left ) taking an early lead sprinting ahead : the pets are on their way , although boris ( left ) does n't seem too bothered ' royal baby betting is booming and the arrival of a new heir to the throne is sure to see a record amount of wagers placed
' alexandra , who won with a time of 4.32 seconds , was then treated to a winner 's ceremony that included a trophy and a rendition of the national anthem
although corgi elizabeth rolled home last in the barkingham palace gold cup , the name is currently the odds - on favourite should the duke and duchess of cambridge have a girl
other popular choices include charlotte , the second - favourite at 6/1 , and diana which comes in at 12/1

while the majority of names put forward by punters are sensible , others have had a flutter on more outlandish names , according to bridge
' elizabeth and james are currently the most popular girl and boy âs names , ' she explains
' but that has nât stopped punters from betting on outsiders , including sapesan and mercedes at 500/1 apiece
' less favoured names in the running include ruprecht , chardonnay , kevin and wayne , all at 500/1 , and ruth , justin and colin at 200/1 .
