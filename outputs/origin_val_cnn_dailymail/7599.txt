an uninterrupted two - hour canal boat journey might not be the sort of thing you âd normally sit down to watch on tv
but it will feature with a three - hour tour of the national gallery and half - hour shows on traditional craftsmanship in a new bbc four series of programmes shot in real time , designed to relax viewers
the concept has been inspired by â slow tv â in norway , which in recent years has included a seven - hour recording of a train journey , a five - day programme on boat travel and 12 hours on knitting
viewers will be able to tune in to the canal , a journey down one of britain âs historic waterways
it will feature the sights and sounds of wildlife and the tow path as the boat passes , giving facts about the canal as captions in the landscape
national gallery will be a three - hour behind the scenes tour of the gallery with frederick wiseman â again , with no voiceover , but taking viewers from board room meetings to exhibition spaces
make presents three half - hour programmes showing traditional craftsmanship as skilled workers make items including a steel knife and a wooden chair
bbc four channel editor cassian harrison said : â this surprising selection of programmes is the antithesis to the general direction much of television is going in
one of three programmes : national gallery will be a three - hour behind the scenes tour of the gallery with frederick wiseman with no voiceover , but taking viewers from board room meetings to exhibition spaces â slowing everything right down gives us the time to really observe things as they happen , and this series of programmes celebrates the simple pleasures of life in the slow lane
â the reaction to the announcement of the series - called bbc four goes slow - today on twitter was mixed
producer chuck thomas joked : ' it 's only a matter of time until itv2 commissions watching paint dry
' but olympia brown , science learning manager at the royal institution , said : ' love that cassian harrison is doing slow tv on bbc four
including three hours of traditional craftmanship ! ' the idea for slow tv began in norway in 2009 when producers decided to broadcast the whole journey of a long train line that runs from oslo to bergen to celebrate its 100th anniversary
slow tv shows , which are known as â sakte-tv â in norway , have also included a 134 - hour boat trip from bergen to kirkenes , and a 24 - hour broadcast of the first day of the salmon fishing season
norway has attracted international attention for its series of â slow tv ' programmes , including a live - broadcast of a seven - hour train journey and the knitting of a jumper
the concept was born on state broadcaster nrk ( nrk - which translates as nrk ) in 2009 with centenary of the bergen railway line
rather than commission a conventional feature programme on the line , nrk instead decided to put a camera on a train and broadcast the entire seven - hour trip from oslo to bergen , interweaving archive footage to liven up the programme
first example : the idea for slow tv began in norway in 2009 when producers decided to broadcast the whole journey of a long train line that runs from oslo to bergen ( above ) to celebrate its 100th anniversary remarkably , it was a roaring success , with 1.2million viewers - about a quarter of the population of norway - tuning in for at least part of the trip
since then , the network has broadcast a cruise journey , a fire being slowly built and burned , and more recently , the making of a jumper - starting with the sheep from which the wool came
last year , the tax - funded channel began the online broadcast of piipshow , a live stream of birds and squirrels in a feeder that looks like a coffee shop
also last year , british airways announced it would make the seven - hour train journey video available to passengers on its in - flight entertainment system .
