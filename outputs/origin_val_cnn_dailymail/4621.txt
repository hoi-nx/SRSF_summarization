photos of durst taken as he was driven from a new orleans courthouse on tuesday showed the man looking remarkably different than he did over 10 years ago when he stood trial for the murder of morris black in gavelston , texas
the 71 - year - old , who was charged with drug and gun possession by local authorities after being picked up on a first - degree murder warrant issued by the los angeles police department for the murder of his friend berman , who was shot dead in her home on christmas eve 2000 , looked younger than he did back in 2003
cosmetic dermatologist dr. mark , who has offices in new york city , aspen and the hamptons , pointed out what work durst possibly had done to achieve this new look
' what this emphasizes is how multiple cosmetic procedures are synergistic and for the optimal cosmetic result , it 's not just simply a matter of doing either botox or filler or a procedure , but picking the best combination
' it also seems clear that durst 's teeth have changed , though it is not certain if he got veneers or dentures
if he did have the work done , it is not certain if it was for vanity purposes , necessity or to slowly alter his appearance
a search warrant that was recently released following his new orleans arrest reveals that durst had a latex mask in his hotel room and a fake id
in addition , he had slowly been withdrawing thousands of thousands of dollars that officials now believe he planned on taking with him or mailing to himself once he fled the country
he reportedly had $ 100 bills stacked in numerous envelopes ultimately totaling $ 42,000 in his hotel room
this in addition to a quarter pound of marijuana
his upper eyelid appears to snap open much higher this week than it ever did twelve years ago in 2003 a fold of skin nearly obscure his eyes , which were heavier lidded here in 2003 it also seems clear that durst 's teeth have changed , though it is not certain if he got veneers or dentures the arrest happened within hours of the finale of the documentary starring and about durst , the jinx , had its finale on hbo
in that finale durst seems to admit in the final scene that he is responsible for murdering berman , morris black and his first wife kathleen durst
durst will next appear in court on monday , and is currently at the orleans parish prison
police searching durst âs houston home on tuesday found three crime - related books , according to a list of items recovered in the execution of a search warrant
cops founds two copies of a deadly secret , a book about the 1982 disappearance of durst 's wife kathie durst and one copy of without a trace about durst being acquitted in the 2001 death and dismemberment of his galveston neighbor , morris black
police also found seven credit cards , seven blank checks and five boxes containing court documents and news articles in his possession
he also had a trash bag filled with court transcripts .
