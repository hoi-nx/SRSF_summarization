west is known for rankling people on stage
now it 's his turn to get a virtual smackdown
one music fan in the uk wants him out of the glastonbury festival so bad , he 's started a petition to make it happen
in his petition , lonsdale describes the rapper as an " egotistical , maniacal , disgrace
" he calls on organizers to replace the " yeezus " singer at the glastonbury festival this summer
west is booked to headline the festival , which runs between june 24 - 28
" west is an insult to music fans all over the world , " lonsdale says in the change.org petition
" we spend hundreds of pounds to attend glasto , and by doing so , expect a certain level of entertainment
" the petition urges west to " pass his headline slot on to someone deserving
" lonsdale is not the only music fan upset by his scheduled performance
by early friday , the petition had nearly 80,000 signatures
west and the festival 's organizers have not responded to the petition
the festival is held in somerset , england , and features various types of music
