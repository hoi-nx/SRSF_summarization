husbands who refuse to pay the divorce settlements they owe their ex-wives should be banned from driving , travelling abroad and even given court - enforced curfews , government legal advisers said yesterday
specially - appointed judges should also have the power to order banks and hm revenue and customs to tell the courts how much money reluctant ex-husbands really earn , they recommended
curfews on men who wo n't pay their debts to their former wives could compel them to stay at home for as long as 12 hours a day â and would be enforced by making them wear electronic tags
driving bans could last as long as a year
around 90,000 family financial orders are made by the courts in england and wales every year , and they feature in three out of four divorce cases the sweeping sanctions were put forward by the law commission , a body led by an appeal judge which supplies ministers with proposals on necessary legal reforms
in a paper yesterday it said that it was time ' to bring pressure to bear on those who refuse to meet their obligations under a family financial order
' it added that making husbands pay would save the state many millions of pounds in welfare payments
single - parent families left behind after divorce often rely on benefits and other welfare services
around 90,000 family financial orders are made by the courts in england and wales every year , and they feature in three out of four divorce cases
the orders set out what the wealthier former spouse or civil partner â most often the husband â must pay to support his former wife to meet her needs and maintain her living standards
the orders also regularly include support for children
but , the law commission said , husbands frequently fail to comply with the orders either because they ca n't pay or they wo n't pay
making them pay is complicated , bewildering and expensive , and often efforts to do so do not work
the only punishment the courts can impose is prison â but sending a husband to jail for as long as six months requires criminal standards of proof that are hard to establish , the consultation paper said
the sweeping sanctions were put forward by the law commission , a body led by an appeal judge which supplies ministers with proposals on necessary legal reforms ( headquarters pictured ) the law commission said the solution was to force men to pay by using ' sanctions that are designed to be coercive and not punitive â the threat of these sanctions ought to be enough in many cases to encourage compliance
' it called for a new power for courts to impose ' disqualification from foreign travel ' orders which would stop an errant husband from taking a foreign holiday or going abroad on business for 12 months
unpaid wives should also be able to apply for their former husband to be banned from driving , the law commission said
the paper said : ' it would not be used in a way that would unduly impact on the debtor 's ability to earn a living as that would defeat the whole point of the order
however , we think that used appropriately , it could be an effective method of influencing ' wo n't pay ' debtors
' curfews , the document suggested , would keep an individual who failed to pay in one place specified by a court for between two and 12 hours a day
' there would have to be arrangements for electronic tagging , ' it said
to tell the difference between what the law commission termed ' ca n't pay ' and ' won ' t pay ' debtors , the paper said the courts should be able to apply to hm revenue and customs for information about employment and earnings
similar orders would force banks and building societies to give up information about accounts
such powers are already on the statute book to make people pay court and tribunal compensation awards
but they have never been put into use
the information gathered could be passed on to wives who are owed money , the law commission said
' on the one hand , this intrudes on the privacy of the debtor and offends the idea of the parties moving on and living separate lives , which is an aspiration of the law in this area , ' it said
' on the other hand , it may be the most effective use of the information and family law creditors are likely to already have some knowledge of the debtor 's personal circumstances
' the paper also said that specially - trained judges should be appointed in every family court to make and supervise the enforcement procedures
curfews on men who wo n't pay their debts to their former wives could compel them to stay at home for as long as 12 hours a day â and would be enforced by making them wear electronic tags the law commissioner who produced the paper , professor elizabeth cooke , said : ' the law governing the enforcement of family financial orders is hard to understand and difficult to use
' when the courts can not enforce family financial orders , it can lead to real hardship for former partners and children and place a huge burden on the state
' we need to understand whether existing mechanisms for enforcement are working as well as they might , what other powers the courts might use to tackle non-payment , and how we can find better solutions for couples when one partner is able to pay but refuses to do so
' some family lawyers were doubtful that driving and travel bans and curfews would work
james brown , a family lawyer with jmw solicitors , said : ' were these measures to be adopted , this would demonstrate that the courts are not afraid to flex their muscles
' however , it is worth remembering that even though this would be a robust initiative , these measures would still only be deterrents designed to intimidate but lacking redress
clients pursuing outstanding sums do n't really care whether their ex has to be in bed early , ca n't drive or travel abroad
what they really want is the prospect of financial relief and that is what is missing here
' the use of curfews and electronic tagging to discipline former husbands and wives was first proposed by tony blair 's government a decade ago
the plan was to penalise thousands of mothers who refuse to let divorced or separated fathers see their children in defiance of court orders
but the idea was dropped amid fears of a backlash if many thousands of single mothers were tagged .
