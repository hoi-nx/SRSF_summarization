a father is finally welcoming all four of his newborn quadruplets home - but sadly not his wife
morales from phoenix , arizona had two of the babies home with him , and the other two were cleared to leave the hospital this week
this after the babies were born premature and , in a tragic twist , his wife erica , 36 , passed away just one day after giving birth
the pair had gone through ivf fertility treatment in a desperate attempt to conceive to complete their family
but the last time mr morales saw his wife was when she kissed her on the head and said he loved her before going into labor at banner good samaritan hospital
their mother would never get to meet them ' look at these beautiful blessings , ' morales told people
' even when they scream their heads off i want to give them the biggest kiss
' he then added ; ' i already know their quirky little habits or the next time they 're going to cry
they 're starting to form their own personalities
' and while he says dealing with four is a lot more difficult than dealing with two , he does have help thanks to his wife 's mother - in - law , who moved down to help with the children
the children arrived one month before her due date
carlos jr , paisley , tracy , and erica were delivered safely but the mother went into hypovolemic shock , an emergency condition where one experiences a severe amount of blood loss
just an hour later she died , and never got to hold them in her arms
since then mr morales has been caring for the youngsters and has described the ordeal he has been through
' we were so excited to start our family , ' he told people magazine , ' and then it all came crashing down
' in the heartbreaking interview , he also described the moment the pair first met
' i did n't speak any english and she did n't speak any spanish , ' , laughing
' but i asked her to dance and she said yes
' he then gave her his phone number , only to discover she had thrown the piece of paper out

' ' the doctor said she was having too many contractions so it was time to deliver the babies , ' he said : ' we took pictures before she went into the delivery room , made some videos , and she was surrounded by family and friends
i said to her , ' let 's get these babies out '
' they began discussing names , but mrs morales said the pair could decide after they were born
after the birth the babies were laid down in a nursery , mr morales went in and squeezed his wife hand as she woke up
a short time later alarms from the equipment surrounding her bed started going off
the next thing mr morales was told is that his wife was dead
describing what happened to people , he said : ' how could this have happened ? she was fine , and then she was n't
she was alive and then she was just gone
' i went from having the best day of my life to the next morning experiencing the worst day of my life
' the nurse then brought the babies into the room and he held them on his lap. the nurse asked for their names and he gave her three they had agreed on and one he decided himself - erica
