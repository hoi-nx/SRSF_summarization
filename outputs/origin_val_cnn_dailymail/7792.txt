rome was n't built in day , and it certainly was n't for rural postman le palais idã©al , who dedicated 33 years of his life constructing an incredible limestone palace , complete with pillars , buttresses and grottoes
the widower would often find unusually shaped rocks as he delivered mail in france , and ended up pushing a wheelbarrow each day on his 18 - mile route to collect stones of beauty
what started as a small hobby , soon became a life project in 1879 , resulting in one of the most magnificent amateur architectural structures to date ; le palais idã©al
the idea for the elaborate cathedral came when he tripped over an unusually shaped rock in his 30s
he later wrote in his journal : ' i wanted to know the cause
in a dream i had built a palace , a castle or caves
i told no one about it for fear of being ridiculed and i felt ridiculous myself
' i said to myself : since nature is willing to do the sculpture , i will do the masonry and the architecture
' le palais idã©al would haul his findings to a site in hauterives every day after work , and thus began the ambitious 33 year project , completed with no outside help
the dedicated builder would often have to work well into the night , by the light of an oil lamp , but that did n't deter him from his mission
le palais idã©al would construct the palace at night , after work , by the light of oil lamps
in 1969 , andrã© malraux , the minister of culture , declared the palais a cultural landmark and had it officially protected the website for the palace states it was built with no architectural rules and is regarded as a great example of outsider artwork due to the long hours of the project , the widower left his son in the care of godparents , in order to be able to focus his energies on his work
the outer walls , measuring 24 metres in length , and 10 metres high , took 22 years to complete , with le palais idã©al binding the stones together with lime , mortar and cement
le palais idã©al is as intricate as it is vast , and includes sculptures of exotic animals and mythical creatures , which were inspired by the postcards he delivered , and with influences from christianity and hinduism
the structure is beloved by visitors today , 100 years after it was constructed , and was even featured on the french stamp in 1986 when le palais idã©al died , he requested that he could be buried at the palace
sadly it was not permitted and the talented constructor ended up building his own mausoleum for himself in the cemetery where he was buried after his death in 1924 , a year after finishing the palace
the structure is beloved by visitors today , 100 years after it was constructed , and was even featured on the french stamp in 1986
perhaps most poignant explanation for the architectural wonder is the inscription carved into the palace by le palais idã©al : ' the dream of one man
