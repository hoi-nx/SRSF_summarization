' as a result of her arrest , her property and car were searched and in her car a dvd was found containing a number of images showing someone having sexual intercourse or oral sex with a dog
' the issue is whether in fact love was in possession of these articles , ' said the prosecutor

' the disabled post-op transexual , who went dogging around three to four times a week at the time the images were found in 2013 , said she swapped dvds with people ' all the time '
she said : ' i would swap them with doggers and lorry drivers in car parks
they were straight sex dvds mostly

love , who denied two counts of possessing extreme pornographic images , said she had not had her phone stolen or tampered with as far as she was aware prosecuting , mallison said : ' you say you helped at the club on thursdays and sundays
i ask that because these clips you had on your phone were accessed on a tuesday
that would indicate they were not put there by people who went to the club
' when asked why she had not tried to find out who had given her the dvds , she replied : ' i do not know the people who get into my van and tie me up and have sex with me
i would n't know where to start
' nine times out of ten i am off my head on drugs
' miss mallison said : ' is it just coincidence that the two pictures are of the same nature as the dvd ? ' jobless love replied : ' i have all sorts of dvds , several of black men who are well endowed
i never ask people 's names , i just get tied up , have a good time and never see them again
' judge christopher critchlow told the jury of six men and six women : ' the only issue for you to decide is whether or not you are sure the defendant had the images on her phone and the dvd in her possession
' love , from sunbury , surrey , was found guilty of possessing extreme pornographic images on her phone but the jury did not find her guilty of possessing the footage on the dvd
she was released on unconditional bail to return to the same court on april 17 for sentencing .
