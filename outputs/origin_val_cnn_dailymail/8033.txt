they went on to lose the game on penalties and two years ago he made headlines when he placed a statue of hitler praying on his knees in the former ghetto
jews groups expressed fury at the ' senseless ' decision to install the provocative artwork in the area where thousands of jews were forced to live during the rule of the nazi regime
in total , around 300,000 jews from the ghetto died or were sent to their death in concentration camps
the statue , entitled ' him ' , attracted a large number of visitors when it was first installed in november 2012
the work was visible only from a distance , and the artist did not initially say what he intended viewers to read into hitler 's pose
organisers of the exhibition of which the statue was a part said its point was to make people reflect on the nature of evil - but others were furious by its placement in such a sensitive site
had the artwork continued to the current day , it would include england 's 2006 world cup loss to portugal
