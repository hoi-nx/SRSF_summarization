roy hodgson is keen to extend his contract which will expire next year , although fa chairman dyke has warned him that negotiations may not begin for another 12 months
â i get on quite well with roy hodgson and we chat all the time but we have not talked about contracts yet , â said dyke
â we genuinely have nât discussed it
we will have that discussion in the next nine months to a year
â when we decided in brazil that we wanted roy hodgson to continue with his contract , we thought , â he âs got a contract , he sees it through â
some time in the next year we will discuss what happens afterwards

roy hodgson will represent england but dyke plans to miss the event after reacting to a tough 2014 world cup draw by making a cut - throat gesture
â roy hodgson will go , i âm not allowed after what happened last time , â he said
england are cruising towards euro 2016 after winning the first four qualifiers to establish a six - point lead at the head of a group from which the top two go through automatically
roy hodgson will be 70 at the time of the world cup in russia but has proved a popular manager with fa chiefs and players alike since he replaced fabio capello in 2012
the euro 2016 qualification process has been so tame , however , that a final decision on his contract may even be shelved until after the finals
â without being disrespectful , this group is nât the toughest , â said centre half phil jagielka
â time will tell in the tournament
there is a bit of pressure on and that is when the judgment will be clearer
we need to have a good tournament in france to back him if roy hodgson is going to stay on , and the boys are desperate to do that
he âs a likeable person and a good man - manager
