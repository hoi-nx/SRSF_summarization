a women 's tournament went on as planned at the myakka pines golf club in englewood , on florida 's west coast , as the gator , estimated at 12 to 13 feet long reposed in full view of about 100 participants , said zada , the club 's general manager
' if we stopped playing because of alligators , we 'd never have golfers , ' zada said
' this gentleman is well into his 80s
he would n't even know photoshop , ' zada said
and according to the club , the alligator is far from the first - or even the biggest - to show up on the course
a 15 - footer , nicknamed big george , hung around for years until his death , zada said
despite nearly daily alligator sightings at the course , none have attacked a person in the club 's 37 years despite nearly daily alligator sightings at the course , none have attacked a person in the club 's 37 years , zada said , owing in part to a strict policy against feeding the animals
dangerous confrontations between humans and alligators usually stem from people feeding them , florida wildlife officials have said
the new alligator has yet to be given a moniker , but that may soon change , zada said
' we might name him viral , ' she said .
