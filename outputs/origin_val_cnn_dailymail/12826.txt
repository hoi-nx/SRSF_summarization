as the seventh full week of testimony in the first - degree murder trial against former patriots star aaron hernandez came to a close this week , witnesses described him as acting strangely and glaring at the victim two nights before the killing
aaron hernandez is on trial in fall river , massachusetts , in connection with the shooting death of odin lloyd , a semi-pro football player who was found dead june 17 , 2013
the former tight end had signed a five - year contract extension worth $ 40 million but , less than a year later , aaron hernandez was charged with the murder of the man who was dating the sister of his fiancÃ©e
hours after his arrest on june 26 , 2013 , the patriots dropped him from the team
two of aaron hernandez 's closest associates are co-defendants in the case
evidence collected in odin lloyd 's death led to two more murder charges against aaron hernandez in a separate case in boston
he is accused of shooting daniel de abreu and safiro furtado in july 2012 , allegedly over a spilled drink
two witnesses who saw aaron hernandez at the boston nightclub rumor just 48 hours before odin lloyd 's killing said he looked angry and aggressive
odin lloyd was with aaron hernandez at the club that friday night
on thursday , prosecutors called witness no. 100 : arma , a nightclub promoter
she told jurors she danced with aaron hernandez at the club in the early morning of june 15 , 2013
" he walked by me and he tapped my hip
" arma testified that she danced with aaron hernandez for about 10 minutes
" he was pleasant and kind of charming , " she said
when he returned about 10 minutes later , arma said , aaron hernandez grabbed her arm and took her to another part of the club
he was " very aggressive , " she testified
then , she said , he asked her " to show what i could do with that thing , " referring to her backside
" he was irritated and very aggressive , " she told the jury
during cross-examination , defense attorney michael fee showed surveillance video of arma dancing with aaron hernandez
there was bumping and grinding , mostly with her backside to him
it was uncomfortable to watch in court
jurors watched the video with laser focus
fee asked arma , " what kind of dance is that called ? " arma said she did n't know
some of the female jurors appeared to chuckle softly
earlier in the week , witness nicholas testified that he also saw aaron hernandez at rumor and the ex-player " seemed like he was angry about something
" aaron hernandez 's mouth looked like a " grunt , " he said
nicholas , a college student , was at the club with friends -- some of whom were friends with odin lloyd
when odin lloyd was talking closely with one of his friends , aaron hernandez looked angry , according to nicholas
aaron hernandez was standing near the dj at the time , about 15 feet away from odin lloyd and his friend
nicholas said aaron hernandez glared at them for a few minutes
during tough questioning from fee , nicholas stood his ground
the defense showed jurors nicholas ' initial recorded interview with detectives in which he gave a different description of what he saw and was less critical of aaron hernandez
nicholas also remembered aaron hernandez " storming out of the club
" " he looked angry , " nicholas told the jury
as aaron hernandez walked down the street , " he motioned back with his arms as if to say get away from me
" prosecutors played surveillance video backing up nicholas ' description
during that video , odin lloyd is also seen following aaron hernandez at a distance
though prosecutors are trying to establish that aaron hernandez was angry , jurors still do n't know why
shayanna jenkins , aaron hernandez 's fiancÃ©e and mother of his baby daughter , was not in court to see the dirty - dancing video
she has n't been seen in court since march 6
but shayanna jenkins ' name did come up in court regarding a defense motion to suppress evidence gathered from aaron hernandez 's house in november 2014
jurors were not present for that debate
the prosecution showed before - and - after photos of a closet in aaron hernandez 's home in north attleboro
one photo from june 2013 showed the sneakers aaron hernandez wore the night odin lloyd was killed
it also showed the shoes aaron hernandez associate ortiz wore the same night
the two pairs of shoes rested on top of a bunch of other shoes
in the second photo , taken in november 2014 , the same closet is seen with all of the shoes except the ones aaron hernandez and ortiz were wearing the night of the shooting
they were no longer in the closet or any other part of the house
prosecutors wanted to link shayanna jenkins to the disappearance of the shoes
mccauley referred to the defendant 's jailhouse comments that " she does what i want , " referring to shayanna jenkins
mccauley also told the judge that aaron hernandez " was directing her ( shayanna jenkins ) to give money to singleton at the time where he had just recently told her not to talk
" he added , " we know she did n't talk and then was held in contempt
" singleton is aaron hernandez 's cousin
court observers wonder when shayanna jenkins will be back
the last time shayanna jenkins was in court , a reporter noticed she was no longer wearing her engagement ring
however , shayanna jenkins is facing perjury charges for allegedly lying to investigators and has been granted immunity to testify at the trial
will testimony about aaron hernandez 's liaisons with other women -- and negative texts about shayanna jenkins -- affect her testimony ? does her absence mean she 'll turn on her fiance ? the answers may be a few weeks away
there are indications the commonwealth may wrap up its case by mid-april , much testimony focused on the shoes aaron hernandez wore the night odin lloyd was shot
a nike consultant testified that aaron hernandez was wearing nike air jordan retro 11 lows in a size 13
about 93,000 pairs of that shoe were made , significantly fewer in a size 13
the shoe 's sole makes a distinct impression , according to lt. bennett of the massachusetts state police
the consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney sultan that other nike shoes -- more than 3 million -- make the same impression yet bennett , who works in crime scene services , testified that the footwear impression left near odin lloyd 's body was " in agreement " or consistent with the air jordan retro 11 lows size 13
although he did not have the shoes that aaron hernandez wore that night , he an identical pair to make his determination
bennett did so by creating a transparency of the sole and laying it over a photo of the footwear impression
jurors watched as he drew lines showing how the sole aligned with the impression
what may have been a key moment for the prosecution was quickly derailed by defense attorney sultan
sultan questioned the science behind analyzing foot impressions , and he introduced a march 2014 report from bennett saying the partial footwear impression lacked certain detail and quality to make a comparison
sultan hammered bennett on that report
bennett admitted that his reexamination helped the prosecution
mccauley was able to undo some of the damage , allowing bennett to explain that it was only after gaining access to air jordan retro 11s in december 2014 that he was able to make a comparison
he testified that what he thought was a lack of distinction were actually gaps in the design of the sole
it 's clear from the testimony and the filing for a search warrant in november 2014 that investigators overlooked the shoes worn by aaron hernandez , ortiz and wallace -- another co-defendant -- the night of odin lloyd 's death , despite having a photo of them from june 2013
seventeen months into the investigation , they searched aaron hernandez 's house again
none of the shoes were found
the prosecution brought in three separate witnesses who either owned or worked for companies in the industrial park along john dietsch boulevard where odin lloyd 's body was found
with these witnesses and collected surveillance videos , prosecutors gave jurors a road map of the route they say aaron hernandez drove to the corliss landing crime scene
while the car 's make and model are n't distinguishable in the video , jurors could see its lights go by at specific times that match when aaron hernandez , wallace , ortiz and odin lloyd would have been in the car
singleton arranged for her aunt to drive her and wallace to georgia in the days after odin lloyd 's death
testifying for the prosecution , ritchon said singleton asked her on june 21 , 2013 , to move up her planned trip to visit her daughter in georgia
she brought wallace with her
at the time , singleton was married to ritchon 's nephew , tl singleton
he died in a car crash a little more than a week later
ritchon also testified that wallace suggested using back roads to drive out of connecticut and through new york to avoid tolls
she said wallace carried his clothes in a black trash bag
prosecutors were attempting to get jurors to link it to the black trash bag shayanna jenkins removed from her house just a few days earlier
prosecutors say that bag held the gun used to kill odin lloyd
after spending the night at the home of ritchon 's daughter , wallace boarded a bus to florida
that 's where he surrendered to police
wallace has pleaded not guilty to the charge of an accessory after the fact of a slaying in odin lloyd 's death .
