american low - cost carrier , spirit , has just acquired its 69th plane and has found an interesting way to celebrate
not only has the airline slashed roundtrip fairs to Â£ 69 in april and may - including taxes and fees - but they also announced such a drastic price drop with some rather cheeky copy
the emails sent around announcing the sale reference a particular sexual act in very blatant terms , with some customers complaining that the new campaign is in poor taste
' it 's our favorite number -- ever since we were twelve and found that magazine under our brother 's bed ( the one with the fantastic articles )
' # 69 is perfect : just the right size , with a cockpit that 's in your face ( because it 's bright yellow )
' use your mouth to spread the word : spirit is in an even better position to get you where you 're going
' spirit has long taken a tongue - in - cheek approach to its promotions , calling itself the ' home of the bare fare ' the company has already used the provocative slogan , ' home of the bare fare , ' when discussing their competitive pricing in the past
in fact , the phrase is currently emblazoned on several of its aircraft
in much the same vein , spirit spokesman paul berry said , in a statement , that the latest campaign was simply a reflection of the airline 's unconventional and quirky personality
' spirit is n't your typical airline and we do n't want to be
' we enjoy being different than other airlines
' spokesman , paul berry , has said that the latest campaign is simply a reflection of spirit 's quirky personality however , some customers have took to social media to question if the ad campaign has gone a bit too far ' when it comes to advertising , different means we do n't spend a lot of money on advertising -- because that just increases fares
' but we 're also different because our ads are fun , provocative , sometimes silly and often irreverent
' they get lots of attention
' the vast majority of our customers find these types of ads humorous and accept them for what they are
we understand there is a small group of people who feel differently
