the third youngest child valerie mccaffrey ( pictured ) was presented with certificate from the guinness book of world records this week following the record being announced in november last year ' it took over a year for the record to come through
' they need proof of everything so i was going to and from the registry office to get birth certificates and marriage certificates
' my son daniel also had to help with all the computer side of things
' however , valerie added that when they were finally awarded their certificate it had been well worth the wait
valerie puts her mother 's constant pregnancy down to a lack of television when they were younger ' everyone was delighted when it was confirmed and we could n't wait for the certificates to come
' when they arrived we were all very excited , they will definitely be going up as pride of place in our houses
' it is incredible to think we are the oldest family in the world
i knew we were a big family but to be over 1,000 years old is a remarkable achievement

she added that growing up with so many siblings had been very entertaining and puts her mothers regular pregnancies down to a lack of television
' growing up was fun all being in the same house together
' i think 23 months was the longest time our mother went without being pregnant
but there was n't really any television in those days
' valerie says that when they are reunited it is just as it once was with all the siblings getting along famously
' we all keep in touch and we are having a big family gathering in june for my 80th birthday
' it is great when we all get together
we all natter away for hours and the older brothers talk about their war service
' second youngest sibling phyllis smith , 78 , said : ' we all go on holiday together once a year and five of my brothers and sisters meet up every week for a game of whist
' we have our moments when we disagree and we do have little cliques but we never fall out or bear a grudge
' val and eunice and i are very close because we are the three youngsters
we go off to the theatre together and do the things women do
' but eunice rules us all with a rod of iron
even though eunice is the youngest she 's the mother figure who has to be obeyed
she is very caring and kind
' the siblings are so close that they even refused to fall out with each when one of them blew their chance of becoming millionaires
phyllis added : ' we all do the lottery together in a syndicate organised by poor ralph
' we always used to include number 39 , the number of the house where some of us grew up
' but because 39 had been coming up a lot poor ralph decided to change it one particular week and unfortunately for us we would have won the jackpot
' we got Â£ 300 each instead of being millionaires
poor ralph was devastated and came round to each of us and apologised profusely
' other families might have broken up over that but we did n't
we were not meant to be rich
