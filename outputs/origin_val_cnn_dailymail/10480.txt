a man who shook his two - year - old stepdaughter so violently she fell into a coma and died , has been charged with her murder
david adams , 25 , had been charged with assault and child endangerment in november after acknowledging having shaken thaiya , according to the authorities
he had recently been released from prison after four when his family posted a bail bond but he was rearrested on wednesday after the brooklyn district attorney upgraded the charges against him , according to the new york times
yesterday he appeared in brooklyn criminal court on a charge of second - degree murder
he hung his head during his 15 minute appearance
assistant district attorney frank degaetano said in court : ' he shook her several times
thaiya , two , was taken off life support after suffering a brain hemorrhage
stepfather david adams , 25 , has now been charged with her murder ' he made her hit her head
she had multiple abrasions and contusions , 17 on her head , and she had damage to the axons and neurons in her brain consistent with massive brain damage
' thaiya had been declared brain - dead in november after david adams said he shook her and she was admitted to a hospital with bleeding in the brain , retinal hemorrhaging and bruises
the incident leading to thaiya 's death occurred on november 12 when her mum spruill left her brooklyn apartment for about an hour , leaving thaiya with david adams
according to a criminal complaint , david adams told police he held thaiya off the ground , causing her head ' to rotate forward and back rapidly several times , ' and the girl 's body then went limp
he again shook her , so hard her head swiveled again several times , and then her body went rigid
thaiya was asleep when ms spruill returned , she said , and the child woke once during the night to ask for juice
ms spruill called an ambulance next morning when she heard thaiya struggling for breath
the youngster was rushed to brookdale hospital shortly before 7am and despite numerous operations , doctors concluded her injuries were too severe to overcome and she was eventually taken off life support
it has since emerged that thaiya may have been the victim of months of abuse at the hands of david adams that was investigated by new york social services
ms spruill and thaiya 's father terrell smith disagreed over whether to donate her organs after the toddler was declared brain dead two days after the incident
a judge ordered brookdale to keep the child on life support for at least another day to keep her organs alive until the girl 's parents resolved their dispute
' she was born with that , she 's going to be buried with that , her body , her eyes - it 's what makes her her , ' thaiya told the new york times from thaiya 's hospital bed in brookdale hospital , new york
thaiya 's father terrell smith says she was being systematically abused by her mother 's new husband ' my daughter was born with that , and she 's going to lie down with the same thing
' speaking separately , spruill told the paper : ' i just think it would be a blessing for someone else 's family
' as organ and tissue donation can only occur when there is agreement among family members , it was eventually ruled thaiya 's organs would not be donated
the parental dispute is reportedly the latest in a series spanning thaiya 's lifetime , as thaiya claims he made repeated attempts to save her from david adams , who he claims was abusive
relatives made emotional tributes to the ' smart ' and ' sweet ' girl at the time of david adams ' first appearance in court
' thai , she was like the sweetest little girl ever , like you would n't have problems with her ever , ' shayne smith , thaiya 's uncle , told time warner cable
' she was very smart - very , very smart
' according to court documents , david adams admitted to shaking thaiya when questioned
and police sources say there are records of a similar shaking incident in the household last month
at his first appearance david adams , who married thaiya 's mother in march , wept before prosecutors in court as they told him the two - year - old had died
he was very , very upset , ' defense attorney joseph sieger told the new york post
thaiya said social services took custody of the little girl for a week while they investigated david adams for abuse
she was returned and the case was dropped , he said
the acs has refused to confirm or deny thaiya 's claims due to confidentiality restrictions .
