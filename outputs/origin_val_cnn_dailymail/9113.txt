sixty three seconds was all it took
just over one minute was enough for a game to be turned on its head and for refereeing standards to be demonstrated , once again , to be lamentable
to deal with the first part of that conundrum , referee swarbrick ca nât really be blamed for the game ending as a spectacle before it had even got going
mcauley and craig dawson got themselves in a terrible tangle , the former with a sloppy pass and the latter clumsily challenging bony , who was through on goal
the red card was justifiable and the challenge was a bone - headedly stupid one to make in the first minute
the real drama occurred thereafter , however
bony , to his credit , attempted to go on and score
mcauley , attempting to redeem his error , ran round to challenge the ivorian and make a good challenge to block him

click here for our match zone service in the midst of all that , swarbrick blew up for a foul from where craig dawson had made the initial challenge
but instead of sending off the left back he dismissed mcauley
in one year the premier league has now seen three cases of the wrong man being sent off
either referees are getting worse , or the game is getting immeasurably faster
and with rugby âs six nations tournament reaching a climax yesterday , you longed for a brief pause in which the referee could consult a fourth official who could adjudicate on the red card â he would have probably concurred â and then ensure the right man is sent off
tony pulis naturally agreed with that , arguing managers should have the ability to challenge two decisions in a match , citing the fact that in other games craig dawson âs challenge might have gone unpunished
â the inconsistency is one thing , â he said
â but once he decides it âs a goal - scoring opportunity and he has to send him of i ca nât believe he âs picked the wrong player
manuel pellegrini âs assessment was about correct
â he made a mistake about the player but i think the rule is very clear , â he said
â the chance was very clear and he was the last man
then it does nât depend on the referee â he has to do what the rule says
â naturally the match felt unnaturally uncompetitive thereafter and that seemed to be reflected in the crowd
the atmosphere at city after a week of defeats to burnley and barcelona was as muted as could be
technically they are still in the title race ; in fact they are only three points behind , albeit chelsea have two games in hand
but judging from the mood at the etihad stadium yesterday , that is merely a theoretical , abstract concept
all belief seems to have been sucked out of the club , meaning that all that is left is a top - four finish to oversee before manuel pellegrini is thanked for his time and his two trophies
bony celebrates after scoring city 's first goal after 25 minutes at the etihad stadium the ivorian striker opened his account for the club when he spun inside the box , hooked the ball over and fired into the net fernando gets down on his knees to celebrate scoring city 's second goal five minutes before half - time the brazilian pounced from close range following west brom defensive confusion , with goalkeeper myhill grounded silva ( centre ) is congratulated after scoring city 's third goal to make absolutely sure of the three points silva raises his arms in celebration after touching in a shot by stevan jovetic from the edge of the penalty box there was a brief spell in which you wondered if manuel pellegrini âs woes might get worse should they fail to break down ten - man west brom
but the visitors , myhill aside , were nât in the mood for gritty defiance
indeed , it seemed as though the entire fiasco had collectively scrambled their defensive brains
the first two goals they conceded , which made their task hopeless both came from corners , situations at which they should be able to defend more easily than from open play
but for the first goal on 26 minutes , city worked the ball well from a short corner to bony
craig gardner attempted a half hearted challenge but bony was not to be shrugged off the ball and pulled it down ; the unfortunate craig dawson was also culpable , not reacting quick enough as the ivorian controlled , shot and scored his first goal for the club since his Â£ 28m move
west brom might have felt a little more aggrieved for the second goal on 40 minutes â though it too involved some dreadful defending
jesus navas corner was met by the high , flying foot of eliaquim managala and it seemed perilously close to stephane sessegnon âs head
that said , from thereon in , west brom hardly covered themselves in glory
olsson sliced the ball gently into the path of fernando and james morrison failed to react as the brazilian simply poked the ball into the net
joe hart collides with west brom defender olsson as he comes out to try and punch the ball clear joleon lescott leaps in behind pablo zabaleta but sends the ball over joe hart 's goal following a rare west brom attack berahino somehow hit the crossbar with this header , with joe hart nowhere near it â i think our fans believe we can do it , â said manuel pellegrini
â the important thing is to demonstrate playing the way we did today that we will try
â that they did , with 46 shots on goal
but it âs not enough to sustain credibility at present

the england under 21 striker ca n't quite believe his luck after seeing his header rebound off the woodwork frank lampard rues a missed opportunity as city attempted to boost their goal difference - settling for three in the end city striker stevan jovetic appeals to referee swarbrick for a handball decision were it not for myhill the afternoon would have been even more calamitous
his most notable saves came from silva on 23 minutes , 54 minutes and 59 minutes but that was by no means an exhaustive list
west brom were also saved on 58 minutes by the post when sergio aguero struck and then again by the woodwork , when bony chipped the rebound on to the cross bar
on 73 minutes there was an extraordinary development ; a west brom corner , which was flicked on by olsson to berahino , who , just two yards out , flicked an instinctive header on to the bar
the miss summed up a dismal afternoon
shortly afterwards , silva , by far the best player on the pitch , confirmed the inevitable
stevan jovetic combined well with the rampaging gael clichy and the montenegrin âs shot was turned in at close range by silva , who departed shortly after to a standing ovation
still , the overwhelming feeling from both sides was of a season gently winding down rather than reaching a dramatic climax
