louis van gaal has filled his players â heads with so much information this season they look shackled
in a dressing room where everything is analysed , the players look unable to break free
if ever a fixture can change that , it âs this one
manchester united against arsenal is a game to inspire any player and , with a potential trip to wembley , you can see players like wayne rooney falling back on their natural attacking instincts
if they do break from van gaal âs mould , those creative personalities could come flooding through
wayne rooney and his manchester united team - mates have looked shackled under louis van gaal 's regime playing at pace manchester united have dominated possession recently but arsenal wo nât be troubled if manchester united play keep - ball
the win at city shows how they are now just as happy hitting teams on the counter as they are keeping possession
with alexis sanchez , danny welbeck and theo walcott , they have pace to burn and with no jonny evans it means another change in the manchester united backline , which will only increase uncertainty
arsenal speedsters such as theo walcott can cause manchester united 's defence all sorts of problems at old trafford watch out for danny welbeck danny welbeck would have been smarting when he was sold by van gaal
he is a good finisher , a mature player and there is no way he will want to see manchester united troop out for a cup final in may
danny welbeck will be looking to prove a point to louis van gaal who moved him on from old trafford the fortress is crumbling when arsenal last played manchester united in the fa cup , sir alex ferguson âs side won 2 - 0 in 2011
since he left , old trafford has not been the same
in a season and a half , manchester united have lost nine league games at home
that âs as many as alex ferguson lost in his last six seasons
teams do nât fear going there and even the home fans do nât know what to expect these days
arsenal will hope to exploit any doubts
old trafford has not quite been the fortress of old since sir alex ferguson 's departure van gaal 's side have played 33 games this season , nine fewer than arsenal , so should be fresher
in the table of minutes played by both squads , only two manchester united players are in the top 10 and one is goalkeeper david de gea
minutes played per mertesacker , arsenal : 3150 santi cazorla , arsenal : 3121 alexis sanchez , arsenal : 3081 david de gea , manchester united : 2970 calum chambers , arsenal : 2392 wayne rooney , manchester united : 2383 kieran gibbs , arsenal : 2287 wojciech szczesny arsenal 2279 nacho monreal , arsenal : 2266 laurent koscielny , arsenal : 2194 my memories of a classic rivalry there has always been a great rivalry between these sides , but i never played at old trafford with any fear
i went there as a youngster in 1986 and won with arsenal and during the wenger years we had a team that could go and win anywhere
we were a physical team but we could play , and it was almost a compliment when manchester united tried to match our physicality
in 1999 , ryan giggs scored that classic fa cup goal and it turned the season
arsenal could have won the double but manchester united went on to win the treble
andy cole made a run to drag me out of position , but sometimes you just have to admire moments of genius
the other game people love to remind me of is the â battle of old trafford â in 2003
in the little black book of opposition players , ruud van nistelrooy was one not to be trusted
he was a top player and a fighter , but he would look for any reason to go down
perhaps i overreacted , but the whole team was infuriated by him
and i âm still not convinced i deserved to give away the penalty that ruud van nistelrooy eventually missed ! martin keown clashed with former manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy in 2003
