here âs a frustrated will stevens , who has nât taken to the track in his manor this weekend : it is frustrating for me and the team
we want to be out on the track
the cars are ready to go but there are a few gremlins which are keeping us back
i want to be out there as much as anything
coming from abu dhabi last year i know what a race meeting is like
i am heading back to the british , but i know the team are heading out early to malaysia so we will be in better shape than we are now
there are a few issues with the software which means we ca nât get out there
17 - year - old max verstappen will start a commendable 12th on his grand prix debut , but the dutchman has been out - qualified by his team - mate
carlos sainz jnr , also on his formula one bow , sticks his toro rosso in q1
home favourite ricciardo is on a hot - lap here as he looks to cement his place in the top - 10 shootout
he crosses the line with a 1:28.679 to bump him up to sixth , and receives a smattering of applause from the melbourne crowd
lewis hamilton and nico rosberg are happy they 've done enough , and they are back in the mercedes garage
remember , five drivers will be eliminated from this 15 - minute session
it 's kvyat , felipe nasr , hulkenberg and perez in the drop - zone with two minutes to run
back on track , and lewis hamilton leads the way from nico rosberg
the briton is some two tenths quicker than his mercedes team - mate
it is bottas up next , albeit over one second down on hamilton
and here is a gloomy , but ever - positive , jenson button : â i think the positives are , looking at winter testing it was difficult , having issues and running short , and suddenly you put a team at a race weekend and you have to stick to the schedule
it was never going to be competitive here but still there is a good feeling about the car
the basic car is there
it is nice that honda have a bit more experience today
it is going to be a really difficult tomorrow
we have not done a race distance yet
â the second session is underway and the sauber of felipe nasr is the first driver to take to the track
we must mention that his team - mate marcus ericsson was the other non-mclaren driver to be eliminated from q1
kevin magnussen : i do nât think we expected anything else
it is a learning process and we have got to be patient
going forward is the main priority
we need to learn from the race
both mclaren drivers are eliminated from the opening qualifying session of 2015
jenson button improves his time to leapfrog kevin magnussen , but they will start 17th and 18th respectively
they will start on the final row of the grid
kvyat is given one timed lap to stick his red bull into q2 and he posts a 1:30.402 which is good enough for p13 ... but what can the mclarens do ? but carlos sainz pops his toro rosso into p4 and maldonado goes ninth
that leaves kevin magnussen and jenson button in the drop - zone
daniil kvyat , yet to take to the track , with less than five minutes
with manor not running , only three drivers will be eliminated from q1 ; pastor maldonado and carlos sainz are the two drivers set to miss out ... lewis hamilton quickly usurps nico rosberg however , and he tops the timesheets in melbourne
but nico rosberg , still on the medium compound tyres , pops in a 1:28.906 to go fastest
so , with eight minutes to go in q1 , vettel leads from bottas , raikkonen , lewis hamilton , felipe massa , nico rosberg , hulkenberg , verstappen , grosjean and perez
nico rosberg , on the medium compound - remember ferrari are on the softer , quicker compound - goes fourth , a second slower than vettel
sainz has a wee spin in his toro rosso as lewis hamilton crosses the line with a 1:30.277
that leaves him in third behind the two ferraris
back on track and it is raikkonen with a 1:30.188 who goes easily fastest
and his new ferrari team - mate , the four - time world champion sebastian vettel , is even quicker
the german crosses the line some seven tenths faster than raikkonen
lewis hamilton , on the medium compound takes a wee trip across the grass on his out - lap. not the ideal start to qualifying from the briton there
he is reporting ' really big vibrations ' on his current set of tyres
sainz is the first to cross the line and he pops in a 1:33.094
lewis hamilton meanwhile , is out on track in his mercedes
meanwhile , it has been confirmed that manor , who pulled everything out of the bag to make it to melbourne , will not take part in qualifying so they will not race this weekend

the british driver and his team - mate kevin magnussen , who is deputising for the injured fernando alonso , endured a miserable day during practice for the season opener at the albert park
the mclaren pair , hampered by reliability problems to their new honda engine , managed only 13 laps between them in friday âs opening session and were five seconds down on nico rosberg âs best time for mercedes
so , with 10 minutes to go until the start of qualifying , why not catch up on the very latest news from melbourne , starting with lewis hamilton and his hope that he will be remembered as a legend when he retires from formula one
the british team have renewed their iconic relationship with japanese engine supplier honda , the japanese engine supplier which saw mclaren win four straight drivers â and constructors â titles between 1988 and 1991
but they âve struggled in winter testing , and it has nât got any better in melbourne
jenson button and kevin magnussen , standing in for the absent fernando alonso , propped up the timesheets yesterday
and they , along with the red bulls of daniel ricciardo and daniil kvyat , were slowest again this morning
but jenson button remains , retained by mclaren for a sixth season , remains typically optimistic : â this is the package i think will challenge mercedes
i really think that â¦
it is just going to take some time
â lewis hamilton ended both practice sessions behind nico rosberg yesterday , but the briton was back on top this morning
