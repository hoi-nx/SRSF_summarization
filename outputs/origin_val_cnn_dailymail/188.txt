target : dickens was the victim of an attempted attack on his carriage in 1862 dickens is today venerated as one of england 's greatest ever literary heroes - but he was not always treated with such respect
newly rediscovered records reveal that at the height of his fame , the celebrated novelist was targeted by thugs who tried to overturn his carriage on his journey home
dickens also had hay stolen from his home at gad 's hill place near rochester in kent , and complained about rubbish from the local pub being thrown into his garden
his struggles with the neighbours came to light in a series of newspaper cuttings from the british newspaper archive which have been unearthed by bygone kent magazine
the author moved into gad 's hill place in 1856 , using the money he had earned from novels such as oliver twist , a chrismas carol and david copperfield
he used to take the train from london to higham , the nearest station to his home , before getting in a horse - drawn carriage to take him the rest of the way
but in june 1862 , his regular route almost got him in trouble - as reported by local paper the south eastern gazette , which wrote about a ' diabolical attempt to overturn mr dickens ' carriage ' by farm worker stedman
dickens was supposed to arrive at higham at 10.30pm to be met by his groom , james marsh , but he missed the train and the groom returned to gad 's hill place
the newspaper reported : ' a little distance on he found two rollers lying across the road , which , had they not been perceived in time , would have caused serious mischief
' munn , a fellow workman of the prisoner , had accompanied stedman from strood to higham by the 9.30 , and when passing through the village saw mr dickens ' carriage drive down to the station
' the prisoner immediately afterwards went into a field and drew the two rollers across the road to upset the carriage on its return
munn at the time held the gate open for the prisoner
' transport : dickens pictured in a horse - drawn carriage with his wife and daughters home : dickens moved in to gad 's hill place , near rochester in kent , in 1856 after the incident , stedman sought refuge in a pub across the road from dickens ' home , where he played skittle - but was soon caught by the police
he was charged at rochester magistrates ' court with ' placing a horse - roller , and also a hand roller , on the middle of the turnpike road , at a late hour on saturday night , with the intention of upsetting the carriage of mr dickens , which was returning from the higham railway station '
stedman pleaded drunkenness as his excuse , but a month later it emerged that he had done the same thing on a different road in a bid to overturn someone else 's carriage , and he was sentenced to two months ' hard labour
in 1859 , george blackman was jailed for three days after he stole hay from dickens ' home , which was one of the grandest in the area
rubbish dumping was also a concern for dickens , as in 1858 he was forced to write to a local pub landlord who continuously left his property a mess
family : dickens reads to his daughters in the grounds of the home , which he bought at the height of his fame dickens wrote : ' mr dickens begs mr strood to be so good as to give directions that no rubbish or refuse from the falstaff to be thrown into the shrubbery of gad 's hill place
' mr dickens also hopes that mr strood will advise his customers not to trespass on that ground , in going from the falstaff to the village
' he wishes very earnestly to live on good terms with his neighbours of all degrees and he hopes that they know it , and will not fee disinclined to respect his property
' he is sure that mr strood can have no desire not to do what is obliging and right , he therefore addresses this note to mr strood in good will and good humour
' station : the railway station at higham , near gad 's hill place , where dickens would get the train from london trouble : dickens wrote a letter to the landlord of the falstaff pub complaining about litter it was reported on another occasion that dickens was forced to add a padlock to his cellar after locals broke in and stole champagne for a party
the author died at gad 's hill place in 1870 , at the age of 58
the home is now a private school
andrew rootes , editor of bygone kent , said : ' i was brought up in the village of higham , near where dickens lived , and have always been an admirer , so was delighted to alight upon this incident tucked away in the british newspaper archive
' stedman was a fairly hopeless type of criminal , nowhere as impressive as the list of malefactors in dickens 's novels , but worthy of a minor role
