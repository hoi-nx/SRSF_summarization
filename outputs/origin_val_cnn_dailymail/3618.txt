the house approved full fiscal - year funding for the u.s. ' domestic security agency on tuesday , dealing a blow to conservative republicans who wanted congress to hold out for a bill that included language blocking president obama 's recent executive orders on immigration
the house , 257 - 167 , backed a senate - passed funding bill stripped of any immigration provisions , ending a bitter fight that raised new questions about house speaker boehner 's ability to manage fractious conservatives , who accused him of ' capitulation ' after the tuesday vote obama has said he will sign the funding bill for the dhs , which spearheads domestic counterterrorism efforts
spending authority for the department was scheduled to end at midnight on friday

they suffered embarrassing internal divisions that left the country within hours of a partial agency shutdown last week but passed a full fiscal - year funding bill today the agency came within hours of a partial shutdown last week but the house approved a one - week extension of funding that was later approved by voice vote in the senate and signed into law by the president
the drama began in december when the legislative branch passed a measure appropriating money to every single government agency through sept. 30 but dhs , which it only funded through the end of february
republicans hoped that once they took the majority in january they would have the resources to use the spending bill as a cudgel against democrats
yet after weeks of bickering , boehner ultimately found himself last week with few - if any - viable procedural options to keep the agency open while also satisfying conservatives who wanted the funding bill to block obama 's executive actions last year lifting the threat of deportation for millions of undocumented residents
democrats had repeatedly blocked a house - passed bill that included the immigration provisions , while obama and democrats backed a ' clean ' funding bill passed by the senate
' what direction do we have ? ' house majority leader kevin mccarthy told reporters on tuesday
meanwhile , many of the republicans 's rank and file seemed ready for the whole debacle to be over
' it 's time to move forward and stop playing these silly games , ' rep. charlie dent , a moderate pennsylvania republicans , said
' let 's prove to the u.s. people that we 're serious about protecting this homeland and that we have the capacity to govern
' ' sanity is prevailing
i do give boehner credit , ' new york rep. peter king said
rep. mike simpson of idaho said he 's against obama 's immigration directives , but the ' security of the homeland is one of our highest priorities
' several republicans said they would be better served by putting their energy into legal strategies to overturn obama 's immigration actions , which have been put on hold by the courts
' this is where we must focus our actions , ' said republicans rep. mike simpson of idaho
senate democratic leader harry reid applauded the passage of the house bill while opining that ' many weeks were wasted on political games that left us staring a homeland security shutdown square in the face
' ' if this ordeal teaches us one thing , it is that for the sake of our country we must stop governing by crisis , ' he said , calling it an ' unnecessary showdown
' ' common ground should be something we seek , not run away from â especially when the security of our nation is at stake
if we are going to get anything done , we must not be afraid of working together
' taking a victory lap , virginia democrat tim kaine said in a statement that he looked forward to working with his fellow senators reforming the immigration process ' now that dhs funding is no longer being held hostage over the president âs immigration executive action
' dhs chief jeh johnson said early tuesday evening in a statement that congress ' has done a good thing
' the obama administration official thanked members ' who showed the leadership necessary to get the job done ' and gave dhs personnel a ' vote of confidence in the importance of their work
' ' now our men and women can return to the vital work of combatting terrorism , ensuring border security , port security , aviation security , cybersecurity , and our other vital homeland security missions , without the uncertainty of a furlough or a delayed paycheck hanging over their heads , ' he said

' yes , the recent court action gives us some hope that the judicial branch will finally rein in this lawless president , ' alabama rep. martha roby said in a statement
' however , i believe congress had a responsibility to use its appropriations authority to stop this lawlessness and uphold the checks and balances that exist to protect liberty
' ' this is a very , very sad day , ' said republicans representative matt salmon of arizona
' if we 're not going to fight now , when are we going to fight ? ' conservative firebrand steve king of iowa argued that ' this is the signal of capitulation
' ' the mood of this thing is such that to bring it back from the abyss is very difficult
' house judiciary chairman goodlatte said he voted against the bill because ' the stakes are too high to surrender
' ' this fight is not about immigration ; it âs about the constitution and preserving the rule of law , ' he asserted
' if we do nât stop president obama âs executive overreach on immigration , future presidents will continue to expand the power of the executive branch and encroach upon individual liberty
goodlatte , a virginia republicans , said congress must use ' all the tools ' at its ' disposal to stop the president âs egregious abuse of authority
' his committee will consider a bill later this week that would prohibit the federal government from using funds to enact obama 's mandates
' we must do all we can within our constitutional authority to stop president obama âs lawlessness , ' he said
alabama sen. jeff sessions , the greatest detractor of obama 's immigration actions in the upper chamber , vowed on tuesday to keep battling
' when it comes to defending our sovereignty there is no " moving on , " ' he said just before the house vote
' now is not the time for recrimination ; now is the time for renewed determination
' ' those who think this fight is over could not be more mistaken ; it is only beginning , ' he stated

' boehner told republicans house members at a meeting on tuesday that he wished they had more time to battle obama but it was time to allow a vote on the provision - free senate bill
' i am as outraged and frustrated as you at the lawless and unconstitutional actions of this president , ' boehner told his caucus , according to aides who spoke to the associated press
however , he said , ' i believe this decision â considering where we are â is the right one for this team , and the right one for this country
' ' imagine if , god forbid , another terrorist attack hits the u.s.
' rep. luke messer of indiana , who chairs the republican policy committee , offered a similar version of events to reuters
' the speaker made the case that he had hoped to continue to fight for three more weeks
obviously we did n't win that vote last week , so we are where we are
' ' it 's disappointing
i had hoped we 'd be able to continue to fight , ' he said
boehner allowed the use of a procedural motion to bring up the senate 's funding bill , which passed the house with support from both moderate republicans and house democrats
the bill provides nearly $ 40 billion in funding for the agency , created after the sept. 11 , 2001 attacks , that secures u.s. borders , airports , coastal waters and other critical facilities
without the funding , the agency would have been forced to furlough about 30,000 employees , or about 15 percent of the agency 's workforce
about 200,000 others would have stayed on the job without pay , including airport and border security agents .
