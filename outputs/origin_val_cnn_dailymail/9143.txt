a baby who developed a life - threatening heart defect in the womb has had a heart transplant - at just 23 days old
doctors said little dravyn johnson ' could die at any moment ' after being born with just half a heart in orange county , california
the right side of the organ , which is essential to provide blood to the lungs , had not formed and the only hope of survival was a transplant
miracle baby : dravyn johnson spent just two days on the transplant list before a new heart was found for him with the average wait for an infant heart being six months , dravyn johnson 's chances looked slim so his family were amazed to get the call after after just two days on the transplant list
mother , nicole eggleton , who was 22 weeks pregnant when she learned of his condition , said she spent the rest of the pregnancy in fear
' i never bought him clothes
i was just scared , ' she said
but now she challenges anyone to see that there was ever anything wrong with him
if you did n't know , you would n't know anything was wrong , ' doing well : dravyn johnson gets a cuddle from mother nicole eggleton , after undergoing the successful transplant at just 23 days old doctors had initially thought that his heart could be repaired with a series of corrective surgeries in the first few years of his life
at just 23 days old , dravyn johnson is mattel children 's hospital ucla 's youngest heart recipient in 25 years
pediatric heart surgeon , brian reemtsen , said they were worried he would not live long enough for surgery
he said of the heart : ' it had such severe disease that we were afraid that the baby could arrest or die at any moment
' infants usually have to wait an average six months for an organ to become available on the list so dravyn johnson was lucky he only had to wait two days after being listed
a six - day - old premature baby became the youngest infant to receive a heart transplant at a us hospital in january
baby oliver crawford underwent the operation at phoenix children 's hospital in arizona after being born seven weeks ahead of schedule with a heart defect which meant her parents did n't expect him to survive
but when he was born in early february at an orange county hospital , they discovered he had only one coronary artery instead of two and determined that surgery would be too risky
he was airlifted to mattel when he was five days old where doctors confirmed that the only hope for his survival was an urgent heart transplant
incredibly , within two days of being on the list , a donor was found and the operation was able to go ahead
the operation made dravyn johnson the second youngest heart recipient at the hospital , only surpassed by a 16 - day - old tot who received a transplanted heart in 1994
dr. juan alejos , professor of pediatric cardiology and director of the pediatric heart transplant program at mattel children 's hospital ucla , said dravyn johnson 's case was ' special '
' any surgery that potentially could have been done aside from transplant was exceedingly high - risk , so the decision was made that we would list for heart transplantation , ' he said
' all of our heart transplant patients are special , but i think this one was special because we knew there was a risk we might not find a donor in time
' at five weeks old , he was well enough to go home yesterday and join his two older brothers
dravyn johnson is expected to remain on medication and will need follow - up care
doctors expect that his new heart should last up to 20 years before he 'll need another transplant .
