a woman whose fiancÃ© passed away suddenly while at work has won a battle to be refunded the cost of the wedding dress she had ordered to wear during their nuptials
fiona , 44 , from workington in cumbria was left devastated when her factory worker boyfriend kevin elliott , 34 , dropped dead of unknown causes in december
as fiona was too devastated with grief to contact the various wedding companies to start cancelling her plans for the big day , her daughter rhiannon took it upon herself to call the bridal shop where the dress had been ordered
fiona with a picture of her and her deceased fiancÃ© kevin elliott but according to rhiannon , staff at the wedding warehouse in carlisle said they were unable to refund the Â£ 1,200 deposit
rhiannon told the mirror : â they told her they could cancel the dress but the money would be held as a cancellation fee or they could carry on making it in case of a change of circumstances
â we could not believe what she was hearing , what was her fiancÃ© going to do - come back from the dead ? â rhiannon then launched an online petition to get support for the deposit to be refunded , which attracted 6,000 signatures in the first day
after the store started to receive death threats to staff , they contacted the family to say that they would be refunding the deposit in full
rhiannon said : i âm so pleased they agreed to pay the money but the whole family are still upset this was deal with so badly
â bridal stores often have strict cancellation policies as many events can disrupt a wedding ( picture posed by model ) but the bridal store was forced to stump up the cash from their own tills though , as the designer who they had commissioned to make the dress had already started work on the garment and refused to hand back the money
ailsa taylor , managing director of the wedding warehouse , told mailonline : â we are very sorry for her loss but we have to deal with emotional situations all the time and each situation is different
â we have people whose dad passes away or brides who are dying from ovarian cancer
â in my personal situation , i would love to give everyone their money back but i have to have a viable business to look after our existing brides , pay my staff wages at the end of the month and put a roof over my family âs head
