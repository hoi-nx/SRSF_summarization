a report into the death of joe lawton , 17 , who killed himself after being arrested for drink driving , has confirmed ' failings ' at the station where he was held a report into the death of an a-grade student who killed himself days after being arrested for drink driving found ' evidence of a concerning culture ' at the police station where he was held
joe lawton , 17 , shot himself dead at his parent 's Â£ 850,000 home in disley , stockport , two days after being held at cheadle heath police station for drink driving
during an inquest into his death , lawyers for his parents claimed that police had mocked him for his middle class upbringing and his new car , contributing to his death
now an ipcc report into mr joe lawton 's death , made public for the first time , confirms there were ' failings ' at cheadle heath police station where the teen was held
the ipcc probe , which was kept hidden from the teen 's inquest but has been revealed by the manchester evening news , uncovered ' evidence of a concerning culture ' at cheadle heath
following the report one greater manchester police sergeant was moved from custody duty due to â inappropriate behaviour â , while another was given â management advice â , the report says
two custody detention officers were also subjected to sanctions as a result of the investigation , according to a copy of the ipcc report obtained by the manchester evening news
mr joe lawton was stopped by police in hazel grove in august 2012 while driving his new peugeot 207 home from a party , just weeks after passing his test
a breathalyzer showed he was over the drink drive limit and he was arrested
lawyers for mr joe lawton 's parents parents nick and jane ( pictured ) told an inquest their son was bullied for his middle class upbringing
the report , revealed today , found ' evidence of a concerning culture ' among police the teen , who had recently gained one a and four bs in his as - levels and was working on his university application and travel plans , was then held for seven hours overnight
but due to an ' anomaly ' in custody laws meaning 17 - year - olds are treated as adults , mr joe lawton 's parents parents nick and jane were not informed of the arrest after he opted not to tell them
two days later he was found dead at home by his father
next to the body was the police charge sheet , and a note saying he thought he had ' ruined his life '
his parents have since led a successful campaign to have the age limit raised to 18 , after an inquest was told mr joe lawton 's suicide could â very likely â have been avoided if they were informed
the ipcc report , together with a response from greater manchester police , were prepared in time for the inquest but were not submitted as evidence , meaning this is the first time they have been made public
parents nick and jane lawton said the inquest was turned into a â gruelling and frustrating â process by the police 's failure to reveal the reports
in a statement , they hit out at the â behaviour and attitude of the custody officers â , adding : ' we love joe lawton and will continue to miss him every day for the rest of our lives
' mr joe lawton 's parents were not informed that their son had been arrested in august 2012 due to an ' anomaly ' in custody laws
parents nick and jane ( pictured ) have since successfully campaign to have the law changed the ipcc said the force has said it has â learned lessons and had been improving working practice â
assistant chief constable garry shewan , who gave evidence at the inquest , said : ' our thoughts continue to be with the family of joseph , and we sympathise with the issues they have raised following this tragedy
' when joseph died in 2012 there was a confusing anomaly where the police and criminal evidence act led the police to treat 17 - year - olds as adults , whilst the children âs act stated that 17 - year - olds should be treated as children
' following the case and a judicial review in 2013 the government have changed the legislation relating to 17 - year - olds in custody
' the new legislation states that when a 17 - year - old is arrested they are now treated as children for the purposes of informing people about the child âs detention
' while in custody joseph made the decision that he did not want anyone to be informed of his arrest
however , if this happened today we would have informed his parents
