the woman who was once the apple of sterling 's eye until she cost him the los angeles clippers was forced thursday to answer questions about recordings in which she and the billionaire discussed how to hide a house he bought her
several of the 500 recordings stiviano made during a nearly four - year relationship with sterling were played in los angeles superior court in his wife 's lawsuit to reclaim millions of dollars he lavished on the younger woman
sterling foresaw the trouble the gifts posed for stiviano , pointing out in one recording that they were community property - owned jointly by him and his wife of nearly 60 years
stiviano ( above ) is seen leaving court with an apple after testifying on thursday in a recording heard in court on thursday , stiviano and sterling discuss the best way to try and hide the purchase of the $ 1.8m duplex from his wife ( above ) that is the basis for her lawsuit
' you just ca n't give somebody a gift , ' he said in one recording
he then laughed and added , ' well , if they do n't know about it
' ' do you think i can hide the house ? ' stiviano asked
after two days of testimony attempting to show that sterling paid the full $ 1.8million price for the spanish - style duplex , there 's little to hide
the question is whether a judge will make stiviano relinquish the home , three luxury cars , including a ferrari , and millions of dollars in cash , jewelry and clothing that an accountant valued conservatively at $ 3.6million
her lawyer says most of the funds ca n't be connected directly from sterlings to stiviano and that the law does n't allow a spouse to go after a third party
lawyers on both sides said there 's no precedent for such a case
judge richard fruin jr. cast doubt on shelly sterling 's case thursday , saying there 's no clear documentation that funds went from the sterling family 's real estate company to stiviano 's bank accounts
stiviano denied that some of the 18 bank accounts where checks were deposited even belonged to her
when asked if it was mere coincidence that identical amounts left sterling 's company and then showed up in accounts used to purchase the home , stiviano pleaded ignorant and said she had n't signed the checks
' life is full of coincidence , sir , ' she told sterlings attorney o'donnell
the sterlings are demanding back items worth $ 3.6 million that they claim stiviano ( above with sterling ) swindled from them - including cars and a $ 1.8 million duplex on the stand thursday , stiviano called sterling 's wife shelly ( above ) a ' bully ' the trial has provided a backstory of sorts to the saga that played out last year when the recording of sterling telling stiviano not to publicly associate with blacks culminated with his lifetime ban from the nba and the record $ 2billion sale of the team
stiviano said she loved sterling and referred to him as her ' hubby ' and significant other , but said they never were romantic despite sharing a room on trips to dubai , paris and las vegas
shown several photos of her nuzzling the 80 - year - old and asked if she was kissing him , she said : ' i do n't know if you call duck lips or pucker lips kissing
' stiviano , 32 , smiled broadly at times and was sassy at others , getting laughs from the gallery as she corrected o'donnell 's pronunciation of designer louis vuitton
when asked if she hated shelly sterling , she did n't hold back
' she is a bully , ' she said
' that 's exactly what i thought she was - the evil witch of the west
' shelly sterling looked back at friends in the gallery at points in the testimony and smiled
stiviano admitted that sterling had bought her cars , gave her $ 100,000 to invest in stocks and helped her buy her house with at least $ 727,000
but she could n't identify how much of the remaining $ 1 million he contributed
she said some came from friends and relatives who gave her small bills she squirreled away in a bedroom drawer
accountant shapiro testified that he had traced funds from sterlings and found it unbelievable stiviano 's drawer could have made a significant contribution
' it would be an awful big drawer , ' shapiro said
' i find the entire story incredulous
