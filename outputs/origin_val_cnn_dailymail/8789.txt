friends of killer pilot andreas lubitz claim he is being framed for murder as part of an elaborate cover - up by his airline company to hide mechanical faults with the plane
they have set up a facebook page titled ' andreas lubitz a320 , we are against the hunt ' where they have been sharing their theories about the cause of the alps disaster
some suggest the black box voice recorder had been tampered with by germanwings parent company , lufthansa , to make it appear as if andreas lubitz had deliberately crashed the plane
meanwhile , it has emerged that andreas lubitz 's home that he shared with his girlfriend in dusseldorf has been blurred out on google maps in an apparent attempt by family to quell frenetic focus on his life
prosecutors said andreas lubitz then proceeded to set the plane on a collision course with the mountain , killing all 150 people on board
however , commenters allege that the recordings were manufactured in some way by lufthansa to hide mechanical problems with the plane , according to a report by vocativ
hundreds of its followers are understood to be from the pilot 's home of montabaur in germany and its surrounding area
one supporter , who claims to be a former classmate , said : ' i believe in the innocence of andy ! ' they also point out that the second black box data recorder had not yet been recovered from the crash site , which they claim was also proof of a cover - up
others also suggested that one of andreas lubitz 's former girlfriends was paid by the media to say that he had once planned to commit a ' heinous act ' that would go down in history
it has also emerged that andreas lubitz 's home that he shared with his girlfriend in dusseldorf has been blurred out on google maps ( above ) in apparent attempt by his family to quell frenetic focus on his life andreas lubitz is understood to have shared his flat ( right ) with his maths teacher girlfriend kathrin goldbach in a separate development relatives have apparently asked google maps to blur out andreas lubitz 's home in dusseldorf that he shared with girlfriend kathrin goldbach from its google maps service
the move came at some point over the last week since the alps disaster
individuals and governments can ask for google maps images to be blurred over privacy concerns
after concerns from government officials in 2010 , the internet giant offered an opt - out policy to german in order to ' obey local privacy laws
' around 250,000 german are believed to have taken up the offer , according to vocativ
the flat has been the scene of intense focus since the crash and reported claims that miss goldbach , 26 , discovered that she was expecting his baby as little as two weeks ago
the pair , who are said to have had a patchy relationship over the last seven years , were letting the pregnancy news sink in when andreas lubitz crashed the jet , according to german newspaper bild
strict german privacy laws which prevented doctors treating andreas lubitz from telling his airline about his ' suicidal tendencies ' were introduced as a consequence of the nazis
the germanwings pilot had been forced to stop his training because of severe depression and had received psychotherapy for several years before last week 's alps disaster
but german law meant it was left entirely up to him to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer , something he failed to do with devastating consequences after tearing up a sick note for the day of the crash
the findings from the investigation have prompted heated debate in germany on a patient 's right to privacy , with chancellor angela merkel proposing an inquiry to re-examine the law
draconian legislation was initially brought in after world war two to prevent a repeat of government spying during the nazi era and subsequently the stasi secret police in germany
this extends far beyond confidential medical data , however , to stringent protection of someone 's identity , meaning many german publications only referred to andreas lubitz as andreas l , even after his death
further data protection laws traced back to 1907 , which enshrines the ' right to your own picture ' , also mean images can only be published with the individual 's consent
with respect to medical data , the criminal code means doctors are only allowed to breach confidentiality when they have reason to believe that sharing their knowledge could prevent ' a particularly serious crime ' or a threat to someone 's life
they can face a year in prison if they wrongly breach privacy , but up to five years in jail for withholding ' credible information about the planning or commission ' of serious acts like murder
despite the variation in sentences , doctors have tended to favour the individual 's privacy
many in germany are now debating whether the potential to neutralise threats to public safety should trump doctor - patient privilege .
