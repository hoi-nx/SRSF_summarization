a simple wooden bottle that can ' age ' cheap booze in less than a day , could make humble plonk taste like vintage wine , inventors claim
while expensive vintages develop their flavour over years in oak barrels , the makers of the oak bottle promise their gadget will replicate the ageing process in just 24 hours
it means drinks lovers could enjoy the oaky flavours of premium tipples without having to fork out the high prices they demand
the bottle , which costs $ 79.99 ( Â£ 50 ) from oakbottle.com , can also be used to improve the flavours of brandies , bourbons and even tequila
it 's the brainchild of canada entrepreneur paglione , who came up with the idea after growing up on his parent 's vineyard
mr paglione , 30 , who now lives in chicago , spent three years developing the oak bottle , which he says is the world 's smallest and fastest way to infuse drinks with oak
eight other versions which are flavoured with the likes of cherry , vanilla , maple and coffee are also available
he said : ' the oak bottle is a revolutionary device that makes cheap wine or spirits taste like an expensive vintage in just 24 to 48 hours
the oak bottle can also mellow the flavour of whisky , brandy and even tequila ' what took months or years in oak barrels before takes just days now with oak bottle
' my family has a vineyard and winery in canada so i grew up in the wine making industry
' once i was old enough to help , i asked why we spend so much time filling small barrels of wine for oak ageing versus pouring it all into a giant barrel like we do the fermentation tanks
' the answer , my father told me , was the smaller the oak barrel we use the faster the oak infusion and the faster we can achieve the desired oak tannin we are looking for in our wine
' the best wines spend years ageing in oak barrels he then spent three years developing the oak bottle , which he claims is the ' smallest possible oak infusion vessel ever made '
mr paglione explained : ' it 's all about the perfect amount of interaction with oxygen available for the liquid to " breathe " through the wood , and the perfect mount of oak contact of the liquid inside
' he said the most popular wines for oak bottle ageing are chardonnay , cabernet and merlot
' in just 48 hours an unoaked chardonnay will taste like an expensive oaked chardonnay vintage that has been aged in oak barrels for years , ' he claimed
' whiskies , bourbons and brandy are also great for ageing with the oak bottle
he also thinks the bottle is good news for whisky makers as this will speed up the process
he said : ' allowing people who perhaps could not afford a 20 - year aged whiskey or that ten - year old wine vintage the ability to enjoy it but at a fraction of the time and cost
' we are not saying that the oak bottle will make a boxed wine into a Â£ 50 bottle , but it can make an average wine much better and less insulting to your taste buds
' despite just being launched , the oak bottle has already been given the thumbs up by top chefs including american tv personality karmel
miss karmel , the star of us cooking show iron chef , carried out her own independent test of the oak bottle on tequila
she said : ' it is remarkable how this toasted oak bottle made by coopers has transformed the raw blanco tequila
' the proof is in the tasting
it is layered with complexity - round , sweet and predictably oaky
i 'd say that the experiment was a success
