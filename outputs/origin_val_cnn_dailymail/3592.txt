ford is an artist and a pragmatist rolled into one and the england fly - half is quickly discovering that the latter trait is a more consistently valuable asset in international rugby
the 21 - year - old bath playmaker spends most weekends with his club demonstrating the range of his attacking game â as a creative rookie able to unravel defences at close quarters
he has shown that part of his repertoire during this six nations , but is also having to embrace the earthier demands of his role , involving substance over style
england âs defeat by ireland in dublin gave ford a first - hand view of jonny sexton , the home fly - half , following orders to the letter and quelling his own instincts in the process
the lions no 10 led an aerial onslaught which the visitors failed to handle
ford is prepared to sacrifice style over substance in the quest for victories at international level ford and team - mate geoff parling are put through their paces at penyhill park on wednesday asked whether he would feel fulfilled if ordered to kick so often , ford said : â it was obviously ireland âs plan
if they come in with a plan and execute it as well as they did and come out with a 10 - point win , then you would ( feel fulfilled )
you do nât always have to play the same way against different teams
â you go into a game with a plan and if it comes off at the weekend , you feel you âve done your job
â but surely he gains more satisfaction from conjuring tries than kicking for territory ? â people always like to score tries , â he added
â they are more exciting
but they are difficult to get in international rugby
â it âs about small margins , little things ; your kicking being on the money , your set - piece and breakdown being strong
ford offloads a pass during training as england prepare for saturday 's six nations match against scotland stuart lancaster oversees training as his side prepare to face scotland in the six nations on saturday â the fancy things come from the foundations being in place
â the substance versus style issue will be on the agenda again in assessing how england fare on saturday against scotland at twickenham , where they will be expected to win with plenty to spare against opponents who have lost all three games so far
ford knows the result is the bottom line , but is aware the hosts need to perform with a flourish too
â we âre not going into the game to play averagely , â he said
â we âre going into the game looking for a really good performance
that will always be our aim
first and foremost we need the win
it âs vital we get it
but obviously we want to go out there and put in a good performance and have a good reaction
