the trend for fresh , local , unprocessed foods could be putting people at risk if they opt to drink raw milk
this is according to a new study that claims raw milk makes people 100 times more likely to get ill than the pasteurised version
raw milk is associated with more than half of all milk - related food borne illnesses , even though only an estimated 3.5 per cent of the population in the us drink it
raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment
advocates believe it is s healthier , cleaner , and tastes better
but a new study claims raw milk makes people 100 times more likely to get ill raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment
all fresh milk sold in the high street is pasteurised â heated to 72c ( 162f ) for 25 seconds
as well as killing e. coli , the process also eliminates campylobacter , salmonella and listeria
untreated raw milk is thicker with a distinctive creamy taste
but any harmful bugs on the body or udders of the cow that pass into the milk are not killed off
cheese made from raw milk may contain these bugs
advocates of the product argue that pasteurisation removes important nutrients , such as folic acid
they also claim raw milk is associated with reduced levels of asthma , hay fever and food allergies in children
but us tests have shown that the nutrients in raw and pasteurised milk are the same
advocates believe that raw milk , which contains more natural antibodies , proteins , and bacteria than pasteurised milk , is healthier , cleaner , and tastes better
they argue pasteurisation removes important nutrients , such as folic acid
but the new study shows the risks are better understood than the benefits and that more research is needed to prove that the health claims are legitimate
they claim it can put people at risk of microbial contaminants commonly found in milk including infectious salmonella , campylobacter , and listeria species along with the most dangerous form of e. coli
these bacteria can cause foodborne illness in humans , including diarrhea , vomiting , cramping , fevers , and sometimes more serious consequences such as kidney failure or death
' the risks of consuming raw milk instead of pasteurised milk are well - established in the scientific literature and in some cases can have severe or even fatal consequences , ' says cissy li , a graduate student in environmental health sciences at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health
' based on our findings , we discourage the consumption of raw milk , especially among vulnerable populations such as the elderly , people with impaired immune systems , pregnant women , and children
' pasteurisation involves heating milk to destroy microbes in the milk supply from fecal contamination , dairy operations , cow udders , or other sources
treated milk is hermetically sealed to prevent recontamination
untreated raw milk is thicker with a distinctive creamy taste
but any harmful bugs on the body or udders of the cow that pass into the milk are not killed off
cheese made from raw milk may also contain these bugs researchers at the johns hopkins center for a livable future conducted an analysis of 81 published scientific journal articles , ' ultimately , the scientific literature showed that the risk of foodborne illness from raw milk is over 100 times greater than the risk of foodborne illness from pasteurised milk , ' says report lead author benjamin davis , also a graduate student in environmental health sciences
' although potential benefits related to the consumption of raw milk would benefit from further investigation , we believe that , from a public health perspective , it is a far safer choice to discourage the consumption of raw milk
' the study comes as incidents on three farms selling raw milk led to e. coli poisoning in five children aged one to 12 and one adult aged 28
last year , the food standards agency in the uk suspended sales of raw cows â drinking milk and any product made from the milk , including cheese , at all three farms .
