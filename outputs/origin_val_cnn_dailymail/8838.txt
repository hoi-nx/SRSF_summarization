a broken neck would have put paid to most men 's hopes of achieving anything in life , but instead it drove warrick on to becoming australian 's strongest man
warrick , whose sister lauren appeared in i 'm a celebrity get me out of here earlier this month , suffered the traumatic accident playing rugby union when he was only 20 years old
the future had initially looked bright for the young prop who presented australian at under - 19 and under - 21 level in 1998 and 1999
but after playing a year professionally in england for bedford , disaster struck when he returned to australian and broke his neck in pre-season scrum training with the queensland reds
he met the action star at the arnold strongman classic in columbus , ohio , a fortnight ago pulling a large truck is much easier than it seems according to warrick it could not have come at a worse time as the following weekend he was due to train with the australian national front - row training squad in canberra
â it happened at scrum training
it was just one of those things â an unfortunate training accident , â he told daily mail australia
â i was in hospital for about a month and had two surgeries
i was in a neck brace for six months
â the road to recovery was a long one
just being able to drive his car again was a big ask , but it could have been worse
fed up with bodybuilding he began competing in strongman events to better utilise his training warrick competes in the world âs strongest man competition in los angeles last year
in this event he had to pull two trucks - the blue and maroon one behind are tied together - along a strip of road
warrick holds his sister lauren above his head at an event to raise funds for the mcgrath foundation in brisbane
lauren recently appeared in i 'm a celebrity get me out of here â when i first got injured i could not use my right arm at all because i âd lost all my feeling in it
i could nât even eat my dinner ; i had to use my left hand all the time
it was a pretty tough time , â he explained
the physical suffering he endured though was nothing compared to the mental anguish he went through at the time
â it âs not just the loss of a sport that you âve loved all your life , but it âs the loss of a potential income as well , ' warrick told daily mail australia
' professional rugby was thriving , especially in england , and i thought i was set for life
but i could nât have been more wrong
in this event at the world âs strongest man competition in los angeles last year warrick has to throw kegs of different weights over a bar five metres in the air â i do nât think i âve ever got over it
i would nât say i âm bitter but i âm still disappointed
i âm now working flat out and struggling to pay bills , which is the complete opposite to what i would have had if i âd been a professional rugby player
â but i have to remind myself that it could have been much worse and i may not have been able to even walk , so i have to constantly remember that
â contact sport was now out for warrick
he soon put on a huge amount of weight and did nât know what to do with himself until a friend came up with an idea â why not try bodybuilding ? after moving into powerlifting in 2005 he set an australian record in the discipline â i had become depressed and was eating everything in sight
my weight ballooned , â he said
â but my friend got me back in the gym training again and a year later persuaded me to get on stage and compete in the queensland bodybuilding championships
â it was the best thing i could have done and my confidence started coming back
â but after a year of this warrick realised that what he enjoyed was the strength side of training rather than the appearance
the atlas stones is one of strongman 's signature events
here warrick raises one off the floor
the stones range in weight from 140 - 200 kilos
instead of showing people his toned body he wanted to show them how strong he was
he did this by lifting massive weights in the gym to start with , before moving into powerlifting where in 2005 he set an australian record in the discipline
it was a simple transition after that to start competing in strongman competitions
â i always watched them on tv growing up
it was great to watch because they were big and strong , but they were also amazing athletes , â warrick said
the fact that competitors were great athletes as well as being immensely strong was what attracted warrick to taking part in the events warrick first competed in america âs strongest man in 2008 and 2009
the rest as they say is history
last year he won the southern hemisphere âs strongest man title in melbourne and australia âs strongest man crown
he is also the only australian to make the final of the world âs strongest man competition
unfortunately a muscle tear will rule him out of the 36th year of the world âs strongest man competition later this month in maylaysia , but he has nothing to prove at this stage
he has pulled and lifted airplanes , trucks and buses over the years
but it 's apparently easier than it sounds
warrick puts much of his success down to his wife bethany who also acts as his nutritionist and physiotherapist â you ca nât really train for it
you ca nât go up to an airport and asked them to pull one of their planes
but funnily enough it âs not the hardest thing to do , â he told daily mail australia
â it âs more like conditioning work
it âs like doing a high - rep squats session where you just keep your legs moving
it may look spectacular but in reality it is nât
â not that being australia âs strongest man makes him the most famous person in his family
his sister lauren was a member of the australian pop group hi-5 and recently appeared on television in i 'm a celebrity get me out of here
lauren brant ( left ) keeps in shape by working out regularly in her brother 's gym at the gold coast warrick 's daughter indiana was born seven weeks premature in december , but is now healthy and happy feeling the strain : a muscle tear has ruled warrick out of the 36th world âs strongest man competition in maylaysia his well known sister trains at the gym warrick runs in the gold coast
generally she does her workouts with her fiancÃ©e warren
â lauren trains at my gym every day and is into general fitness
she trains there with warren regularly
all my family is into sport in some way or another
we âve got a very athletic background , â he told daily mail australia
the 35 - year - old trains four times a week for three hours each session doing a variety of weights regimes that will depend on the kind of strongman competition he 'll be competing in
generally he weighs in at between 145 - 150 kilos
warrick attributes much of his success to his wife bethany who is a former bodybuilder too
she has travelled with him to strongman competitions across the globe
â she acts as my trainer , my nutritionist , and my physiotherapist
she always makes sure i âm in perfect condition for every event , â he said
warrick 's story proves that with dedication and perseverance you can still achieve your goals the couple had their first baby , a girl called indiana , in december
and it sounds like she also has her father âs fighting spirit
â she was born premature and arrived seven weeks early
she was three weeks in hospital in the intensive care unit , but she âs all healthy now and doing well , â warrick said .
