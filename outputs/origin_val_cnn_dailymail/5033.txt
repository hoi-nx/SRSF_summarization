it is inevitable that myths will swirl around an event as monumental as the richest fight of all time
one by one the more extravagant of those fantasies are being debunked
no , not the enormity of the money
this is a fortune which just keeps on growing and will carry on doing so all the way to the desert night of may 2 â and beyond as the pay - tv returns pour in
this is the latest picture floyd mayweather posted on shots.com as he trains for the manny pacquiao fight and manny pacquiao has also updated his instagram account with this picture from monday las vegas was the only realistic option for the floyd mayweather - manny pacquiao mega-fight the $ 300million fight will be held at the mgm grand garden arena which has hosted floyd mayweather 's last 10 bouts the latest dose of reality comes from promoter arum as he explains why , despite all the speculation to the contrary , floyd mayweather jnr vs manny pacquiao was never going anywhere except las vegas
not to new york , the preceding spiritual home of boxing
not to the philippines , where the national adoration of manny pacquiao could have generated a second thrilla in manilla to follow in the immortal footsteps of muhammad ali and joe frazier
not to the space odyssey of a stadium which is the new home of the dallas cowboy , even though it would have accommodated more than five times the number of spectators lucky and wealthy enough to acquire tickets at the mgm grand garden arena
arum was glibly cited as the proponent of alternative venues
not least because he took his manny pacquiao to the house which dallas cowboy owner jerry jones built in dallas for two fights each of which pulled in 50,000 plus crowds manny pacquiao 's promoter was cited as the proponent of alternative venues including dallas and new york arum hosted two of pacquaio 's fights to the dallas cowboy 's stadium in front of 50,000 fans â not me , â said arum as soon as floyd mayweather put pen to contract and he no longer had to muzzle himself for fear of jeopardising what may well become the half-billion - dollar boxing match
â do nât forget that i live here
â all the workers in the entertainment and gaming industries , every restaurant and bar owner and all their waiters , every hotel executive and their employees , all the cab drivers and every maintenance man ... they âre all my neighbours
am i going to let them down ? am i going to disappoint or upset the folks next door ? â that would have made life very difficult for me
but on top of that , this fight truly belongs in las vegas
â that is not just sentiment
arum is a man who deals in hard economic reality
nfl star tim tebow visits manny pacquiao at training camp at the wild card in los angeles manny pacquiao talks to trainer freddie roach as he continues his training at the wild card he sees the numbers outside the arena â where 16,000 seats priced from $ 1,500 to $ 7,500 will treble boxing âs gate record in nevada to $ 60 million
he see past the pay - per - view tv returns which alone could generate upwards of $ 400 million
he sees this single event completing the recovery of the place where he lives from the economic recession which at one point threatened the future of the gaming as well as the boxing capital of the world
las vegas has still not managed to attract a american major league sports franchise but arum says : â this fight is three super bowls rolled in one
â he knows it is not only jobs in the short term which the richest fight of all time can secure but the medium term future of the entire city
every big name in show business has played the las vegas â from frank sinatra to elton john , from barbra streisand to celine dion
so too the great names in boxing â from muhammad ali to mike tyson , from sugar ray robinson to sugar ray leonard , floyd mayweather poses at home as he takes a break from his rigorous training regime floyd mayweather is training at his las vegas gym as he bids to maintain his unbeaten record but arum says : â what we have here now is the biggest event in the history of las vegas
there will be a hundred thousand or more visitors
some with tickets for the fight
another 30,000 watching on closed circuit screens
others just for the experience and so they can say they were here that night
â hotel rooms are a thousand bucks a night
with all the high rollers you are looking at a casino drop at the tables of hundreds and hundreds of millions
â arum has also scotched the rumour of a re-match clause being secretly inserted into the contract ,
but if floyd mayweather - pacquaio lives up to all the hype , none of those high rollers from all over the world will bet against all concerned grasping the chance to make another half - a - billion
and where might mayweather-pacquiao ii take place ? what happens in las vegas , stays in las vegas
