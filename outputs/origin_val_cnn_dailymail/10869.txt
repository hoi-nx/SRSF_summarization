high social status has its privileges - even in wild animals
researchers studying spotted hyenas in kenya found that high - ranking members of a clan live longer , are healthier and even have more offspring
the discovery was made by analysing the lengths of telomeres - caps at the end of each strand of dna - regarded as important signs of ageing and stress in many species , including humans
researchers studied the status and health of spotted hyenas in kenya ( stock image )
they found high - ranking members of groups live longer and are healthier and these alpha females were also found to have more offspring
the discovery was made by analysing the lengths of telomeres lewin from msu 's zoology department said : ' if you want to see the hierarchy of spotted hyenas , throw down some fresh meat near them
' it 's quickly apparent who 's dominant and who 's not
' but she wanted to know if these long - accepted biological markers would support what she was seeing in the field
ms lewin worked with fellow lead author and msu zoologist kay holekamp to study more than 25 years of data on hyenas across the african country
telomeres are caps at the end of each strand of dna that protect chromosomes from deterioration
these biomarkers are regarded as important signs of ageing and stress in many species , including humans
shrinking telomeres are a signal that cells are sliding into ' defensive mode ' , stressful actions that could soon lead to cells ' - and to the person or animal 's - death
high - ranking hyenas had longer telomeres than their peers
in young humans , telomeres are about 8,000 - 10,000 nucleotides long
they shorten with each cell division , however , and when they reach a critical length the cell stops dividing or dies
this internal ' clock ' makes it difficult to keep most cells growing in a laboratory for more than a few cell doublings
she also spent a summer in kenya observing hyenas ' social structure
the team of researchers focused on telomeres , caps that protect chromosomes from deterioration

high - ranking hyenas had longer telomeres than their peers suggesting they were healthier
group membership significantly predicted telomere length of those female hyenas that sat at the top of the social hierarchy
but ms lewin also noted a couple of interesting twists
the alpha females of each clan had the longest telomeres
however , the length was relative to each individual clan
this meant that if researchers found a lone hyena wandering the savanna they could n't simply identify it as an alpha female based solely on telomere length
also the team was able to rule other factors that could possibly influence telomere length such as abundance of food - which could be linked to better overall health

high - ranking hyenas had longer telomeres than their peers and clan membership predicted telomere length of those that sat at the top of the hierarchy although the alpha females of each clan had the longest telomeres , the length was relative to each individual clan so telomeres could n't be used to identify leaders when on their own
the team was able to rule out factors that could possibly influence telomere length such as abundance of food its research found no correlation between the amount of food and the size of the biological marker
' this work shows , for the first time , the effects of social rank on telomere length in wild mammals , ' ms lewin said
' this enhances our understanding of how social and ecological variables may contribute to age - related declines of hyenas , and in organisms in general
' ' the fact that there is variation in telomere length when prey abundance is constant means that there are other factors we need to find
' we think it 's less about genetics and more influenced by the environment , but we just need to keep searching for the right environmental factors
' the results are published in the journal of biology letters .
