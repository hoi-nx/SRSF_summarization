sarah lord , 30 , lost 10st after a gastric bypass operation in september 2010 , after ballooning to a size 24
she is pictured before ( left ) and after her weight loss ( right ) , now back to a size 12 although she says she feels healthier after losing weight , miss sarah lord has been left with a huge flap of excess skin which has ruined her confidence and left her too insecure to attract men or wear a bikini miss sarah lord had become depressed after a break - up four months into her pregnancy , and gained weight after turning to comfort eating ( left )
after her gastric bypass ( right ) she changed her diet and began exercising the procedure has left her with a pouch of saggy skin around her waist , which she says has ruined her confidence and left her unable to attract men
miss sarah lord , who works as a team leader for the yorkshire ambulance service nhs trust , said : ' i 've gained a lot of positives , but the saggy skin is holding me back from my happy ending
' i 'd like to have someone to share my life with - and no man can fancy me with all this excess skin
i need to get it removed
' i 've asked the nhs for another funded op - now i just need to hear back from my doctor to see if i qualify
' at 16 weeks into her pregnancy , miss sarah lord 's relationship with her daughter 's father broke down
she said : ' the pregnancy was making me feeling anxious enough , and the breakup was very upsetting
i fell into a dip of depression , which i coped with through eating
' by the time bryony was attending her first days at school , miss sarah lord had ballooned six dress sizes and gained ten stone , leaving her at 22 stone and size 24
before breakfast : bacon , egg and sausage sandwich lunch : pie and chips dinner : beef stew with yorkshire pudding snacks : crisps and chocolate after breakfast : cereal lunch : jacket potato and salad dinner : chicken stir fry with vegetables snacks : fruit and yoghurt she said : ' i was in and out of hospital for various reasons
as my weight increased i seemed to be more prone to abscesses under my arms and on my bikini line
' friends thought i was bubbly and outgoing , but inside i was finding things really difficult
' whenever i found myself in an argument with anyone , my size was the first thing they would pick on , and it really hurt when they did
' as people used harsh names , i became more and more reclusive
' her depression reached such a state that she was recommended a course of antidepressants by her gp , but she decided against relying on drugs to improve her mood
eventually , her doctor suggested that a nhs gastric bypass would combat her mounting health problems and attack the route cause of her depression
after an assessment she underwent the procedure at dewsbury and district hospital in september 2010
she said : ' before the bypass i 'd tried to lose weight in the gym , but nothing had ever worked
' the weight loss after the operation was unbelievable
i lost eight stone in a year , and a further two the year after that
' instead of spending my evenings gorging on food i got involved in some intense boot camps at my local gym
there were moments after a heavy session where i could barely walk
' i was exercising five times a week and the pounds were melting away
' miss sarah lord , pictured part way through her weight loss ( left ) , and now that she has lost 10 stone ( right ) says her excess skin has left her less confident than when she was overweight she also completely overhauled her diet , further accelerating her weight loss
before her operation , she typically ate a greasy bacon , egg and sausage sarnie for breakfast , followed by pie and chips for lunch
in the evenings she would tuck into comfort food like beef stew with yorkshire puddings
she snacked on crisps and chocolate throughout the day
after the bypass , she enjoyed cereal for breakfast , followed by jacket potato and salad for lunch
for her evening meal she typically made chicken stir - fry with plenty of vegetables
when she snacks today , she indulges on fruit and yoghurt
while her physical appearance and general health improved , she found her confidence dipping
she said : ' there 's absolutely no question about whether or not i feel healthier , but whether or not i feel more confident , that 's a whole different story
' in the past i was confident enough to meet up with men after meeting them on a night out , but i would n't do it again
i do n't feel comfortable with my loose skin
' now whenever i find myself talking to a man at a bar i always make an excuse to leave early
i tend to just say " i 'm with someone else "
' when i 'm on holiday i 'll always wear a modest swimsuit
i never wear anything tight around my stomach area
' miss sarah lord is happy to be healthier after the gastric bypass , but desperately wants the nhs to remove the excess skin
such a procedure would cost around Â£ 15,000 at a private clinic she is now waiting for a green light from nhs bosses so that she can have an operation to remove the saggy skin from her waistline
the cost of such an operation from a private clinic would be around Â£ 15,000
she said : ' my gp has tried to get me funding for the operation four times but every time it has been denied
' this is my fifth application for the saggy skin removal op so i am really hoping that i am eligible this time
' despite her struggles with low confidence , miss sarah lord said she has gained a lot of positives
she said : ' i feel much more freedom in my movement and my daughter bryony looks up to me
i would n't want her to end up like how i did
' after weight loss , proteins in skin tear and break , resulting in a loss of elasticity and strength losing weight is the answer to many people 's prayers
but they may not realise dramatic weight loss can have a deeply distressing side - effect : excess skin
this hidden downside of losing weight occurs as a result of damage to the deeper layers of skin , the dermis , which contains two proteins : elastin , which helps it retract , and collagen , for strength
when the skin is stretched too much through weight gain , these proteins tear and break , resulting in a loss of elasticity and strength
unfortunately , while losing weight causes the fat cells to lose their fat , the skin can not retract
it is linked unpleasant health problems , from infections to back pain
doctors say the excess skin after weight loss is the same skin damage that occurs during pregnancy â but all over the body
factors that affect how much skin is left include age , how quickly the weight was lost ( gastric bands are slower than bypasses , for example ) , and , for women , the number of children she has had
many patients patients develop an ' apron ' of skin around the abdomen , and loose skin under the arms , chest and inner thighs
this excess skin can cause a range of medical problems
one of the most common is intertrigo - a bacterial , fungal , or viral infection that occurs often due to the difficulty in keeping these folds of excess skin clean and dry
patients also find the folds of skin make it difficult to exercise
excess skin is a problem particularly for people who undergo weight loss surgery .
