host commentator neil ashton : the club need to be supportive off the field , to create an environment so that his family can settle in the north west and enjoy their life in cheshire
his wife wants to leave the country and return to argentina , and di maria is wrestling with that decision : let her leave with the children and leave him to continue his manchester united career , or move to another club more suited to their lifestyle in european

he looked the business with his great ajax team in the nineties and he has an excellent record in european football
the problem is that he has under - estimated some of the demands and the customs of english football , such as the capital one cup defeat at mk dons and the failure to inspire the supporters at old trafford
he claimed manchester united would be stronger in the second half of the season
they actually look disillusioned and directionless
i was surprised that van gaal did not build from the back when he arrived , buying top class defenders ( although i like marcos rojo ) to make sure manchester united would be difficult to beat
everybody with a passing interest in the club knew that they would need defensive reinforcements after nemanja vidic , rio ferdinand and patrice evra left
the task of rescuing manchester united and turning them into a formidable attacking presence again was bigger than he thought , possibly too big
neil ashton : not a lot , but at the pressure moment of the game he delivered
he spotted the back pass , the opportunity to take arsenal into the fa cup semi-final at wembley if he could take advantage inside a stadium where he has only ever known what it is like to play in red
to finish the way he did , clipping the ball around the advancing figure of david de dea , was a moment of composure and genuine class

van gaal was dismissive of him when he decided to sell , claiming that he was not of the standard required for his new manchester united team
he had been fairly anonymous until his goal , but he took it brilliantly
when he was substituted he showed respect for his surroundings by clapping all four corners of the stadium
you know in his heart of hearts he would still like to be a manchester united player , but the decision was taken away from him
neil ashton : history is on arsenal âs side because they have won the trophy five times under arsene wenger
if liverpool reach the final then it will be difficult for them to deviate from the narrative about it being a fitting send off for the captain gerrard before his move to la galaxy
the reality is that it would be a distraction , particularly for a team that has n't won the competition since 2006
having said that , gerrard âs contribution to the 2006 fa cup final against west ham was superhuman
you could not rule out something special
neil ashton : manchester united measure their seasons on silverware , not top four finishes
at the moment they are making up the numbers , trying to work out where they are heading under a manager who appears uncertain of his own values
van gaal is becoming increasingly tetchy and his response on monday evening , sarcastically batting away questions , is a sure sign that he is under pressure
finishing in the top four would be an achievement , nothing more
to win a sixth fa cup under one manager would be impressive , but arsene wenger wants another crack at the premier league title before he calls it quits at the emirates
to do that he will need a better squad , not team , than chelsea and manchester city
as good as arsenal look at times , they do not have the muscular presence and stature of chelsea
neil ashton : a quiet word is needed because english football frowns upon it
i do actually have sympathy in some instances because i âm sure that a lot of players throw themselves to the floor to avoid robust challenges in situations where they think they might get injured or seriously hurt by an opposition player
gareth bale is a case in point , because he had a terrible reputation for diving when he was at spurs
neil ashton : he has added a protective force in the shape of coquelin , an unexpected bonus after he was sent out on loan to charlton
he has made the grade because he has finally listened to the coaches who told him that he could have a career in the position , provided he sacrificed his initial preference to be more extravagant on the ball
the big test is whether he can get the better of nemanja matic in the big games with chelsea
if he ca nât get to grips with him then they will be second best again next season
neil ashton : it was a bizarre decision to substitute two players at half - time because manchester united were in the ascendency after rooney scored the equaliser
after the game arsene wenger even conceded that his players had been demoralised at half - time because they felt they did not deserve to have been pegged back
van gaal should have persisted for a little while longer , but the changes disrupted the team âs rhythm
it felt like a big mistake at the time and an even bigger one when arsenal scored the winner
neil ashton : i am not sure he has a philosophy because he urges caution and does not want to play with risk , and yet he makes two huge gambles at half - time with his substitutions
everybody can bring in players , but has he really identified the players who can turn manchester united in to a team capable of challenging for the top four ? patience is beginning to wear thin
