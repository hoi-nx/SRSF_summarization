double - yellow lines in auchenblae , mearns , are to be painted a pale shade of primrose so as not to detract from its historic charms liberal democrat , liberal democrat member for kincardine , said : ' as a driver , when you see double yellow lines you know what they mean
' if you see primrose or cream lines , well i am sure it 's very tasteful but you do n't have a clue what they mean
' you might think a local resident has been at it with a tin of dulux
' liz mcdonald , 50 , said : ' i think it is a bit mad
if the double yellow lines are primrose , will people just ignore them ? ' residents branded the idea ' mad ' and voiced fears that the new lines would be ignored because people would n't know what they mean this will be the first time double yellow lines have been introduced in the village as residents have objected to them in the past , given its picture - postcard appeal
the scottish village was immortalised in lewis grassic gibbon âs ( pictured ) classic novel sunset song joiner alexander adams , 60 , said : ' if it is a conservation area , there should be no double - yellow lines at all if they want to keep it the way it was

stuart mcfarlane , aberdeenshire council 's roads manager for mearns and mearns , said : ' the colour will be a lighter yellow and less harsh to tie in with the conservation area
' no - one should have any misunderstanding that they are double yellow lines
' the village was granted conservation status last autumn and is said to have important historic interest as an early mill town of the late 18th century
it was immortalised in lewis grassic gibbon âs 1932 novel , sunset song , which was named the ' best scottish book of all time ' at the edinburgh international book festival in 2005
