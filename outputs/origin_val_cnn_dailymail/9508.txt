being made redundant makes people less willing to trust others for up to a decade afterwards , according to a study
losing a job in this way dents trust so badly that even finding new work fails to overcome the problem , the researchers found
it suggests that , even in later life , people can struggle to get over a firing in their life
the study was carried out by the university of manchester
they found being made redundant made people less willing to trust others ( stock image shown )
people still showed the effect years after losing their job
' trauma like redundancy can shift people âs outlook of the world , ' said dr james laurence of the university study author dr james laurence , from the university of manchester , said : â people âs willingness to trust others tends to remain largely stable over their lifetime
â however , this work shows that trauma like redundancy can shift people âs outlook of the world and this change persists long after the experience occurred
â society is still recovering from one of the longest recessions this century and much has been discussed in counting the economic costs of that
â even a single experience of redundancy can lead to depressed trust and what is particularly concerning is that people reported less willingness to trust others even after they got another job
no matter how good your cv , it 's your voice that may actually help you land the job
researchers found recruiters rated candidates as more competent , thoughtful and intelligent when they heard the pitch than when they read it - even when the words used were exactly the same
they also discovered evaluators who listened to trained actors reading job candidates ' written pitches out loud believed those candidates were more intelligent and wanted to hire them more than the evaluators who read candidates ' own written pitches
the new study by university of chicago booth school of business professor nicholas epley and phd candidate juliana schroeder also found the addition of video did not influence evaluations beyond hearing the candidate 's voice
â this has important implications not just for the person involved but for society as a whole as trust can have significant benefits , from health and happiness , to social cohesion , efficient democratic governance and economic development
â the study , which was published in the journal social science research , involved data from almost 7,000 british adults followed as part of the national child development study of adults born in march 1958
responses from 1991 , when the individuals were 33 , were compared with responses from 2008 , when they were 50 , noting whether they had experienced involuntary job loss from redundancy , downsizing or restructuring in the period in between
their responses showed that at age 50 , those who had been made redundant were 4.5 per cent less likely to express trust in others than those who had not been laid off
among those who said at the age of 33 that it was very important to be in work , the figure rose to seven per cent
to find out how long the effect of redundancy continues , the data was split into groups according to the age they were laid off : ages 33 - 41 ( but not 41 - 50 ) ; 41 - 50 ( but not 33 - 41 ) and both 33 - 41 and 41 - 50
their responses showed that at age 50 , those who had been made redundant were 4.5 per cent less likely to express trust in others than those who had not been laid off ( stock image shown )
among those who said at the age of 33 that it was very important to be in work , the figure rose to seven per cent â we observe that experiencing displacement within any age group has a significant negative effect on trust , â said dr james laurence
â importantly , individuals who experienced displacement between the ages of 33 - 41 but not 41 - 50 are therefore also likely to report lower trust at age 50
â this is suggestive that the effect of displacement can persist at least nine years after the event occurred
â he added : â the greater the attachment to employment , the stronger the negative effect of displacement
â a range of mediators , such as physical health , mental well - being , and personal efficacy , do not appear to account for the effect
â that the effect remains present at least nine years after the even occurred demonstrates the severity of displacement experiences
