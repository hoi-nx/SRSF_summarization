some dogs are born with the ability to make impressive catches with their mouths
and some dogs , like fritz the golden retriever from california , are not â as demonstrated by its owner , who collated the canine 's failed attempts to catch different food items in slow motion
standing before the camera the dog initially looks calm , composed and ready to make its owner proud
fritz waits patiently at the start of the video and looks composed before the first item comes his way spotting the piece of meat the dog licks its lips in anticipation and locks its eyes on the prize
the owner tosses the piece of meat , which travels in a straight line and at a good pace towards the dog
but as fritz opens his mouth to make the catch , he leans back just too far and the meat hits him in the face
after licking its lips at the prospect of a piece of meat , the dog mistimes his jump and is clobbered with it leaning back too far the dog is unable to anticipate the flight of a doughnut and it hits him in the neck next up is a doughnut , and while not the healthiest piece of food for a dog , one would think the bigger surface area would surely make the task easier
jumping too eagerly once more fritz mistimes the doughnut 's flight and the food item hits him in the neck
with a new stars and stripes bandana comes new opportunities in the form of a meatball and a taco , but the dog once again makes a mess of the catches and the taco explodes against its face
the dog pulls out of his attempt to catch a taco and it smashes against his face and breaks apart a strawberry appears to by flying directly into the dog 's mouth before it bounces off his nose gaining a crowd , the dog later attempts to catch a strawberry but despite following the flight of the fruit it ricochets off his nose and onto the floor
the final food items include a hot dog , which covers him in ketchup , and a slice of pizza , which collides awkwardly with his ear
the video concludes with a moment of success as the golden retriever manages to catch a single chip with the side of its mouth
the dog follows the flight of the hot dog but is unable to catch it and is instead covered in ketchup success at last ! finally , against all the odds , the dog manages to catch the single chip that comes his way
