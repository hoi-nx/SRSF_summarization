but after he visited two specialists this past week and held several conference calls with a specialist team , it was determined that the fracture , which had shown significant healing previously , was demonstrating signs of regression

' while everyone is disappointed that kevin durant falls into that group , we are encouraged that the bone graft procedure has historically demonstrated long - term health and stability
