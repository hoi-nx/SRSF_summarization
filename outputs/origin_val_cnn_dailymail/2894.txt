when manuel pellegrini was asked on tuesday about manchester city players not believing in their coach , he told the spanish journalist asking the question that the same enquiry could easily have been made of barcelona âs manager enrique just two months earlier
he was spot - on too
back at the start of january barcelona âs head coach sat ghost - like through press conferences â a condemned man after a fall - out with the one man at barcelona you do nât fall - out with â lionel messi
barcelona had just been beaten 1 - 0 by david moyes ' real sociedad , the president josep bartomeu had sacked sporting director andoni zubizarreta and called elections for the end of the season
lionel messi 's ( left ) fall out with manager enrique was the pinnacle of barcelona 's drama behind the scenes before the first game of the season enrique seemed a condemned man but , given his team 's form , he 's a happy man ahead of his side 's champions league second leg clash with manchester city serve and protect : neymar gives a serious salute next to the barcelona logo in this instagram post and javier mascherano had gone on a one - man media mission to convince everyone that all talk of training ground bust - ups and sour air in the barcelona dressing room was the product of reporters â fertile imagination
and off - message french defender jeremy mathieu admitted as such in an interview with french radio saying that lionel messi had indeed had a heated argument with enrique in a training session before the first game of the year
since that defeat by real sociedad , barcelona have devoured all that has been put before them barring one slip against malaga
suarez is still setting up team - mates as he was towards the end of last year but he is now in the kind of scoring form that saw him win the golden boot last season , and lionel messi has gone from being 12 goals behind cristiano ronaldo in the la liga scoring stakes to two goals in front him
real sociedad celebrate their victory over barcelona on january 4 that coincided with the sacking of sporting director andoni zubizarreta and president josep bartomeu calling for elections for the end of the season french defender jeremy mathieu ( left ) admitted lionel messi and enrique had a heated argument during training what happened ? player power is what happened
what most upset squad members at the start of the year is that three of their number â dani alves , lionel messi and neymar â had been given permission to come back slightly later than the rest from the mid-winter break but were then left out of that first game of the new year because , according to enrique , they had not trained sufficiently
the players had had enough of the mixed messages and of the constant changes in starting line - ups
and they made themselves heard
suarez ( left ) and lionel messi ( right ) laugh during training on tuesday ahead of their meeting with manchester city from that moment on enrique âs team changes were drastically reduced
he began to leave out one star - player at a time instead of making wholesale changes and with the emphasis now on the players to deliver because they had won their internal battle with the coach they began performing at a level not seen since tito vilanova was in charge two seasons before
there are still disagreements between coach and players
suarez was unhappy about being taken off two weeks ago and at the weekend neymar responded in the same way when he was taken off at eibar
neither would it be fair to say that enrique is now a puppet being made to dance solely to lionel messi âs tune
one of his strengths as a manager is that he gets the players fit and keeps them fit throughout the season , and barcelona players look strong with 11 games left to play plus the copa del rey final
one of enrique 's strengths is keeping players fit and barcelona 's squad looks strong with 12 games left to play the manager has loosened the reigns since january 's blow up and his team is now difficult to stop his assistant juan carlos unzue should also be credited with the transformation in the way they take and defend corners
barcelona had taken over 100 set plays at the start of the season without making a training ground routine render a single goal on the pitch
but all that has changed of late with â unusual â suspects jordi alba and lionel messi both getting their heads to important corners â alba with an assist and lionel messi scoring his first header from a corner in his barcleona career
enrique has played his part in the revival but it âs also been a change in him that has seen barcelona âs form transformed
it seemed he was trying too hard to put his stamp on the team towards the end of last year ; trying to hard to show his multimillionaire players who was boss
since january he has loosened the reigns â and in response his thoroughbred team have hit the front and will be difficult to stop .
