sergeant evans , 46 , was dismissed by gwent police for ' disgraceful ' sexual behaviour towards women in custody - and against his own colleagues in the police force
evans , an officer with 25 years experience , denied having sex with women suspects and fondling their breasts and was cleared in a subsequent court case
but a police misconduct hearing today heard there were 41 complaints allegations against sgt evans - 32 of a sexual nature - and he was dismissed for gross misconduct
evans was accused of kissing one woman in a police van before later having sex with her in the sluice room at the police station
one woman held in custody told how she was ' flattered ' and boasted to her daughter : ' you 're not going to believe it , but i s * * * * * * a policeman '
a second woman alleged he kissed and fondled her after she was arrested and taken to ystrad mynach police station near caerphilly , south wales
and a third woman said that while she was getting dressed he pulled a blanket off of her so he could see her breasts
he denied all charges and a jury found him not guilty of two counts of misconduct in public office and three counts of sexual assault
but evans , of new inn , near pontypool , south wales , faced an internal misconduct hearing by senior officers at gwent police who upheld 41 against him involving inappropriate sexual behaviour towards female detainees and colleagues
deputy chief constable craig guildford said : ' evans ' attitude and behaviour was disgraceful , he abused his authority when dealing with female colleagues and female detainees
' he failed to treat them with courtesy and respect , and failed to have regard to the equality and diversity duty in the workplace
' his immediate dismissal was the only appropriate course of action
' the police officers , police staff members and members of the public who provided accounts and came to the hearing to give evidence demonstrated admirable courage , dignity and integrity
' during his trial in august last year a mother - of - three told a jury that evans had a ' five minute fumble ' with her after spending a night in cells sleeping off a drinking session
but evans denied the misconduct on duty after being accused of having sex with her up against a sink in a sluice room in the cell block
the woman told the court : ' i just let it happen , i wanted it to happen
it was flattering - you 've got a man in uniform and he fancies you
' i felt a bit cocky - not everyone can say they 've had an affair with a policeman
' the woman was taken to ystrad mynach police station in caerphilly , south wales when she was ' worse for drink '
allegations : one of the complainants woman alleged he kissed and fondled her after she was arrested and taken to ystrad mynach police station near caerphilly , south wales , pictured she was ' extremely ' thirsty the next morning and asked evans for a drink of water , the court heard
he allegedly took her into the sluice room , before shutting the door and having unprotected sex with her
the woman said : ' he put his arms around my waist and started kissing the back of my neck
then he was undoing my jeans and pulling them done and then my underwear and we had sex
' he had an orgasm then he pulled his trousers up and walked back up to the desk
he said nothing to me afterwards , like it was one of those things that had happen but so what ? ' there was no feeling , it was just a quick bunk up and be done with it , there was no love
she said that when she was released home she told her daughter : ' you wo n't believe it but i just shagged a cop
' the woman told the court she first met evans in 2003 when he gave her a lift back home
he allegedly took her into the back of the van before kissing her and touching her breast
she claimed he was aroused and wanted to ' go further ' - allegedly asking her for oral sex
a court heard that did n't report the kiss in 2003 or the sex in 2006
the allegations only emerged when evans was investigated after allegedly sexually assault two other women at the police station
he denied misconduct in a public office and three charges of sexual assault and was cleared in august last year
ipcc commissioner jan williams said : ' sergeant evans displayed wholly inappropriate behaviour towards both vulnerable female detainees while in custody , and to female colleagues , and i am pleased he is no longer able to abuse the position of trust he held
' i give credit to gwent police for their diligent and determined investigation into his behaviour , and for reaching this fitting conclusion where he can no longer be a part of the police service
' the dismissal should send a message to any police officer that the sort of behaviour shown by this sergeant is utterly unacceptable , and bring confidence to colleagues who witness anything like it to report their concerns
