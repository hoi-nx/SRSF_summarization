while scientists have theories about how fish first crawled onto land and breathed air , it 's a mystery as to how vertebrates evolved tongues instead of feeding using suction
but now , a slow - motion video of mudskippers eating shrimp may help reveal the evolutionary secret
it shows the creatures , which live in and out of water and forage for food on the ground , taking a mouthful of water to act like a tongue , allowing them to swallow food on land
it shows the creatures , which live in and out of water and forage for food on the ground ( pictured in a stock image ) taking a mouthful of water to act like a tongue , allowing them to swallow food on land experts believe the finding may shed light on how terrestrial tetrapods - four - legged vertebrates - with tongues evolved from fish between 400 and 250 million years ago
when underwater , mudskippers suck water containing food particles into their mouths , which are swallowed when they reach the back of their throats , new scientist reported
however , this method does nât work on land , so terrestrial vertebrates evolved tongues to move the food to the back of the throat
a team of researchers led by michel at the university of antwerp , belgium , captured slow - motion x-ray footage ( shown ) of atlantic mudskippers eating pieces of brown shrimp out of water the video revealed that mudskippers combine the sucking method of fish ( stock image left ) with the grabbing tongue action of amphibians such as nexts ( right ) , meaning they could reveal a missing evolutionary link mudskippers are members of the gobies family , which is one of the largest fish families comprising more than 2,000 species
they are completely amphibious that can use their pectoral fins to walk on land
they appear to move in a series of ' skips ' and can use their muscular bodied to catapult themselves two feet ( 60cm ) in the air
mudskippers are uniquely adapted to intertidal habitats , meaning that they do n't have to hide in rock pools or retreat when the tide goes out
they feed out of water and even fight to defend their territories
the creatures breathe through their skin and the lining of their mouth and throat , but this only works when mudskippers are wet , limiting them to humid and watery habitats
enlarged gill chambers enable them to retain a bubble of air and they close tightly when the animal is out of water to keep gills moist
a team of researchers led by michel at the university of antwerp , belgium , captured slow - motion x-ray footage of atlantic mudskippers eating pieces of brown shrimp out of water
they found that it takes the gelatinous creatures less than half a second to pounce and eat
by watching the video , which was slowed down 50 times , the experts were able to see that the mudskippers carry water in their mouths
they spit it forward to grab the shrimp and then suck it back into their mouths quickly , to mimic the action of a tongue
the team also placed food on an absorbent surface and found that the mudskippers could still grab the food using their unusual technique , but had problems swallowing it
the scientists worked out that mudskippers move the hyoid bone in the floor of their mouth upwards , before they attempt to gulp down food
their finding is reported in proceedings of the royal society b : biological sciences and is the opposite of what fish do underwater
however , it closely resembles the feeding habits of newts , which have tongues
this means that mudskippers combine the sucking method of fish with the grabbing tongue action of amphibians , so they could reveal a missing evolutionary link
dr michel said : â this could be an in - between , from which a fleshy tongue could have evolved
â this has never been considered a possibility , until now .
