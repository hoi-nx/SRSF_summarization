republican presidential hopeful carson has been forced to apologize for comments made on wednesday in which he said prisoners ' changing their sexuality in jail proves that being gay is a choice
the retired neurosurgeon posted a statement on his facebook page just hours later in which he said he ' realized that my choice of language does not reflect fully my heart on gay issues
' ' i do not pretend to know how every individual came to their sexual orientation
i regret that my words to express that concept were hurtful and divisive
for that i apologize unreservedly to all that were offended , ' he added
' some of our brightest minds have looked at this debate , and up until this point there have been no definitive studies that people are born into a specific sexuality , ' he said
carson 's opinion is at odds with many in the medical community , including the american psychological association , who says ' most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation
' carson had landed himself in hot water on wednesday morning after appearing on cnn 's new day
asked by chris cuomo if being gay was a choice , carson replied : ' absolutely
' ' because a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight - and when they come out , they 're gay
so , did something happen while they were in there ? ask yourself that question , ' carson said
he then spoke out against gay marriage
' why do gay people want to get married ? why do they say they want to get married ? because they want to have various rights - property rights , visitation rights , ' he said
carson 's apology only went so far and he remains adamant that it is n't certain whether people are born either gay or straight ' why ca n't any two human beings , i do n't care what their sexual orientation is , why ca n't they have the legal right to do those things ? that does not require changing the definition of marriage
' carson said he believes marriage should be decided at the state level , this on the same day the alabama supreme court ignored a federal ruling and in a near unanimous vote ordered the state 's probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples
carson has long been outspoken on the subject of gay marriage , which he compared to bestiality and pedophilia in a 2013 speech
in an interview with sean hannity , carson said ; ' my thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman
it 's a well - established , fundamental pillar of society and no group , be they gays , be they nambla , be they people who believe in bestiality
it does n't matter what they are
' he continued by saying ; ' they do n't get to change the definition
it 's not something that is against gays , it 's against anybody who wants to come along and change the fundamental definitions of pillars of society
' the comments came as a shock at the time as up to that point carson has come across as an affable and moderate republican in a series of interviews
the backlash was so strong , especially among young americans , that carson was forced to withdraw from delivering the commencement address at his alma mater johns hopkins
earlier this week carson launched an exploratory committee to run for president , becoming the first high - profile republican candidate to potentially enter the 2016 race .
