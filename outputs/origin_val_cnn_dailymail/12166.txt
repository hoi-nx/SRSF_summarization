a severe solar storm created a stunning display of light in the night sky over parts of the u.s. , europe , australia and new zealand early wednesday morning , spotted by those lucky enough to be awake in the wee hours
called aurora borealis in the northern hemisphere and aurora australis in the southern hemisphere , the lights were the product of large geomagnetic blasts from the sun that arrived tuesday about 10 a.m. et ( 1 a.m. wednesday in sydney )
both the aurora borealis and the aurora australis were sparked by a particularly strong solar storm that sent charged particles toward the earth , said cnn meteorologist borek
" when these particles bombard the earth 's magnetic field in the upper atmosphere , the collision often creates brilliant colors , " borek said
" most of the time , auroras appear green -- when these particles collide with oxygen in the atmosphere -- but there were reports this past aurora australis also appeared to have a reddish tint , which suggested the collision with high - altitude oxygen was also seen on earth
" share your photos of the aurora with ireport the stronger the storm , the farther south it can be seen , said borek
and this geomagnetic storm was rather powerful , reaching as a high as a g4 on a scale from 1 to 5 tuesday night , according to noaa 's space weather prediction center
the storm was expected to last 24 to 36 hours , and noaa 's latest reports say it 's down to a g1
though the storm could affect gps technology and power grids , noaa said tuesday that it had no reports of disruptions
the most visible impact as been this stunning light display
if the auroras are seen again tonight , borek said , they wo n't be as pronounced and most likely wo n't reach as far south as tuesday night
people in northern michigan , northern minnesota and maine may be able to spot them , although he warned that clouds from minnesota to montana may impede visibility wednesday night .
