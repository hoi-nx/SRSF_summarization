sanaa , yemeni a coalition of middle eastern forces continued pounding rebel targets in yemeni from the air on friday , the second day of a campaign aimed at the houthis group
while it was hard to immediately determine the extent of the damage and destruction , the resounding sounds of huge explosions heard around sanaa on friday night suggested that the saudis - led strikes were taking a toll
the strikes ' target is houthis rebels , a shiite muslims minority group that has taken over the capital and , on wednesday , captured key parts of the yemeni port city of aden
aden was where president hadi had moved because of the rebel advance
hadi has since left yemeni , and on friday he 'd arrived in egypt for a summit of arab league representatives
many nations in the arab league are now participating in the armed effort against the houthis and presumably to return hadi to yemeni as its leader
while he 's not in yemeni , the fierce fighting there continues
not surprisingly , the houthis are bearing the brunt of the bloodshed -- and not just in sanaa
that includes at least 10 killed in the northwestern province of saada , home to the houthis 's leader al houthi , houthis commanders said
more than a dozen more people were wounded , as 15 locations saw airstrikes
five houthis died were hurt in an attack by fighters loyal to hadi on a houthis post about 6 miles ( 10 kilometers ) outside al anad airbase , two security officials in lahj province said
that 's where u.s. special operations forces involved in fighting al qaeda had been based as recently as this month
hadi has also ordered the closure of all houthis - controlled media -- including yemen tv and saba tv
the houthis , though , responded by raiding two tv channels and the prominent al masdar newspaper
al jazeera 's office in sanaa was also targeted , with houthis looting security cameras and damaging equipment , the qatar - based network said
the nations stepping into yemeni 's civil war are predominantly sunni , and they are working to rescue a government that has strong sunni support
the houthis are allied with majority iran
saudis , the largest contingent in the intervention dubbed al-hazm storm , considers the houthis to be proxies for the shiite muslims government of iran and fear another shiite muslims - dominated state in the region
" what they do not want is an iranian - run state on their southern border , " cnn military analyst lt. col. rick francona said of the saudis
the kingdom says hadi , who is out of the country , pleaded for military intervention in a letter
" i ask you , based on the principle of self - defense in article 51 of the charter of the united nations , and on the basis of the charter of the arab league and the treaty of joint arab defense , to provide instant support by all necessary means , including military intervention to protect yemeni and its people from continuous houthis aggression , " read the letter , which was posted by saudis 's foreign ministry
united states secretary of state john kerry said thursday that the united states commends the military action and is supporting it through intelligence sharing , targeting assistance and logistical support , a senior state department official said
the other nations participating in the military action are the united arab emirates , kuwait , bahrain , qatar , jordan , morocco , sudan and egypt , a saudis adviser has said
the adviser also included pakistan , saying its military was offering naval support
but on friday , that country 's defense ministry said it had only vowed to defend saudis , according to a local media report
saudis and egypt have spoken about the possibility of sending ground troops
saudis has blockaded the houthis , effectively cutting off their supply lines
by thursday afternoon , the saudis controlled yemeni airspace , the adviser said , and the military threatened to destroy any naval ships trying to enter yemeni ports
supreme leader al houthi spoke live thursday night in yemeni on al-masirah tv , saying , " if any army tries to invade our country , we will prove that yemeni will be a grave for those who invade us
" iran denounced the military intervention
afkham , a spokeswoman for the country 's foreign ministry , said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to yemeni 's months - long internal strife
it also wo n't help a region already facing terrorist threats from groups like isis and al qaeda , she said
" this is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries ' national sovereignty , " afkham said , according to a report in iran 's state - run islamic republic news agency
at least one major player in yemeni besides the houthis -- the gpc , which is the party of longtime leader ali abdullah saleh -- thinks the saudis and their partners should stay out
the gpc says the airstrikes have already led to civilian casualties
the best way to stop the bloodshed is to bring everyone to the negotiating table , the group said
