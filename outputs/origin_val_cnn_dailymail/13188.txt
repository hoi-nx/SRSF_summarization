american missionary sortor , who was kidnapped last month by masked gunmen in central nigeria , has been freed , a american official confirmed friday
officials refused to provide details of her release , but said it involved some form of negotiations
five men abducted sortor , a missionary from seattle with the free methodist church , from her workplace february 23 and demanded a ransom of 60 million naira ( $ 301,500 ) , kogi state police commissioner adeyemi ogunjemilusi said
sortor runs a nongovernmental organization that educates nomadic fulani children , the police commissioner said
kogi state is located away from the areas where boko haram operates , making it likely that the kidnapping is not related to them
but there is the possibility that an offshoot group could have kidnapped sortor , or that she might be sold to another group .
