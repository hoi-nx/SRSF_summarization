a nuclear deal with international powers on iranian 's nuclear program is within reach and achievable , iranian president rouhani told reporters saturday
rouhani said negotiators from both sides have found new common ground in recent days , the official irna reported
the president believes that " clinching a general deal is easy , " according to the irna story , but hammering out agreements on certain details " will be a very tough and complicated job
" iranian has been largely isolated for years for its nuclear program , one that its leaders say the country wants for peaceful purposes
others , like the u.s. , have challenged that assertion and instituted strict sanctions , fearing that tehran actually plans to develop nuclear weapons
after years of basic stalemates , iranian officials and representatives of the p5 +1 have managed to reach short - term agreements as they try to strike a larger deal
the sides have been working toward that end in lausanne , switzerland , hoping to get a framework pact in place ahead of a march 31 deadline
u.s. secretary of state kerry and iranian foreign minister zarif , joined these talks monday
all sides took a break friday , but are expected to return to the negotiating table soon
kerry , addressing reporters saturday in lausanne before leaving for london , said " substantial progress " had been made toward reaching a deal but that " important gaps remain
" he insisted that the international powers involved in the talks , the p5 +1 -- consisting of germany and the five permanent members of the u.n. security council : the u.s. , russian , chinese , france and british -- were united in their determination to ensure that iranian 's nuclear program is purely peaceful
the stakes are high and the issues complicated , kerry said
" let me once again be clear : we do n't want just any deal , " he said
" if we had , we could have announced something a long time ago
" there has been " genuine progress " over the past 16 months since a joint plan was agreed and in his conversations with zarif of the past few days , kerry said
the international powers wo n't rush the process , he said , but the negotiations are at a decisive point
" we recognize that fundamental decisions have to be made now and they do n't get any easier as time goes by , " he said
" it is time to make hard decisions
we want the right deal that would make the world , including the u.s. and our closest partners and allies , safer and more secure , and that is our test
" u.s. president obama has made clear that he wants to achieve a " comprehensive and durable agreement " that is based on intensive verification of its implementation rather than trust , kerry added
" we have not yet reached the finish line but , make no mistake , we have the opportunity to get this right , " he said
while in london , kerry met with his counterparts from the british , germany and france , as well as the european union foreign policy chief , to discuss their coordinated approach
british foreign minister hammond spoke for the group , echoing kerry but saying while " substantial progress has been made in some areas , " there were other areas that lacked agreement
" the time has come now for iranian in particular to make some very tough decisions if we are going to see progress made , " hammond said
kerry also spoke friday by phone with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov and chinese foreign minister wang yi
the iranian president 's guarded optimism saturday -- which also happens to be nowruz , a holiday marking the start of spring and beginning of a new year in the persian calendar -- jibes with the progress cited recently by the iranian ' counterparts in the talks
western officials said friday that the ongoing negotiations have led to compromises on some crucial issues that have long divided the west and iranian
specifically , the parties are coalescing around an idea that iranian could keep 6,000 centrifuges in any deal , down from the 6,500 that had been under discussion , two western diplomats told cnn
the pace of relief from sanctions is a sticking point for iranian , according to a western official
iranian negotiators want them lifted immediately , while u.s. and european negotiators prefer they be phased out over several years , contingent on iranian meeting its end of the bargain
the debate has generated heated disagreements not only in switzerland , but also in washington , where israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu spoke to congress on march 3 at the invitation of republican leaders to warn about any nuclear deal with iranian
the speech was made without the approval of u.s. president obama
the next week , an open letter signed by 47 republican senators , addressing iranian 's leadership , noted that any agreement made with the u.s. administration that is not approved by the senate could be nullified by obama 's successor
late thursday , obama reached out " directly to the people and leaders of iranian , " in a video message recorded ostensibly for nowruz , to urge them to back a deal curtailing tehran 's nuclear program
" this year we have the best opportunity in decades to pursue a different future between our countries , " obama said
" ... together we have to speak up for the future we seek ... i believe our countries should be able to resolve this issue peacefully with diplomacy
" but iranian 's supreme leader ayatollah ayatollah , in his own nowruz address on saturday , noted the political divisions within the u.s. over the nuclear talks , iranian 's state - run press tv reported
he suggested the u.s. president 's nowruz message " included dishonest assertions and his claim of friendship for iranian people was not sincere , " he is quoted as saying
ayatollah also said obama had claimed falsely that some people in iranian did not back a diplomatic resolution to the nuclear issue
what they are in fact resisting is the bullying approach of the u.s. , he said , according to press tv
the ayatollah also insisted that the removal of sanctions should be part of the negotiations , not a step that only followed the implementation of a deal
" iranian will never accept this , " he said
" this is the u.s. ' ploy
removal of sanctions should be part of any agreement
