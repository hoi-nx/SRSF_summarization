great britain may be perennial underachievers in world tennis but when it comes to the sport 's premier team competition wimbledon 's host nation continues to punch over its weight
in the city of his birth an emotional murray carried his side into the last eight of the davis cup knockout by fending off a ferocious challenge from usa giant john isner to secure a 3 - 2 victory
to the deafening acclaim of glasgow 's emirates arena the former sw19 champion survived a tough opening set to win 7 - 6 6 - 3 7 - 6 against the world number 20 to wrap up the tie with his second point
murray celebrates extravagantly after winning the first set on a tie break to leave great britain just two sets from the quarter - finals the british no 1 was spurred on by the glasgow crowd to secure a 3 - 1 win over the usa and book a quarter - final against france murray is forced to stretch to reach a backhand as john isner put in a much better performance on sunday in the davis cup against one of the best servers ever seen in tennis murray 's coolness in the tiebreaks was the key , as was his ability to save seven break points in the opening set
' it was a great win for the team , everyone played their part , ' said murray
' togetherness was a key , everyone was pulling in the same direction
' i managed to find a way through the first set
i was over complicating my service games at first and he was going for broke on the first point of every rally
the huge usa showed aggression in a first set where he forced seven break points on the murray serve , but could n't take any of them murray was well supported by a partisan glasgow crowd as he sought to book great britain 's place in the davis cup quarter finals john isner plays a forehand on the run as the usa 's top player started fast in a game his country needed to win to stay alive in the match murray was not at his best early on , but rallied to take the first set on a tie break after saving three set points gb are through to the elite davis cup quarter finals for the second year in succession and now face a home tie against france â 3 - 0 winners over germany - immediately after wimbledon in july
if on grass it is likely to be held somewhere like eastbourne or nottingham , but if they opted for an indoor court it would likely come back to scotland , as the fans here have been outstanding in this match
' if everyone plays to their abilities we have the chance to win more matches
we do n't have huge margin for error but if wardy ( james ward ) plays like this we have a chance , although france have huge strength in depth
' this match turned out to be remarkably similar to last year 's davis cup first round against the same opponents : james ward upset the usa number one on the first day , before the bryans pulled the doubles point back for the usa and then murray finished it off with his second singles win
great britain captain smith and his staff celebrate as their talisman murray wins a crucial point against the usa john isner john isner looks stunned during a tough first set where he played plenty of good tennis and earned seven break points , but could n't break through john isner looked to have put everything he had into the opener , and looked exhausted after losing the first - set breaker john isner once beat roger federer in an away match against switzerland so is no shrinking violet in the cauldron of davis cup competition and british captain smith â low profile but with an excellent record in this job â knew that he could be a danger
that did not take long to be confirmed and the 6 ' 10 ' usa , revelling in his underdog status unlike on friday against james ward , came out swinging
a more under pressure was a little hesitant and he had to fend off seven break points in total before the tiebreak , once at 1 - 2 , three times at 3 - 4 and three more times at 4 - 5
john isner twice took enormous forehand cuts and shaky second serves and will have been massively frustrated not to have taken the lead
smith whispers some advice and encouragement into his player 's ear between games as murray booked great britain 's place in the last eight murray continued to show his emotion as he began to find his best form in front of a raucous crowd in glasgow murray 's serve had come under pressure in the first set , but as john isner tired the british no 1 became more secure his serve was as potent as ever but , crucially , he double faulted at the start of the tiebreak and after that murray clung on to his lead to clinch it 7 - 4 , a massive psychological blow as he had been outplayed
the nerves of him and another hugely committed crowd were eased by that , especially as john isner needed to play nearly five hours on friday
a brilliant backhand lob at 3 - 2 in the second set secured the key break there , but to give john isner his due he kept fighting to take it to second tiebreak
murray went ahead 6 - 2 and then finally finished it with a swinging serve ace at 6 - 4 to complete his weekend 's work
murray stretches for a forehand as he wore down his opponent before pulling out an array of stunning passing shots in the later sets john isner had played five sets in his defeat to james ward on friday , and the effort caught up with him after a brave first set on sunday john isner is consoled by his usa davis cup captain jim courier as he struggles to cope with murray 's athleticism in glasgow
