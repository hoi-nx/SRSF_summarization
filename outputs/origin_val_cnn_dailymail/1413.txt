it took just one juror to spare the life of convicted murderer travis alexander on thursday - and the woman had to survive an attempt by her colleagues to boot her from the jury before she could do it
in the end , the jury voted 11 - 1 in favor of death - but not enough to send arias to death row in the case that became a global sensation with its tawdry revelations about her sexual relationship with the victim and that she had slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated
the deadlock took the death penalty off the table and left a judge to decide whether to sentence arias to life in prison or to life with the possibility of release after 25 years
that decision is expected at an april 13 hearing
