lowe , pictured , stole the Â£ 60,000 porsche 911 from outside solicitor ackroyd 's home and took it on a 100mph joyride a car thief wrote off a lawyer 's luxury porsche during a 104mph police chase - not realising it was a model so rare it was one of only four in britain
lowe , 24 , stole the 2011 911 carrera gts in broad daylight after spotting the car parked on the driveway of personal injury specialist ackroyd who at the time was on a family ski - ing holiday in austria
just half an hour later , lowe , of ashton-under-lyne , manchester , was spotted by police driving the Â£ 60,000 car - described as mr ackroyd 's ' pride and joy ' on the m60 , and a six - mile high speed chase commenced along the motorway
lowe weaved in and out of traffic at 100mph , forcing cars to move and slow down dangerously , before he attempted to move on to the a666 towards bolton at the same speed
the high - powered vehicle eventually slewed out of control and ended up in bramble bushes on the embankment where it was damaged beyond repair
tragically , it later emerged father of three mr ackroyd , 46 , had been planning to take his 11 year old disabled son edward on a road trip in the porsche around the scottish highlands on return from the skiing trip , as the boy 's disability meant he had not been able to go to austria
at crown court , lowe was jailed for two years after earlier admitting aggravated vehicle taking , burglary , dangerous driving and driving without a licence and insurance
after the case mr ackroyd a founding partner of a law firm in rochdale said : ' i got a call when i was away on holiday from the tracking company
you just feel so helpless
the first thing i wanted to know was whether they had been on the house or just stolen the car
it was devastating to find that they had been in the house as well
' it had taken me a long time to find that car
there were only four on the market and it had taken me nine months to find the right one
i love motoring and cars are my passion
it was the special edition so it was a really special car
i only bought the car in october last year and the kids loved it
' edward is terminally ill with duchenne muscular dystrophy , and he in particular adored the car
in many ways i bought the car because of him
he could n't come on holiday with us in january so the two of us were going to do a grand tour of the scottish highlands in the car
' it is only a car but it meant so much to him
it has been very upsetting
i drive a volvo estate as my everyday car and the tour in scotland would n't be the same in that car
' the court heard the theft occurred at 1pm on january 23 after opportunist lowe spotted the porsche and sneaked around the outside of mr ackroyd 's cottage in oldham to establish it was empty
he smashed through patio doors and helped himself to ipods , a playstation3 and the keys to the car before driving away in it
lowe broke into mr ackroyd 's home , stole electronic goods as well as his ' pride and joy ' porsche 911 mr ackroyd was planning to take his terminally ill son on a driving holiday around scotland in the car the car , pictured , was written - off after lowe lost control at 100mph and crashed into an embankment shortly afterwards mr ackroyd who had a tracking device fitted inside the porsche , got a call from a vehicle tracking company who said his car was on the move
prosecuting , berry said : ' the police having received information about the stolen car saw it on the m60 in prestwich
officers from the tactical aid unit notified other colleagues
' the defendant realised the police had seen him and while still on the motorway accelerated away and drove in and out of traffic
they activated the emergency equipment and a pursuit commenced
he tried to negotiate to the slip road at 100mph , left the road and hit the embankment causing the vehicle to stop
the airbags were deployed and the vehicle was damaged
lowe tried to flee on foot but soon gave himself up to officers and admitted he had stolen the vehicle earlier that day
the tracking device fitted to mr ackroyd 's car later provided evidence that lowe had also sped through a residential 30mph zone in the country town of slaithwaite at 82mph and he hit a top speed of 104mph before the crash
miss berry added : ' the porsche was worth Â£ 60,000
i understand it is particularly rare
there were only four in the country and the impact upon mr ackroyd has been significant
he was on holiday with two children
the third child is disabled and was unable to go
father and son had planned a road trip around the scottish highlands in the vehicle and were unable to do that and his son was very upset
' in a statement , mr ackroyd said his children are now reluctant to stay at his home as they do n't feel safe and he has been forced to increase security
defending lowe , who has 10 previous convictions for 20 offences , sara haq said : ' he expresses that he fully embraces a custodial sentence because he acknowledges at the time of the offences he was not coping with life in the community and custody provides him with the stability he ca n't find in the community
the defendant is glad to be there
' he accepts that he was looking for something to steal that day and came across a house that was clearly unoccupied with an attractive vehicle on the driveway and he took the opportunity
' sentencing judge maurice greene said : ' there were only four in the country of this particular type of car
you were tempted by this vehicle and drove it away
you were seen by the police but decided to try and escape because you were , i suspect , looking for the excitement of driving at speed
' a Â£ 60,000 vehicle was written off which was devastating for mr ackroyd as it was his pride and joy and we also heard about how his children feel about the intrusion to his house
that 's the traumatic effect a house burglary has
it 's not always what is taken but the intrusion to a place people are entitled to feel safe
it is really by luck more than anything else neither you nor other people were killed
' lowe was jailed for two years at crown court , pictured , after admitting the theft after the case detective constable adam frank said : ' it is a miracle that lowe did not kill either himself or someone else
he drove in such a reckless way and at such dangerous speeds that if he had crashed into another car , i have no doubt we could be talking today about a fatality
' he also showed no signs of slowing down or giving himself up until he crashed into an embankment , suffering only the indignity of some scratches from the brambles he tried to run through and the cuff marks when we arrested him
' i am pleased to see lowe behind bars , not least because he is a burglar who could still be out there today targeting people 's homes
i am sure the streets are much safer with this reckless and foolhardy individual behind bars
' but also for the family who have suffered tremendously from lowe 's actions
he invaded the sanctity of their home , stole their property and wrecked a very expensive car
i know from speaking to them just how traumatic this has been for them , to the point where the three children have been so badly shaken up they refuse to now stay in their own home
' that is the type of crippling effect burglars like lowe can have so i am really pleased he has been convicted and is now firmly behind bars where he belongs
