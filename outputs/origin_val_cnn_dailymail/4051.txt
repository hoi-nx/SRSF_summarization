it could mean the end of scrabbling for your credit card - and your hpone
china 's internet tycoon ma , founder of giant online merchant alibaba , gave a glimpse of the future when he demonstrated a new e-payment system using facial recognition at the cebit it fair in german
criss - crossing the stage in the style of a silicon valley pioneer late sunday , ma showed off the technology that uses facial recognition from a smartphone camera selfie as a digital signature
the founder and executive chairman of alibaba , ma , speaks during the official opening of the cebit technology fair in hannover , german on march 15 , 2015 Â© tobias schwarz ( afp ) cards are linked to google wallet , and payments can be made for online purchases and in shops using a phone 's contactless nfc chip google wallet is a free mobile payment and digital wallet that securely stores a user 's credit cards , debit cards , gift cards , loyalty cards and offers
cards are linked to the wallet , and payments can be made for online purchases and in shops using contactless nfc chips
developers can currently use this api to add ' buy with google ' buttons to apps , which android pay would effectively supersede if it works as expected
' i want to take this opportunity to demonstrate a small innovative product that we designed , ' ma said
he used the technology to buy a gift for the mayor of hannover â a souvenir stamp dating back to one of the city 's trade fairs in 1948 â found on alibaba , of course
' using online payments to buy things is always a big headache , ' he said
' you forget your password , you worry about security
' today we 'll show you a new technology , how in the future people will buy things online
' on a smartphone he pressed a ' buy ' button , which triggered a face - recognition routine
ma , a former teacher , is known for thinking big , and at this week 's cebit he was the keynote speaker , addressing an audience that included german chancellor angela merkel
like many other companies from the event 's official partner country china , alibaba -- flush with cash from a massive stock listing -- is looking beyond the borders of its huge domestic market of 1.2 billion people , to the world
ma enthused that , while the industrial revolution freed workers from hard labour , the digital ' revolution ... liberates the strength of the human brain '
' it 's not the technology that can change the world , it 's the dreams behind the technology that change the world , ' the 50 - year - old told the audience , adding that his dream was to help small enterprises sell on a global market
ma has not hidden his global ambitions and has cited as his models global companies such as wal-mart , ibm and microsoft
in january at the world economic forum in davos , he said his target was two billion alibaba users worldwide , compared to 334 million ' active buyers ' in december , and a global version of taobao , the sales site that cemented his dominance in china
some observers think alibaba could one day rival the us online giants ebay and amazon , or just buy them
' many people think that 's a road that they may pursue , since it would be so expensive to build their own brand ( in the us ) , ' said zia daniell wigder , vice-president of forrester research
' simply making a name for yourself in a market where the leaders have been established for a long time is going to be difficult
' it is more likely that alibaba conquers emerging markets with still nascent online trade while prudently strengthening its presence in developed countries
' the head of german it industry group bitkom , dieter kempf , said about alibaba that ' the success is impressive , even if it is in large part because suppliers face a very large , hungry china market '
asked whether it could become a true global player , he said : ' i think we will have to see
someone who can operate successfully in a large domestic market is not necessarily a good exporter ... it really depends on the individual solutions
' the china giant has already launched an online auction site in the us , called 11main , challenged amazon in the field of cloud computing with a service called aliyun , and invested $ 200 million ( 188 million euros ) in snapchat , a photo - sharing application
wang , beijing - based analyst for the consultancy forrester research , said it was an early attempt by alibaba to try to ' understand digital consumers on a worldwide scale , outside of china '
last september , the hangzhou - based group raised a massive $ 25 billion on the new york stock market , although the share price has since fallen below the listing price
founded in 1999 , alibaba has based its success on taobao -- ' look for treasure ' in mandarin -- and tmall , a gigantic virtual mall that has become so dominant that even amazon has opened up shop there
like google , alibaba capitalises on the analysis of user data
it does not charge commission to individuals but derives its profits from advertising options it offers to improve their visibility
the volume of annual trade carried on its platforms , still mostly within china , exceeds that of ebay and amazon combined
alibaba operates its own online payment system alibaba , and has received approval from beijing to open a private bank
it also offers a navigation system , an online tour operator , and a music streaming service , among other things
' alibaba is not only an e-commerce platform , it is the largest digital ecosystem in china , ' said wang
' wherever you are in china , alibaba actually knows your behaviour
' but alibaba still faces other challenges -- it has been accused of not doing enough to eliminate counterfeits sold on its platforms
if alibaba wants to internationalise , said kitty fok , analyst at the consultancy idc , ' the number one concern is that people buy something that 's actually worth their money
