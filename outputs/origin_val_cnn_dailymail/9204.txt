miliband has been challenged on live tv over whether he regrets ' stabbing his brother in the back ' to win the labour leadership
he insisted that although the contest was ' bruising ' he thought he would make a better leader than brother david , and still does
it came as he was grilled by young voters on bbc three , who questioned him about trust , drugs and being weird
the surprise decision by miliband , his less experienced younger brother , to stand against sent shock waves through westminster and plunged their relationship into the deep freeze
miliband proved victorious , narrowly securing the leadership with the support of the trade unions
but his decision to stand against his brother has proved to be one of the most potent aspects of his leadership remembered by voters , almost five years on
taking part in bbc three 's free speech programme , audience member alex hancock asked to applause : ' do you think the labour party would be in a better position if your brother was leader ? ' mr miliband replied : ' look i thought i was the best person for the job when i ran for leader , and i think that now
look , let me try to explain to you why i thought that
' it was obviously really tough for me to be in a contest with my brother , tough for him as well
i thought we needed to move on from labour
because i thought we 'd been a good government but on issues like iraq , inequality we got it wrong and we needed to move on
' i thought i was the best party to move the labour party on
and sure it was bruising and sure it was difficult but i thought that then and i think that now as well
' he was asked if he thought the labour party would be better off if his brother david had won the leadership election taking part in bbc three 's free speech programme , audience member alex hancock ( right ) asked mr miliband : ' so do you regret stabbing him in the back or not ? ' david miliband had been seen as a frontrunner for the labour leadership after gordon brown lost the election in 2010 but was narrowly beaten by younger brother miliband audience member fay asked mr miliband what he would do if he found cannabis in his son 's bedroom miliband would not call the police if he found cannabis in his son 's bedroom
he was challenged by audience member fay over whether he would support the decriminalisation of cannabis
he rejected the idea , insisting : ' we know that there are harmful effects
' i think the signal government sends is important
if the government sends a signal that cannabis use is somehow ok , and we know there âs harder forms of cannabis and softer forms of cannabis , i think it âs sending the wrong signal
' fay responded : ' in a few years â time when your sons are teenagers and you find a bag of cannabis in your bedroom , will you be going to a doctor or will you be going to the police ? ' but the labour leader insisted : ' i âll be going to neither
i âd be discouraging from using it , absolutely i would
challenged on the issue again , mr miliband replied : â i hope i âd stop it happening in the first place
â but miss hancock hit back with the stinging question : ' so do you regret stabbing him in the back or not ? ' while there was laughter from some in the audience , mr miliband appeared stony faced
that 's not the way i 'd describe it , ' he said
' that 's not the way i 'd describe it
look we both stood in this contest and we both offered different things to the labour party
' it was a narrow victory for me , but i won the election , i won the contest
it was tough at the time and it 's obviously healed since then
' but you know i think the thing people are focussed on for the next 55 days is the choice between me and david cameron , not me and david miliband
that 's obviously the contest at this election
' during the programme mr miliband was also tackled about whether his policies add , the lack of women in politics , rent controls and drugs policies
an audience member called john told the labour leader : ' you are often portrayed as a bit strange , a bit weird
' ' i had n't heard that john , ' mr miliband said
' and you look like wallace , ' john added
' i had heard that , ' the labour leader laughed
asked if any of that matters , mr miliband insisted it did not
' if you want this to be a beauty contest or a photo opp contest , then i 'm not going to win it
' ' i think there are other things that matter in a leader
i think ideas matter , to change the country , decency matters , and whtehr you hear the voices of people across the country
' i think you need someone in downing street who stands up for what they believe in
' awkwardly for mr miliband , his comments about being against photo opportunities came after he was pistured posing with his wife justine in his kitchen
it has since emerged that it is the couple 's second kitchen in their smart north london home
mr miliband was cheered when he promised to abolish the bedroom tax , telling the audience : ' it is mean , its unfair , two thirds of the people it hits are disabled people
' he also warned that people were being ' totally ripped off ' in the private rented sector , and promised three - year tenancies , with rents controlled so they ' ca n't just be jacked up by 10 per cent without warning ' , and letting agents will be banned from charging fees to tenants
he admitted the last labour government did not do enough on rented housing
during the programme , mr miliband was grilled by young voters on bbc three , who questioned him about trust , drugs and being weird an audience member called john told the labour leader : ' you are often portrayed as a bit strange , a bit weird
' mr miliband also admitted that a lack of trust in politics remains an issue for all parties
' people know that politicians have broken their promises in the past
it 's not just nick clegg
' my mission and what i 've tried to do is make sure everything i promise is funded , credible and deliverable
' judge me in government
i 've made sure that the promises i make are the promises i 'll keep
' my manifesto will be my contract with you
you will have to judge me on how i keep those promises
' some people in my party say why do n't you make bigger promises , and i say it 's because i want to be the first politician to under - promise and over-deliver , instead of over-promise and under - deliver
