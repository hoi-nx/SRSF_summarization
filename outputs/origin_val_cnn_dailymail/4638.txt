the home boy âs straight lefts over the canadian based romanian âs southpaw leads were especially effective and he was off to a good start
there were no signs of distress from that left leg which had been savagely severed
this time it was kell brook inflicting the pain
one sharp sent dan reeling
the next , an uppercut , put him down
the third sent him to the canvas again
only a mix of gallantry and clinching got dan through more punishment to the bell , which seemed more likely to have condemned him to a continuing world of pain rather than to have saved him
special k stamped his credentials as a serious player in the welterweight division kell brook was looking for the finish but dan managed to weather the storm at the opening of the round â and somehow fought back
the brook attack was relentless and dan reeled around the ring like a drunk , yet still made it to the end of another three minutes of hell
kell brook 's red shorts covered that wound on his left leg but there was no hiding place for his challenger
