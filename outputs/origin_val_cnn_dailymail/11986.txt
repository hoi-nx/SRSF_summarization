' i could n't see anything and she did n't seem to be in pain
ana cardoso , 10 , had been taken to the clinic in brazil after complaining of a tingling sensation in her gums and things ' moving around ' ' but then it started getting worse and no matter how much we brushed her teeth she said she still felt something
' i know my daughter and she is not one to make up stories or lie , so eventually i took her to see a dentist
' there , ana , from the brazil capital , brasilia , was diagnosed with a rare form of oral myiasis
this is a fly lava maggot infection that grows in humans and animals
' i could n't believe it when they said she had a disease and then started pulling the maggots out , ' said ms ana cardoso
' i thought i was going to be sick
' a spokesman for the dental surgery said : ' there were 15 maggots in her mouth so we videoed the removal for our records as it is a rare occurrence
' we also wanted to show the girl 's family what had happened and warn others
' the video shows ana 's reaction as a surgeon in white gloves takes out one maggot at a time with a pair of tweezers
ms ana cardoso said : ' she was actually very calm throughout the whole process but i suspect that was more out of helplessness
' i mean , what else could she do ? ' myiasis comes from the latin word ' myia ' meaning fly and ' iasis ' means disease
the flies ' larvae can feed on the host 's living or dead tissue , liquid body substance , or ingested food
when the tissues in the oral cavity are invaded by parasites , this is known as oral myiasis
those at risk of the rare condition include those from poorer social backgrounds and people who have suffered wounds or other injury to the face
it is also more common in regions with a warmer climate
infestations of the nose and ears are dangerous because of the possibility of penetration into the brain , the fatality rate is 8 per cent in such cases .
