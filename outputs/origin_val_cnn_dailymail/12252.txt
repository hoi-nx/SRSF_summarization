isis militants kidnapped 20 foreigners working at a libya hospital , then released them -- under the condition , if they want to live , that they stay put so they can treat members of the islamist extremist group , a hospital official said
about 30 gunmen tied to the group calling itself the islamic state stormed ibn sina hospital in sirte on monday while a bus was waiting to take the workers to tripoli , libya 's capital
the medical workers were later released and sent back to their homes near the medical facility , a hospital official said tuesday
but they ca n't go far , with isis militants ordering them not to leave sirte , according to the official
one of those kidnapped , a doctor from uzbekistan , was told he is safe as long as he did n't leave , and he treated any militants who were wounded , the hospital official said
" they told him that , for your life , you ( stay ) and work in the city , " the official added
like the doctor , the other medical workers are n't libya
most are from the filipino , with others from ukraine , india and serbia
the kidnappings came days after people of filipino , austrian , czech , ghanaian and bangladeshi descent were taken from libya 's al-ghani oil field , an operation that libya 's internationally recognized government blamed on " isis militias
" the abductions are more evidence of the turmoil libya has experienced since 2011 , the start of an uprising against longtime dictator gadhafi
sirte was gadhafi 's hometown , where he was killed , and where his loyalists held out the longest
in the years since , sirte has become a home to isis
the coastal city , halfway between tripoli and benghazi , is where terrorists kidnapped 21 coptic christians from egypt in separate incidents in december and january
that mass abduction was followed by mass slaughter -- one that , in isis ' distinctive , depraved style , was videotaped and disseminated as propaganda , showing jihadists standing behind their orange - clad , handcuffed victims and then beheading them
" the sea you have hidden sheikh osama bin laden 's body in , " a masked english - speaking jihadi said on the video , " we swear to allah , we will mix it with your blood
" like the egypt , the medical workers kidnapped monday are foreigners , having come to sirte to work
they also have skills that could help isis
the ibn sina hospital official believes the extremist group went after the workers -- who 'd been trying to flee sirte 's precarious security situation -- because they make up the only medical team there and might be needed to treat isis militants
the large - scale kidnapping illustrates how isis has become a disruptive force in africa
the group 's main foothold is in iraq and syria , where it has ruthlessly conquered territory and threatened to take more despite efforts by local governments and a american - led air campaign
isis branched out into libya last year , with cnn reporting in november that fighters loyal to the group had complete control of derna , a city of about 100,000 near the egypt border
militants who 've pledged allegiance to isis also have made their mark in points westward , forming chapters in cities including sirte , benghazi and tripoli , according to noman benotman , a former libya jihadist now involved in counterterrorism as head of the quilliam foundation
besides its actions in derna and sirte , isis ' libya branch claimed responsibility for a january attack on a luxury hotel in tripoli that killed 10 people , one of them american david berry
but isis is n't just active in libya
earlier this month , boko haram -- another islamist extremist group with its own reputation for mass abductions and craven brutality -- pledged allegiance to isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi
this bond gives isis a gateway to africa and specifically to nigeria , africa 's most populous nation and boko haram 's home .
