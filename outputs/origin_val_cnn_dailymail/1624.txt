how france manager didier deschamps must wish he had this group of legends to call upon in his quest for euro 2016 glory
thierry henry , marcel desailly , zinedine zidane and patrick vieira all took to the france turf before france 's defeat to brazil on thursday night to celebrate their position as national centurions
together , they are four of just six players to be capped more than 100 times by les bleus , with didier deschamps another and all - time leader thuram making up the list

zinedine zidane is next up with 108 , then patrick vieira on 107 and finally current boss deschamps on 103
and of the six , four started the 1998 world cup final on the same paris pitch where they became champions , while patrick vieira came off the bench during the 3 - 0 triumph and thierry henry was an unused substitute - although he was france 's top scorer in the tournament with three goals
all six of them also started the final as france beat italy 2 - 1 in extra-time to win euro 2000

it was a frustrating result for didier deschamps , who kept his job despite seeing france crash out at the quarter - final stage to eventual champions germany during last summer 's world cup
and with euro 2016 set to be played on home turf , there will be precious few games for him to prepare for an assault at glory , with friendlies against belgium and albania in june before a trip to wembley to face england in november
