speaking at hampden where he was publicising the scottish league cup final between the two teams at hampden park on sunday - they will meet in the scottish cup replay and the scottish premiership in the immediate two games after that - the scotland skipper said : ' i think it was a great tackle
the referee is five yards away and he had no problem with it
' the linesman was 10 yards away and two of them had great views and you can clearly see on television that i have won the ball
' i was kicked in the head ( by nadir ciftci )
you can blatantly see that
we will see what happens with that
' at the time i did n't know who it was
i felt a boot against my face

dundee united keeper radoslaw cierzniak , who had a fine game , saved the consequent penalty by the hoops striker , who made amends in the 71st minute when he headed in a stefan johansen cross
parkhead manager ronny deila accused aidan connolly of diving to win the penalty , a view with which his captain concurred
' it was a blatant dive , ' said scott brown
in a case of mistaken identity , the referee also sent off dundee united 's paton the referee points to the spot after aidan connolly was brought down in the celtic box ' i was close by
anthony put his leg in but you can see that he has pulled his leg away before the lad has gone down
' he played it really well
i will give him that
' scott brown would not say if aidan connolly should face retrospective punishment but pointed back to celtic midfielder derk boerrigter 's two - match ban for simulation at the start of the season
he said : ' we have had a player who did that at st johnstone and he got a two - match ban so i think it was dealt with rightly
' you do n't want to see people cheating whether it helps you or not
it is not a nice part of the game
' the former hibernian midfielder , however , believes the introduction of video evidence at games would have cleared a lot of the confusion up

' we stopped the game for four or five minutes and it was the wrong decision that paton got sent off
' if we had watched that back we would have clearly seen who it was
' it would n't stop the game every two minutes , ( only with ) big decisions like that
' scott brown insists there is no bad blood between the clubs and sunday 's final on a newly - laid hampden pitch - and the two following meetings - will each start with a clean slate
he said : ' it was both teams wanting to win and i think that is good for the scottish game
' as soon as you step on to the park it is a clean slate
' the pitch at hampden will help us
they are relaying that now so it should be in great shape
