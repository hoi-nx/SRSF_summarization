a smart cooking device that uses ' satellite technology ' for precision - temperature cooking has been unveiled
the Â£ 330 ( $ 499 ) cinder looks like a sandwich toaster but is used to cook a variety foods , including steak
an app tells you when your food is done - and even stores it for up to two hours if you are n't ready to eat just yet
a san francisco - based company has developed the cinder sensing cooker ( shown )
it uses ' satellite technology ' to cook food to precise temperatures the boss of the san francisco - based company , norman , was previously an engineer at lockheed martin - known for its involvement in the space industry
mr norman said they â drew upon rocket science used in spacecraft to create a wholly down - to - earth cooking experience
â for example , the materials and the structural design were selected specifically to optimise heat flow , while the device can cook food to very precise specifications
â like controlling the motion of a satellite , cinder âs predictive control system and sensor placement are carefully tuned to avoid overshoot , â the company said
dimensions : 18 x 12 x 5 inches ( 46 x 30 x 13cm ) weight : 12 lbs ( 5kg ) electric : 1800w at 120v max temperature  ( 550 Â° f ) connectivity : wifi and bluetooth mr norman said the product enables people to â combine the best parts of home cooking - the creative and sensory experience - with the best part of fine dining , which is the perfectly cooked , delicious food
â to cook food , cinder has an enclosed chamber and two non-stick aluminium cooking plates
these are equipped with highly accurate sensors that achieve and maintain the precise temperature to cook a particular food
this can either be calculated by the machine , or selected according to the cook âs preferences
the company said it can â prepare a perfect , medium - rare new york strip steak , cooked evenly edge - to - edge and with a beautiful seared exterior , in 28 minutes
â the user selects what food is cooking via an app. the device then uses two plates to heat it to the right temperature
it can also store cooked food for up to two hours ready to serve the app will send you reminders to let you know when your food is done and the user can also control the cooker remotely using any connected device
it is currently only available for ios to cook food in cinder , the user simply places the food inside and closes the lid
they then select what they are cooking - for example â ny strip , medium rare â - in an accompanying app. it reaches its target temperature â within seconds â and then maintains this until the food also reaches its correct temperature
once cooked , the machine can then keep the food at its serving temperature for two hours
â because the temperature inside cinder is so precise and remains constant , it is impossible to overcook or undercook the steak , â the company claimed
' to monitor the temperature of the food , cinder uses a â patent - pending virtual - thermometer algorithm
â cinder is available now for pre-order , and will begin shipping in early 2016
