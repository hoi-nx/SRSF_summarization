just as chancellor george osborne ratcheted up company car tax for thousands of motorists , german giant bmw unveiled its new ' budget buster ' â its first mainstream plug - in petrol - electric hybrid suv
the ' green ' bmw x5 xdrive40e can be recharged at home , can run on electric power only and switches constantly between petrol and electric power while on the move
it 'll help keep company car tax far lower than for a conventionally fuelled version
the two - litre petrol engine and the 113bhp electric drive together generate 313bhp of pulling power
the new ' green ' bmw x5 xdrive40e ( pictured ) can be charged at home , can run on electric power only and switches constantly between petrol and electric power while on the move it has a top speed of 131 mph , will sprint to 62mph in 6.8 seconds and will be launched at next month 's new york motor show
average fuel consumption of up to 85 mpg and co2 emissions â on which company car tax and road tax are based â are a low 77g/km
bmw says : ' short , everyday journeys in urban areas can easily be completed with zero exhaust emissions , while actual fuel consumption is reduced substantially when driving for distances of up to approximately 15 miles in urban traffic
' driving in this way equates to an equivalent 94.2mpg
' however , the budget measures also mean most company car drivers will be thousands of pounds worse off
there will be a 3 percentage point hike in the tax in 2019 - 20
it means a higherrate taxpayer with a Â£ 28,000 nissan qashqai 1.6 - litre company car will be Â£ 1,008 worse off after just five years with a total annual benefit - in - kind tax bill of Â£ 3,360
city accountant deloitte says the hikes are unfair on company car drivers locked into three or four - year deals who ' in good faith ' chose a frugal model , only to find it re-classified just a couple of years later as ' a gas - guzzler ' , and taxed accordingly
they are the chilling words most likely to strike horror into the heart of any long - suffering person whose car - nut partner has time on their hands : ' i quite fancy doing a car restoration project

' ? cars made here are becoming even more uk as the amount of parts deployed that are made in the uk has risen by a fifth
domestic parts makers sold 19 per cent more components to uk - based manufacturers last year than in 2013 , say new figures from the automotive council
but the ' britishness ' of cars manufactured here is still far less than 40 years ago
the smmt ( smmt ) says around a third of the components in a uk - built car are sourced domestically , compared to more than 90 per cent in the mid-seventies

for the new jeep renegade scores a few considerable firsts , not least being built in italy

jeep , now along with chrysler owned by fiat , says that although built in italy , the renegade had to be instantly recognisable as a jeep
it 'll be sold in 100 markets globally
designers were challenged to come up with a look that would symbolise jeep 's u.s. heritage while appealing to youthful , adventurous buyers
the result is rugged yet chic , and preserves classic styling cues such as the seven - slot grille , round headlamps and straight - line wheel arches
its two petrol engines are the 110hp 1.6 - litre e-torq unit , and a 1.4 - litre multiair ii turbo , which comes with power outputs of 140 and 170hp .
