it was a complete shock

ms jemma was taken to gloucestershire royal hospital where doctors battled in vain to save her the mitral valve separates the upper left heart chamber from the lower left heart chamber , and helps control blood flow through the heart
during each heartbeat the smaller upper chambers of the heart contract to push blood into the larger lower chambers
the mitral valve opens to allow this passage of blood from the left atrium , and closes when the left ventricle is full of blood , to prevent backflow
when the valve closes , its two leaflets ( flaps ) normally seal the valve shut
tendons attached to these flaps keep them taut and prevent them collapsing through to the other side
problems with the mitral valve can make the heart less efficient at pumping blood around the body
severe problems can lead to heart failure - which is where the heart can no longer pump enough blood around the body if the valve is not surgically repaired or replaced
there are three main types of problem : - mitral regurgitation ( also called ' mitral incompetence ' ) â where there is a backflow of blood through the valve , often as a result of a problem called mitral valve prolapse - mitral stenosis â where the valve does n't open as wide as it should , restricting blood flow - mitral valve prolapse - where one or more of the mitral flaps are floppy and do n't close tightly , often leading to backflow of blood these conditions can each occur alone or in combination
