the global chemical weapons watchdog will investigate allegations chlorine gas has been used to carry out fatal attacks in syria villages
it is understood that a probe will take place to examine reports that several chlorine ' barrel bombs ' in the northwestern idlib region of syria have been used in attacks that killed six people and wounded dozens
uzumcu , chief of the opcw ( opcw ) said the organisation would continue a current fact - finding mission into the use of ' toxic chemicals for hostile purposes ' in syria
he added : ' the matter is of serious concern
activists have accused the syria regime of using chlorine - a toxic agent that can be considered a chemical weapon - on civilian areas in the past
' we have been monitoring the recent reports suggesting that toxic chemicals may have been used as weapons in the idlib province in syria , ' uzumcu added
a monitoring group and opposition activists said six people , including three young children , were killed in the alleged regime gas attack in the village of sarmin , in idlib province 10 days ago
amnesty international said the attack was further evidence of ' war crimes
' a report by the chemical weapons watchdog in january concluded ' with a high degree of confidence ' that chlorine gas had been used in attacks on three villages in syria last year
at least 13 people died in the attacks that were carried out from april to august , according to the report
the opcw 's fact - finding mission last year found that the use of chlorine gas is ' systematic ' in the four - year syria civil war , which has killed more than 200,000 people and displaced millions
both sides have denied using chlorine gas in the attacks , which are believed to be dropped onto villages using helicopters
the syria air force is the only party in the conflict known to have helicopters
smoke is seen rising in the opposition - controlled district of jobar , in eastern damascus syria joined the chemical weapons convention in 2013 , agreeing to allow foreign weapons inspectors into the country and averting us - threatened air strikes after sarin attacks in the outskirts of damascus killed hundreds
the government of president assad has since handed over 1,300 tonnes of toxic chemicals and is destroying production and storage facilities
the process of verifying that the chemical weapons programme has been eliminated is continuing
syria did not have to declare its stockpile of chlorine - a toxic agent that can be considered a chemical weapon - as part of a disarmament deal agreed in 2013 because it is widely used for commercial and domestic purposes
the assad regime and the rebels have accused each other of using chemical agents , including chlorine , in the nearly four - year war that has killed more than 210,000 us secretary of state john kerry said he was ' deeply disturbed ' by the reports of renewed use of chlorine gas , last used widely in world war one
the use of industrial chemicals as weapons is banned under the 1997 chemical weapons convention
a group monitoring the syria civil war said on tuesday government forces had carried out the poison gas attack that killed six people in the northwestern town of sarmin , not far from the turkish border
medics posted videos of children suffering what they said was suffocation , which could be caused by a number of toxic agents , including chlorine
the opcw team has a rolling mandate from the united nations to investigate chemical weapon use in syria , but will need to negotiate security arrangements with officials in damascus if it plans on site investigations
the fact - finding mission has issued three reports on the use of chlorine in syria , most recently in december .
