temidayo 's father vincent joseph ( pictured today ) said his son was a ' lovely young man ' â he had a loving and sound extended family , lots of support and was very popular at school , not just with pupils but teachers as well
â why on earth would he intend to kill himself ? â i am not satisfied , so that i am sure , that he intended to kill himself that day and therefore i am not returning a verdict of suicide
she added that although he had discussed the death of robin williams , â there is nothing to show he intended to die â
she concluded it was a â tragic accident of a young boy simply trying to work out how something has been done and it went horribly wrong
â after the verdict , temi âs devastated father vincent , 54 , from waterloo in london , wept as he described his â talented son â
he said : â i did not know about the link to robin williams before we went into the inquest
â temidayo was a lovely young man and a great character
â he did not intend to kill himself - he was a very talented boy and lived for his football - that âs all he wanted to do
â i was so happy when i stood by him to hear him call me father
i have lost a good friend
