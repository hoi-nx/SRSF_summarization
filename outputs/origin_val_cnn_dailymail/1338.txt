prince charles might not be known for his love of ten pin bowling but at least his attempt did n't end up in the gutter
instead , the charles managed to knock over four pins - much to the delight of veterans and a watching duchess of cornwall - although he was n't pleased with the result
charles was at the armed forces retirement home in washington to meet veterans on the morning of his third day in the us
the six - lane bowling alley gives the veterans who live at the home in washington a recreational work out and keeps them active
with the charles for the visit was camilla who looked wonderful in a pale gold coat and who looked on admiringly as charles tried his hand at bowling but gave it a miss herself
chief petty officer patricia kirchner , who manages the alley , told that charles , as he walked over to the lanes , said : ' i 've got a couple of bowling balls picked out , just try one
' with the duchess of cornwall at his side charles , who had turned down the offer of some bowling shoes , confessed ' i have n't done this for a long time '
but he gingerly picked up a bowling ball and sent it down the fifth lane more in hope than expectation
and its off ! charles releases the ball and waits to find out how he 's done not good enough ! charles managed to knock down four pins but did n't seem pleased with the result his execution looked good but the bowl ran wide and clipped three pins that toppled over and he turned to camilla and said : ' at least i got one '
bill bowen , an 80 - year - old retired staff sergeant from the us air force , said : ' he did pretty good , ' adding , ' i told him i was the worst bowler in this alley and he said " no , i am "

along with a visit to the bowling alley , the royal couple were also shown the library , which boasts stunning views of the washington monument , and the wellness facilities for the pensioners who live there

not far away is the cottage itself , which is particularly notable because it was there that abraham lincoln lived for a quarter of his presidency
he also used the cottage during the american civil war and dreamed up the 13th amendment , which outlaws slavery , while living there
