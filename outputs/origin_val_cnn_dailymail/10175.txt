she was reportedly seen by a member of staff but not stopped
the hospital âs latest cqc report said it â required improvement â in a number of areas , including in caring for those with dementia
the watchdog âs report , following an inspection in june 2014 , stated : â the support for patients living with dementia or who may have a learning disability was inconsistent
â it also raised concerns about staff levels , saying there was a â heavy reliance â on agency staff which , in some instances , â affected the delivery and continuity of patient care â
last month , the hospital , in aylesbury , buckinghamshire , was criticised in a scathing report into the actions of jimmy savile
it found that the disgraced bbc disc jockey had been allowed to abuse 68 victims there , including a boy of eight
jimmy savile joined the hospital as a porter in 1968 and effectively lived there for more than 30 years
the report found that ten complaints were made about him , but none was â taken seriously â
those who tried to blow the whistle were rebuked because senior managers thought jimmy savile was an asset to the hospital
mrs violet burton , known as vi ann , was admitted to the hospital on march 7 after she was reportedly found wandering in her home village of aston clinton , which is near the hospital
she was described as a â sweet lady â and was well known in the area , where she was often seen walking her 17 - year - old dog

she was awaiting an assessment by buckinghamshire county council âs social services team when she went missing
a hospital source told the independent : â her death could nât have happened at a worse time
the cqc had issues they were concerned about so they âve come back for a visit and one of the things they âre looking at is patient safety
the hospital still has serious problems
â an independent investigation into the abuse by jimmy savile found he had sexually abused more than 50 people at stoke mandeville , including staff , patients and visitors with the youngest victim aged just eight buckinghamshire healthcare nhs trust , which runs the hospital , said : â our deepest sympathies are with mrs violet burton âs family at this very difficult time
we respect the family âs privacy and it would be inappropriate for us to share information about any care mrs violet burton was receiving
â stoke mandeville is a general , open hospital and , as with other district general hospitals , patients are free to move around the site
we have security measures that are appropriate for each clinical environment and processes in place should an alarm be raised
â police said they were not treating her death as suspicious
