the dogs taking part in the agility events at crufts each year appear to have the time of their lives
and now you can live their moment with them thanks to a pov gopro recording of two dogs taking part in the the flyball
in the video dog owners can be seen attaching cameras to the collars of a pair of excited pooches â a border collie and a springer spaniel
the owners attach gopro cameras to the collars of the dogs before they take part in the flyball barking in excitement , the border collie waits for its owner âs command to go and then springs into action jumping over the four gates and pouncing on the spring - loaded pad at the end
after catching the tennis ball the dog turns and makes its way back â the gopro picking up the frenetic footage of the dog bounding happily towards its owner
next is the turn of the springer spaniel who , if possible , appears to run even quicker
hurdling the gates and collecting the ball , the dog runs back towards its owner and jumps up excitedly
ready , steady , go : the border collie is held in place by its owner and waits for its command to go floppy ears : the excited springer spaniel hurdles the four gates at great speed before collecting the tennis ball in its mouth the two dogs are briefly shown at the end dropping the tennis balls at the feet of their owners and receiving a pet for their hard work
crufts 2015 , which kicked off on march 5 , presents dogs in the gundog , working and pastoral , terrier and hound , and toy and utility categories
the flyball , which is hugely popular with the crowds , features on all four days of the show with the team final being held on friday 7
job well done : the two dogs return to their owners after the race and are greeted with a pet
