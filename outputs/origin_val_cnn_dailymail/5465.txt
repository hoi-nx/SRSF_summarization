this is the moment a tearful chinese mother and her two daughters knelt down to beg forgiveness from the parents of a student who died while saving the two girls ' lives
the youngsters , aged seven and nine , had gone with their mother li xiaoli at the end of last month to visit a man - made lake near the village of xizhaolou in qingfeng county , in central china 's henan province
but as they were playing on the side of the lake , the younger of the girls - named chao - slipped and started to fall towards the water , and when her sister liao went to grab her , she fell in as well
li xiaoli and her two daughters beg the parents of the man who died saving them for forgiveness meng ruipeng drowned after rescuing the two girls pictured , but their mother failed to report it for fear of a compensation claim both girls were wearing winter coats and it was clear they would not survive long as they struggled to get back to the shore
the girl 's mother , who was unable to swim herself , started screaming , alerting a nearby university student named meng ruipeng who ran over to help
without thinking of his own safety , meng ruipeng jumped into the water to rescue the girls , the people 's daily reported
he managed to throw the youngest girl from the steep - sided quarry lake back onto the bank , plucking her from below the surface where she had started to sink , and then pushed the older girl towards the bank where she was grabbed by her mother and pulled to safety
meng ruipeng ( pictured ) , 24 , died dragging two young girls to safety from a man - made lake but the intense cold and exertion had left the 24 - year - old student so weakened that he sank below the surface seconds later and vanished from sight
yet incredibly , instead of raising the alarm , the girls ' mother had been terrified that she would end up in trouble and possibly a compensation claim from the boy 's family , and had told the girls to say nothing
instead , she had taken them home , dried them and changed their clothes , and acted as if nothing had happened
however , she did not realise that the drama had been watched by fishermen on the other side , who had raised the alarm with police
after divers investigated , they recovered the young man 's body , and then started trying to work out if other people were involved in his death
that eventually led them to the girls and their mother li xiaoli , who had initially denied knowing anything about the tragedy but later admitted what she had done
so as the young man was being prepared for the funeral , she and her daughters turned up dressed in black together with all their savings , a total of 10,000rmb ( Â£ 1,000 ) , and offered it to the parents of the dead student to make amends
she said : ' i forced my girls to say nothing , it was my decision , and all the shame is mine
' i offer you my apology and my tribute to your son who saved the lives of my two daughters
' after seeing the two children in tears alongside the mother , the parents of the dead boy accepted the apology
they also told them to keep the money , saying it would not bring back their son but their admission of what he had done at least restored honour to his death
mourners lay wreaths at the funeral of 24 - year - old student meng ruipeng , whose body was found by police mr meng ruipeng 's parents forgave the mother of the two girls and declined her offer of Â£ 1,000 , saying her apology was enough to restore honour to their son 's name
