following a documentary about baby p late last year , he wrote on twitter : â media and politicians â responding to public mood ? â i think not
â conspired to create moral panic and witch hunt
disgraceful treatment of social workers confirmed
â he also described a 2014 panorama documentary , which considered whether parents had lost their children unfairly thanks to secret family courts , as â a shameful piece of journalism â , adding : â such a poor , partial , sensationalist piece of journalism , offering no right of reply for my authority

he also reported a stream of men going into a flat every night and emerging in the early hours
but instead of dealing with his complaints , a senior council official complained about his behaviour and his manager apologised for the â unprofessional way â in which he had acted
sources have claimed that the senior council official who had asked a colleague to complain about the emails was in fact mr andy couldrick

â crime chief : stansfeld has questioned why sex offenders â race was not deemed relevant in the oxford grooming scandal report an elected crime chief has questioned why sex offenders â race was not deemed relevant in the oxford grooming scandal report â despite evidence from victims claiming it had discouraged police from acting
stansfeld , police and crime commissioner for thames valley , said the scr pulled punches compared to a report on the rotherham child sex abuse case
mr stansfeld told the mail : â the theme running through child abuse in many areas has been the pakistani heritage of the majority of perpetrators
as the rotherham report says , council staff did not report issues for fear of appearing racist
â the scr report concluded that there was â no evidence of any agency not acting when they should have done because of racial sensitivities â
but one of the victims quoted in the report said : â the police would nât touch them with a barge pole
they did nât want to confront people because they were scared of being called racist
â mr stansfeld went on to say : â the review details what went wrong in oxford
it does not go into why it happened
â however maggie blyth , chairman of the oxfordshire safeguarding children board , defended the report , saying : â i am confident that there has been no stone unturned
