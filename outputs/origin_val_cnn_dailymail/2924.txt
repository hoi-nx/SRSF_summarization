a plum , which was ' accidentally created ' , has been touted as the next superfood to rival the acai berry
the australian queen garnet contains some of the highest levels of antioxidants ever found in a fruit and has just gone on sale in the uk
according to studies the fruit has five to ten times more anthocyanins than a normal plum
the australian queen garnet has five to ten times more of the antioxidant anthocyanins than a normal plum the superplum was created during a breeding programme for a disease - resistant version of the common plum anthocyanins provide the dark colours of many fruits and vegetables , such as blueberries and red peppers
research suggests that the plant antioxidants , which mop up harmful molecules , can help protect arteries and prevent the dna damage that leads to cancer
the plum was accidentally created during a breeding programme for a disease - resistant version of the common plum in queensland , australian
it is currently undergoing trials in studies with obese rats , and early results relating to the fruit 's potential to aid weight loss have been positive , reports say
rats were fed a diet high in fats and carbohydrates until they were obese
then a few drops of the plum juice was added to the rodent 's drinking water , which the rats consumed during their daily 30 minutes of exercise
the previously obese rats shed most of their excess weight in eight weeks
anthocyanins provide the dark colours of many fruits and vegetables , such as blueberries and red peppers
they have high levels of antioxidants which appeare to reduce inflammation and reduce the effects of arthritis in the body
the compounds in the antioxidants have similar effects as drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen
professor brown , from usq biomedical sciences who led the research told the bbc that the results from the rodent - led research are enough to make a case for the plums health claims
' all the changes that rats experience with obesity - glucose levels , cardiovascular functions , inflammation - all those occur the same way in humans , ' prof brown said , adding : ' the plums taste really nice
' marks & spencer claims it is the first retailer in the uk to stock the new variety of plum
marks & spencer fruit technologist mellonie said : ' this is one of the most exciting new fruits to hit the uk in the last decade
' it is a win - win fruit
not only is it delicious but also incredibly healthy
it was created purely by chance and is an amazing discovery that could offer significant health benefits
' similar levels of anthocyanins in berries usually made them inedible , but the queen garnet is incredibly sweet and a ' delicious addition to the fruit bowl ' with a ' delicious jammy taste - similar to that of a black fig ' , mr mellonie continued but not everyone agrees with the positive claims
the plum can be consumed as a juice ( left ) or stewed and eaten with ice - cream for pudding ( right ) professor noakes , research director for nutrition and health at the australian science agency csiro , said it was n't a clear - cut case
' it 's very good research and very interesting research , ' prof noakes said to the bbc
' but when i last checked , humans and rodents were very different
you can feed rats an entire diet to test a hypothesis but that does n't mean you 'll get the same results in humans
' to make a claim that the consumption of a food will make a difference to people 's weight is a pretty long bow to cast , ' she continued
' unfortunately , this is something that happens a lot when it comes to promoting the health benefits of food
similar claims have been made by research on animals using everyday grape seeds
' mr mellonie said : ' we 're constantly working with our growers around the world to develop new fruits and vegetables for our customers to try
' when our supplier came to us with the queen garnet we knew we had to get it on our shelves for consumers in the uk to enjoy
' the plums are currently being grown for marks & spencer in australian , although the retailer said it hoped to grow them closer to the uk in future
they have gone on sale for Â£ 3 for 400g , or two packs for Â£ 4
moringa best for : liver protection and blood sugar regulation most popular in powder form , this superfood is made from the leaf of the moringa â miracle ' tree , native to africa and asia and one of the most nutrient - dense plants on the planet
it has been claimed that it boosts immunity , lowers blood pressure , alleviates stress , fights fatigue , improves digestive health and increases libido
and that 's just on the inside
it 's also a tonic for hair , nails and skin
so what makes moringa so miraculous ? it contains almost 25 per cent protein , including all nine of the essential amino acids , which are important for the body 's key functions and help maintain healthy skin cells
it is also packed with essential vitamins and minerals , including skin - supporting vitamins such as zinc , which includes strong , supple healthy skin , nails and hair among its beauty benefits
holistic nutritionist nikki advises : ' moringa has six times the antioxidant content of the popular superfood , goji berries
it contains over 90 nutrients , 46 antioxidants and abundant minerals
' gram for gram , moringa contains more vitamin b12 than steak , more vitamin a than eggs , and more calcium than milk
' its antioxidants detox and protect the liver , boost immunity and support healthy blood sugar levels
' chlorella best for : liver detoxification and healthy protein delivery we âve all seen supermodels sipping on green juices containing chlorella this year but as nikki stresses , there âs more to this trend than just a fad , especially when it comes to the morning after
the one to look out for , she says , is sun chlorella a , a green algae and superfood detoxifier , popular in japan
in 1996 , research from sapporo medical university , japan , suggested that chlorella , a freshwater green algae , can lessen hangover symptoms by up to 96 per cent if taken before drinking
the idea is that the antioxidant - packed algae neutralises the free radicals ( chemicals that damage cells ) in alcohol
chlorella - which also contains iron , folic acid and energy - boosting b vitamins - is also lauded for its gut - soothing properties , as it dissolves and expands to coat the stomach when eaten
mushrooms best for : adrenal recovery and digestion these are nât the kind of fungi you âll find in the veg section of the supermarket
these medicinal mushrooms have powerful antioxidant properties that can help bring you back on track following a heavy night
one such example is chaga , a hard black fungus which has been central to folk medicine in northern climates for centuries and is dubbed the mushroom of immortality in siberia
nikki said : ' chaga is a nutrient - rich medicinal mushroom , it grows on the birch tree and so harnesses the amazing nutrient properties of this tree
' chaga contains numerous b vitamins , flavonoids , minerals and enzymes
' it is also one of the world âs densest sources of pantothenic acid , an essential nutrient needed by the adrenal glands as well as digestive organs
