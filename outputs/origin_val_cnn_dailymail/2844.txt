o'neill says this summer âs friendly match with england is simply a means to an end for republic of ireland
roy hodgson takes the three lions to dublin on june 7 , six days before the irish face scotland in their decisive euro 2016 qualifier
o'neill , though , has played down the significance of england âs visit and prefers to focus his attention on the match with the scots
o'neill says that ireland 's game against scotland is much more important than the england clash â england is ( a means to an end ) for me , â he said
â i agree it âs a big match , but it âs not for me
the scotland game is the be all and end all
â i do nât think we should overlook the fact that , for me , it âs a build up to the scotland game
it will be intense and that might be a good thing
â but at the end of the day , if you want us to win a load of friendly games i âll play the 700th rated team in europe every single week and build it up
â roy hodgson 's side travel to ireland on june 7 for a friendly match at the aviva stadium in dublin o'neill and his team can not afford anything other than victory against scotland at the aviva stadium
they salvaged a 1 - 1 draw at home to poland on sunday night thanks to shane long â s injury - time strike
failure to win , however , has left them three points adrift of the table - topping poles with germany and scotland also two points better off
gordon strachan and his scotland side are just above ireland and the clash has been labelled as ' must win ' the team have been praised for refusing to accept defeat against poland , but also criticised for again having to rely on a last - minute rescue act
o'neill said : â i âd rather get the first goal in the game and take it
we âve been chasing some of the matches
â but overall i think the draw sets it up for scotland
it âs probably a must - win game for us
â we âre still in the competition
it would have been a real blow to lose on sunday
â but i thought we had spirit in abundance
we really can not wait now for june
