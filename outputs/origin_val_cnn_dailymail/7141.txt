thomas ' face will need to be reconstructed after the two hour surgery as the ' super-vet ' in surrey may have to take out part of his cheek bone
administrative assistant elaine clarke , 50 , from warrington , cheshire , sacrificed her 50th birthday celebrations to lead the campaign to save the cat on behalf of a friend , thomas ' owner
she said : ' we have been told by the vets to bulk him up and bring him back
' we need to feed him up every three hours , get him exercising and get him some muscles
thomas will need to be bulked up like a mini arnie for him to survive the surgery
' elaine clarke first became aware of thomas when his owner posted some pictures of him on a facebook site asking for advice
she said : ' she posted a picture of him after a cupboard had fallen on him and a few weeks later a video of him trying to eat and you could see he was struggling to eat the meat and could only drink the milk
so everyone commented ' go to the vets , ' which she did do
' funding : thomas ' owners are desperately trying to raise money to fund the crucial treatment happier times : thomas , before his head was partially crushed by a falling cabinet thomas was then taken for an x-ray and it was thought he had a broken jaw which only allowed him to open his jaw 2mm and elaine clarke offered to take the cat in
' after various treatments of steroids and antibiotics there was no improvement in his condition , ' she said
' the vet then suggested taking biopsy 's from the top of his head and either side of his jaw
the results came back and the left side of the jaw and top of the head were clear , regrettably there is tissue and muscle damage to the right side of the jaw
' thomas then had a nasal feeding tube placed to allow him to eat but having pulled it out , a vet refused to replace it fearing it was unethical and that he should be put to sleep
elaine clarke and thomas ' owner were referred to a veterinary specialists in surrey
elaine clarke , an administrative assistant , said : ' after a consultation they told me his jaw was fused but right were the joint is
the jaw had fused right where it meets the skull
they said , ' we want you to bring him back a miniature arnie , really feed him up and we will weight him in a few weeks to see if we can operate
' when elaine clarke first took thomas in he weighed just 1.1kg but has since put on half a kilo
she said : ' he is tiny
he is about 5 - months - old but the size of a 12 - week - old kitten
we have to body build him up with loads of food which being fed through a stomach tube
we need to exercise him too
' ' i have to get up at 6.30am every morning and feed him every half an hour
my mission is to get him strong enough for surgery
' recovery : thomas , left and right with a friend , has been lucky to survive but needs surgery to improve his chances of survival ' i missed my 50th and everything because i had to feed him
i was also supposed to go on holiday to celebrate it but we needed to be here for thomas
. it 's worth it though
i was a lost cause and doctors told me i was in a worse state that they had seen for a long time
but i made it though and thomas is the same

' ' he is so adorable
i will be sad when he has to go back
