rice claims he felt close to suicide during the mass outrage over footage that showed him punching his then - fiancee unconscious
it is just over a year since the former ravens player was captured on surveillance cameras attacking janay in the elevator of a casino in atlantic city , new jersey
reflecting on the past year , which saw him dropped from the league , rice told the baltimore sun he felt like ' it was n't worth living '
' the big picture of it all , being the person that i am , i really felt horrible , ' rice told the newspaper in an interview
i know i 'm never going to win the battle of public opinion
honestly , i almost felt like at one point that it was n't worth living
i see why people commit suicide
' it hurt that bad
i was low , real low
it hurt that bad because you worked your whole life to do all the right things and then you 're the world 's most hated person
' it was really tough
my daughter , oh lord , i grew up without a father , there 's no way i could check out on my own family
' it comes after he issued an apology to ravens fans , who turned up in their droves last year to exchange their rice jerseys for new ones with other players ' names
rice was booted from the ravens after footage was leaked showing him knocking out his now - wife in a casino elevator the nfl lifted the ban on rice in november and allowed him to become a free agent but he remains untouched by any team in a statement on facebook , he wrote : ' to all the kids who looked up to me , i 'm truly sorry for letting you down , but i hope it 's helped you learn that one bad decision can turn your dream into a nightmare
' there is no excuse for domestic violence , and i apologize for the horrible mistake i made
' the running back , who helped the ravens win the super bowl in 2012 , is currently a free agent , after his indefinite ban from the league was overturned upon appeal in november
ravens owner bisciotti has said rice will never play for the team again
but rice said he valued the time he spent with bisciotti , general manager ozzie newsome and head coach john harbaugh
rice told his fans that ' one bad decision can turn your dream into a nightmare ' ' i love you all very much , and i 'll always be proud to say i played for the ravens , ' he said
the nfl 's inept handling of rice 's case plunged the league into crisis
he was originally suspended just two games , after a hotel video showed him pulling an unconscious janay from an elevator in an atlantic city casino
the punishment was widely denounced as too lenient , and when another video that showed the actual punch surfaced , the ravens sacked him and nfl commissioner roger goodell banned him indefinitely
the nfl players association successfully appealed on the grounds that the league violated labor laws by increasing rice 's punishment after the second video surfaced because it gave no real new information on the case .
