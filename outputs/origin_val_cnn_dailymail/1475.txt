in the footage , the man warms up the crowd by playing air guitar and posturing before attempting to swing around the pole at the centre of the stage
but the man 's hand passes several inches from the pole and he flies past it and - to screams from the crowd - falls straight off the stage and on to the line of judges
luckily , a judge manages to move out of the way as the man falls and the performer hits the ground with a thud , but is said to be fine
