tsa agents allowed a convicted felon and former member of a domestic terrorist group to pass through an expedited security line , homeland security 's internal watchdog has revealed
the passenger , whose identity has not been released , has served years in prison for murder and offenses involving explosives , the homeland security 's inspector general 's office said as it revealed the ' significant aviation security breach ' in a statement on thursday night
the watchdog was asked to investigate the june 2014 incident last october after a whistleblower came forward
it did not release specific details of the passenger 's criminal history or where the incident took place
the passenger , who is a u.s. citizen , had not registered for the tsa 's precheck program , but if they had , they would have been rejected because of their convictions , the office said in the statement
' significant security breach ' : a passenger who has convictions for murder and offenses involving explosives was allowed to pass through the tsa 's precheck line ( file picture ) despite an agent recognizing them instead , they were selected for the screening through the secure flight program 's ' risk assessment rules ' , the watchdog said
the program compares information the traveler has given their airline with information from the terrorist screening database , no fly lists and other intelligence - based systems to determine if they can board the plane and to identify low - risk passengers for expedited screening
after determining a passenger can be pre-screened , it allows them to print documents carrying the precheck sign
the tsa was unable to show the traveler 's vetting results because they are deleted seven days after travel , the inspector general 's office said
when the passenger reached the airport , an agent looked at their documents
' after checking the traveler 's boarding pass and identification , an alert transportation security officer at the airport recognized the felon and alerted his supervisor , ' the watchdog said , cnn reported
' however , the supervisor directed the [ officer ] to take no action and allow the traveler to continue through the tsa pre-check lane
' as part of the precheck system , the passenger - who has a criminal history involving explosives - would not have had to take off their shoes or jackets or remove liquids from their carry - on luggage
investigation : the tsa responded that all passengers , including those with precheck tickets , are subject to ' robust ' checks
it is not known where the june 2014 breach took place the incident was brought to the attention of the inspector general 's office 's after a whistleblower went to the u.s. office , an independent federal investigative agency
a classified report was issued to tsa detailing the need to make changes to the precheck vetting and screening process
on thursday , the tsa said in a statement that it ' takes its responsibility for protecting the traveling public very seriously '
' all passengers , including those with precheck on boarding passes , are subject to a robust security approach that employs multiple layers of security , both seen and unseen , ' it said
the tsa added that the success of its pre-screening system relies on the intelligence and national law enforcement communities identifying passengers they believe to pose a risk - yet this passenger had not been place on one of their lists
still , the agency said it was reviewing the guidelines it provides to tsa officers and supervisors to ensure they ' clearly understand the procedure in the event a person or item presents a creditable threat to transportation security ' .
