the director and cinematographer , an oscar nominee , died thursday at his home in manhattan of natural causes , stacey farrar , marketing director at the maysles center in new york , confirmed to the hollywood reporter
" gim me shelter " -- which chronicled the 1969 stones tour that culminated in the altamont , in which a fan brandishing a gun was stabbed to death by a hells angels security man â stood in a stark and more enduring counterpoint to the myth of the documentary " woodstock , " a depiction of the glorified 1969 free concert whose own dark side was left out in its pre-conceived , celebratory style
their most well - known film , " grey gardens " ( 1975 ) , was a profile of jacqueline onassis ' eccentric cousins -- mother and daughter big edie and little edie bouvier -- who lived in a dilapidated , cat - packed estate in east hampton , new york

we 're out to discover what is going on behind the scenes and get as close as we can to what is happening , " he said of their cinematic style
there were often emotional reactions to their films ; fans applauded them for the trust they developed with their subjects , allowing them to reveal long - repressed feelings or telling insights
their style -- with their subjects caught by a hand - held camera and shotgun mike -- was in the tradition of such documentarians as frederick wiseman
however , cinema verite " purists " argued that the maysleses sometimes exploited the content , particularly in regard to the omniscient editing of " gim me shelter , " where their flashback storytelling style created a dramatic foreboding and " imposed " a narrative on the stones ' tour
flashbacking from mick jagger reviewing their footage , with altamont 's horrific memory in the recent past , " gim me shelter " punctuated a feeling of dread as the events moved inexorably to the tour 's cataclysmic end

muddled by inadequate planning and the darkness at the fringes of the peace / love zeitgeist , the concert was a ghoulish nightmare
