a suicide bomb attack in iraq this week was carried out by an american jihadist , isis claims
the terrorist group released a photograph on tuesday of a masked fighter it identified as abu daood al-amriki , an alleged american jihadist who committed the suicide attack
the claim grabbed headlines , but days later , neither cnn nor american government officials have been able to confirm the identity of the attacker
isis claims the attacker used an explosives - laden vehicle to mount an attack in samarra , iraq
two senior iraq security officials confirmed that an attack matching the description did take place -- that a suicide attacker rammed a vehicle packed with explosives into a convoy of iraq forces
at least three iraq security forces were killed in the attack , the sources said
but isis has not released the birth name of the alleged american suicide bomber , or shown his face
american officials tell cnn that for the moment there is nothing to corroborate the claim .
