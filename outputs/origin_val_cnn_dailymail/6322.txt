first it was smoked salmon and caviar , followed by champagne and lobster
now lidl , the bargain supermarket chain the middle class love , is trying the luxury - on - the - cheap approach with something rather different : lingerie
the collection , entitled see you in venice , is part of the esmara clothing range , and consists of four bra designs in cup sizes 34b , 36b , 38b and 38c
the bras are available in polka - dot , slate grey , black trimmed with pink or nude and black , and cost Â£ 3.99
the matching briefs come in small , medium and large , which covers a generous range of sizes between a ten and 20 , and a pack of two costs Â£ 3.99 â a fraction of the amount we usually spend on smalls
all the lingerie is made in china from polyester , lycra and nylon , and is available in lidl stores while stocks last
if the range proves popular , more sizes will follow , says sophie lambert russell , from the lidl fashion team
while the undies are certainly cheap , as any woman knows , it can sometimes be a mistake to scrimp on the basics
so , can these supermarket smalls compete with our high street favourites ? to find out if the see you in venice collection is catwalk chic or bargain bucket , we asked independent lingerie expert becky john and the mail âs senior stylist amy kester to cast their critical eyes over them , checking for size , fit and comfort
here âs what they found â¦ dark and chic becky says : â this dark colour is flattering , and it looks classy on nearly every skin tone
there is no seam up the middle of the cup , so it wo nât be visible through a tight t - shirt
the briefs are ultra-thin and i do hope they maintain their shape when they are washed
there are seams up the middle of the briefs on the front and back , which might be uncomfortable under tight jeans due to chafing
â however , they are pretty , grown - up looking and great value
â amy says : â wow , this set looks really chic
the underwiring gives good support and the brief - style knickers have good coverage as well as looking glamorous
â best for : date - night
slate grey padded push - up bra , matching briefs
5/5 everyday essential becky says : â this is probably the most versatile of all the bras and could be worn everyday because of its neutral colour â it âs just a shame the whole set is nât completely nude - toned
the black lace trim just looks like a cheap , last - minute add - on
it is only sewn on to the bra at the top and bottom rather than all the way round
i can actually put my finger under it , and i âm worried it might become detached or pucker when washed
the briefs are a good size â not too grannyish but not too skimpy either
â amy says : â i do nât like this one on
the colour reminds me of shapewear and the black lace makes it look cheap
it would have been better in ivory
â best for : everyday wear
nude with lace trim padded push - up bra , matching briefs
2.5/5 go - getting glamour becky says : â this colour combination reminds me of agent provocateur and this set has a lovely diamante detail along with the bows
â the briefs have no centre seams , which will ensure a smooth contour
i like the fact all the lidl bras have three fastenings on the back
some cheap sets have only two , or one , which means you ca nât adjust them easily
this set looks beautiful and it smacks of luxury
â amy says : â pink on black can look cheap but the satiny fabric makes it look classy
it reminds me of a set rosie huntington-whiteley designed for m&s
â best for : a pretty gift
black padded push - up bra with pink lace trim , matching briefs
4/5 polka push-up becky says : â thin straps look more attractive , but are nât always strong enough to support a bigger bust and i âm not sure i âd want such a delicate strap if i was wearing the 38c
â the underwiring does nât sit flush to the model âs skin and that âs because the sizes are so limited
â and the half - seam up the front of the bra cup might show under a t - shirt
â but the cut of the cups makes lauren âs cleavage look really good and there is no unattractive gathering on the knickers
â amy says : â i love the bow details , and the lace edging gives it an expensive feel
â best for : teenagers
cream and black polka - dot padded push - up bra , matching briefs
3/5 the verdict of our experts becky says : â these four styles will give pricier ranges such as la senza and boux avenue a run for their money
but the reason they can retail at such a low price is that the manufacturers need only a few templates as the bra sizes on offer are so limited
i âd be a bit fed up if i âd driven across town to buy a set , only to find that the sizes available are too small for me
â a survey conducted by debenhams in 2014 found the average bra size of women in england and ireland is 34c , while in scotland it âs 34dd . only welsh consumers â whose average size is 34b â would fit into the lidl range
â amy says : â i âve inspected the stitching and everything looks finished properly
on the whole , i think they âre well made
i âm impressed by the attention to detail at such low prices
