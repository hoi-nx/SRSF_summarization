after fighting to stay cool , mcclaren now has a battle of greater significance
his derby team must arrest their alarming slump if this season is not to finish in even deeper disappointment than the last
wolves inflicted another defeat with a determined display and have the play - offs firmly in sight
derby were top after 33 games , 11 points ahead of jackett âs side
after a sixth match without a win the gap is just two
derby do not look safe in fifth
wolves are in the prowl in seventh
mcclaren was furious with referee stroud âs call that denied his team an opening goal
he will be angry with his defenders for the wolves goals
derby goalkeeper grant punches a sliced clearance into his own net to make it 2 - 0 to wolves nouha dicko celebrates with scott golbourne and bakary sakho after giving wolves the lead at molineux dicko fires past grant in the derby goal just minutes after half - time to set wolves on their way to victory wolves ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : tomasz kuszczak 7 ; doherty 6.5 , danny batth 6 , stearman 6.5 , golbourne 6.5 ; henry 6.5 ( van la parra 68 â 6.5 ) , price 6.5 , mcdonald 7.5 , sako 7 ; afobe 7 ( doyle 90 â ) , nouha dicko 7 ( edwards 65 â 6 ) subs not used : mccarey , ebanks-landell , hause , iorfa scorer ( s ) : nouha dicko 48 , grant ( og ) 69 manager : jackett 7 derby ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : grant 4 ; christie 6 , keogh 5.5 , albentosa 6 , forsyth 5 ; will hughes 7 , bryson 7 ; russell 6 ( dawkins 70 â 5 ) , ince 7 , lingard 6.5 ; darren bent 6 subs not used : ward , roos , hanson , thomas , shotton , warnock booked : christie manager : steve mclaren 6.5 referee : stroud 3 attendance : 27,480 in the 69th minute goalkeeper grant elected to punch rather than catch the ball after forsyth had slashed a clearance skywards
grant succeeded only in diverting it horribly into his own net
forsyth was at fault earlier
three minutes after the interval he erred in sending a clearance to mcdonald , who fed the nouha dicko
the mali striker dispatched his finish through the legs of two derby defenders
the match was utterly absorbing
derby hit the woodwork twice , wolves once
there were shots , saves , and in the 39th minute a real shocker
amid the end - to - end chances , stroud intervened in entirely unnecessary fashion
lingard slipped a pass to darren bent , who was tugged down by wolves captain danny batth as he ran clear
in an instant ince arrived to pop the ball into the unguarded net
but stroud had blown to award the visitors a free - kick
he compounded the error by failing to administer a card of any colour despite the foul warranting red for denying a goalscoring opportunity
the wolves players celebrate after grant punched the ball into his own net to make it 2 - 0 derby manager steve mclaren shows his frustration during the championship defeat on friday mcclaren , sitting in the stands , ripped the headset from his ear and made his way to the touchline to remonstrate
growing animated , he was mocked by wolves fans
â where âs your brolly gone ? â they sang
bryson fired the free - kick at goal and tomasz kuszczak , not for the first or last time , dived to save
the polish goalkeeper had earlier made fine stops from a lingard piledriver and a long - ranger by ince
ince was targeted by wolves fans for his england under-21 withdrawal
â eng-ur-land , â they chanted
he nearly silenced them in the 25th minute with a curling shot that hit the bar
wolves were more than competing
in the 27th minute a cross by nouha dicko was deflected to benik afobe whose volley was kept out by grant
nouha dicko sent another effort just wide
bakary sakho holds off the challenge of derby midfielder will hughes he made no mistake with his goal to send molineux wild
derby pressed hard in the second period and tomasz kuszczak produced his finest save by getting his fingertips to bryson âs sweet drive , diverting the ball onto the post
wolves hit the woodwork too , when mcdonald sent afobe clear with a long pass
the wolves striker smacked the crossbar
grant then gifted the hosts the clincher and derby âs race was run
afterwards , mcclaren had one thing on his mind
â it âs cost us the game , â he said of stroud âs decision
â he will watch it again and know he is wrong
â mcclaren implements a no - swear policy but admitted he breached it when trying to make sense of the officiating
he spoke to the referees assessor to air his grievance
tomasz kuszczak of wolves celebrates his team 's second goal against derby on friday night â we try not to complain too much about referees like we see in the game , â he said
â but it is very difficult to keep our humility
â mcclaren believes his side can â absolutely â win all their remaining seven games to reassert a push for automatic promotion
a play - off place is the minimum requirement
he hopes his injured players including chris martin , jeff hendrick , and george thorne will all be back after the international break
jackett wants two points per match in the run - in to reach the play - offs just a season after winning league one
â we âre in with a really good shout of being able to take one of those three promotion places , â he said
â we have potency up front and pace that disturbs defenders
â when derby beat us by five ( in november ) , at that junction it looked like a chasm between the two clubs
derby have been setting the benchmark for quality in the championship
so for us to be two points behind we âre delighted
