' if i leave cleaning products out for a second then he will eat them or try to drink them and he 's always picking paint off the walls
' and i had to give a plant that a friend gave to me as a present to my mum because he was always at the soil
' he will eat literally anything

' but thankfully that has n't happened yet and he 's not gained weight
' but eoin collins has limited speech so he ca n't tell me why he does it at all and it 's really stressful

mrs collins said : ' he will get more freedom when he goes outside which is really important - it will be a massive step for his independence
' he loves to be outside and people have been really kind by donating things and raising money for the new garden
' he 's a rascal but is really loving
unfortunately he ca n't go outside on his own much because of the condition but hopefully that is about to change .
