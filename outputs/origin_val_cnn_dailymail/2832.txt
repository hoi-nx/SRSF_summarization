simon danczuk has lambasted the labour leader miliband miliband is a ' f * * * * * * knob ' who costs labour votes , according to one of his own mps
outspoken backbencher simon danczuk said the labour leader was seen as more of a ' toff ' than cameron because he was too ' aloof ' from voters ' everyday lives
ordinary people would rather go for a pint with the prime minister than the labour leader - and any mp who said otherwise was ' telling lies ' , mr simon danczuk said
he said : ' i spend four hours knocking on doors on a sunday â they [ constituents ] say things like ' you 're doing an alright job as mp but i do n't want miliband as prime minister , so i wo n't vote for you '
' mr simon danczuk 's bombshell remarks come just 45 days before the general election â and less than two weeks before the official campaign kicks off
the labour backbencher tore into mr miliband for failing to connect with voters outside london and lambasted his decision to apologise for posing with a copy of the sun newspaper
he said the public could n't understand the labour leader 's decision to pose for a picture holding the sun â while also claiming he had been right to apologise after the image sparked fury on merseyside
mr simon danczuk said : ' it 's that sort of double speak from politicians : how could he be right on both counts ? that turns people off politics
' so when somebody hears a politician say that , you know what they think , if you pardon the language : ' what a f * * * * * * knob '
that 's the reality of it
' mr simon danczuk also blasted labour 's deputy leader harriet harman for the same ' double speak '
the labour backbencher said mr miliband was harming his chances of re-election
mr simon danczuk only won his seat by 889 votes in 2010 , narrowly defeating the paul rowen candidate paul rowen
voters would prefer to go for a pint with the prime minister than the labour leader - pictured in scotland today - and any mp who said otherwise was ' telling lies ' , simon danczuk said mr miliband delivered a speech to activists in clydebank , scotland , today as the party 's struggles north of the border continue - with the latest polls showing a landslide victory for the snp in may simon danczuk was only elected in 2010 but has already established himself as one of parliament 's most prominent backbench labour mps

but mr simon danczuk has also launched a series of attacks on his own party - including over immigration , benefits and the lack of working class labour mps
he even criticised his own mother for relying on welfare and revealed he had taken drugs
his profile has also been enhanced by his wife karen , who has risen to fame after posting a series of provocative selfies on twitter
he said : ' you get it on the doorstep
if we 're having a straight conversation about this , he [ miliband ] has an image of being more of a toff than cameron
that 's how the public see it
' and what they mean by that is that he 's seen as more aloof
they 'd prefer to go for a pint with cameron than they would with miliband , that 's the reality of it
' mr simon danczuk said if the labour knew the cost of electing mr miliband in september 2010 they would have chosen another leader
this scathing criticism , in an interview with the new statesman , comes amid growing concern in the party over labour 's chances in the election in may
but mr simon danczuk said the labour could be in trouble for years to come
he said : ' i do think the party has almost been hijacked by what i 've described previously as a north london liberal elite
it 's just so disconnected
' i think labour has a real problem if they do n't realign themselves actually , after the general election
if they do n't start thinking afresh about how they approach politics and how they involve people at a community level
' mr simon danczuk added : ' you know , this north london elite view of the world , just does n't play in rochdale , rotherham , runcorn or anywhere else beginning with an ' r ' outside the m25
' we should be winning rugby should n't we ? why are n't we winning rugby â we wo n't win rugby
why wo n't we win rugby ? it 's ridiculous
' so you ca n't , as leader , just do set piece speeches for three years â hidden behind a lectern â and hope that gets on the 10 o'clock news and convinces loads of people to vote labour

he said : â he is a weak leader who it utterly out of touch with the lives and concerns of hardworking taxpayers
