' you just feel hollow if i 'm being honest
we have n't played well enough , we 've got to accept that
' you just feel like you 've let people down , that would be the main emotion
' i want to carry on desperately
it 's certainly not my decision
i hope [ to stay ]
i 'm here to try and make a difference
certainly on a day like today you look at it and you know we have a lot of work to do in one - day cricket - there 's no doubt about that
' we have n't played well enough in this tournament all the way through
that 's something we have to look at
' it 's a game we felt we should have won
we should have chased 275 and we did n't do it - we have to take that on the chin
' england must now play out a dead rubber against afghanistan on friday in a tournament that was summed up against bangladesh by morgan 's fifth odi duck in 12 innings
morgan replaced cook as captain shortly before england left for their warm - ups in australia , with the relatively untested gary also drafted in at number three
moores continued : ' we have n't got a settled team
we 've lost two key players at the top of our order ( cook and ) jonathan trott was the number three , we 've lost some players and we accept that , we do n't make an excuse of it
we tried to find what we think are the best players to get into that team
' gary is a very good one - day player , we felt that was the right decision
he did n't play well enough , alex ( hales ) got his go today

you make your choice , you pick the side you think is the best team , which we did , and we have to accept they did n't play well enough
' warne and kevin pietersen were among those criticising england on twitter after their early elimination in the group stages
' england had the wrong team , the wrong style of play and everyone could see it
tonight 's result is not a shock , i feel for morgan
coach is in trouble , ' warne tweeted
kevin pietersen added : ' i can not believe this
but , well done bangladesh ! you deserved it ! ' do not say we have n't prioritised odi cricket ! we played a back - to - back ashes to make sure england played six months of odis before this world cup ! ' gary lineker , the former england striker , said : ' bangladesh win ! congratulations to them
the good news is , england ca n't possibly get any worse
' and piers morgan wrote : ' what an absolute disgrace
[ paul ] downton and moores have dragged english cricket into the sporting sewer with their petty , clueless incompetence
' i want downton and moores sacked today and kevin pietersen restored to the team
this farce just reached its true , hideous nadir
' i would n't trust downton and moores to run a * * * * ing bath , let alone the england cricket team

' we 've picked guys who can play a brand of cricket that if we performed we could win this world cup but ultimately we have n't performed , ' he told sky sports
' it 's pretty poor , obviously to be knocked out of a world cup this early is unbelievably disappointing
i 'm gutted at the moment
we 've struggled and fought away since we arrived here
' one of our big things was to fight quite hard and to try and get through to the quarter - finals and then from there fight our way through the last three games but obviously that 's not meant to be
' morgan added : ' it ultimately comes down to performance and today was an example of where some of our guys performed but we did n't perform as a unit and we 've done it for quite a while now
' since we 've landed in australia we 've tried to address that problem but it has n't worked
' our expectations are a lot higher than the way we 've performed so that 's extremely disappointing
' there 'll be an inquest over the next few weeks as to what happened and what went wrong and then we 'll go from there
