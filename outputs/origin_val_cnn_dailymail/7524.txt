a gang enforcer convicted of beating and strangling a san antonio woman who refused to pay a mexican mafia - imposed tax on her illegal drug sales is set to be executed this week
the lethal injection of manuel vasquez on wednesday evening would leave texas prison officials in the nation 's most active death penalty state with enough pentobarbital to carry out only one more execution until they are able to obtain a new supply
at least six executions are scheduled in the coming weeks in texas , where prison officials â like in other death penalty states â have struggled to find providers for drugs for executions
manuel vasquez , 46 , had no appeals in the courts tuesday and the texas board of pardons and paroles rejected a clemency petition filed on his behalf in a 7 - 0 vote
gang enforcer manuel vasquez , 46 , is scheduled for execution on wednesday for the ordered murder of a san antonio woman who ignored a 10 per cent street tax on drugs known as a ' dime ' evidence at manuel vasquez 's 1999 capital murder trial showed he and two other men were carrying out orders to kill 51 - year - old ybarra for ignoring the mexican mafia 's 10 per cent street tax on drugs â known as a ' dime
' after a night of drinking and drugs at a run - down san antonio motel , manuel vasquez and two companions barged into the nearby room of ybarra and her boyfriend , bazan , early on march 19 , 1998 , according to evidence presented at his trial
bazan was knocked out in an ensuing struggle but said he saw ybarra being beaten , heard manuel vasquez holler that she was biting him and saw manuel vasquez using a telephone cord to strangle ybarra
the attackers grabbed valuables like cameras and jewelry , stuffed them into a pillowcase and fled
when bazan regained consciousness , he stumbled to the motel office to summon police
he was able to identify at least one of the attackers , leading to the arrest of all three
one of them , johnny joe cruz , took a plea deal that carried a seven - year sentence and testified against manuel vasquez
the third man charged , oligario lujan , is serving a 35 - year prison term
court records show the three were carrying out orders from mexican mafia boss rene munoz , who spent years on the texas department of public safety 's 10 most wanted list until his arrest in 2012
joel perez , manuel vasquez 's lead trial lawyer , recalled last week that the motive for the slaying was ' very detrimental '
' we have the texas mexican mafia , and anyone selling drugs they collect a dime - 10 percent , ' he said
' and the motive in this case was she was n't paying
