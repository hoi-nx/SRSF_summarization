david moyes ' side , who like getafe came into this game on the back of two wins and a defeat in their last three matches , saw plenty of ball early on but did little with it
the hosts looked sluggish during the opening exchanges , but they had a penalty appeal turned down in the ninth minute
leon cut into the box and just as he looked to get it out of his feet and pull the trigger he was stopped in his tracks by a bumbling challenge from real sociedad centre - back inigo martinez
referee lopez waved away the appeals , but the incident sparked getafe into life and quique flores ' side should have taken the lead when alvaro vazquez beat three defenders and then disappointingly toe - poked straight at real sociedad 's grateful keeper rulli
leon came within inches of opening the scoring after 20 minutes when he exquisitely curled onto the bar from the corner of the box

inigo martinez made the pressure count by leaping highest to head granero 's pinpoint free - kick in with the help of a post as guaita got close to clawing it away after it bounced off his right upright , but fell just short of getting a good enough contact
with getafe frustrations boiling over after the goal , juan rodriguez protested too loudly when his penalty appeal for a challenge by inigo martinez and granero was rejected and he was duly booked by lopez
the hosts frantically probed for an equaliser late on , with mehdi lacen again forcing rulli into another good save with six minutes remaining , but real sociedad held out to finally get a reward on their travels .
