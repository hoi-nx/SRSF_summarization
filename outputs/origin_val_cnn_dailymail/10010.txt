a hotel worker whose nose was bitten off on the night of his work christmas is having it rebuilt using skin from his face
watson , 32 , admits he was too drunk to remember on a night out with colleagues in newcastle on december 23 , but insists he was attacked
he is currently recovering from reconstructive surgery as doctors battle to repair his disfigured face using grafts from other parts of his head
but police have shelved the investigation into the alleged attack because he was too drunk to remember who attacked him , and where
anger : watson , 32 , claims his nose was bitten off , left and right , during his work christmas but is furious after police shelved their investigation because he was too drunk to remember what happened after checking cctv at possible locations and hunting for witnesses , officers found nothing so were unable to record the incident as a crime and suggested he may have fallen over
mr watson fears the person who attacked him may now never be caught and denies he fell because he had no grazes on his hands , elbows or knees
now he faces years of surgery to repair his nose , which was so severely damaged people can not stop staring
aftermath : mr watson says that people keep staring at him because of his injuries he said : ' it 's been awful
people still stare at me wherever i go , in the shop , on the bus , i get people looking at me
' i just ca n't get my head around the fact that this has happened to me and i do n't know why
' he had been enjoying a christmas do with his colleagues from newcastle 's vermont hotel when the mysterious incident occurred , during the early hours of december 22 , 2013
he believes he was attacked near grey 's monument , outside fenwick department store , in newcastle city centre
he said : ' all i can remember is a flash of blue , then the pain of someone biting my nose , i can just remember the excruciating pain
i was delirious , in shock and in pain '
he then went back to the hotel he works in and a friend called an ambulance
when watson got to hospital medics told him a piece of his nose , the size of a five pence piece was missing
the hotel maintenance worker has since undergone painful skin grafts , and in december surgeons took skin from another part of his face to rebuild his nose
last month watson went under the knife again for more reconstructive surgery
and he will return to hospital this month to find out what the next stage of his treatment will be
watson still believes part of his nose was bitten off
but police say there was not enough evidence to suggest a crime had taken place
' there is no way i could have got that injury without someone else doing it
the police say i could have tripped or fallen , but i have no other bruises on my knees or hands
and i was wearing my glasses and they did n't break
' the police have now written it off because i ca n't remember what happened
i thought it happened outside fenwick but i ca n't be sure
they say they checked the cctv cameras in that area and found nothing
but it could have happened somewhere else
' mystery : mr watson has had surgery twice already after the incident on december 23 - but his memory of the night is hazy , making it hard for police to discover what happened northumbria police has confirmed the incident was investigated but no evidence of an attack could be found
a spokeswoman said : ' we can confirm we received a report from the ambulance service that a man had suffered an injury
