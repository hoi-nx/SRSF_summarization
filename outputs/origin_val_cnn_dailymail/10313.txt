the prime minister led furious calls for any companies found guilty of selling personal data without consent to face the toughest consequences rogue data firms were warned by cameron last night that they could face serious penalties after the mail exposed an astonishing trade in private information
the prime minister led furious calls for any companies found guilty of selling personal data without consent to face the toughest consequences
he suggested the law would be tightened if loopholes are being exploited by unscrupulous cold callers
his comments came as charities for the elderly , politicians and campaigners called for an urgent crackdown and said there should be lengthy jail sentences for the worst offenders
the information commissioner said data firms could face fines of Â£ 500,000 and warned that those breaking the law â are in deep trouble â
the mail revealed yesterday how highly sensitive financial information about millions of pension holders is being sold for as little as 5p and ending up in the hands of criminals
the revelations come amid fears scammers are targeting the elderly and vulnerable ahead of george osborne âs pension reforms , which come into force on monday and will give savers the chance to access their full retirement pots
data firms sold undercover reporters personal data for 15,000 people , including their salaries , the value of their investments and the size of their pensions
they did so without any attempt to verify that the reporters , who posed as a cold - calling firm , were a genuine company or to check how they planned to use the data
last night , mr cameron said the revelations were â very worrying â
he told the mail : â i âve listened to the information commissioner who now has the powers and laws that he needs to chase after this stuff
but it âs extremely serious
' we âll always look at it and if more needs to be done we âll do it , but my understanding from the briefing that i have had is that the legal position is pretty robust
data theft , information theft , there are quite serious penalties
â nick clegg said large scale data theft should carry a jail term
the deputy prime minister said he had pushed for tougher sentences
â the average fine for data theft is about Â£ 100 â , he said
â even if it âs on an industrial scale
â labour health spokesman andy burnham said : â it is nothing short of disgraceful that personal details of vulnerable and older people are being bought and sold in this way
this has got to stop and the government needs to act
â and labour work and pensions spokesman rachel reeves said : â today âs revelations that personal data is being passed on to those looking to make a quick buck out of pensioners â savings are shocking
how yesterday 's mail broke the story : nick sayer , a director of b2c data , offered to sell details of 15,000 people to undercover reporters ' ministers have ignored warning after warning about the threats to savers from fraudsters , but they must now act quickly to protect savers
â the mail âs investigation into the sale of personal data prompted a wave of fury and concern from leading politicians , pensions experts , data experts and charities
here is what they said : cameron : â it âs extremely serious
we âll always look at it and if more needs to be done we âll do it , but
. data theft , information theft , there are quite serious penalties
â information commissioner christopher graham : â what these companies appear to be failing to understand is that under the law you have rights over the use of your personal information
if they decide to treat it as their own product , to buy and sell without your permission , then there will be consequences
â andy burnham , shadow health secretary : â it is nothing short of disgraceful that personal details of vulnerable and older people are being bought and sold in this way
this has got to stop
â ros altmann , pensions expert : â it is utterly shocking and wrong
there now needs to be real change from the authorities
a zero tolerance policy for those who sell your private , personal or intimate details for their own profit and cause so much misery so carelessly and callously
â professor sir brian , nhs data expert : â people can get this confidential information and target those who are vulnerable
the data is being used for one reason when it was given for another
there need to be harsh punishments
â lisa harris , saga spokeswoman : ' the findings of the mail âs investigation are extremely worrying , and not just for the most vulnerable in society
whilst many of us know not to give details over the phone , when the caller appears to have information about you that only you could have provided , it âs easy to see how people might think the call is genuine
â janet morrison of charity independent age : â it is horrifying that older people are being deliberately targeted by those who have gained access to records on their pensions
they are clearly being seen as easy pickings
â nick clegg : ' the average fine for data theft is about Â£ 100 , even if it âs on an industrial scale
that âs why we wanted to introduce custodial sentences
data theft is a big issue
â the information commissioner âs office ( information commissioner âs office ) has begun an inquiry as a result of the mail investigation and is passing our evidence to police
pensioners â financial details appear to have been sold after being stolen , and as the result of firms keeping personal information when they should have deleted it
information commissioner christopher graham said : â what these companies appear to be failing to understand is that under the law you have rights over the use of your personal information
if they decide to treat it as their own product , to buy and sell without your permission , then there will be consequences
' this looks like a very serious breach of the data protection act
if we establish it âs criminal activity by individuals , then they are in deep trouble
â pensions expert dr ros altmann , an adviser to mr cameron , said : â it is utterly shocking and wrong
it seems this theft of our private and personal information is endemic in business today and needs to stop
â there now needs to be real change from the authorities
no more tolerance of such betrayals of trust â a zero tolerance policy for those who sell your private , personal or intimate details for their own profit and cause so much misery so carelessly and callously
â janet morrison , chief executive of independent age , said : â it is horrifying that older people are being deliberately targeted by those who have gained access to records on their pensions
they are being targeted for their savings and pensions as well as by individuals specifically looking to exploit their vulnerabilities
â over- 50s specialist firm saga warned that the level of detail on sale about individuals made them more likely to fall victim to â despicable fraud â
age uk said it was particularly troubled by the firm that offered the mail âs team of â cold - callers â undercover reporters Â£ 500 for every pensioner they could persuade to put Â£ 20,000 in high - risk investments
one of the firms named by the mail , b2c data ltd , said it welcomes the information commissioner âs office probe and will co-operate fully with any investigation
a spokesman accused the mail of â numerous factual errors and exaggerations â
a statement added : â b2c data ltd is registered with the information commissioner âs office and is a member of the direct marketing association
it operates an entirely legitimate and legally - compliant data business
â it complies with all its legal requirements
importantly , it does not receive or process information other than in respect of those customers of its members who have opted in
equally , it does not sell â highly sensitive details of ... salaries , investments and pensions â
b2c data takes its legal obligations very seriously and will continue to do so
â by katherine faulkner mail investigations editor controversial plans for a new nhs database face growing concerns following the mail âs revelation that lists of people with medical problems are being touted for sale by unscrupulous data firms
doctors have already expressed â grave doubts â about the nhs plan â called care.data
under the scheme , details from every patient âs gp medical file will be put on one huge database and shared with drug companies
officials say the database will be kept secure and anonymous
but many doctors have expressed misgivings concerns about the project , with the nhs âs top data expert , professor sir brian , saying last night he was still â very worried â about it
today the mail reveals how lists of people with medical problems are being treated as potentially rich pickings for those looking to exploit the vulnerable
those whose medical details had been sold on said that being on such a list meant they were constantly cold called â with some offered apparently unregulated treatments and medicines by unscrupulous firms
critics are likely to feel that if such information was compiled on to one huge database , which was then shared with commercial companies such as drug manufacturers , the risk that it could be used by firms wanting to target the sick could be just too great
sir brian , a senior government health adviser , said : â this is the most confidential information you can have on patients
â among these are very vulnerable people
that data should not be available
â many doctors already believe it would be impossible to ensure the detailed information on patients contained in their gp files â which often includes private and sensitive discussions between doctor and patient â would not identify them
others have protested that the government has a poor record on keeping peoples â data secure and have criticised the move to opt all patients in to the scheme , without their explicit consent
some analysts say they could identify individuals in under two hours from the information .
