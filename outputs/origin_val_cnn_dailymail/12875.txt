los angeles gov. jerry brown unveiled an emergency $ 1 billion spending plan thursday to tackle the state 's historic drought
a staggering 11 trillion gallons are needed for californians to recover from the emergency
senate president pro tempore kevin de leã³n said the legislation will include two bills that will speed up contracting funds to " manage the drought and strengthen our infrastructure
" according to the california state water resources control board , the package will specifically accelerate $ 128 million from the governor 's budget to provide direct assistance to workers and affected communities
proposition 1 funding , which enacted the water quality , supply , and infrastructure improvement act of 2014 , will funnel $ 272 million into safe drinking water efforts and maintenance of water recycling infrastructure
some $ 660 million from prop 1 will also be accelerated for flood protection in urban and rural areas
as part of the changes , jerry brown said additional measures will crack down on water inefficiency as californians enters the fourth year of a worsening - water crisis
" this unprecedented drought continues with no signs yet of letting up , " said jerry brown
" but we have a lot of good policies coming
" to exacerbate matters , weather conditions are continuing to diminish natural resources
the sierra nevada snowpack , which californians rely on heavily during the summer for their water needs , is at a near record low
the march snowpack measurement came in at 0.9 inches of water content in the snow , just 5 % of the march 3 historical average for the measurement site
the overall water content for the northern sierra snowpack came in at 4.4 inches , just 16 % of average for the date
central and southern sierra readings were 5.5 inches ( 20 % of average ) and 5 inches ( 22 % of average ) respectively
only in 1991 has the water content of the snow been lower
" the drought is n't letting up , so we ca n't let up either , " assembly speaker toni atkins said
" this legislation will deliver relief to californians harmed by the drought and help us manage the significant problems the drought continues to cause
since our skies are still clear , our job is too
and making sure we meet emergency needs , prepare for short term problems and advance longer - term projects are an important part of that effort
" jerry brown anticipates his emergency package to move into action immediately
he has recently created a drought task force to expedite the legislation .
