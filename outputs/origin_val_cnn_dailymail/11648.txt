walcott will return to arsenal with roy hodgson 's warning ringing loud and clear
' an important few months , ' said the england boss , and that was before a frustrating night spent all - too - easily shackled by three italians centre - halves
starved of the ball in an unfamiliar position in an even less familiar line - up it was easy to feel sympathy for walcott as he was hauled off after 55 minutes in turin
walcott struggled for england against italy and was starved of the ball playing in an unfamiliar position but sympathy wo n't do him much good
what he needs is football and plenty of it if he is to recapture the zip , rediscover his rhythms and regain ground on those who have passed him at club and country
with a contract set to expire next year and arsene wenger seemingly reluctant to offer him game time , even when alexis sanchez is running on empty , there is lots to consider
unlike those striking deals to be excused a half here and a game there , walcott reported for international duty desperate to feature
he added two more caps
he was encouraged to get the nod to come on ahead of townsend against lithuania and thrilled at the chance to start against italy but it was heavy going
walcott shoots at goal during england 's friendly against italy at the juventus stadium on tuesday walcott was starting his first international game in 18 months having injured his cruciate ligaments tottenham winger townsend came on , also out of position , and fired home england 's equaliser england improved as an attacking threat after michael carrick 's introduction towards the end of the first - half and pulled level as the game became disrupted by substitutions
to make matters worse for walcott , it was townsend who came on , also playing out of position on the left of roy hodgson 's midfield diamond , and fired a terrific equaliser past gianluigi buffon
walcott goes back to arsenal to prepare for liverpool on saturday , but when arsene wenger catches up on this game , he will not see any compelling evidence to offer a recall to the first team against one of the clubs likely to show interest if he is to leave the emirates stadium
that is not a decision he has yet made
but it will emerge as a possibility if walcott can not impose himself on the end of the season
he has just turned 26 , he has been an england international for nearly nine years â this was his 38th cap - and he needs to play regularly
if he is on the market , there will be demand from premier league clubs anxious to add to their english contingent , but he has to choose carefully
arsenal may ultimately make the decision for him
england winger walcott failed to make an impact for the england as his touch map ( right ) shows in turin , walcott was starting his first international start for 18 months , having played less than nine hours of competitive football since damaging cruciate ligaments in january last year
when he was injured he was playing up front in an fa cup tie against tottenham
it ' s safe to assume that at that point he did not expect his next england start to be in tandem with harry kane , who was on the tottenham bench that day
their partnership is unlikely to be rekindled
it started badly , with a moment of miscommunication with gibbs , his arsenal team - mate
walcott turned and dashed away while gibbs rolled a pass into the area he had just vacated
then his touch let him down
his touch was too poor too often , a clue to his lack of match sharpness
the failure of either harry kane or walcott to hold up the ball contributed to an insipid start and the gentle rhythms of the first - half seemed to have sent the crowd to sleep until pelle stirred them with his goal
walcott dropped deeper in search of the ball
his touch was better when he accepted a long , wonderful right - to - left pass from rooney , just before pelle scored
he tried to duck onto his right foot and curl one towards the far post but his effort was blocked by andrea ranocchia
walcott , pictured against italy 's leonardo bonucci , lacked match sharpness after his time on the sidelines that was his only real sniff of goal
another chance was smothered after a knock - down from harry kane
england were flat in the first - half , and less effective on the turnover than they have been
they never utilised walcott 's pace in behind and so did not unleash his greatest asset , although ian wright partly blamed the arsenal man for making the wrong runs
this is one reason he will remain primarily a winger
he can finish and has a healthy goal rate at the time of his injury but he thrives in the open
he was too easily policed by the italians , but so was harry kane , the hottest striker in england
at the start of the second - half , walcott switched roles with rooney , playing in the n.10 position , one he is even less familiar with
but , 10 minutes after the break , he was replaced by ross barkley , who also made a good impression
the work out will do him no harm , but walcott is in danger of slipping down the order at england as well as arsenal
none of which bodes well for his chances of getting what he really needs at club or country
harry kane , the premier league 's joint - top scorer , was easily dealt with by giorgio chiellini and co walcott was replaced by ross barkley and the england team seemed more comfortable with the everton man
