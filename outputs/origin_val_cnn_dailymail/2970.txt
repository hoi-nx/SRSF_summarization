tomorrow 's total eclipse will produce a 100 - mile - wide ' totality ' shadow path that crosses the north atlantic and covers only two land masses , the faroe islands between scotland and iceland and the norwegian archipelago of svalbard
elsewhere only a partial eclipse will be seen at best and that is why there are only two places on the planet where the real junkies want to be tomorrow morning

' one minute the sun is shining then it starts getting darker but it does n't get dark like it does in the evening or at dusk - it goes dark very , very fast
' within half a minute it 's completely black and it is something that is very strange to experience
' it does n't feel natural and completely understand the ancient civilizations who thought it was some sort of omen
' when you see it you 're so happy that it was shown to you because there are so many things which can disturb it , like clouds
' though some of her friends and family may think she 's mad , all the hassle and the expense is worth it for agnese when the eclipse itself happens
she said : ' that moment alone alone you feel like , " yes , we did it "
all the natural power comes together when you see it and even though it 's short , i am never disappointed
' my family and some of my friends think i 'm a bit crazy but every person goes crazy in their own way
