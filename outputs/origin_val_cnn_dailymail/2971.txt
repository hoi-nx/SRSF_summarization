but kim did n't always look the way she does today
on sunday her childhood friend lund shared never - before - seen photos of the 34 - year - old keeping up with the kardashians star taken long before she became an international sensation
but never has the singer , whose new song is north 2 south-this is it was released this year , shared so many
in one image kim looked chubby faced as she shows off bangs and thinner lips
the reality diva also looked more natural with a hearty smile and lack of self - consciousness
peace out : lund has shared images of mrs kanye west before.but never has the singer , whose new song is north 2 south - this is it was released this year , shared so many in another she looks older with thin eyebrows , bigger lips and short hair
she appeared to be about 18 - years - old

cool kids of calabasas ? : kim , at age 19 , had braces as a teen and already plucked brows while lund wore a nineties style choker hats off to them : as teenagers they knew how to do their makeup already and mug for the camera lund also talked to the mirror , where she told the publication her old friend struggled after the loss of her father robert kardashian , an attorney , in september 2003
' kim was a daddy âs girl , she adored her father and when she died she was devastated , ' the singer said
' rob was the one who would make sure she was working hard and that she was behaving herself
i do n't think this whole thing would be happening to her right now if he was still alive
' lund also added that kim was quiet as a child
' she never wanted to be famous , it just kind of happened
she was always the quiet girl sitting in the corner while we were all being loud
' ahhh , this is more like the kim we know : the e ! star looked more like herself in later snaps ; here she was in a photo booth with lund the friend also said the mother of north west , aged one , was diligent
' kim was studious , she wanted to be a good student
she worked hard at school , she did nât get straight a âs but the teachers liked her
she âd never bunk off school

she did the no - carbs thing and would ask for a burger with no bun ' wanting to be like jennifer lopez meant kim watched her weight
' kim was always on some sort of diet , we all were
she did the no - carbs thing and would ask for a burger with no bun
she was conscious of what she looked like , she did nât have her bum then but the boys liked her
kim got a lot of attention back then
' we were a bit dorky really
we loved the spice girls , when we were like 15 and 16 and we loved dressing up as them and singing along to their songs
kim loved posh , she thought she was the prettiest one and she loved what she wore
' she went out and bought herself a black leather dress with slits in it â it was exactly like posh âs
kim would do her make up like posh âs and her hair was similar so she did actually really look like her
' they were friends too : lund arm in arm with kim 's older sister kourtney , now 35 and a mother of three children on sunday , kim has been in paris taking in fashion shows
