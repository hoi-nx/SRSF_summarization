an improvement in pacquiao 's sparring in the ring has seen ' smart money ' gamblers backing him carl froch â who was disgracefully accused of running scared of james â has added the most feared pound - for - pound puncher in the world to his list of potential opponents
gennady golovkin , the killer kazakh who knocks out opponents for fun , is in the cobra âs line of fire if a fight can not be made with ward at nottingham forest 's football ground or julio cesar chavez jnr in las vegas carl froch has added gennady golovkin , the killer kazakh , to his list of potential opponents gennady golovkin has made it clear he is willing to venture to nottingham while also stepping up a division and just in case james âs loose - tongued advisors would like to know , if all goes well for both of them this summer carl froch would be open to fighting his fellow brit thereafter
james meets andre dirrell in chicago in may for the ibf title vacated by carl froch , who beat the america in nottingham
carl froch says : â james has not yet proved himself for a fight with me but if he can beat andre dirrell it would become more interesting for me to face him
but not before a big name fight this summer
â james fights andre dirrell - who carl froch beat in nottingham - for the ibf title in chicago in may while khan and kell brook are talking about fighting any and every name in the welterweight division â except each other as far as khan is concerned - world super-middleweight champion carl froch holds an additional option not yet open to these of his countrymen
that possibility may be a little more tempting following the offer of a bit part â as a villain or a tough guy â in a gangster movie
but he will not exercise the glove - hanging alternative â at 37 â if he can find â a fight which floats my boat
â kell brook , who defeated jo jo dan on saturday , has spoken of fighting names in the welterweight division ward has come into that category after the wba ordered their two super-middleweight belt holders to meet for a second time to decide which of them is the real champion
the america who calls himself ward became one of only two men to have beaten carl froch when he won the final of the super six tournament â and the only one against whom the cobra has not avenged a defeat
having been outpointed in that fight in the america , carl froch is challenging ward to come to the city ground in nottingham , saying : â we âve boxed once in america so it âs his turn to come over here , where he will find i âm a different animal
â ward , a notoriously reluctant traveller , is making baulking noises about crossing the atlantic even as carl froch âs promoter hearn says : â we are in negotiations with his people
â ward , pictured left with jay z earlier this year , is a notoriously reluctant traveller chavez is committed to an interim fight next month , after which talks will resume for a fight in las vegas , the other venue which would realise a life - long ambition for carl froch
if neither ward nor chavez take the bait , world middleweight champion gennady golovkin has made clear his willingness to venture into nottingham while also stepping up a division to super-middle
gennady golovkin âs punching power has become fabled , while the eagerness of other top middleweights to duck him has become shameful
our own martin murray bravely met the challenge in monaco last month
he was stopped for the first time in his career , victim of the 29th ko inflicted by gennady golovkin in a perfect record of 32 wins
julio cesar chavez jnr , pictured against brian vera , is committed to an interim fight next month gennady golovkin defeated martin murray ( left ) , victim of the kazakh 's 29th ko , to maintain his perfect win record to which carl froch has said to hearn : â everyone says he âs a big puncher
do you think he hits hard enough to hurt me ? maybe we should find out
â carl froch is back in training and already only seven pounds over his 12 - stone fighting weight
hearn says : â carl froch âs crazy like that
almost everyone else avoids gennady golovkin like poison but it âs the kind of challenge which excites carl froch
wow what a tough fight and i âm glad it would nât be me getting in the ring with him
but we âre still talking with ward and chavez
carl froch is back in training and facing gennady golovkin would excite the 37 - year - old , according to hearn â carl froch would consider james if he wins the world title but that âs not an easy fight for james
â hearn adds : â of course carl froch could retire now
he âs worked hard and ducked no - one to get into this position
so he âs earned every right to make whatever decision he wants
â that he most certainly has .
