taylor , of union county , new jersey , went to the campus health center at syracuse university - a school she 's since left - when she was a sophomore in september 2013 complaining of flu - like symptoms
but the six - day stay in the nearby st joseph 's hospital was not what she was expecting when she told the center 's staff that she was suffering from a fever , cough , phlegm and chest congestion
while waiting for care , taylor said she told a counselor that she wanted to change her arts major and take a leave of absence from the school but missed the semester 's deadline because her computer was stolen
when she was told no one could write her a prescription at the center , she was driven to st joseph 's hospital 's and dropped in front the the emergency room , according to the post
while waiting in the er , taylor said she felt as though she was getting sicker
' i was getting stressed by the circumstances and the surroundings , ' she told the post
' i thought i 'd only be there for an hour or two
' she was then taken to a psychiatrist 's office , where she spent 15 minutes explaining that she was sick , had not been sleeping well , was struggling in her classes and feared she might lose her scholarship
taylor was then told that she would have to stay overnight and was sent to an ' observation room ' with four other patients
the psychiatrist 's notes said that taylor was in for ' involuntary treatment , ' for ' insomnia , pressured speech , disorganized , declining grades '
the patients in the room were separated by low walls while staff watched over them , taylor said
she still did n't receive medication or treatment
she wanted to call her mom , but her cellphone had died and she said the hospital would n't recharge it
taylor was sent to st joseph 's hospital ( pictured ) where she was put into ' involuntary treatment ' and observed for six days after she had only gone to the health center for medication for her flu - like symptoms taylor is now suing syracuse university , a university employee and st joseph 's hospital for misdiagnosing and improperly treating her
her hospital horror started at her university 's health center ( pictured ) , where she went to get medication ' they had n't done anything for me or my cold
they did n't take my blood pressure or even my temperature , ' she told the post
a nurse told her that if she cooperated and took the medication they gave her , she would be out in a shorter time period
she said she was given risperdal , which is used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , and klonopin , used to treat panic disorder
taylor told the post that they had to line up and take their pills , ' just like in the movie cuckoo 's nest '
she was finally able to reach her mom , who came to the hospital to get her out of the ward
taylor is now suing syracuse university , a university employee and st joseph 's hospital for misdiagnosing and improperly treating her , negligent and harmful use of medication and failure to get informed consent , among other reasons , the lawsuit states , according to the daily orange
marc held , taylor 's lawyer who filed the lawsuit in manhattan supreme court , said her treatment was ' unfathomable '
the lawsuit claims that the ' unlawful , negligent and otherwise improper confinement ' , caused taylor to suffer ' personal indignities '
taylor has since left syracuse university and transferred to rutgers university
rebecca reed kantrowitz , senior vice president and dean of student affairs , said in a statement to the daily orange that the university ' strongly support the medical professionals and staff in the center '
in november 2014 the university announced they were in the process of searching for a new psychiatric provider and since has hired additional staff
syracuse university 's attorney matthew larkin , however , told the post that the university ' denies that it acted inappropriately in any way '
a st joseph 's spokesman would n't comment due to patient privacy and pending litigation .
