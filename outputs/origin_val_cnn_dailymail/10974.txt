the diverse genetic ancestry of south america has been mapped in unprecedented detail revealing key events the history books missed
the study compared the dna of current africans and european using more than 4,000 dna samples to reveal the genetic fingerprints of the slave trade and colonisation
it also highlighted previously unidentified ancestry , such as basque lineages in south america , along with a â surprising â degree of variation in the ancestry of modern - day americans
the diverse genetic ancestry of south america has been mapped in unprecedented detail , revealing key events the history books missed
the study compared the genes of current africans and european using more than 4,000 dna samples to reveal the genetic fingerprints of the slave trade and colonisation
this map reveals the location of donor and recipient populations analysed the oxford university team first grouped subsets of people in africa and european who were genetically similar
they were able to separate european genomes into 37 groups
they then compared the data with the genomes from 2,500 people of mixed ancestry from the south america
the method helped them identify detailed ancestry sources , such as basque dna patterns from spanish , rather than french
overall the group , which also included researchers from university college london and the universita ' del sacro cuore of rome , used dna sample from 64 different populations
they included people in barbadians , columbia , the dominican republic , ecuador , mexico , puerto rico and african - americans in the usa
the study , led by oxford university , compared the ' donor ' africans and european dna with ' recipient ' american populations to see where their ancestors came from
' it was interesting to find so much complexity in the ancestry of american people , â professor cristian capelli from oxford university told dailymail.com
professor capellii , who is italian , was particularly suprised to find evidence of the basque in colombia and the italian in puerto rico , as well as the fact that some part of spanish , but not others , contributed spanish dna to the south america he explained how his team first grouped subsets of people in africa and european who were genetically similar
using something known as a ' haplotype - based ' dna technique , researchers were able to separate european genomes into 37 groups
they then compared the data with the genomes from 2,500 people of mixed ancestry from the south america
the method helped them identify detailed ancestry sources , such as basque dna patterns from spanish , rather than french
in total , the group , which also included researchers from university college london and the universita ' del sacro cuore of rome , used dna sample from 64 different populations they included people in barbadians , columbia , the dominican republic , ecuador , mexico , puerto rico and african - americans in the usa
the study found that while spanish provide the majority of european ancestry in continental american hispanic / latino populations , the most common european genetic source in african - americans and barbadians comes from the uk
the basque , a distinct ethnic group spread across current - day spanish and french , provided a small but distinct genetic contribution to current - day american populations , including the maya in mexico
meanwhile , the caribbean of puerto rico and the dominican republic are genetically similar to each other and distinct from the other populations

ithey were able to separate european genomes into 37 groups ( pictured )
they then compared the data with the genomes from 2,500 american people of mixed ancestry the ancestors of current - day yoruba people ( left ) from africa - which is one of the largest africans ethnic groups - provided the largest contribution of genes from africa to all current - day american populations
the most common european genetic source in african - americans and barbadians comes from the uk ( right ) - the most common european genetic source in african - americans and barbadians comes from the uk
- the basque , a distinct ethnic group spread across spanish and french , provided a small but distinct genetic contribution to current - day american populations
- puerto rico and the dominican republic are genetically similar to each other and distinct from the other populations , probably reflecting a different migration pattern between the caribbean and mainland south america
- compared to south americans , people from caribbean countries ( such as the barbadians ) had a larger genetic contribution from africa
- the ancestors of current - day yoruba people from africa provided the largest contribution of genes from africa to all current - day american populations
- the proportion of africans ancestry varied across the continent , from virtually zero in the maya people from mexico to 87 per cent in current - day barbadians
- south italy and sicily provided a european contribution to colombia and puerto rico , in line with the history of italian emigrants to the south america in the 19th and early 20th century
- one of the americans groups from the usa had french ancestry , which reflects historical french immigration into the colonial southern united states
the researchers say this probably reflects a different migration pattern between the caribbean
compared to south americans , people from caribbean countries , such as the barbadians , had a larger genetic contribution from africa
the ancestors of current - day yoruba people from africa - which is one of the largest africans ethnic groups - provided the largest contribution of genes from africa to all current - day american populations
' we can see the huge genetic impact that the slave trade had on american populations and our data match historical records ' , said study author dr garrett hellenthal from the ucl genetics institute , ' the majority of americans have ancestry similar to the yoruba people in africa , confirming that most african slaves came from this region
â in areas of the south america historically under spanish rule , populations also have ancestry related to what is now senegal and gambia
records show that around a third of the slaves sent to spanish america in the 17th century came from this region , and we can see the genetic evidence of this in modern americans really clearly
' researchers also found that the proportion of africans ancestry varied across the continent , from virtually zero in the maya people from mexico to 87 per cent in current - day barbadians
south italy and sicily also provided a significant european genetic contribution to colombia and puerto rico , in line with the known history of italian emigrants to the south america in the late 19th and early 20th century one of the americans groups from the usa had french ancestry , in agreement with historical french immigration into the colonial southern united states
the proportion of genes from european versus africans sources varied greatly from individual to individual within recipient populations
these genetic findings also uncover previously unknown migration
' we found a clear genetic contribution from the basque in modern - day maya in mexico ' , said oxford university 's professor cristian capelli
' this suggests that the basque also took part in the colonisation of the south america , coming over either with the spanish conquistadores or in later waves of migration
' the differences in european ancestry between the caribbean islands and mainland american population that we found were also previously unknown
â it is likely that these differences reflect different patterns of migration between the caribbean and mainland south america
' these results show just how powerful a genetic approach can be when it comes to uncovering hidden patterns of ancestry , â added professor capelli
the team now hopes to use the same approach to look at other populations with diverse genetic contributions , such as brazilians
professor capellii , who is italian , was particularly suprised to find evidence of e italian in puerto rico ( bottom right ) , as well as the fact that some part of spanish , but not others , contributed spanish dna to the south america
