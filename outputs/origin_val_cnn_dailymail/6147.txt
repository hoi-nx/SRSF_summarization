it 's a photograph that captures a collision of worlds ; in the foreground is one of the uk 's richest society heiresses and , on the table behind her , three of the most famous people on the planet - photobombers kanye , kim and their daughter north
whether alice bamford , the british heiress to the jcb farm equipment dynasty , was aware of exactly who was photobombing her image when she smiled next to her baby daughter is anyone 's guess
the social media moment was taken outside nobu , hollywood 's favourite a-list japanese restaurant , close to where alice owns an organic farm and restaurant
sir anthony 's net worth has been estimated at over Â£ 2.8billion by forbes
the family is also behind the popular daylesford organics food brand
alice is no stranger to los angeles having dabbled in hollywood when she co-produced wes anderson 's modern classic the darjeeling limited
she was also formerly a show - jumper , and previously owned her own record label in the early 2000s
more recently , she has run an organic farm and restaurant , one gun ranch , in malibu
completely unaware that one of the world 's most famous families were going to be caught in her family snap , alice can be seen with a wide smile , even slightly distracted by the view behind
when caught off guard by alice at the high - profile establishment , kim 's famous family did n't appear to be quite the picture of domesticated bliss that the reality tv star would like you to believe
while the keeping up with the kardashians personality may be no stranger to a selfie , it wo n't be the type of flattering snap that she 's used to as she was pictured reaching down to pick something up from the floor
alice bamford , pictured with her mother lady carole , is heiress to a vast fortune alice bamford might not compare to the kardashian-west family in terms of global fame but the jcb heiress has certainly led a fascinating life
the 39 - year - old is the daughter of billionaire sir anthony and his wife , lady carole , obe
sir anthony 's net worth has been estimated at over Â£ 2.8billion by forbes
the family is also behind the popular daylesford organics food brand , the namesake of the farm in gloucestershire where alice grew up

she was also formerly a show - jumper , and previously owned her own record label in the early 2000s
more recent ventures include one gun ranch , which alice purchased in 2010

a fatigued kim was in full mummy mode as north wriggled around in her high chair at the table
meanwhile photobombers kanye , looked transfixed by the mum - of - one appearing to grimace as he watched his wife reach under the table with a stern look on her face
after all , 37 - year - old rapper photobombers kanye had spent the afternoon pandering to their toddler as they played on the sands in malibu
photobombers kanye was beach - ready in a sleeveless vest - albeit in black - with practical trainers while nori looked cute in a pair of denim shorts and a white vest
most of kim 's most intimate moments from the last seven years - from her pregnancy to her 2013 divorce - have been documented on her e ! reality show with sisters kourtney , khloe , kendall and kylie , as well as mother and manager kris and step father bruce jenner
kim is usually partial to a few photograph filters to brighten or smooth her skin and has even been accused of using photoshop to alter the appearance of her famous figure in the pictures she 's posted
but this particular moment was perhaps the most candid of them all when she and her husband of one year were captured in their most raw form
polished as always , kim was arguably unsuitably dressed for a day on the sand on sunday
she had dressed up in her strappy sandals and a military green midi dress , which clung to her famous curves , deciding to watch her daddy and daughter duo from the restaurant , outside her car
her hair was looking slightly frazzled after treating it to a third dye job this week to keep the platinum shade from revealing her brunette roots
she had her hair , which she has referred to as a ' full - time job ' recently , pulled back into a low - fuss ponytail at the nape of her neck
and as if styled for a red carpet appearance , kim was carrying a snakeskin clutch bag in her hands , which was far from a traditional baby bag used to tote everything a 21 - month - old might need for a day at the beach
kim may be a style icon to some , but her younger half sister jenner has admitted that nori is actually her main source of fashion inspiration
speaking to star ! magazine recently , the youngest of the jenner family said of her icons : ' to keep it in the family , i love kim and photobombers kanye âs style
' they definitely inspire me
north probably inspires me the most
kim and photobombers kanye â i âm obsessed with their style ! kim âs always in the latest stuff , so i always look to her for advice
photobombers kanye and kim seemed unaware that they 'd been caught in someone else 's photo adorable : photobombers kanye acted like the doting dad as he spent time by the sea with nori on sunday afternoon mum mobile : kim was seen in her car in california on monday and appeared to be chatting on her phone as she sat at the wheel busy bee : the mum of one was recognisable just by her peroxide locks as she peeped over the steering wheel
