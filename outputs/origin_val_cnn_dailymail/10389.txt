television companies must try and stop children from embarrassing themselves on air , amid fears that their parents may not always have their best interests at heart
ofcom , the broadcasting regulator , called for the crackdown after a flood of viewer complaints about the way children are treated on shows like benefits street or jeremy kyle , where they are openly mocked or shown in severe distress
in one instance , a 17 - year - old guest on jeremy kyle was accused of having slept with 33 men , and told that her mother would disown her for stealing
viewers complained that the individuals sacrificed their â dignity â for entertainment , even though their own parents did not complain about the treatment
in a new set of guidelines , which raise worrying questions about the lengths people will go to for fame , ofcom has now told television producers to be wary about parents â motives for allowing their children on air
broadcasters should â form their own judgements â about how much children should be allowed to do or say on camera , and not â rely solely on the assurances of parents or guardians , particularly where vested interests may be involved , â it said
the warning comes amid growing concerns that parents allow their children to embarrass themselves on television in exchange for a fee , or because they are offered all - expenses paid hospitality , including restaurant meals and overnight stays in hotels
other parents allow their offspring on air in the hope that they will become celebrities , a source said
broadcasters should continue featuring children in their programmes , but they must take care that they are emotionally and mentally mature enough to cope with the public exposure , ofcom said
â children form strong views and feelings from a very early age and these deserve to be seen and heard in programmes
however , the ability of participants to weigh up the potential consequences of participation can vary widely
in another instance , children were â vilified â on benefits street , the channel 4 series which follows a street - full of families which live off state welfare
pictured is benefits street where the show was set â children and young people differ in their vulnerabilities and resilience ; their age , gender , physical and mental capacity , their maturity , their cultural , ethnic and religious background and their previous life experiences can all affect how they might respond to specific circumstances and nature of performance
â ofcom warned television companies to watch children âs body language , and made it explicit that they have a choice to opt out of appearing on television , in order to ensure that they are not being pushed into it by adults
and even if broadcasters do think they can deal with the public profile , children must be taught how to deal with potential bullying , including on social media platforms like facebook and twitter
there has been a huge increase in online bullying since ofcom last updated its guidelines for protecting minors , six years ago , but the rise of this so - called â trolling â now needs to be factored in at â an early stage â of production , the regulator said
â broadcasters should consider the impact of social media and the risk of bullying , including online bullying , on the child participant , and take appropriate steps to advise the young person and their parents [ or ] carers â
the crackdown follows a string of controversies about the way children are treated on air
in late 2013 , itv was found guilty of breaching broadcasting rules for airing an episode of jeremy kyle , where a guest called her 17 - year - old sister a â silly anorexic slapper â , and alleged that she had slept with 33 men
the teenager was visibly distressed as she was attacked on air
she was also accused of stealing her mother âs camera , and told that she would never see her mother again if she failed a lie detector test protesting her innocence .
