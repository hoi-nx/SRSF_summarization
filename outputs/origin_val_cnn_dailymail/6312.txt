an unmanned atlas 5 rocket blasted off from florida on thursday with a quartet of nasa science satellites designed to map explosions triggered by criss - crossing magnetic fields around the earth
the 20 - story - tall rocket , built and launched by united launch alliance , a partnership of lockheed martin and boeing , lifted off from cape canaveral at 10:44 p.m. edt ( 0244 gmt on friday )
perched atop the rocket were four identical satellites designed to fly in a pyramid formation high around earth
data from the four probes will be combined to produce three - dimensional maps of the process
magnetic reconnection , as the phenomenon is known , is commonplace throughout the universe , but poorly understood
magnetic fields are generated by planets , stars , galaxies , black holes and other celestial objects
when field lines snap apart and reconnect , charged particles are sent soaring into space at nearly the speed of light , roughly 186,000 miles per second
on the sun , magnetic reconnection unleashes solar flares , each as powerful as 1 million atomic bombs
such solar activity can trigger magnetic storms and aurora displays on earth
mission space : they will fly in pyramid formation to provide 3 - d views of magnetic reconnection on the smallest of scales new frontiers : magnetic reconnection is what happens when magnetic fields come together , break apart , then come together again , releasing vast energy nasa is spending about $ 1.1 billion on the project , known as magnetospheric multiscale , or mms , in an effort to understand how the energy is generated and released
the satellites will fly directly into reconnection zones 44,000 to 95,000 miles above earth and map what happens when magnetic field lines realign
" the mms mission will conduct a definitive experiment in space that will finally allow us to understand how magnetic reconnection works , " lead researcher jim burch , from the southwest research institute in san antonio , texas , told reporters at a pre-launch press conference
the research may have some practical spinoffs as well
efforts to harness nuclear fusion in laboratories have been stymied by magnetic reconnection , which causes temperatures to drop in the fusion chambers
it also may help forecasters predict dangerous solar storms , which can knock out power grids on earth and disrupt radio , gps and satellite signals
the mission is designed to last two years
science : the process of magnetic reconnection drives the aurora , as well as potentially disruptive solar storms
