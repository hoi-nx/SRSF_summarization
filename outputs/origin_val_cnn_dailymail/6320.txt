mr malcolm benfold 's sister , wendy bridge , from newton-le-willows , merseyside has previously spoken out against the wedding
' i do nât object to a prisoner having a wedding , but when its two murderers getting married to each other , that âs wrong , ' she told the liverpool echo
' marriage should be something to aim for when they get out , to build a home and a new life with someone , ' she added
it came at no cost to the public purse , a prison service spokesman said
' we are very clear that if prisoners do get married , the taxpayer does not foot the bill for the ceremony and they are certainly not allowed to share a cell , ' he added
