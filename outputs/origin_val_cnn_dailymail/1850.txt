a baby clothing company is being accused of fat - shaming babies after it came out with a onesie with the saying , ' i hate my thighs ' on the front
the kitschy company wry baby was brought into the spotlight after ms. magazine editor michele kort published a blog on march 10 saying the supposedly humorous onesie was actually detrimental to babies ' body image
' yes , we know â it 's meant to be funny
after all , the company that sells this onesie with the saying " i hate my thighs " is named wry
and we feminists do have a sense of humor
but really , there 's something icky about projecting fat awareness on babies , ' kort posted on the magazine 's blog
the company then offered with with an alternative saying , ' love me for my leg rolls
' wry posted a pretend poll in the comments section of kort 's post sarcastically asking consumers which onesie they preferred to see , one that favored cynicism ( i hate my thighs ) or the other one which favored sweetness ( love me for my leg rolls ) , reports e online
wry 's true to form snarky response joked that the style that gets the most buyers will be the one they keep and that the proceeds from selling both will go to the ms. foundation for women
kort did n't find wry 's response especially funny
' please make the donation to ms. magazine , wry baby
the ms. foundation for women is an entirely separate organization , ' she wrote
' and sorry that we do n't see much difference between i hate my thighs and love me for my leg rolls ; the subtext of the latter is that someone would not be loved for her leg rolls
but of course we 're making too much of this , right ? ' today reports that wry posted on their facebook page that they are merely trying to make parenting fun
new alternative : after the ' i hate my thighs ' jumper caused fury among some women , the company wry baby offered another alternative that said ' love me for my leg rolls ' other funsies : these fun baby onesies are among wry 's kitsch collection of baby gear ' what we âre trying to do is make the entire parenting experience as fun as humanly possible , ' writes wry baby co-owner kelly sopp
' we equate having kids with having a good time
why should nât it be ? ' wry baby continued to fight back against kort 's criticism of them and wrote on march 12 , ' we could nât agree more about body image
â that âs why we made an ironic joke about it
obviously no baby would or should hate their thighs ! ... but we âre glad you âre able to froth up your readers this week and shine a light on what is apparently a vital mission of ms. magazine â reviewing baby clothes
' kort spoke with today.com and said she hoped that wry baby would stop basking in the spotlight and focus on the health of babies ' body image
' think about your daughters , ' kort added , ' and what message that you want to convey to them
' some other messages from wry baby are sporty onesies with the sayings , ' silently judging you , ' ' bringing booty back , ' and ' turnt up
' it 's likely that the babies sporting the onesies will need some help from mom and dad reading what they say and understanding what they mean
