it will be trebles all round on sunday night when two of the most expensive forward lines of all time come face to face in the nou camp â barcelona âs three - pronged attack of luis suarez , neymar and lionel messi up against real trio cristiano ronaldo , gareth bale and karim benzema
carlo anceotti âs threesome have the edge so far this season having scored 56 goals between them â one more than luis enrique âs attack
but with luis suarez missing the first two months of the season and lionel messi out of form before the turn of the year , there is a feeling that the barcelona strike - force gave their real counterparts a head start and are about to go past them
there is also a feeling at a club that has a history of brilliant front threes that this particular barcelona group could finish up being the best ever
lionel messi , luis suarez and neymar jnr have netted 55 la liga goals between them this season lionel messi has hit top form for the la liga leaders after enduring a difficult start to the season it was in the 2008 - 09 season that henry , samuel eto'o and lionel messi scored 100 goals between them in one campaign with the former arsenal striker scoring 26 , etoâo 36 and messi 38
henry was at the nou camp on wednesday to cover barcelona âs victory over manchester city for sky and went down to the barcelona dressing room after the game to congratulate the players who could yet break that scoring record this season
following the henry / etoâo / lionel messi forward line came the lionel messi / david villa / pedro one that also won a european cup against manchester united
they scored 98 goals in the 2010 - 11 season with lionel messi getting 53 , villa 23 and pedro 21
cristiano ronaldo , gareth bale and karim benzema have scored 56 league goals between them this season in the 2008 - 09 campaign barcelona 's front three of henry , samuel eto'o and lionel messi scored 100 goals both attacks had a tendency to come good in the clasico and henry played in one of the most famous real - barcelona games in 2009 with barcelona winning 6 - 2 at the bernabeu , henry and lionel messi both scoring twice
on sunday it is the barcelona three who are in the best form , although none of them could get past joe hart on wednesday
real âs â bbc â forward line are a little more out of sorts with karim benzema , gareth bale and cristiano ronaldo having scored five each since the turn of the year
tomorrow at the home of their biggest rivals would be the perfect time and place to alter the trend once more .
