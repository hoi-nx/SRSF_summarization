it 's midnight , and i âm sitting by a fire swathed in native american blankets - bourbon on ice clinking in one hand , the other incinerating plump saccharine marshmallows in the gentle flames
native americans in full traditional dress â one of them calls himself â little bear â â are serenading our group with haunting songs
this is no inauthentic act cranked out for tourists , but a moving , thought - provoking reminder of an almost - lost america heritage
the native americans are not the only emblems of local culture to have been threatened
i am at mustang monument wild horse eco-resort , the creation and domain of the glamorous madeleine , whose life âs work has been to preserve the last great america mustangs from oblivion
standing proud : mustang is home to an impressive number of wild horses she opened this resort last year , a 900 - square - mile reserve and not - for - profit luxury eco-resort in northeastern nevada
former wife to oil billionaire t. boone pickens , and an ex-racehorse breeder , , madeleine rescued 600 wild horses in 2008 after hearing that the government was planning to euthanise or sell more than 30,000 for slaughter
the animals encroach on federal land and so are rounded up at extortionate cost to the taxpayer
it was a prequel to setting up a foundation to save america âs mustangs , whose conservation is battled over between those who consider the animal an agricultural pest , and those who believe it is a symbol of pioneer freedom
â the story of these wild horses unites people
we âve created a playground that brings to life everything we imagined as children
but behind the fantasy , each guest is preserving a symbol of america heritage , and a symbol of freedom , â as madeleine puts it
this place is a reminder of days when games of ' cowboys and indians ' were made possible by a bed - sheet tipi and faces streaked with lipstick
home free : some see wild mustangs as pests - but they are protected at this nevada retreat madeleine âs version of playtime is a surreal blend of high fashion and authentic ranch life
arriving at mustang monument â two hours drive from salt lake city and submerged within three mountain ranges â feels as though you are checking into the touristic lovechild of anna wintour and butch cassidy
candy - coloured hand - painted tipis , pioneer wagons and a cinnamon - coffee blend of migrating horses punctuate the brush
waking up on my first morning , a peachy glow floods through the painted canvas , a gentle way to greet the day and an unbelievable reminder that i slept in a tipi last night
( although , with its hardwood floors , leather armchairs , and luxuriant egyptian cotton and hand - made quilts , the transition to camping is hardly challenging , and , if canvas does nât appeal , guests can also stay in a sumptuous pioneer cottage
) we meet the famous mustangs at feeding time when hordes of wild horses bashfully approach our wagon , their velvety noses pushing through the hay bundles
listening to their satisfied snuffles and admiring their heavily lashed eyes , it âs hard to imagine how these placid beasts can be considered a nuisance
life under canvas : guests at mustang monument can opt to sleep in a luxury tipi we take off on regular saddle horses up spruce mountain led by clay nannini , who is riding a broken - in mustang
resident cowboy and rodeo champion , his spirit of adventure makes me feel i âm in dusty pursuit of a steam train hiding a gang of runaway bandits
the 21st century , ultra-luxe reality check arrives when madeleine meets our gang with a lunch of artisan sandwiches and homemade lemonade , taken under a canopy overlooking the valley
riding is by no means the only activity
there 's rifle shooting , lasso tutorials and archery under the guidance of former us navy seal monty heath
for the slightly less authentic - but seriously fun - wild west experience , there are dune buggies , abseiling and mountain biking
each day is book - ended by the saloon
its rustic exposed woods and card tables are lantern - lit for pre-dinner cocktails and exquisitely arranged canapÃ©s
no peanut shells or nightly brawls here ; just amber evenings filled with roaring chatter and witty anecdotes from the guides clay and monty
madeleine tells us over the crackling fire that the resort is expanding to include nights where guests can sleep under the stars
no walls , no electricity â just wilderness under the inky night sky
creature comforts : for those who prefer walls to tents , rustic cabins are also available in bringing freedom to mustangs in the wide - open spaces of america , madeleine is bringing freedom to her guests too ; as well as a slug of the old american dream
in this wifi-less zone , even the most driven ceos â and plenty come here , in their private helicopters , along with a dusting of hollywood a-listers , though they wo nât tell me who â cast off their shackles
children lose the playstations , iphones , and tvs and learn about archery , horse - riding and calf - roping , off - road vehicles , abseiling , and target shooting , or even learn to ride for the first time
the derelict gold mines and eerie ghost towns that are littered across the mountain ranges are evidence that the dream did nât last for everyone ; but in this case , a happy ending seems assured
