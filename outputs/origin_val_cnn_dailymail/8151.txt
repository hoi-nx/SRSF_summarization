american businessman josh harris , who owns nba side philadelphia 76ers and nhl 's new jersey devils , had been in talks to buy the premier league club
but steve parish believes there is no need for the south london club to sell up but is wary of the financial implications of commissioning new projects
crystal palace co-chairman steve parish said that the club are in no rush to sell up ' taking on commitments and building things is risky , ' he said
' you could lose a lot of money really quickly
people have lost hundreds of millions in this game in a year or two
' i could probably stay 20 years and i could get a new main stand and a new training ground and find a way of financing it every year
' but if you finance it , it puts the club at risk
if you get relegated , you 've got a project you 're committed to and suddenly your wage bill is bigger than your income
