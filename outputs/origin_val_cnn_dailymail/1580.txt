rangers supporters trust spokesman chris graham praised fans for the part they have played in forcing change at ibrox before warning them : ' the hard work starts now
' the rangers supporters trust and rangers first , another group aimed at fan ownership , had amassed almost 19,000 registered members between them going into friday 's egm
a combination of shares purchased by each organisation , using cash raised from that backing and from proxies , saw them hold around 10 per cent of the voting power at the meeting
rangers supporters trust fans gather outside ibrox stadium to hear news from the extraordinary general meeting rangers supporters trust spokesman chris graham has praised fans ' role in changing the club dave king ( centre ) received almost 86 per cent of the votes from rangers supporters trust shareholders for power at ibrox fans show their delight for the incoming rangers supporters trust board of dave king , john gilligan ( left ) and paul murray ( right ) chris graham is delighted the club 's followers have performed such a significant role in getting dave king , paul murray and john gilligan on to the board and overthrowing previous incumbents derek llambias and barry leach but insisted there is still much more to do
now he has urged supporters to keep investing in the two fan movements to ensure there is never a repeat of the financial turmoil experienced at rangers supporters trust in recent years
' the response to both schemes has been amazing and it has been crucial , not just in winning the egm but also in moving forward , ' he said
' it is important the fans want to have more of a shareholding in the club
i believe we can trust this board and i think they will run the club properly
' we do n't know what is going to happen in 10 years ' time , though , so it 's vital the fans have a big enough say to stop anything like we 've seen in the last three or four years from happening again
and if there is a new share issue i think it 's important they continue to up their shareholding to a more significant portion
' it has been brilliant seeing how people have risen to the challenge
the rangers supporters trust has been plugging away at this for 12 years while rangers first is a more recent thing
but , to be honest , it 's just great to see the fans getting behind the same objective , however they have chosen to do that
' what the supporters have done has been crucial in winning the vote and it will be crucial going forward
now it 's really important we get working as soon as possible
there will obviously be a couple of days of celebration but there 's going to be a huge rebuilding process at the club
' it has been ripped apart over the last few years so the priority is to get the hard work started straight away
some things can be done quickly and others will take a bit longer ' i can understand where kenny mcdowall was coming from when he said it is going to take five years to fix the club
i think he was talking there about the football infrastructure and things such as scouting and youth development take a long time to come through if you start doing them properly
a rangers supporters trust fan holds up a sign in protest against mike ashley , derek llambias and barry leach just 15 per cent of the club 's shareholders voted to keep llambias ( pictured , centre ) and barry leach at ibrox ' but dave king was right , too , in the sense that there are things you can do in the short - term which would immediately improve the situation
even just getting the fans back in the stadium is an improvement because there 's increased revenue from that alone
on the football side , appointing a new manager will be an improvement and we 'll possibly be able to bring in players in the summer who can improve the squad
' what matters most is there are guys in the boardroom now who actually care about the club
they are n't just there to feather their own nests and that 's the difference
' although derek llambias and barry leach are no longer on the board , they do remain employed by the club as chief executive and financial director respectively
severance deals must be struck and , although both men have dug their heels in this week , chris graham thinks it 's only a matter of time until they are driven out of the club
' barry leach and derek llambias can make it a little bit difficult in terms of getting them to leave and i 'm sure they will make it as hard as they can , ' he said
' they are obviously in this for themselves so they will try to get what they can out of the situation
' the sports direct contract is obviously something which still needs to be looked at and there are big question marks over how a lot of contracts came to be latterly
that will need to be examined pretty closely but i do n't think there is anything that 's insurmountable as long as the people in the boardroom want to get it fixed
that 's the big difference
there 's nothing the club ca n't do as long as everybody is pulling in the one direction
' tackling the influence of sports direct owner mike ashley ( pictured ) will be next on the rangers supporters trust fans ' agenda
