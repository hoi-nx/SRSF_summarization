ms catherine mcclennan says her job was later scrapped and she was pitted against two colleagues for another position
she took redundancy in february last year and now has a new job helping to improve nhs maternity services
she argued this was discrimination and an employment tribunal in liverpool ruled in her favour this month
ms catherine mcclennan , 43 , said : ' the tuc needs to start practising what it preaches
' the tuc should be an exemplar employer but that could n't be further from the truth in my case
' the tuc , which represents 54 british trade unions and campaigns for better workplace rights , denied it had discriminated against ms catherine mcclennan
but with backing from trade union unite , ms catherine mcclennan took the tuc to court for maternity discrimination â leading to a five - day hearing at liverpool civil and family court this month

she said : ' when i returned i was marginalised and sidelined
i had to fight for my responsibilities back
' before my maternity leave i was on an upward trajectory but when i came back it was as if my whole career had been taken off me
i continued to complain but absolutely nothing was done about it
' ms catherine mcclennan says her job was later scrapped and she was pitted against two colleagues for another position

ms catherine mcclennan says her job at the liverpool offices ( pictured ) was later scrapped and she was pitted against two colleagues for another position
she took redundancy in february last year and now has a new job helping to improve nhs maternity services she said : ' i felt i was forced out
employers should support women who come back from maternity leave but instead i was sidelined and they tried to cover this up
' coming back after having a child is hard enough without being subjected to discrimination
what happened is a great shame and was incredibly stressful
' i have daughters and nieces so i felt this was a case i had to fight for the sake of future generations
' ms catherine mcclennan 's solicitor steve pinder , head of employment law at liverpool - based ead solicitors , said : ' this case shows women who take maternity leave are still subject to difficult working conditions and still struggle to get their jobs back
' when catherine mcclennan went back to work there was a complete absence of any plan to get her back into the workplace and she spent over a year trying to get her job back
' a tuc spokesman said : ' we vigorously contested this case but the tribunal has made an award for injury to feelings even though there was no malicious or conscious attempt to discriminate
' the tuc recently published a report called the pregnancy test : ending discrimination at work for new mothers , which advised women how to cope with returning to work from maternity leave
it warned that women may face changes on their return , including having been effectively demoted while they were away , and called for an end to discrimination of working mothers
it said : ' employers must learn lessons from pregnancy and maternity discrimination cases brought against them
' at the moment , about half of employers fail to implement any changes following a finding of discrimination
' therefore , tribunals must have the power to make recommendations that an employer change their practice to protect other women from similar treatment
' these recommendations must be enforceable against the employer
