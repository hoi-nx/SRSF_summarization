during her career there has never been a dull moment
she has assisted at the births of two babies born in hospital car parks and has even had two children named after her
' it 's a lovely compliment and one that midwives love , ' kathleen mcsherry said
she 's delivered too many twins to mention and has also delivered countless children and grandchildren of the children she 's brought into the world
' you can plan to have your baby in hospital but they often have minds of their own and arrive at the least expected time , ' she said
' they set the agenda and there is little you can do when a determined baby decides it 's time to be born
' the most magical moment in kathleen mcsherry 's career was being at the birth of two of her grandchildren she also had a surprise delivery of her own when she was forced to advise husband jim , 67 , a retired firefighter , what to do when she went into labour with their fourth child katey
' it was five in the morning when i woke up in labour and jim ushered our older kids , pauline , then nine , paul , seven , and ashley two , into the kitchen with breakfast cereal and told them to stay there , ' she remembers
' i knew this baby was n't waiting , so we called an ambulance hoping i would make it to the queen mother 's hospital about four miles away
' it was a blizzard outside and i hoped it would arrive in time
' the midwife flying squad was also called - but our wee girl arrived before they got here - and jim had to do the honours
' i was at one end issuing instructions to jim , hoping all was going well down at his end
' being a midwife helped , as did having three babies previously ! ' the most magical moment of her career was being at the delivery of two grandchildren
her daughters pauline , now 44 , and ashley , 35 , wanted their mum by their sides as they gave birth
' pauline had a wee boy , dale , in 1994 , and it was magic supporting her throughout the labour , ' kathleen mcsherry remembers
' i was thrilled being allowed to assist my second daughter , ashley 's wee boy , matthew , into the world in 2009
the saddest moments in kathleen mcsherry 's career has been when couples have lost babies after years of trying ' i put my hands on her baby when he came out and broke the news to my daughters both times that they 'd had boys
' you worry so much more when your daughter is pregnant and in labour
that 's mainly because you know what mums have to endure
' people say it 's just childbirth but they do n't call it labour for nothing
. it 's exhausting and takes women to the limit of endurance
' but being a midwife has brought heartache too
' the saddest have been couples who lost babies after years of trying , ' she adds
' your heart goes out to them
it is the hardest challenge for any midwife
' it 's been a family career for kathleen mcsherry as her mum , mary , was a nurse during the war and her sister moira , 68 , took the same path
' i grew up with mum being a nurse and she worked through some really hard times during the war
' she never complained once about the long hours on old nightingale wards
' in fact , she was a great role model for us
' none of kathleen mcsherry 's children have followed her into midwifery , though
' there are so many other career options open to women , ' she says
daughter katey , 33 , an asda section leader , said : ' it 's very impressive how long she 's been a midwife
' she is one of the longest serving in scotland
' kathleen mcsherry 's bosses , nhs greater glasgow and clyde are sad to see her leave
evelyn frame , head of midwifery at nhs greater glasgow and clyde , said : ' kathleen mcsherry has dedicated her life to delivering babies and supporting new mums and we wish her all the very best on her retirement
