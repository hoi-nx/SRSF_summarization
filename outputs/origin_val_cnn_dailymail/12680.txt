for four years , james called the oklahoma 's sigma alpha epsilon his home
he walked its halls , bunked in its rooms , held office as one of its leaders , considered his fraternity brothers his dearest friends
he was proud to be sigma alpha epsilon
now that pride is tainted
a video shot this saturday of party - bound shows sigma alpha epsilon members clapping , pumping their fists and chanting in unison : " there will never be a ni * * * * sigma alpha epsilon , " they sing
" you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me
" these young men are talking about him , james said
that 's because not only is he an sigma alpha epsilon alumni , he is also african-american
how do you make sense of the fact that those behind these hateful words wore the same pledge pins , occupied the same house , preached " the same motto that i hold dear to my heart " as james did ? " i could n't look at myself , " he said , " still claiming to be that
" since the video surfaced sunday , students have been expelled and sigma alpha epsilon 's oklahoma chapter has shut down
the episode has left james disgusted , horrified that members of a fraternity that once welcomed him could espouse such hatred
students expelled over racist chant " i do n't know what happened to the culture of my home , " he told cnn on tuesday
" that is not my home
they are not my brothers
" while the oklahoma frat has never had a lot of black members , that did n't matter to james when he joined in 2001
sigma alpha epsilon was where he forged lifelong friendships , where he and others grew into men
" we were becoming something while i was there , " he said
" something that i do n't think these kids grasped
... i do n't think they know what it means to be a brother of any fraternity , let alone mine
" james does n't believe the racist chant was an isolated incident , not given how many on the bus seemingly sang it so easily and enthusiastically
nor does he think that only those leading the chant deserve punishment
just as easily as one person could have started it , someone else could have called for it to stop
that 's what james thinks that his own fraternity brothers would 've done , whether he was around or not
they understood the importance of stepping up to say : " this is n't right , this is n't what i stand for , this is n't gentlemanly , this is n't even human , " he said
" that 's what being an sigma alpha epsilon is
" " my pledge class ... would n't let that happen , " he said
" and i do n't know what 's happened to ( the sigma alpha epsilon chapter ) since then
" many members of that pledge class , as well others who he knew from sigma alpha epsilon , have reached out to james in recent days by text , phone , email and facebook
he knows he is not alone , including in his support for disbanding oklahoma 's sigma alpha epsilon chapter
" that entire house has accepted the culture that accepts that song , those words , that imagery , " james said
" so the whole house has to be punished
" his former frat brothers are different from him , of course
their skin color would n't have stopped them from getting into sigma alpha epsilon if the twisted chant reflected reality
still , james feels their pain is real and sincere
those on this weekend 's video may not be his brothers , but those he knew from 2001 to 2005 still are
" i do n't think that they can fully encompass the pain and betrayal that i feel , " james said of his white friends from the fraternity
" but by holding me so close in their life , they know that their brother was hurt
" " so it 's a thing they 're feeling in their family
i 'm family to them
