manchester united manager louis van gaal has revealed his time in charge at old trafford will be his last in football
van gaal and his players head to liverpool on sunday in an attempt to solidify their current position in the top four of the barclays premier league
and the dutchman has revealed his attempt to bring glory back to manchester united will be his final challenge in the game
louis van gaal has announced manchester united will be his last job before he retires from the game van gaal told the telegraph : ' i am old
this is my last job
' i have to pay attention to my kids , my grandchildren but also to my wife
now i can not pay that attention
i was not at the birthday of my grandson for example
i do n't like it
' we have to qualify for the european cup and we have many tests next year
that also develops the level of your team , and of course how many players can come in to improve our selection
' van gaal has not had everything his own way in his first season in english football but already believes he has identified two future managers in his squad
the former ajax boss won the european cup with the dutchman giants against ac milan back in 1995 the dutchman took charge of his national side at the 2012 world cup in brazil where they impressed van gaal ( left ) was boss at barcelona alongside ronald koeman and jose mourinho ( fourth left ) in 1999 ' rooney is very open to learn , ' he said
i do n't know if he speaks with his wife coleen about football , i do n't think so
' but we have the process of talking here
most of my players of my selection are open and that 's very nice
' michael carrick is more or less a trainer - coach
he is also willing to talk about shapes and systems
the manchester united boss intends to finish victorious before his spell at the ' biggest club in the world ' comes to an end ' that 's nice
not every player is very open and then you have to convince him , and then you get a struggle
it works or it does n't work
also give me time to do it
' i am the most flexible manager you can imagine
when the players are coming with good arguments , i change my opinion
' manchester united head to anfield on sunday having finally abandoned the three - man defensive system that attracted so much debate earlier in the season
despite using it all through pre-season and in to the competitive campaign , van gaal now claims he has settled on a more effective shape
' i ask also the players which system they want to play , ' van gaal revealed
' and then i ask individual players : ' what 's your favourite position ? ' ' first they do n't want to answer but now they are more open , and they answer
' the fans are shouting it ( 4 - 4 - 2 )
i have played it but that was to do with accidental circumstances
the system we play now is the system that i prefer , that i have played everywhere
the system against tottenham last weekend is my preferred system
' when it is needed , then i play with five at the back
tottenham was 4 - 3 - 3 when we had the ball
when we defend it was more 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 yesterday
the next game is different
