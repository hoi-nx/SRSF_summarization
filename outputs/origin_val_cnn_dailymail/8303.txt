de bruyne or cesc fabregas ? jose mourinho knows who he 'd choose
the chelsea boss made a brave decision when he shipped the former off to wolfsburg , basing the spine of his team on Â£ 30million man cesc fabregas
but could it have been the wrong choice ? this season , de bruyne has racked up more goals and more assists than cesc fabregas , while jose mourinho 's current midfield maestro searches desperately for his first goal since december
de bruyne has scored more goals and assisted more than cesc fabregas has this season cesc fabregas ( centre ) has not scored a goal for chelsea since mid-december , while de bruyne is impressing de bruyne is in the process of establishing himself as one of the biggest talents in the bundesliga , helping wolsburg cement their place in the top echelons of germany football
typically , the pair play in slightly different positions
cesc fabregas is more suited to a defensive midfield role , while de bruyne roams further forward
despite this , for Â£ 30m you would expect cesc fabregas to be firing on all cylinders , chipping in with more goals than he has been
de bruyne was signed for just shy of Â£ 7m in 2012 , but mostly consigned to a place on the stamford bridge bench , starting just two premier league games in two years at the club
he was criminally underused in the league , especially if this season 's stats hint at his ability
19 assists to cesc fabregas ' 18 , 13 goals to cesc fabregas ' four
indeed , it is the goal count that is most worrying for chelsea
de bruyne was sold to wolfsburg , and has scored 13 goals in the bundesliga this season for chelsea , de bruyne was only given two starting places in the premier league in two years cesc fabregas was stifled against psg in the champions league on wednesday was jose mourinho right to sell de bruyne ? was jose mourinho right to sell de bruyne ? now share your opinion they have not been desperate for scorers , admittedly - diego costa and eden hazard have that covered - but their side could surely have been improved with the talents of the belgian midfielder
at the start of the 2013/14 season , de bruyne was given a fleeting chance to impress , before the door slammed shut on his chelsea career
his final two starts in the premier league
as assist for oscar , and an impressive performance that warranted praise from gary neville
' the surprise of the season , ' he was tipped as
following that , he was entrusted with a place in the starting xi against manchester united
60 minutes , zero goals , zero assists
and from there , zero starts
his only further premier league appearance came against fulham a month later
five minutes at the end , when the game was already won
he was shipped out on loan to werder bremen in january , where he impressed
perhaps it was the change of surroundings , perhaps slightly easier opposition , but germany rivals wolfsburg later decided that his performances were enough to be worthy of Â£ 18m
he scored 10 goals in 33 appearances on loan in germany , and has continued where he left off this season
a brace against inter milan on thursday is his latest story of success
wolfsburg are now in a commanding position in their europa league last 16 tie , and that is mainly thanks to de bruyne
when he was n't scoring , he was setting them up , and he earned deserved praise from all corners
de bruyne 's european week was far more impressive , as he scored twice against inter milan jose mourinho has impressed in charge at chelsea , but may be ruing his decision to let de bruyne go cesc fabregas , on the other hand , could not do the same against psg
another level of competition , yes , but it is worth considering whether de bruyne would have been able to make an impact
stifled by marco verratti and thiago motta , the spain international was largely anonymous
there is no questioning jose mourinho 's eye for talent
he has produced them time and time again , but everyone makes mistakes
de bruyne may not have impressed week in , week out in a chelsea shirt , but he was only 20 years old when he joined
three years later , he has matured into an impressive footballer
still baby - faced , but far from it with the ball at his feet
cesc fabregas ( right ) and his team - mates look dejected after conceding against psg in the champions league a baby - faced de bruyne in action against singha thailand all - star xi during a 2013 pre-season game
