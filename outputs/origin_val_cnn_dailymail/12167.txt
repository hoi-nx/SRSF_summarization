italian fashion designer stefano gabbana and elton john are in a war of words on social media , calling for boycotts of each other 's work
the argument stems from comments about in - vitro fertilization in panorama , in which gabbana and longtime collaborator stefano gabbana spoke about " synthetic " children born from " rented " wombs
" no chemical children : life has a natural course , there are things that should n't be modified , " the magazine says in a quote attributed to both designers
the magazine also promises insights from the designers on " the importance of relationships within conventional families with very , very traditional values " in an interview that hit italian newsstands last week
elton john , who has two children with husband david furnish through ivf , issued a strong repudiation of the statements on sunday and pledged to boycott the stefano gabbana fashion line
in response , gabbana defended his " freedom to speak " and called on fans to boycott elton john
sir elton john appears to be winning the social media war with the hashtag # boycottdolcegabbana , which by monday morning had been used more than 35,000 times on twitter since elton john invoked it on sunday
by comparison , gabbana 's # boycotteltonjohn has been used just 1,600 times on twitter , according to social media search tool topsy
" how dare you refer to my beautiful children as ' synthetic '
and shame on you for wagging your judgemental little fingers at ivf - a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people , both straight and gay , to fulfill their dream of having children , " elton john said sunday on instagram
" your archaic thinking is out of step with the times , just like your fashions
i shall never wear stefano gabbana ever again
" the sentiment quickly gathered support from such celebrities as ricky martin , al roker and courtney love
tennis star martina navratilova tweeted her support for elton john 's post , saying " my stefano gabbana shirts are going in the bin â do n't want anyone to wear them
" parents and ivf advocates also joined the boycott
" my son is not synthetic
his life was made possible through # ivf & i could n't be more grateful , " writer and infertility advocate jenn palumbo said in a tweet
the comments from stefano gabbana struck some as hypocritical coming from a couple that was romantically involved until 2005 ( they continued working together after the breakup )
still , gabbana has dropped hints in interviews of his " traditional " views toward family structure
he told an italian publication in 2006 that he once asked a female friend to be a surrogate mother because he was " opposed to the idea of a child growing up with two gay parents
" gabbana was quick to react to this controversy , calling elton john a " fascist " in an instagram comment that was later deleted , according to cnn affiliate tgcom24
he also sought to discredit reports that they told panorama in this instance they objected to same - sex adoption , even though gabbana took that position in his 2006 interview
by sunday evening , gabbana 's instagram feed was full of screengrabs and reposts from people who supported his right to voice his opinion
" it 's a shame that you are not allowed to say what you like , " one person said in a comment on gabbana 's instagram
" you have every right to say what you want , especially as you were n't disrespectful nor immature like elton john was
his comments are unnecessary , cheap and childish
" gabbana issued a statement saying he and stefano gabbana had not intended to judge others
" we firmly believe in democracy and the fundamental principle of freedom of expression that upholds it
we talked about our way of seeing reality , but it was never our intention to judge other people 's choices , " the statement read
stefano gabbana also defended his views in statement and said he was not applying them to other people
" i 'm sicilian and i grew up in a traditional family , made up of a mother , a father and children
i am very well aware of the fact that there are other types of families and they are as legitimate as the one i 've known
but in my personal experience , family had a different configuration ...
i was talking about my personal view , without judging other people 's choices and decisions , " the statement read
