true meaning of easter : the eggs were backed by archbishop of york john sentamu , who is urging the supermarkets to rethink supermarkets have been accused of pursuing an â anti- christian agenda â after refusing to sell easter eggs with a religious message
some of britain âs biggest stores are celebrating the most profound event in the church calendar by offering treats featuring everything from darth vader to postman pat â but turned down products that mention jesus
one chain even asked â what has easter got to do with the church ? â , according to the makers of real easter egg , which features christian crosses on the box and contain a leaflet telling the story of the resurrection
now archbishop of york john sentamu has stepped in â urging sainsbury âs , asda and the co-op to stock the charity eggs â while former archbishop of canterbury george carey said he was â saddened â by the three supermarket giants â decision
george carey said : â the rest are rubbish
these easter eggs that have nothing to do with easter , all they are trying to do is get more money out of people
i think it shows ignorance on the part of these supermarkets
â by not offering an alternative to secular easter eggs they are really undermining the real message of easter
it saddens me because we are living in a land that is completely losing contact with its religious roots and is out of touch with the christian message
â david marshall , the head of the meaningful chocolate company , said the supermarkets appeared biased against its â proven seller â
he said : â we do wonder at times if there is an anti-christian agenda from some of our supermarkets who just keep turning it down
it is as if some feel christian is politically incorrect or the easter story , which mentions jesus , might put people off
â one buyer asked us what easter had got to do with the church , while another simply said , â i do nât think this is a credible product â and asked us to leave
â the warrington - based firm has spent five years trying to persuade stores to sell its Â£ 4 christian - themed eggs , which were launched in 2010 with the backing of john sentamu
at first the supermarkets refused , but two years ago , tesco , morrisons , sainsbury âs , waitrose and the co-op bowed to pressure and agreed
but this year sainsbury âs and the co-op have dropped the eggs , blaming poor sales , while asda has never stocked them
however , the meaningful chocolate company say a million eggs have been sold over the past five years
' poor sales ' : sainsbury 's and co-op have cited poor sales as the reason they dropped the real easter eggs , while asda said it has not be approached by the makers of the egg archbishop john sentamu , who has lamented ignorance about easter after learning that a third of children thought it marked the birthday of the easter bunny , said yesterday : â with a million real easter eggs sold i am delighted that morrisons , tesco and waitrose have met the challenge
i call on sainsbury âs , asda , and the co-operative to give their customers the same choice
â sainsbury âs said their decision was based on â the popularity of ranges in previous years â , with the co-op also citing â poor sales of the real easter egg in previous years â
asda said it had not been approached this year , a claim disputed by the meaningful chocolate company .
