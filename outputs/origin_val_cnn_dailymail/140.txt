these pictures of botched tattoos may make you think before you get inked
luckily for the unfortunate few who have been left with inking mishaps , there are talented artists out there who can work miracles
lal hardy , a tattooist at new wave studios , london , is tasked with turning disaster pieces into masterpieces
lal hardy has shared some of the cover - ups he 's most proud of and proves that with a bit of handiwork and a lot of experience , dodgy tattoos can be given a new lease of life
' personally , i am brutally honest with people regarding cover - ups
if i think it ca n't be covered i tell the client , the same if i think they have unrealistic expectations as to how a tattoo can be covered
i now only take on cover - ups or reworks that i feel will work
' four of lal hardy 's most prized cover - ups include a lion design that was transformed from some squiggles into a fierce inking
lal hardy says he transforms ' plain bad ' ones , adds to some - like this seemingly unfinished lion tattoo - or makes dated ones more modern more straightforward renovations include a robin playing card , left , which lal hardy re-vamped by changing it into a sparrow and adding a border , right speaking about the renovation work , he said : ' the lion was done by an amateur artist and because it was only partially done , it was possible to salvage it and cover it up
' he also worked his magic on a faded design by transforming it into a bold and colourful rose
another botched design he fixed was a faded monroe inking
' the cover up worked because the client researched a design he wanted , his original monroe was faded and the new design had lots of detail and shading so lent itself well to a cover up , ' said lal hardy
he also worked his magic on this faded design by transforming it into a bold and colourful rose , right more straightforward renovations include a robin playing card , which lal hardy re-vamped by changing it into a sparrow and adding a border to give a splash of colour to the new piece
' the cover - up process depends on various factors like the size of the tattoo , how faded it is and the density of the dark pigments in it as darker colours are harder to cover , ' he explained
' the amount of clear skin around it is also a consideration as this can open up the opportunity to incorporate the cover - up in a bigger piece
the placement of the tattoo on the body can also be a major factor in whether or not a cover up can be done
