but not quite so many at one time
three major characters -- superman , wonder woman ( both of dc comics , a time warner company , like cnn ) and archie -- came out with new looks ( and costumes in two cases ) thursday
superman and wonder woman are no stranger to change over time , but these are pretty different from what we 're used to
wonder woman is back to wearing pants ( similar to her style circa 2010 , not to mention a brief time in the 1970s ) along with something of a turtleneck and body armor
superman looks the most casual that we 've ever seen him , simply in a t - shirt and jeans , and decidedly shorter hair
he also looks like someone you might not want to come across in a dark alley
as for archie ( who never really died , by the way ) , he 's getting ready for his promised tv show by debuting a modern look -- one that makes it much easier to see why betty and veronica have been fighting for his affections all of these years
it 's been a whirlwind time for comic book fans , and there will be a lot to get used to .
