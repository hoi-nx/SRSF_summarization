as course demelza suggestively asked poldark to help unfasten her dress , it was the steamy love scene fans had been waiting for
but while most of the drama âs huge audience of viewers were transfixed by the unfolding romance , some were left scratching their heads with the question â how did she put on the gown in the first place without assistance ? the strong - willed servant , played by eleanor tomlinson , 22 , told aidan turner âs poldark that she needed his help to remove the dress as it undid from the back
however , it was never explained how , this being the case , she had squeezed into the outfit unaided in the first place
with no sense of time passing , other viewers expressed puzzlement at how quickly the story was progressing , with course demelza marrying poldark just minutes after they first kissed on screen
also , elizabeth , the other object of poldark âs brooding affections , gave birth just one episode after dramatically announcing she was pregnant
despite these minor concerns the vast majority of the audience still seem enthralled by the cornish - set adventure , based on the novels by winston graham
just as the original 1970s series turned robin ellis into a global sex symbol , the hunky aidan turner , 31 , is fast becoming the nation âs new favourite heartthrob
pillow talk : fans of the bbc1 drama took to twitter during the episode to joke it had been a clever ploy to lure poldark between the sheets morning after : last weekend âs episode attracted 6.2million viewers , thanks in part to regular glimpses of the cornish hero 's toned torso viewing figures have been consistently impressive , with last weekend âs episode attracting 6.2million viewers and each of the first three instalments of the eight - part breaking the six million mark
but with such large audiences it becomes difficult to please everyone and the show has found some fans poking fun at it online
after course demelza and poldark spent the night together , one tweeted : â enjoying poldark great chemistry between aidan turner and eleanor tomlinson - but how did course demelza get the dress done up ? ! â while another added : â okay course demelza i get it you need help getting your dress off * wink wink * but how exactly did you do it up in the first place ? â a third joked : â re 
as a costume fairy , i have to ask , if she needed help getting out of the dress ... who got her into the dress [ sic ]
â other viewers seemed fazed by the pace of the script
fans pointed out that barely ten minutes elapsed between the scenes where poldark first kissed course demelza and the pair tying the knot on screen
others were left bemused that elizabeth , played by heida reed , revealed she was pregnant at the end of the second episode and then gave birth during the third

though if you are pregnant in poldark times expect to have it in the next 10 minutes
â complaints have previously been raised about the make - up in the programme
some have claimed that poldark âs scar , a souvenir from his time fighting in the american war of independence , looks like mascara or hair dye running down his face
others have pointed to demezla appeared to be wearing perfect make up , despite having just escaped crushing poverty
a spokesman for the poldark production team said : â of course demelza could have got the dress off by herself ! ! ! but why the hell would she want to ? â
