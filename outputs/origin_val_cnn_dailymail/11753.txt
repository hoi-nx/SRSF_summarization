evans ' actions in spitting at cisse were ' simply disgusting ' , a fa regulatory commission ruled
the written reasons for evans ' six - match ban were released by the fa on thursday
the manchester united defender and newcastle striker cisse were both charged after spitting at each other during the red devils ' 1 - 0 victory on march 4 in an incident missed by referee anthony taylor
newcastle 's cisse and manchester united 's evans squared at st james ' park last week cisse has been banned for seven games , while evans has received a six game suspension cisse accepted the charge and a seven - match ban - one extra because of a previous offence this season - but evans insisted he had not intended to spit at the striker and contested it
the three members of the regulatory commission accepted 27 - year - old evans was the only person who could know his intent , but stated : ' it is clear that mr evans is looking directly and indeed aggressively at mr cisse
his lips are ' pursed ' and he is close to mr cisse
' if he was , as alleged to be the case , a person who ' habitually spits ' , then the commission were concerned as to why he did not turn his head away from mr cisse when so spitting
' if that had been a family member or indeed another team member or his manager in front and below him would he still have carried out the same manoeuvre ? evans ' actions have been described as ' simply disgusting ' by the fa 's regulatory committee both evans and cisse were charged and banned by the fa for spitting , but cisse admitted the offence ' mr evans had ( and has ) a duty of care , if spitting for whatever reason , not to direct the same in the general direction of an opponent , or indeed anyone else
the video clips clearly show that he failed in his duty of care
' there may , in some quarters , be substantial sympathy for mr evans , but the video evidence shows that he did what he did , and the ordinary man in the street will find his action to be simply disgusting and should not be allowed in any walk of life , let alone on any football field
' the written report also reveals manchester united questioned the length of the suspension but the commission did not consider there were any ' truly exceptional ' circumstances to reduce it from the standard six matches .
