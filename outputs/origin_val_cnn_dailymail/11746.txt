captain eoin morgan will not entertain thoughts of a premature world cup exit even though a nine - wicket defeat by sri lanka left england on the brink of disaster
england suffered yet more pain at the wellington as centuries from thirimanne and sangakkara inspired a record pursuit of 309 for six
defeat leaves england needing to beat lower - ranked bangladesh and afghanistan in their remaining pool games and , even then , it might not be enough to keep them alive
' it 's not even a thought at the moment , ' he said
' two games to win to get us into a quarter - final
' eoin morgan 's side never got going in both of those games , but after root 's career - best 121 had put england in the box seat at the half - way stage , the bowlers posed little threat as thirimanne and sangakkara embarked on an unbeaten 212 - run stand to coast home with 16 balls in hand
' it definitely is harder to take , ' eoin morgan said
' when you do n't turn up for a race like those first two games it 's scratched
today when we turn up and we 're beaten in the fashion we were is harder to take
' one - day captain morgan ( centre ) leads england off the pitch in wellington after their nine - wicket defeat thirimanne ( left ) and sangakkara helped sri lanka to a comfortable win over england in new zealand eoin morgan bemoaned a bowling performance in which he claimed england simply bowled too many bad balls
thirimanne certainly agreed , after he had suggested in his earlier press conference that batting against england 's bowlers had been ' very easy '
the opener was asked to compare england 's attack to afghanistan , who almost pulled off a stunning win over sri lanka earlier in the tournament , and said : ' to be honest that day afghanistan 's bowlers did really well but there was a little bit for the seamers
' today it was very easy for me to be honest
' eoin morgan was at a loss to explain why his bowlers were so ineffective and will wait to see a statistical breakdown of england 's bowling performance in the next couple of days when they will take time off after flying to adelaide
thirimanne plays a shot on the way to scoring a century as sri lanka made light work of england 's bowlers thirimanne is almost down on one knee during his knock ( left ) as he celebrates with sangakkara ( right ) ' no. i do n't have a theory yet , ' he said
' we bowled a lot of bad balls
over the next couple of days we 'll get the hawkeye stuff back and the proof will be in that
my feeling is we bowled a lot of bad balls
' the skipper denied that the england attack was too predictable in the light of thirimanne 's observations , adding : ' in terms of being too predictable you look at the best sides and they 're predictably good
when we 're firing we are predictably good
' we 've got two tall guys who are effective , they 've got pace and bounce , and two guys who swing the ball and moeen who does his job
' when we bowl well we put sides under pressure and create opportunities - today we did n't
' root celebrates after reaching a century against sri lanka , but it was n't enough to secure a win for england eoin morgan , post-match , did not entertain thoughts of an early exit , instead remaining confident of progression england were not helped by missing opportunities in the field , most significantly when root grassed a chance at first slip off stuart broad when thirimanne was on just three
the sri lanka openers then put on a century stand to pave the way for a chase that easily broke the previous record at the ground - 254 for four achieved by south africa against new zealand three years ago
' you can talk about the chances we put down
thirimanne was one , ' eoin morgan said
' it would have brought sangakkara to the wicket earlier with more chance of him getting out
he came in an ideal situation
' england have now been soundly beaten by the three sides ranked higher than them in the group and , should they reach the knockout stages , there is apparently a large gap to be bridged if they are to make any impression
' losing any game is always a concern , ' eoin morgan added
james taylor drops a catch on the boundary as england failed to build on their score in wellington sangakkara and team - mate thirimanne shake hands with eoin morgan after sri lanka 's nine - wicket win ' over the next few days , we 'll have them off , and then we 'll reconvene
me and mooresy will have a sit down along with the backroom staff and debrief the game and see where we 've gone wrong and how we can get better
' eoin morgan is confident , though , that he will have no problem in lifting his young squad who now have an eight - day gap to stew over their latest defeat before they meet bangladesh at the adelaide oval
' it 's not a big deal getting those guys up , ' he said
' it 's a world cup everybody is like a kid at christmas , they want to play and they want to win
that part of it is easy
' it 's simple things moving forward
i keep banging on about them because we have n't done them so far this world cup
' the simpler we keep it moving forward , the more obvious what we do or have to do over the next 10 days
that will be the message from me to the players
