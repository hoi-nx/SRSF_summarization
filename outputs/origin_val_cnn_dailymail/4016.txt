liverpool are the biggest english club when measured solely by the number of major trophies won , all - time
with 18 league titles , seven fa cups , eight league cups , five european cups and three uefa cups , they have lifted 41 major honours in their history , two more than their closest rivals in this regard , united , who have 39
united have more league titles , 20 , and 13 of those have been won since liverpool âs last league title in 1989 - 90
they also have more fa cup wins than liverpool ( 11 ) , but fewer league cups ( four ) , fewer european cups ( three ) and fewer other european trophies ( one , the cup-winners cup of 1990 - 91 )
the silverware has been totted up as part of a sportsmail study to explore which english clubs are the â biggest â ; 59 different teams of the current 92 in the top four divisions have been considered , having played in england âs top division for at least a season
john barnes and peter beardsley celebrate in 1990 with the last league trophy to head to liverpool steven gerrard hoists old big ears aloft after that famous night in istanbul crowds we ranked all clubs on the size of their average gates during this season to reflect contemporary pull
then we ranked each club by the size of their biggest historic gates
their overall crowd rank is an aggregate of current pull and also potential based on past highs
global fanbase we added up the total number of fans and followers for each club on facebook and twitter â by far the most popular global social media platforms
every club has official accounts
trophies we counted â major â trophies won by each club , giving points for each ; 10pts for each european cup / european cup win , 8pts for each top - division english title , 5pts for each fa cup or other european trophy win , and 3pts for each league cup win
no â one - off â trophies such as the charity shield are considered because they are not the product of multi-match competitions
and being a losing finalist does not count for points either â here at sportsmail , winning is everything , second is nowhere
average league finish the average league finish position for each of the clubs since 1888 - 89
player quality we counted the number of players from each club who have played for england , all - time , ranking the clubs by total
this reflects historic â bigness â
we then ranked the clubs by the number of players provided to the 2014 world cup â a measure of modern â bigness â
the overall ranking is an aggregate of these two
income we ranked the clubs by their income for the most recent season available
the biggest clubs have generally had the most money and been able to buy and pay the best players
the trophies considered as â major â are those earned through playing a whole season , tournament or competition , so no â one - off match â silverware has been included , such as the charity shield or super cup , nor have we counted silverware won in events that have ever been â one - off match â occasions - like the intercontinental cup , which morphed into the club world cup
some trophies are bigger than others ; few would disagree a league title is more impressive than an fa cup , or that a european cup is bigger than a league cup
so we have weighted the trophies , awarding 10 points for each european cup , eight for each league title , five for an fa cup or other european trophy and three for each league cup win
in fact when the clubs are ranked 1 to 59 on total trophy wins without weighting , the order is very similar to the order when weightings have been applied
liverpool stay at no1 for example ahead of united , themselves clear of arsenal ( 28 trophies ) in third , villa ( 20 ) in fourth and chelsea ( also 20 ) in fifth
when clubs have the same number of trophies the total points are used to separate them
villa and chelsea have both won a european cup but villa âs seven league titles to chelsea âs four made the difference between that pair
when the points are the same , the club with the higher number of most important trophies are ranked higher
the full rankings of the â biggest â clubs by trophies accompany this piece
of the 59 teams in our study , 46 of them have won at least one major trophy
the 12 that have nât are ranked by how closely they have come , for example as runners - up in the fa cup ( which is as close as crystal palace , fulham and hull among others have come ) , runners - up in the league cup ( oldham ) and then by the highest position they ever achieved in the top division
after the top five trophy winners come everton and tottenham in sixth and seventh places , everton ahead on points because their nine league titles , the last of them in 1986 - 87 , are far superior to tottenham âs two titles , the second and last in 1960 - 61
spurs are more cup specialists , having won eight fa cups , four league cups and three cups in europe , albeit not the european cup
manchester city , newcastle and sunderland fill out the top 10 places , with rankings 10 to 20 dominated by former premier league teams , among them blackburn , wolves , nottingham forest , sheffield wednesday , leeds , huddersfield , sheffield united , portsmouth and preston among them , all of who have won the english title at least once and all of whom have won between four and 10 major trophies in their histories
bolton in 23rd place are the highest - ranked club never to have won the title , and are 23rd courtesy of their four fa cup wins
they are a place above west ham , who have also never won the title and have won three fa cups
