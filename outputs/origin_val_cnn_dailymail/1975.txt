crocuses have also sprung up in the eight - acre field of the village of inkpen in berkshire - another sign of the changing of the seasons this week
but the newborn lambs are unlikely to see this season getting warmer yet as cold conditions continue throughout march , which is forecast to be drier in the second half of the month but with colder nights and frost
however , by easter sunday on april 5 the mercury is expected to reach 21c - around 8c above average for the time of year
this is likely to be caused by a build - up of higher pressure that will bring warmer and more settled conditions

the warmer than average weather is leading to hopes that uk could be on course for a hot dry summer .
