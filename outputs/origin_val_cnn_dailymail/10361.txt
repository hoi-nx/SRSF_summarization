since his rookie year in 2007 , rice said head injures were being taken more seriously , but admitted the culture is a tough one to change
' it âs just the way we âre brought up
i guess it âs the culture , ' rice said
' you feel like you have to be out there on the field
it âs the competition that âs instilled in you
you love it , you want to be out there , but it âs very important that you pay attention to what goes on when you get a concussion
' ' there are a lot of issues that stem from brain injuries and it 's not just professional athletes
this affects everybody , ' weatherford said
' a lot of my team - mates and a lot of close friends have dealt with concussions and the depression that comes with that , ' he added
more than 4,500 former players are suing the nfl over head injuries suffered during their careers
they are nearing to a settlement worth about $ 1billion ( Â£ 655m ) .
