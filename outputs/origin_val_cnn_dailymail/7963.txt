' rett syndrome syndrome is a rare chromosome condition that only affects girls
the disease usually strikes youngsters when they have learned to walk or talk
over time the disease drags a girl 's progression backwards so they lose their new skills and are left unable to communicate
most girls with rett syndrome syndrome reach adulthood but lose their motor skills
the syndrome is most often caused by a spontaneous genetic mutation and can occur in any family at any time
it affects around 1 in 12,000 live female births
there is no current treatment for the condition but there are hopes of finding a cure
the condition also affected coleen rooney 's little sister who died in january 2013
sufferers can live to their 40s and some have been known to live to their 70s
