a new first - time buyers â isa will mean those saving for a deposit will get Â£ 50 from the government for every Â£ 200 they put away
the help to isa was unveiled by the chancellor yesterday as a way to help thousands of young people on to the property ladder
set to be launched by banks and building societies this autumn , it will give a maximum bonus per saver of up to Â£ 3,000
this means that a young couple who jointly save Â£ 24,000 could get Â£ 6,000 from the government
it will give them Â£ 50 from the government for every Â£ 200 they put away groups of friends who buy together would also be able to take out one isa each and get additional bonuses
the scheme was hailed as a massive boost for first - time buyers , amid claims it could cut the average time taken to save for a deposit by up to a year
david , director at brokers london & country , said : â this is basically free money
â it will help combat the issue which really affects first - time buyers who complain that they can not save as quick as house prices are rising
â it is quite a large perk the government is paying
â the average britain first - time buyer currently pays around Â£ 150,000 for a home , putting down an average deposit of Â£ 25,000 , according to figures from the council of mortgage lenders
set to be launched by banks and building societies this autumn , it will give a maximum bonus per saver of up to Â£ 3,000
this means that a young couple who jointly save Â£ 24,000 could get Â£ 6,000 from the government in london , the typical price paid for a first home is Â£ 260,000
last year around 25,000 first - time buyers a month made it on to the property ladder , with an average income of Â£ 38,000
however , steep rises in house prices around the country â particularly in london and the south east â mean that it is becoming increasingly difficult for many to save the deposit needed

the original help to buy scheme , which has proved extremely popular , allows people to buy a home worth up to Â£ 600,000 with just a 5 per cent deposit
the government provides them with a loan â which is initially interest - free â to make up the rest of the down payment
around 45,000 buyers have benefited from the scheme so far
the new isa is the latest attempt by the government to help first - time buyers
the accounts will work like a traditional isa , with interest paid out by banks and building societies tax - free
they will be available to new account - holders for four years â but once opened there is no limit on how long someone can save for
savers can make an initial deposit of Â£ 1,000 when they open the isa , but after this can only pay in a maximum of Â£ 200 a month
a Â£ 50 bonus is then added by the treasury
the minimum bonus size is Â£ 400 , and the maximum is Â£ 3,000 â which would be payable on a balance of Â£ 12,000
the bonus is only paid out when someone buys their first home , and only applies to properties worth up to Â£ 450,000 in london and Â£ 250,000 elsewhere in the britain
savers must be 16 or over to open a help to buy isa they are individual accounts , meaning a group of four friends buying a home together could benefit from a total of Â£ 12,000 in government bonuses
official figures suggest around Â£ 2billion could be paid out in bonuses between now and 2020
britain âs biggest bank , lloyds banking group , estimated the bonus payouts could slash the average time it takes a first - time buyer to save a 5 per cent deposit from 37 months to 27
stephen noakes , the bank âs managing director of retail products , said : â we believe this provides a genuine solution to the challenge of raising a deposit
we know that this is the key barrier when trying to buy a first home
â this rewards positive savings behaviour and makes a real difference in helping young people get on to the property ladder faster
