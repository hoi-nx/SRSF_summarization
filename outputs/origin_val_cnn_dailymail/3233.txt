a burmese python 13 and a half feet long moved into a florida zoo yesterday
the jacksonville zoo and gardens newest exhibit featured some of the nation 's largest living snakes to celebrate it 's new 48 foot , life - sized replica of the prehistoric titanoboa snake - the heaviest and longest snake ever discovered
though it might have looked tiny next to its ancestor , the zoo 's burmese python was no small thing , clocking in at 112 pounds

a burmese python 13 and a half feet long made an appearance at the jacksonville zoo and gardens newest exhibit yesterday that featured some of the nation 's largest living snakes guests could take pictures and touch the 112 pound reptile
the burmese python can reach more than 17 feet and weigh 400 pounds maloney , the zoo 's deputy director of animal care and conservation , told daily mail online that the snake was ' pretty large ' for a burmese python but that she had a ' great temperament '
' she 's a nice snake and she 's gorgeous and a pretty thing as can be , ' he said , adding that her relaxed mood will make her great for school visits
maloney said the python is fed frozen rabbits that are thawed out
the zoo 's snakes are never fed live food in order to protect their safety
' its much easier for quality control , ' he said
' and live food , even rabbits , can severely bite the face of a snake
they 're also trying to avoid being dinner
' a rock python , an anaconda and an eastern diamondback rattlesnake , the largest rattlesnake and the heaviest venomous snake in the americas , have also moved into the exhibit
the burmese python is well - known in the state , where its hardly been harmless
a recent u.s. geological survey and national park service study found that there are 150,000 pythons in the everglades national park , according to the washington post
according to maloney , the leading theory is that the burmese python first came to the everglades in 1992 , after hurricane andrew blew through the state - and a pet breeding center
the exhibit was celebrating the zoo 's new 48 ft long , life - sized replica of the prehistoric titanoboa snake - the heaviest and longest snake ever discovered ' its believed either people could n't take care of them anymore , released them , or the hurricane destroyed the facilities and liberated the animals , ' maloney said
the burmese python has become what is known as an invasive species , wreaking havoc on the environment 's native species as they continue to spread
native to southeast asia , the python has quickly spread throughout the everglades as females can lay up to 100 eggs
the non-venomous snakes , who kill and eat their prey by constriction , have decimated the park 's mammal population , consuming more than 99 percent of raccoons and 88 percent of bobcats , according to the washington post
although pythons can reach more than 17 feet in length and weigh up to 400 pounds , they are not a major threat to humans
instead they 'd rather feast on small mammals and birds , but are known to eat deers and alligators as well
an eastern diamondback rattlesnake featured in the titanoboa exhibit , the largest rattlesnake
unlike the burmese python , which kills its prey by constriction , this rattlesnake is venomous more than 2,000 pythons have been removed from the everglades since 2002 , according to the u.s. national park service
pythons captured in the park are typically euthanized
maloney said the zoo , which carries a rock python that was caught in the everglades , tries to provide homes for wild snakes if they can - but there often is n't the space to house such large animals
and the snakes are n't easy to find
the national park service said trapping methods are often ineffective , meaning the reptiles must be detected and removed by search and hand
the state even hosted the ' florida python challenge ' , offering a reward to the team who captured and killed the most pythons in the month - long event
but for now , maloney said the zoo wants to celebrate snakes and their history
' we think of snakes as being positive members of the animal kingdom , ' he said
' we âre celebrating snakes by showcasing not only the big snakes living on the planet today but the biggest snake that ever existed
