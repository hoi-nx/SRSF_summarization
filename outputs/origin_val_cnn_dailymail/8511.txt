figures reveal vice-chancellors earned an average Â£ 260,000 last year mr cable said yesterday : â at a time when most university staff are seeing modest wage increases , if any at all , news of these large pay rises for university bosses will be hard to swallow
it would be wise for the sector to think twice before increasing vice-chancellors â salaries
â tuc general secretary frances oâgrady said : â soaraway pay at the top has been matched by zero - hours contracts and big real - wage falls for staff across higher education
â last year , ministers said they had serious concerns about the â substantial upward drift â of salaries and that university leaders should show â much greater restraint â
uk universities are independent institutions but they receive public grants , and students receive government loans to pay tuition fees
university asked 155 uk universities and colleges a series of questions about vice-chancellors â pay packages , including benefits and pensions , as well as money spent on air fares , hotel accommodation and personal expenses , for the year ending july 31 last year
around 16 per cent - 24 institutions - did not respond or cited exemptions and did not release the requested information
the findings show that the average overall salary package for university heads in 2013/14 was Â£ 260,290 based on data from 150 institutions
the average expenditure on flights for university leaders , with information from 128 universities , was Â£ 9,705.75
the most was spent by the lse ( lse ) , which paid out Â£ 59,811.14 on flights for director professor craig calhoun
overall just over two - thirds of air fares were for first or business class , university said , according to data from 114 universities

richard bullock , chairman of nottingham trent âs board of governors , said : â former vice-chancellor professor gorman received a 2 per cent salary pay rise in his final year as vice-chancellor
â the additional monies reported in this year âs financial accounts were paid under a scheme that was instigated in 2008 to operate over a five - year period
' this scheme was put in place by the board following independent , external advice , at a critical time in the university âs strategic development which required continuity of leadership
' the board were keen to retain professor gorman for this five - year period following a very successful initial five years
â he added that monies accrued annually were subject to meeting clear terms , with accruals declared each year
an lse spokesman said : â a key part of the director âs role at lse is to maintain the array of international relationships and establish new links with universities , businesses and non-governmental organisations around the world
' inevitably this involves a significant amount of international travel
none of this travel is in first class
â a glasgow caledonian spokeswoman said : â gcu is the first scottish university to open a campus in london and it established the uk âs first campus in new york in 2013/14 , with further key partnerships in bangladesh , oman and south africa
â this has inevitably required extended trips to our overseas locations and having increased costs
the university is transparent about expenses incurred
