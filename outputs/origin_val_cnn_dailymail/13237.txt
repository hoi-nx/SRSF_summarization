for the first time ever , we 're getting a live - action " star wars " movie without the man who composed the " star wars " theme
" star wars : rogue one , " the recently - announced " star wars " spinoff movie starring felicity jones , will not include the soaring music of oscar winner williams
williams originally scored " star wars " and every other episode since then , including the upcoming " force awakens " later this year
however , composer desplat has revealed that he will be working on 2016 's " rogue one
" the film 's director , gareth edwards , worked with desplat last year on " godzilla
" a " star wars " movie without that iconic williams sound is certainly something that fans will have to get used to , and desplat has a big job ahead of him
williams ' work will also be absent from the next steven spielberg movie , " bridge of spies , " it was announced this week
for the past three decades , williams has scored every single steven spielberg film , but the new movie , starring tom hanks and due out october 16 , will be scored by thomas newman , best known for the score of " american beauty
" movie studio dreamworks attributed williams ' absence to a " minor health issue , since corrected
" williams ' best known non- " star wars " music is almost entirely from steven spielberg films , including " jaws , " " raiders of the lost ark , " " e.t. the extra terrestrial " and " jurassic park
" another upcoming steven spielberg movie , " the bfg , " will include a williams score .
