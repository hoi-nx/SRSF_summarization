i do n't remember actually getting stabbed
i remember walking off and all of my friends screaming
' that 's when i looked down and blood was all over my shirt
the paramedics were there trying to see how bad it was and taking off the jumper which i had on
' that 's when it started to sink in
that 's when it hit me that i had actually been stabbed
the eight inch wound was so deep it almost struck his heart and police said tyler was ' lucky to be alive ' the teenagers were at a party on a roundabout known locally as dilton marsh roundabout when they were approached by the unknown man on saturday at about 11pm ' it does n't feel real
still people do n't know why it happened or why he did it
' loui suffered cuts to his hands and was also treated in bristol 's southmead hospital
their mother erika , 34 , said : ' i was shocked
i do n't understand why anybody would approach a group of children and do this
tyler pictured in hospital after the attack
he is now recovering at home but will be off school for weeks ' it 's not like this is a dangerous city - it 's a small town
he 's lucky to still be here
' tyler has taken it very well
i do n't think it has sunk in yet
he 's had all his friends around him
' it was completely random
i do n't know what i would say to the attacker
to me , it proves he is not sorry because he has n't come forward
he 's not sorry and he 's hiding like a coward
' i 'm looking at people and thinking they look like the description
' detective inspector paul franklin said : ' he 's first threatened the children and then when the two brothers have gone over to him , he slashed out at them with the knife causing one a very serious and deep lacerations to his chest , and the other brother some cuts to his arm
' from that point , he has then run away up main road
it 's completely unprovoked and at this time we have absolutely no idea who this man is
this could have been a murder inquiry quite easily
' the attacker is described as being aged between 20 and 30 , with shortish black hair and wearing a blue jacket and either blue jeans or grey jogging bottoms .
