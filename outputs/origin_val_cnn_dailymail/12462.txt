moscow kim jong un is expected to attend world war ii anniversary celebrations in moscow at russia 's invitation , a russia official speaking on condition of anonymity said thursday
north korea accepted russia 's invitation , but russia is waiting on pyongyang to make the official announcement about the may trip , the official said
this would mark kim jong un 's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership in late 2011
" the invitation was sent to kim jong un
the leadership of north korea is expected to take part in victory day celebrations in moscow , " the russia official said
the official later clarified : " by leadership , we 're talking about kim jong un
" so far , north korea state media has not issued any statement about the invitation
this year 's victory day marks the 70th anniversary of the soviet union 's victory over nazi germany in world war ii chatter over whether kim jong un would make his first official overseas trip during the pivotal anniversary started in late december after russia state media reported that moscow had extended an invitation to pyongyang
on december 22 , russia presidential aide yuri ushakov told itar-tass : " first signals are given from pyongyang that the north korea leader plans to come to moscow and attend celebrations
" recently , russia and north korea have been fostering warmer relations
if kim jong un appears in russia along with other world leaders , he may look like a minor figure , said dr. petrov , an asian studies professor who specializes in the political history of north korea
" in a setting with a large crowd of state officials , in group pictures , he would look like a minor figure instead of what he 's portrayed in north korea media as supreme leader , invincible marshal , jack of all trades
" so i think if kim jong un decides to go to moscow , he 's going to look like a very lonely , lonely figure
" the kremlin has invited 68 world leaders to its victory day celebrations on may 9 , said russia foreign minister sergey lavrov as quoted on russia network rt. he was quoted in russia media as saying that china president xi jinping will also attend
in the last year , russia and north korea , two historical allies , have increasingly established stronger ties as russia president putin faces international backlash over the war in ukraine
the two countries declared 2015 their " friendship year
" both countries have been slapped with sanctions by the united states and are facing international isolation
" north korea is a convenient friend for moscow -- it 's anti-american and it 's in a key place of asia , " petrov said
" russia lost many of its traditional allies -- it needs friends , both economically , politically , strategically
" ties between north korea and russia date back to world war ii , when kim jong un 's grandfather and founder of the country , kim il sung , trained as a communist guerrilla leader in the soviet union
throughout kim jong un 's subsequent reign , the soviet union backed the nation
after the soviet union crumbled in the early 1990s , north korea became increasingly reliant on china
kim jong un 's father , kim jong il , visited moscow several times , with his last visit in 2011
the late kim jong un rode into russia in an armored train ( he disliked flying ) and met with both putin and prime minister dmitry medvedev
" moscow undertook a diplomatic offensive " with north korea , said petrov , of australian national university
" it absolved $ 10 billion of soviet union - era debts from the account books and started rebooting relationships between north korea and russia
" last year , russia forgave 90 % of north korea 's $ 11 billion debt
