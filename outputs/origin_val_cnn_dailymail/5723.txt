a ba pilot threatened to kill himself by crashing a jumbo jet five years before the germanwings disaster in the alps last week
robert brown killed his wife in a horrific attack with a claw hammer , and the next day he considered deliberately crashing his boeing 747 747 in order to ' make a statement '
now his victim 's family say they fear that airlines have not learned from the case and are not making enough effort to assess whether pilots are genuinely fit to fly
he had told ba that he was suffering from stress as a result of his divorce from wife joanna , and consulted his gp about his illness , but carried on working anyway
in october 2010 , robert brown argued with his wife while dropping off their two children at her home in ascot , berkshire , and hit her 14 times with a claw hammer
he then buried her body in windsor great park - but he told his murder trial that he had considered crashing a plane the next day after being harassed by joanna 's lawyers
' i thought something needs to be done , ' robert brown said
' i thought i want to fly one last time and crash the aircraft
i wanted them to be held accountable
' i thought if i got to work i could crash an aircraft , or fly to lagos and crash it there or hang myself in the hotel room
i wanted to make a statement
' sporty : robert brown , a ba pilot , is pictured on a long - distance run in ba - branded kit warning : joanna 's mother diana parkes , right , says airlines should have learned from the case instead , he called in sick and another pilot stepped in to fly the ba jumbo jet to nigeria
robert brown was arrested later the same day , and subsequently convicted of manslaughter and jailed for 26 years
joanna 's mother , diana parkes , told the telegraph that following the case airlines should ahve done more to ensure that pilots can not endanger their passengers
she said : ' robert brown 's claim in court that he planned to ditch a commercial flight the day after he killed her was chilling to hear , and yet there has never been any acknowledgement from ba that lessons can be learnt from that
' the victim 's best friend barkworth-nanton said that there were ' chilling similarities ' between robert brown 's case and that of andreas lubitz , who were both fitness fanatics
robert brown told his ba bosses that he was feeling stressed out , but they did not follow up the conversation to check that he was in a fit mental state to fly , she said
plane : robert brown had been due to fly a ba boeing 747 similar to this one ( file photo ) similarly , andreas lubitz was apparently signed off from work following a struggle with depression , but ripped up the doctors ' notes he was given excusing him from flying
mrs barkworth-nanton told the telegraph : ' neither should have been allowed to fly and put the lives of their passengers at risk
in both cases there were things the airlines should have picked up on
the warning signs were there
' robert brown 's terrible crime resulted in him taking the life of jo , but it could have been much worse , and myself and jo 's family feel that airlines are not learning the lessons of these tragedies
' andreas lubitz is believed to have locked the pilot out of the cockpit during germanwings flight 4u9525 from barcelona to dusseldorf last tuesday , before deliberately crashing into the alps killing all 149 other people on board
work to retrieve the bodies of the victims from the crash site high up in the mountains is continuing six days after the disaster .
