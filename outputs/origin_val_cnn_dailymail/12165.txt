los angeles federal agents on tuesday raided more than three dozen " maternity hotels " in california where foreign women give birth , allegedly for the sole purpose of having a u.s. - citizen baby , authorities said
the " maternity tourism " sites included apartment complexes in los angeles , orange and san bernardino counties where authorities believe the businesses housed the foreign nationals about to give birth , federal officials said
those targeted residences are believed to have catered largely to women from china , who paid $ 15,000 to $ 50,000 for lodging , transportation and food , according to a statement by ice
those fees do n't necessarily include medical care , authorities said
authorities are looking for evidence of bringing in and harboring of undocumented visitors ; conspiracy , fraud and misuse of visas and permits ; tax evasion and false tax returns ; and willful failure to file report of foreign bank and financial accounts , court papers said
" based on the results of the investigations to date , it appears the women pay cash for prenatal visits and the actual delivery , " u.s. authorities said
" as part of the package , clients were promised they would receive social security numbers and u.s. passports for their infants , which the mothers would take with them when they left the u.s. " some of the packages included recreational trips to disneyland , shopping malls and even to a firing range , authorities said
" any women encountered at the search locations will be interviewed and those identified as potential material witnesses will be directed when and where to report for further questioning , " authorities said tuesday
investigators were n't expected tuesday to comment further on the outcome of the raids , said ice spokeswoman kice
in all , authorities obtained warrants for 37 locations and ended up searching more than 50 sites , including consensual searches , kice said
the purported tourism businesses promoted themselves on the internet and through social media , authorities said
one firm in rancho cucamonga , california , advertised in china and branded itself as " you win usa vacation resort
" operators of that firm could n't be immediately reached for comment tuesday
china women have been flocking to the u.s. to give birth , lured because the country grants u.s. citizenship to anyone born on u.s. soil , cnn money reported last month
that cnn money account was cited in an affidavit filed monday in a federal california court by homeland security investigation agent blair , who asked a judge for a warrant to search rancho cucamonga apartment buildings for large sums of cash and evidence of contraband and a crime
the judge granted the warrant
read one affidavit " perpetrators of visa fraud schemes typically charge $ 40,000 to $ 60,000 , which is a fee able to be paid by the wealthy in china , " blair stated in court papers
in 2012 , about 10,000 china women gave birth in the u.s. , more than double the 4,200 in 2008 , according to china state media
blair alleged that the birthing houses " will generally advise foreign national clients to fly to tourism points of entry such as hawaii or las vegas and to avoid traveling directly to lax
this advice is due to heightened security by ( u.s. customs and border protection ) officials at lax based on the volume of fraudulent visas and false statements and entry documents that cpb officials have experienced over the last decade related to birth tourism
" one operator of the alleged maternity tourism schemes in california was providing bank statements claiming he had monthly gross receipts of $ 213,968.79 and an annual income of $ 1,283,812.74 , blair said in court papers
those bank statements were provided by an internal revenue service special agent , blair said
many of the families want an u.s. child because a foreign passport could be the family 's ticket out of china if they grow weary of pollution or food safety scares
president xi jinping 's widespread anti-corruption campaign has given rich china yet another reason to be on edge
" if things become economically or politically uncertain in one 's country of origin , the children have a place to come to , " volpp , a law professor at the university of california , berkeley , told cnn money last month
the children can " then sponsor their parents when they turn 21 , " volpp said
the desire to leave china is especially pronounced among the wealthy
almost two - thirds of china with more than 10 million yuan ( $ 1.6 million ) in the bank have emigrated , or are planning to , according to a hurun report released last year
one advertisement for a hacienda heights location " claims that the apartments are extremely suitable for expectant mothers and their accompanying families , " blair said in court documents
" the apartment will allow expectant mothers to experience the u.s. lifestyle during their stay
" in an interview with cnn money in february , felicia he , 27 , said she paid tens of thousands of dollars to give birth in california
that interview occurred well before tuesday 's federal announcement of raids
" i started getting ready for the trip around the end of my first trimester , " he said
" i asked my friends who have given birth before in the u.s. for a doctor recommendation ; then i found a place to stay in the area for a few months , and purchased my plane ticket
" he , who gave birth last year , said a u.s. passport for her baby means access to better education opportunities
foreign status opens the door to exclusive international schools in beijing , where she lives with her husband , and the option for the child to study abroad for high school and college
there is one catch , though
getting a u.s. passport for a baby means the child will eventually be responsible for u.s. taxes
