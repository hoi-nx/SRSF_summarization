switch off ? the sale of halogen bulbs could be banned as part of the eu 's energy - saving drive the sale of halogen bulbs which are used in millions of homes could be banned as early as next year as part of the eu âs energy - saving drive
it follows the prohibition of traditional incandescent bulbs , which have been phased out in an effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions
millions of halogen bulbs are sold in britain every year , often for use in kitchen and bathroom spotlights
any ban could consequently cause enormous inconvenience
the ec and green campaigners say halogens are not much more efficient than traditional bulbs so should be replaced by energy - saving compact fluorescent bulbs â known as cfls â and leds
yet these alternatives can be as much as 15 times more expensive
there is the additional problem that some leds do not work with the dimmer switches and wiring circuits currently used by halogen bulbs , while cfls can take up to five minutes to reach full brightness
the ec is due to hold a vote on the issue in april , when it could agree to go ahead with the proposed 2016 ban or push back the date to 2018
consumer group which ? argued there are good reasons for a delay
a spokesman said : â half of which ? members still have halogen bulbs in their home and more than two in five have halogen spotlights
delaying the ban until 2018 would allow more time for some of the compatibility and user issues to be resolved
â and a campaign group of manufacturers called lightingeurope is demanding any ban on halogens is delayed until 2020 at the earliest , in order to minimise the impact on consumers and the industry
the group âs secretary general , diederik de stoppelaar , said : â a phase - out before 2020 is going to be costly and inconvenient to consumers
the industry supports the change to more energy efficient lighting ... however , an earlier date does not allow for alternative developing technologies to be widely available
â but which ? added that despite the inconvenience , there are some positives to switching
the new bulbs last longer and , because they are more energy efficient , they will cut electricity bills over time
typically , halogens use 10 per cent less energy than incandescent bulbs , while cfls use 60 - 80 per cent less and leds up to 90 per cent less
led lights are so efficient that a 5 - watt bulb is , in theory , equivalent to a 35 - watt halogen
but while a typical 35 - watt halogen spotlight costs about Â£ 1 , a 5 - watt led can be anything from Â£ 5 to Â£ 15
the managing director of britain lighting company blt direct , steven ellwood , supports the 2016 ban
he said : â we understand the concerns of experts who want to delay the ban in order to iron out some issues
[ but ] implementing the ban sooner rather than later would see plenty of benefits for consumers , not to mention the environment
â other advocates of the 2016 deadline argue that the energy savings for britain as a whole could be so large that it would eliminate the risk of black - outs caused by the closure of old and run - down power stations
one analysis suggests that if all 27million homes reduced their need for lighting by 100 watts on winter evenings , this would cut peak energy demand by 5 per cent .
