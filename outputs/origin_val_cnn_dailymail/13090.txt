omoa , honduran alexis gonzã¡lez walks slowly and with some hesitation , using the outside wall of his house for balance
" i 'm getting used to the prosthesis , " the 16 - year - old says
he tries to smile , but an expression of sadness quickly returns to his face
when he was 15 , alexis gonzã¡lez made a decision that would forever change his life -- to leave omoa , an impoverished village in honduran -- with dreams of getting to the u.s.
at the end of the trek -- about 2,500 kilometers ( 1,500 miles ) across mexico and guatemala -- he saw hope , school , a job and the chance to send money home
" sometimes we do n't even have food to eat and i also wanted to get a higher education , " alexis gonzã¡lez says
his mother was singlehandedly raising nine children , working odd jobs in restaurants and the nearby fields
they lived in a single room , an adobe house with dirt floors built on a steep and muddy hill
chickens being raised for food roamed around the structure
alexis gonzã¡lez says his father left the family when he was little boy
when gonzalez left in january 2014 , he did n't ask his mother for permission
he only left a letter telling her about his plans
" i would n't have let him go , " his mother melã©ndez says
" when he left i went looking for him everywhere
" she even went to corinto on the honduran - guatemala border to ask authorities if they had seen him , she says
alexis gonzã¡lez says he traveled by land through honduran and guatemala with a teenage cousin
they took the bus and also walked and hitch - hiked in some places
once in mexico , they got on the cargo train migrants call " the beast
" migrants get a risky , but free ride clinging to the outside of the train
violent gangs sometimes board the train to rape , rob and kill migrants
those without money to pay off the gangsters are thrown off , sometimes to their deaths in deep ravines or sharp rocks
alexis gonzã¡lez says he never faced any gangs
things seem to be going well for him and his cousin for a while
they had been traveling for a few days on the train and were excited at nearing the u.s. - mexico border and crossing into the land of their dreams
but they were also tired
they ate what they could , but were unable to sleep for more than an hour at a time
they were hanging onto the grate above the train car 's couplers
" we used our own sweaters to tie ourselves to the train so we would n't fall off , " alexis gonzã¡lez says
but tragedy was just around the corner
somehow , he does n't know how , he fell off the train while sleeping
he woke up bleeding profusely
" the train had severed my right leg and part of my left heel , " he says
he was eventually rescued by the mexico red cross and taken to a hospital where he recovered for a month
he stayed at a shelter for wounded migrants for another two months
there he was fitted with a prosthesis free of charge
it 's not difficult to find stories of minors in central america who have lost limbs , been kidnapped or died while trying to travel through mexico with the dream of migrating to the u.s.
juan enamorado , a 22 - year - old who lives in the coastal town of tela , honduran , says he almost lost his life at 17 when he jumped off the train , fleeing from gangs
" they got on the train to steal money from people
when i heard they were coming , i jumped off the train traveling at more than 30 mph , " he says
enamorado says he was barely able to make it to the nearest town after walking for four days without food and very little water
children are fleeing endemic poverty and drug violence in central america
last year , u.s. immigration authorities in the u.s. detained nearly 18,000 minors from honduran as they were trying to cross the border without documents
altogether , more than 67,000 minors , mainly from central america , were detained , according to u.s. government figures
to understand why children are fleeing in droves , cnn traveled to san pedro sula , honduran
the second largest city in the country
it has the highest reported murder rate in the world
violence is fueled by turf wars between two powerful gangs that control entire neighborhoods
the honduran government is trying to change this harsh reality by deploying security forces to hotspots
vilma maldonado says her son was forced to leave because of death threats from gangs when he was only 15 years old
he left la lima , just outside san pedro sula , four years ago at the age of 19
the last time she heard from him he was in monterrey , mexico , hoping to cross into the u.s.
" sometimes i think he 's dead , " maldonado says crying
" but then i seek refuge in god and try to think the opposite and ask god to take these ideas out of my mind because if i 'm trusting god you have to have faith that my son is still alive
" for monsignor emiliani , auxiliary bishop of san pedro sula , the migration of central america children to the u.s. is a regional disgrace
" it 's something terrible , sad and shameful for us honduran that nearly 18,000 of our children have desperately left because of hunger and violence
it 's a slap on our faces and there are people that do n't care about these 18,000 children
" can you imagine the trip for a child who 's 4 , 6 , 10 , 12 years old all the way to the u.s. ? many girls have been fondled and raped by the smugglers , " monsignor emiliani says
honduran president hernã¡ndez says his country has fallen victim to powerful criminal organizations fueled by drug dollars and weapons coming from the north and drugs from the south , but insists his government is working hard to stem the tide
" we have our own responsibility
we accept that and we 're doing our work
we are pushing this forward with all that we have
other countries are responsible for this war that we 're living , " president hernã¡ndez says
back in omoa , mercedes melã©ndez , the mother of alexis gonzã¡lez , says she 's deeply worried about her son
" he has told me that he 's depressed
he has recently been better , but he used to say he wanted to die
i was getting very worried because he said that he wanted to kill himself , " melã©ndez says
the teenager says he now draws and writes to forget
he shows us a drawing of a family of four holding hands
he uses pastel colors and soft features in the drawing and inscribed words like " happy , " " love , " and " i love you " throughout
he may never be able to go to college or help his family the way he wanted
but asked if he regrets his decision to leave , he says he does n't : the rewards were so high , it was worth the incredible risk
and for countless others like him -- from across central america -- the same is true
and they will keep trying .
