an oregon teen who is too young to gamble in strip is n't being allowed to bring a showgirl to prom because his school says she is too old to attend
moore , 17 , asked mariah rivera to prom over instagram
moore , a junior at regis high school in stayton , had a slight in with rivera because she is a cousin of one of his friends
after moore made his request on social media
rivera got back to him about a week later and said if he was able to get 10,000 retweets she would be part of his prom group , kgw reported
the retweets started coming fast and furious - they are at nearly 1,400 - and moore 's quest began to draw attention
however , even if moore reaches 10,000 retweets , rivera wo n't be attending the dance on may 16 because the catholic school wo n't let her
regis high school principal scott coulter said : ' all prom guests have to be 19 and under
' austin 's not in trouble
' we just laughed about it and i said this just is n't going to happen
' in addition to working as a topless dancer on the strip , rivera also dances as a las vegas outlaws cheerleader even if moore reaches 10,000 retweets , rivera wo n't be attending the dance because the school wo n't let her in addition to ending up on a variety of media sites because of the prom , rivera has also drawn attention for this moore 's friends were ' pretty bummed ' to find out rivera was n't coming , oregon live reported
he said : ' they all really wanted a model in the group
' things are n't that bad for moore as he has a girlfriend he always intended to bring as his date
rivera , who is married , told the las vegas sun that moore 's request was ' all in good fun ' and ' strictly pg '
she said : ' it âs very flattering , although a little embarrassing
' my other fantasy dancers are having some fun over this , but i think it âs because they are a little jealous they did nât get an invitation
' maybe i âll take them along with me
' unfortunately for moore and his friends , it does n't sound like the school will let that happen .
