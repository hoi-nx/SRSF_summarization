neanderthals may have created and worn the world 's first jewellery 130,000 years ago , according to scientists
researchers examining eight talons taken from a white - tailed eagle found at krapina in croatia say they were used to create necklace or bracelet
the claws bear multiple cut marks , notches and signs that they had been polishing by the neanderthals that once inhabited the site where they were found
the eagle talons shown above were found at a site inhabited by neanderthals and are the earliest example of jewellery yet discovered , according to researchers who have re-examined them 100 years after they were found the findings will add to mounting evidence that neanderthals were not the slow - witted and primative creatures they are often portrayed as
instead they are emerging as having had a sophisticated culture , were highly intelligent and may have even created art. it has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern - day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient neanderthals
but the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes
neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred , meaning europe now have roughly 2 per cent neanderthals dna
these ' legacy ' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history
however , some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases
scientists have found that part of our hla system , which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body , could have come from neanderthals
other researchers have suggested that humans outside africa are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes because they interbred with neanderthals
researchers from oxford and plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the neanderthal genome
a gene that can cause diabetes in latin americans is also thought to have come from neanderthals , long before their ancestors colonised the new world
the new findings suggest that the talons may have had a symbolic purpose - something that some anthropologists have argued neanderthals did not possess or copied off modern humans
however , dr frayer , an anthropologist at the university kansas who led the study along with colleagues in croatia , said the talons appear to have been made into symbolic jewellery 80,000 years before modern humans arrived in europe
he said : ' it 's really a stunning discovery
' it 's one of those things that just appeared out of the blue
' it 's so unexpected and it 's so startling because there 's just nothing like it until very recent times to find this kind of jewellery
' the eight talons were discovered more than 100 years ago at a site where neanderthals remains have been found just outside the town of krapina in northern croatia
the researchers examined the talons and found that four of them bear multiple smooth edged cut marks around the top
three of the largest talons also have small notches at roughty the same place along upper area of the talon blade
all eight of the talons appear to show signs of polishing
the researchers , whose findings are published in the journal public library of science one , say the cut marks are evidence that they talons and connecting bones were cut from the foot of the eagle and attached to a string or sinew
along with colleagues at the croatia natural history museum , dr frayer said : ' these talons provide multiple new lines of evidence for neanderthals â abilities and cultural sophistication
' they are the earliest evidence for jewellery in the europe fossil record and demonstrate that neanderthals possessed a symbolic culture long before more modern human forms arrived in europe
our traditional view of neanderthals , shown above in the reconstruction at the natural history museum in london , is of a primative and stupid species but new evidence suggests they were intelligent and cultured cuts and notches on the talons ( shown above ) suggest they were strung on sinew as a bracelet or necklace ' some have argued that krapina neandertals lacked symbolic ability or copied this behavior from modern humans
' these remains clearly show that the krapina neandertals made jewelry well before the appearance of modern humans in europe , extending ornament production and symbolic activity early into the european mousterian
' previously the oldest jewellery to be discovered in the world were some seashells that had showed signs of being used as beads around 100,000 years ago in israel and africa but were thought to have been made by modern humans
the new discovery now suggests that neatherthals were also capable to creating jewellery , other sophisticated ' art ' , and may even have had rudimentary religion
the talons were discovered at a site inhabited by neanderthals close to the town of krapina in northern croatia the shells above were found in israel and were thought to be the earliest example of beads that were worn as jewellery - dating to around 100,000 years ago - but the eagle talons predate these by up to 30,000 years previously scientists have found evidence that neanderthals may have created engravings on rocks in gibraltar while modified feathers and shells have also been found alongside their remains
researchers believe neanderthals used their mouths as a third hand for tasks such as preparing the furs or chopping meat
in july , the biggest collection of ancient human fossils ever recovered lent weight to this theory
the collection reveals how neanderthals developed their distinctive teeth before their brains , using them as a third hand for holding objects
the study adds to theories that the neanderthals evolved their characteristic looks slowly , and intermittently , over hundreds of thousands of years
the ancient skulls , dating back 400,000 years , show neanderthals - like features in the face and teeth , while other parts of the skulls , including the brain case , resembled those of more primitive human ancestors
this suggests the earliest neanderthals used their jaws in a particular way for chewing as well as for holding objects
such findings are also raising new questions about how this now extinct branch of the human family tree died out
scientists have long believed that they died out as modern humans , homo sapiens , moved into the parts of asia and europe where homo neanderthalensis had lived
others believe instead that as the climate warmed they were unable to cope or even merged with modern humans through interbreeding
dr simon underdown , an anthropologist at oxford brookes university , said the discovery of the talons shed new light on neanderthals intelligence
he said : ' this research gives us two important bits of information about neanderthals and their intelligence levels
' one , that they made symbolic objects which clearly means they thought in a very similar way to us , and two , much more importantly , that they were capable of making complex symbolic objects in complete isolation from us
' similar evidence from france dated to around 35,000 years ago is sometimes held up as an example of neanderthals copying us
' but the date and location of the krapina material means that this is clear evidence of independent neanderthals innovation at its best
' the last five years has seen our view of neanderthals revolutionised - it is time to put the stupid cave man image to bed once and for all
' neanderthals first emerged around 280,000 years ago , spreading to inhabit much of europe and parts of asia , but they eventually died out 40,000 years ago
the reason for their demise was often put down to being a more primative species of human that was unable to compete against the more sophisticated homo sapiens
they were depicted as thuggish cavemen that scraped an existence on the cold lands of ice age europe
however , a series of discoveries are now putting neanderthals into a new light
stone tools discovered at sites they inhabited suggest they were skilled tool makers with adept hand eye coordination
a 60,000 - year - old multi-purpose bone tool unearthed in france also suggests neanderthals understood how to use bones to make useful devices a recent discovery by researchers at the musã©um national d'histories naturelle in paris suggests that neanderthals may have built homes using the materials they found around them
they discovered a 26 feet wide building created 44,000 years ago from mammoth bones
many of the bones had also been decorated carvings and ochre pigments
cross-hatched engravings found inside gorham 's cave in gibraltar are also thought to be the first known examples of neanderthals rock art. dna analysis has also shown that neanderthals carried the same genes that are thought to have enabled modern humans to speak
the traditional image of neanderthals as primative creatures like above is no longer holding up to evidence
