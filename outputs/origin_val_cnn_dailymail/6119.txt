clegg today bet a ukip candidate six pints that the lib would have many more mps than farage âs â pipsqueak â party
the lib leader dismissed ukip âs â bluster , anger and brave talk â ahead of may âs general election , despite being behind in the polls
the deputy prime minister has grown increasingly confidence that despite his slump in popularity nationally , the lib vote is holding up in the 57 seats where they already have an mp
scroll down for audio clegg was challenged on live radio by ukip candidate fraser , who boasted his party would win more mps than the lib one poll this week put the lib on just 5 per cent , the lowest for 25 years , while ukip were on 14 per cent
however , the concentration of lib support in a few dozen seats means they are likely to hang on to many of them despite their national collapse
by contrast , ukip has built support across the country but party insiders admit it is unlikely even to get 10 mps on may 7
mr clegg made the provocative boast that he will win more mps than ukip during his weekly radio phone - in on lbc
one poll this week put the lib on just 5 per cent , the lowest for 25 years , while ukip were on 14 per cent ukip candidate fraser called into the programme to attack mr clegg âs stance on civil liberties and boast that the lib face wipeout
but mr clegg hit back : â rather than making slightly silly political points on the radio â¦ â how about this , i will bet you , i do nât know , what shall i bet you , i will bet you several pints that the lib will have many , many , many , many , many more mps than your party after the election
ukip leader farage boasted his party would win more than 10 mps and could hold the balance of power â i can not only bet , i can close to guarantee you that your party is going to be a little pipsqueak party after may 7 compared to the lib
â all your bluster , and all your anger and all your brave talk i think will dissolve
â mr clegg initially appeared reluctant to commit his own money to the bet , but when lbc host nick ferrari offered to pay the money , mr clegg replied : oh alright then , six pints
â let me be absolutely clear fraser , you believe on behalf of farage , that you ukip will have more mps than the lib after may 7 , is that right ? â fraser replied : â i think there âs a very good chance of overtaking your party
am i taking the bet ? two pints will go to each : if i lose , i âm buying nick ferrari two pints , i âm buying clegg two pints , how about that ? â but mr clegg insisted : â bad luck fraser , you might as well set the money aside already
â later mr fraser told mailonline : ' if i lose , or ukip loses , i will be more than willing to buy clegg and nick ferrari a beer
' in fact , after the election clegg will have plenty of time to have a beer
' however , mr farage later insisted his party was on course to win more than 10 seats and could hold the balance of power
appearing on itv 's loose women , he said : ' it 'll be more than a handful
it 'll be in double figures
' he added : ' ukip is not going to win the election
what ukip is going to do is win a number of mps
' and given no - one is going to have a majority we might just find ourselves in a position where nick clegg was five years ago if we do that i 'll do a better job than clegg did
