stacey lee 's friend then took a photograph of her holding the message board and posted it to her facebook page sparking the image to be shared more than 100,000 times

the facebook messages which will lead to mother and daughter being reunited at last later the pair were reunited during a tearful meeting at a pub near brenda 's home in blackpool , lancashire
â when i clicked on my mum âs facebook profile i could nât believe it â she looked just like me ! â said stacey lee , who lives in chorley
â i sent her a message and told her that i had missed her and that i wanted to build a relationship with her
â she sent me her phone number and i called her
i was shaking as i dialled the number and i just sat staring at the phone for 15 minutes before i made the call
â mum told me that she had four other children and that she had always thought about me and my older brothers
a teary - eyed stacey lee is reunited with her mother , brenda , and meets sister shannon , for the first time â we cried together on the phone
it was very emotional and i was so happy that i had finally found her
â i arranged to go and meet my mum the following day in blackpool
my arms felt like jelly for the whole journey
â i went to meet her in a pub and when i saw her i just hugged her and we both cried
we look a lot like each other and i am quite shy and quiet like her
â stacey lee said she had never seen a photograph of her mother , and although she knew her name was brenda elizabeth davies and that she had been born in leyland , she did nât know her age
â growing up i had always wondered about my mum , â said stacey lee
â i was born in manchester but when i was two i went to go and live with my dad , david , then two years later i moved to runcorn to live with my granddad and two brothers
' as i approached my teenage years , i always thought about my mum
martin smith came up with the idea for stacey lee to post the photograph on facebook which was shared 100,000 times and help reunite mother and daughter in just 20 hours ' my friends had good relationships with their mums and i often wondered what it would be like to have a mother - daughter relationship
' occasions like mother âs day and christmas were particularly difficult and when i reached the age of 16 i started looking for my mum on facebook and the electoral roll
' when i first met my partner , martin , five years ago , i confided in him about my long - lost mother and he was so supportive
he 's been my rock
' there were times when i thought i would never be reunited with my mum
she could have passed away or moved abroad for all i knew
' last week martin and i were talking about my mum again and he encouraged me to create a sandwich board and use it to look for her on facebook
' i had seen similar posts on social media and i just thought " why not ? " i had nothing to lose
' i wrote my birth date and the hospital i was born in along with my mum âs full name and birth place
' i knew my mum might have changed her name since i was born but it was worth a shot
' ten hours after posting the picture to her facebook profile , the image had been shared 100,000 times , and the next day stacey lee was contacted by kerianne , a friend she had known in her teenage years
stacey lee said : ' i received a facebook message from a girl i had known when i was younger
she told me that she had some information about my mum , and that she was my cousin
i was so confused , but it turned out that her father was my mum âs brother
' i used to go round to kerianne âs house a lot when i was a teenager , so it turned out that i had known my uncle all along ! lots to talk about : stacey lee and sister shannon share details of their lives after growing up apart ' it was unbelievable , i could nât believe that i had known some of my relatives
kerianne had the same surname as my mum âs maiden name but we never put two - and - two together because davies is quite a common surname
' stacey lee was told her mother had changed her surname and after a quick search , found her mother âs facebook page and sent her a message
within an hour brenda had replied and the pair exchanged phone numbers
brenda explained that she had changed her surname to drake after getting married , and had moved to blackpool soon after she had been separated from stacey and her brothers stuart , now 26 , and steven , now 25
she went on to have four more children , shannon , 19 , shona , 15 , aaron , nine , and sabrina , eight
stacey lee kisses martin who she has described as ' her rock ' throughout her search brenda said she was delighted to finally have been able to see stacey lee again and had also searched for her and her two sons
' i regret losing contact with my three eldest children , ' said brenda
' i thought about them a lot , especially at times like christmas
' i tried looking for them but i always came to a dead end
i always thought that they would come looking for me when they turned 16 but i never heard anything from them
' when i received the facebook message from stacey lee , i just could nât believe it
' she was so beautiful and i just could nât wait to meet her
' stacey lee is so sweet and adorable and my other children were so pleased to find out they had an older sister
' we 're all looking forward to the future and i am going to be reunited with my two sons stuart and steven too
