she refused , telling him ' i 'm done ' , and tried to leave
as she turned towards the door , betts stabbed her in the back and also stabbed himself in an attempted suicide
betts pleaded guilty to the attempted murder in february 2012 ms holland tried several times to escape
in one attempt she told betts to hand her the knife if he wanted them to die together in ' the romeo and juliet love scenario he had in mind '
