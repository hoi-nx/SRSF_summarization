friday 13 did n't leave mercedes red - faced as they dominated free practice at formula one 's season - opening australian grand prix , but they did emit a crimson complexion of a different kind as they showed their support for red nose day
last season 's f1 world constructors ' championship champions wore red noses in support for the british charity
defending world champion hamilton was the only one from the party to not be seen wearing a red nose , but the british racer did wear a t - shirt backing
f1 team showed their support for red nose day by wearing merchandise on friday mercedes ' drivers hamilton ( left ) and rosberg both also wore t - shirts in support of red nose day rosberg wore the red nose while conducting interviews and signing autographs to fans at albert park captioned with the slogan ' i think i may be the voice of a generation , ' the 30 - year - old is all smiles as he poses for photographs with team - mate rosberg
rosberg was also pictured wearing a t - shirt , as well as a red nose , for the biennel telethon charity event which takes over the bbc on friday evening
and friday 's f1 practice proved a good one for the german as he set the fastest lap of 1:27.697secs in the second session on a glorious day at albert park , topping hamilton by one tenth of a second
rosberg was also quickest in the first session , his best time of 1:29.557secs edging hamilton as the constructors ' champions carried their ominous form from winter testing onto the track
four - time world champion vettel was third fastest on his debut for ferrari in the second session , with team - mate kimi raikkonen fourth best
the german made a flying start to his season as he topped the timesheets in both practice sessions rosberg pictured in action ahead of sunday 's season opener at the australian grand prix world champion hamilton finished behind rosberg in both practice sessions on friday hamilton takes time out in the garage during the first practice session of the new season but with vettel 's fastest time over seven tenths of a second adrift of rosberg , the opening day 's practice will strengthen belief that the first rounds of the new season may be a private duel for race wins between the mercedes duo
at the other end of the grid , and dogged by reliability problems during winter testing , the gloom in the mclaren garage followed drivers jenson button and kevin magnussen onto the track
kevin magnussen , who has taken injured fernando alonso 's seat at albert park , skidded into the gravel at turn six in the second session and his car had to be winched off the track
that was after he and jenson button finished slowest of the 15 cars in the first session that posted flying laps
jenson button improved in the second but only marginally to be 13th fastest
