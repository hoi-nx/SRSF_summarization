city playmaker david silva believes the barclays premier league champions have got to stop barca scoring if they are to have any chance of pulling off a miracle at the nou camp on wednesday night
david silva and his team - mates are 2 - 1 down after the first leg of their champions league last - 16 tie and head into the game having been written off by just about everybody
however , the spain international believes manuel pellegrini 's team can progress if they manage to become only the fifth team â and the first in the competition â to stop luis enrique 's team scoring
city playmaker david silva believes they have to stop barca scoring to have a chance david silva and his city team - mates are 2 - 1 down after the first leg of their champions league last - 16 tie it is a task easier said than done to stop barca , led by lionel messi , from scoring at home lionel messi ( centre ) and co will have something to say about city 's progress when the come to the nou camp ' we need the kind of mentality we showed in the games against roma and bayern munich in the group stages , ' david silva said
' the most important thing is not to concede a goal because obviously things then become more difficult
' strange things can happen
everybody wrote schalke off before they played real madrid but they won 4 - 3 and could have scored again which would have put them through
' not many thought psg could beat chelsea , especially with only 10 men for so long , so i know that everything can happen , not only in the champions league but in every game
' everyone is expecting barca to go through but hopefully we can give a strong performance and we do n't have any kind of pressure on us because we are behind and playing away
' david silva is preparing to face barca with his city team - mates on wednesday night at the nou camp david silva feels city can progress if they can stop barca from scoring against them in the last - 16 tie city travelled to spain at this stage last season , having lost the home leg 2 - 0
this time they are slightly better off following joe hart 's last - minute penalty save from lionel messi at the etihad stadium three weeks ago
' we played well in the second leg against barca last season and played with freedom so we will see , ' added david silva
revered in spain , where he played for first celta vigo and then valencia , david silva has long been coveted by barca and indeed real madrid
the 29 - year - old has insisted , however , that he is n't thinking about a move away from city and has enjoyed playing further up the field under manuel pellegrini this season
' i have played closer to the box in a more advanced position this season and that 's why i 'm scoring goals , ' he said
manuel pellegrini will look to perform a miracle on wednesday night against a powerful barca side ' it 's more about the team than individuals
if we are good as a group we can make the difference
i always have freedom in the pitch but now we need all the players at their best if we are to go through ' i have four more years on my contract and i 'm very happy here â i have always said that
the way the supporters are with me is something i 'm very proud of and it inspires me to play my best and i 'm humbled to have that kind of appreciation every time i play
' city will train at their own base in manchester on tuesday morning before flying to barca early in the afternoon .
