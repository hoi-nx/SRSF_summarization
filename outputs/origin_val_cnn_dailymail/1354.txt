raf pilots have been banned from flying the new f35-b fighter jets in a storm over fears the Â£ 100million plane could explode if struck by lightning
the ministry or defence said that the stealth f35-b , which has been plagued by design flaws and technical setbacks , could not be flown within 28 miles of a thunderstorm
named â f35-b â , it was even at risk of its namesake while on the ground with pilots told to move it under cover if less than 11 miles away from a storm
raf pilots have been banned from flying f35-b fighter jets in a storm over fears it could explode the fighter was created under the u.s 20 - year joint strike fighter programme , with the u.s government having ordered 2,500 of the lockheed martin planes
in britain , 14 of the aircraft have been ordered to replace the ageing harrier jump jet on the decks of the new queen elizabeth class aircraft carriers
but a recent pentagon report highlighted concerns over the placement of the jet 's fuel tanks , which are located all the way through the wing , through the fuselage , around the inlets and back toward the engine
pierre sprey , a former pentagon analyst who helped design the f-16 in the early 1970s , compared the engine to ' a blowtorch surrounded by fuel
' there was also a risk of catching fire if the fighter plane was shot at
last june , an f35-b burst into flames as it was taxiing for take - off at eglin air force base in florida , because the engine had cracked during previous flights manoeuvres
one of the pratt & whitney engines broke apart , pushed through the top of the aeroplane , and caught fire while the pilot was preparing to take off
the entire fleet of f - 35s was grounded for three weeks , and the plane missed its international debut
but that was not the end of problems for the fighter jets
the single - seat , single - engine fighter aircraft boasts a helmet mounted display system which is supposed to offer a 360 degree view of the outside of the aircraft
but the mod admitted there were still ' unresolved issues ' surrounding the technology
the ministry or defence said that the stealth f35-b , which has been plagued by design flaws and technical setbacks , could not be flown within 28 miles of a thunderstorm in case it was hit by lightning snp defence spokesman angus robertson , who brought up the safety issue in a series of parliamentary questions , told the mirror the mod were ' burying its head in the sand ' over the jet 's failures
he said : ' when they named the aircraft lightning i do n't think they expected that very thing would render them totally useless
adding to this Â­ embarrassment is the revelation none of these new jets have yet broken the sound barrier
' the raf website states that the f35-b was built to be a ' multi-role , all weather , day and night aircraft '
planes have a top speed of 1,300mph , a range of 1,450 miles and can carry a range of weapons including air - to - air rockets and satellite guided bombs
the design also uses stealth technology which will allow pilots to minimise its radar signature .
