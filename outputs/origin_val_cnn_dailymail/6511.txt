another weekend and more discussions and dissatisfaction with officiating
at old trafford i could actually understand how roger east thought that wes brown had clipped falcao but the clear and obvious foul was clearly by john o'shea
east was right to award the penalty kick
what mystified me was that the pgmo decided , unusually , to issue a statement regarding the incident , perhaps in an attempt to support one of their officials
east 's statement , in which he felt wes brown had made the foul for the penalty , makes it impossible for the fa to transfer the red card to john o'shea as they can only do so when the referee accepts that he has disciplined the wrong player
wes brown was sent off for a foul on falcao even though it appeared john o'shea made the contact poyet 's side are appealing wes brown 's red card but an overturn is n't certain roger east sends off wes brown ( right ) and poll admits he can understand his decision to show him the red card now the red card will be issued to wes brown , although he has appealed it as he did not foul falcao
had no statement been made then the card could have been transferred and natural justice could have taken place - even when referees get decisions right there appears to be a mess - up
nothing is certain , however , in the discredited disciplinary process following the barnes and nemanja matic incident
barnes could not be charged for a clearly and widely accepted red card challenge while a player guilty of violent conduct , according to the fa , had a reduced ban for some bizarre reason
either he was guilty or not
another example is that crystal palace captain mile jedinak should be charged for his clearly deliberate forearm smash on west ham 's diafra sakho towards the end of crystal palace 's win at upton park
it appeared to be unseen by referee mike dean but was around the area of active play , where the ball was present , so could that be deemed as 're - refereeing ' an incident ? i hope not as the australian certainly deserves a ban for the mindless assault
mile jedinak 's elbow was labelled a ' mindless assault ' and poll says he should be punished the crystal palace midfielder caught west ham striker diafra sakho and was lucky not to injure him there was more dissatisfaction , and this time by both mangers over the performance of referee neil swarbrick at the britannia stadium
there were three key incidents although both steve bruce and mark hughes seemed less than happy with the general refereeing
two acts of serious foul play escaped neil swarbrick 's detection and stephen ireland was involved in both
first he went into a challenge with david meyler leading with a sideways , stamping studs first boot which could have caused a really nasty injury â it certainly endangered his opponents safety and should have led to a red card
just ten minutes later it appeared that hull 's maynor figueroa decided to take the law into his own hands and went through stephen ireland from behind , raking straight down the back of the stoke midfielder 's calf and causing a nasty injury
another red card tackle which did n't even merit yellow for neil swarbrick
perhaps the fa will act or maybe they 'll say they can not
the fact that the only goal of the game came from peter crouch who was in an offside position led to more understandable frustration
unfortunately the video replays that the game needs to correct such errors was turned down by the ifab at their meeting this weekend
stephen ireland lies injured after a after a tackle from maynor figueroa which left him needing stitches the honduras international is unlikely to receive any ban from the fa as the officials saw the incident
