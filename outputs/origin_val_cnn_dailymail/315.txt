the financial rewards of southampton âs continued academy excellence were blindingly obvious last summer , but ligue 1 lille run the south coast club close in terms of money generated from their youth products
a study carried out by the cies football observatory shows ligue 1 lille have benefited hugely from the premier league âs wealth over the last three years - with the country producing players worth more than any other on the continent
only southampton have been paid higher transfer fees for players brought through their youth system than the ligue 1 side in that time throughout the whole of europe
southampton have taken more money for their youth stars than any other side in europe since 2012 eden hazard 's move from ligue 1 lille to chelsea helped the france side rake in profits from their academy divock origi ( right ) joined liverpool in the summer but was immediately loaned back to france money earned from selling homegrown players since 2012 mathieu debuchy left ligue 1 lille for united before later sealing a switch to arsenal calum chambers , adam lallana and luke shaw made 90.2million euros ( Â£ 64.4m ) for southampton as they moved to arsenal , liverpool and manchester united respectively at the end of last season
but interestingly it is ligue 1 lille â midtable in france âs top division - who were the most profitable of the rest
and that âs thanks in no small part to the premier league
eden hazard ( chelsea ) , mathieu debuchy ( united ) and divock origi ( liverpool ) have all sealed permanent switches to england since 2012 and count for the majority of ligue 1 lille âs 76million euros recouped
while they have been able to lean on origi this year â the belgian striker was immediately sent back on loan â they are renowned for taking the money for their sellable assets
they sold five academy stars in that period in contrast to real sociedad âs two â antoine griezmann and asier illarramendi
atletico madrid snapped up the former for around 30m euros last summer , with city rivals real taking illarramendi a year previous
it is ligue 1 who garner the most profit on their academy stars , with the premier league third adam lallana ( left ) and luke shaw both left st mary 's for bigger things last summer unsurprisingly real madrid and barcelona both figure in the top 10 after selling off a raft of players who were unlikely to impact on their first team for modest profits
mario gotze âs move to bayer munich mean dortmund figure ahead of the spanish giants , with sevilla nestled beneath sociedad after earning just over 50m euros
the research puts into perspective a lack of homegrown talent emerging from top - flight clubs outside of southampton âs buzzing academy
swansea , manchester united and everton are the only other domestic sides included in europe âs top 20 ; each of united âs five players sold â michael keane , danny welbeck , robbie brady , matt james and josh king â were deemed surplus to requirements at old trafford , with four of them having to drop down a division in the search of regular football
a large proportion of everton âs profits was down to jack rodwell âs move to manchester city , and it is unquestionably southampton who continue to lead the way in nurturing talent .
