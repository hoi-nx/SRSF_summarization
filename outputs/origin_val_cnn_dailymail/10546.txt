the princess royal was pictured at sandown park racecourse today looking cool in a pair of sporty sunglasses that she borrowed from her daughter zara
the queen 's granddaughter , 33 , was given the adidas shades as part of her team gb kit when she represented her country in the equestrian at the london 2012 olympics
the sunglasses were certainly lucky for the mother - of - one who won a silver medal in the team event
the princess royal was pictured at sandown park racecourse today , left , looking cool in a pair of sporty sunglasses first worn by her daughter zara , right , during the london 2012 olympics like mother , like daughter : the royal profiles look at same as they pose in the sporty shades so that 's perhaps why anne chose to wear the sunglasses today in the hope they would be a lucky charm for her at the races in esher
the 64 - year - old grandmother , who is 11th in line to the throne , looked happy and relaxed as she watched the horses compete
but while the sun shone causing her to don zara 's sporty shades , temperatures remained cool so she stayed wrapped up in a beige double breasted coat , polo neck jumper and red scarf
anne looked happy as she watched the races - perhaps the shades were a lucky charm and just like her mother the queen who is rarely keen on a public engagement without wearing hat , the princess wore a brown hat with tartan trim
anne , wearing pearl stud earrings , was pictured in the parade ring during the grand military gold cup day at sandown park racecourse
the event dates back to 1841 and has always been a firm favourite with the british monarchy
one of the races held today is named in memory of the queen mother who was an avid fan of the sport
the royal chats to attendees in the parade ring during the grand military gold cup day despite the sun shining , she still wrapped up in a double breasted coat , hat and red scarf earlier this week , the princess royal opened a new Â£ 2.3m youth arts centre in jersey
the st james centre was built in a converted church in st helier and will include a performance space , studios , rehearsal rooms and a radio station
meanwhile , zara is busy training for the 2016 rio olympics with the hope of winning more medals - and perhaps more kit which she can share with her supportive mother .
