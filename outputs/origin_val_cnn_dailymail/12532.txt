the debate over health care reform once again blooms in d.c. , but this time democrats and the president whose legacy rests on the aca are tending a garden challenged by some rather invasive species
the republicans has kicked off its season by pulling aca up by the roots in its proposed 2016 house budget
but this budget will not become law
and so republicans are also preparing strategic plays if the supreme court rules in their favor this summer , or if a republicans wins the house next year backed by complementary majorities in the house and senate
either scenario would mortally wound aca
but this is n't a zero sum game
smart republicans already know they do n't win just because the other side loses
upending aca may poison the republicans 's standing with 16.4 million americans who will face adverse , even dire consequences without legislative patches to the law , or a swift switch to a solid alternative health care policy
this week , the conservative weekly the washington examiner aimed to mark aca 's fifth anniversary by asking a panel whether to " reform , replace or restart " the law
a gas leak scuttled the event
once they 've regrouped for their next panel , republicans should instead entertain a different r : revise
so far every plan republicans are offering strikes out any mandate to purchase insurance , which , oddly for a party celebrating self - reliance , encourages some people to continue shifting their adult responsibilities onto others
many of the republicans plans replace the subsidies that make exchange plans affordable for low - income americans with tax credits
tax credits do n't make much sense when you do n't have a lot of taxes to pay in the first place
these alternatives appear to be thinly veiled transitions away from the key aca principle of providing guaranteed access
to date the law has reduced the rates of uninsured americans by a whopping 35 %
sen. cruz , r-texas , lifted his veil even during his own plan 's debut by insisting " every last word of aca must be repealed " while promoting his own health care choices act that ditches subsidies and the mandate
republicans presidential front - runner jeb bush shares cruz 's preference to dismantle the " monstrosity " altogether , describing his preference for cheaper catastrophic insurance that helps people with massive bills but leaves poor americans to fend for themselves when it comes to needless perks -- like insulin and blood pressure pills
and besides repealing the aca , house budget committee chairman tom price , r-georgia , wants to tear into president lyndon johnson 's great society achievements as well
his budget proposal dismantles the federal medicaid program by slashing its funding and devolving it to the states , while asking seniors on medicare to try their luck with a voucher - discounted private insurance
what these approaches do n't get is that we live in a country entirely populated by citizens who want and expect to receive medical care when they need it , yet not all of these citizens want to pay anything for the privilege
the beating heart of aca is its mandate to purchase health insurance , which keeps costs down for everyone , makes it fiscally feasible to cover patients with pre-existing conditions , and makes government subsidies possible for those who ca n't afford any insurance without them
if republicans shift their focus to revising aca , there are an array of spots to trim and weeds to pull , and they can expect many democrats to join in the work
but after dealing with a withering onslaught of over 60 republicans attempts to kill the bill , democrats ca n't make even the most basic fixes for fear of losing everything
but there are some places to look
even aca supporters can acknowledge some specific anti-competitive features in the law
the aca 's push toward offloading risk onto hospitals rather than insurers is encouraging hospital consolidation , with large hospital corporations seeking to build economies of scale to offset future risk this trend may drive up costs as hospitals face less competition
meanwhile consumers shopping the exchange plans can select from few in - network hospitals and physicians , again making the health care marketplace less competitive
the americans may be graced with institutions offering stellar care in complex conditions that attract patients across state lines as well as across the world , centers that contribute to medicine generally through their research and training
but going out of state to seek such care is n't an option for many patients on exchange plans
cruz proposes opening up health insurance markets nationally , an idea that we should build on
years of a rough economy have left many consumers without the income or savings to pay the high copays , deductibles , and out - of - pocket maximums that aca uses as a cost - control measure
among families making 250 % to 400 % over the federal poverty line , 55 % to 68 % ca n't make their deductible , depending on their plan
the numbers are considerably worse for families under that threshold , and even for families making over 400 % of the poverty line , 25 % to 38 % ca n't pay the out of pocket maximum if they become seriously ill. despite these costs , the aca penalizes responsible consumers further by capping flexible spending accounts
furthermore , aca is in part more expensive than it might be because it takes a gamble covering preventive testing for people with no sign of disease for " free , " yet makes patients with chronic conditions pay deductibles even when we know their care will save money in the long run
that 's not the most rational distribution of funds if we 're trying to do the greatest good for the greatest number at the lowest cost
since jeb bush is interested in focusing on the big - ticket items and not sweating the small stuff , perhaps this is an area where he can throw his support
aca is n't a work of art by any means
it 's a messy , pragmatic attempt to reach a goal the majority of americans want : access to affordable health care when it 's needed
some rather fundamental revisions lie ahead , like a forthcoming administrative decision on whether to continue allowing state variability among the prescribed essential health benefits it covers
so , my advice to republicans is that they pick one or two specific aspects of aca they 'd like to improve , let 's have the policy debate , then introduce your legislative fix to the existing law , leaving its beating heart intact
show you 're open to constructively improving the aca and i 'm sure we 'll see democrats start coming to the table with their own pet peeves about the law
2016 does n't have to be a hyperbolic , hyperventilating contest for the fate of 16.4 million americans .
