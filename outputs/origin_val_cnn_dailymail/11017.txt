brownlee sprinted to victory as he claimed gold in the second round of the world triathlon series in auckland on sunday
the 24 - year - old olympic bronze medallist maintained a challenging position throughout the race after coming home fifth following a disappointing opening race in abu dhabi earlier this month
but , in new zealand , brownlee burst out of the second transition and established an immediate lead over world champion javier gomez of spain and france pierre le corre , while current world number one mario mola of spain was a minute down by this stage
brownlee sprinted to victory as he claimed gold in the second round of the world triathlon series though the final stages of the 10 - kilometre run brought with them heavy rain , brownlee reached the final corner clear of his rivals and celebrated along with the crowd over the final few metres before crossing the line in a sprint finish with a time of one hour 55 minutes and 26 seconds ahead of javier gomez and third - placed le corre
brownlee 's brother alistair missed the race because of a minor ankle injury but , with olympic qualification to be decided in august and september at the test event in rio and the world series grand final in chicago , none of the leading triathletes will want to peak too soon
alastair is hopeful of a return in time for the fourth round in cape town late next month
browlee was visibly delighted with victory and said : ' in ( the previous round in ) abu dhabi i made many mistakes , and i 've been beating myself up about it for the last few weeks
i 've been training hard because i did n't want to do that again , and i wanted to be able to show how good i was
' i really enjoyed it , i felt good and i 'm pleased to win
' the west yorkshireman added on twitter : ' very happy to win # aucklandwts today
it is a honest triathlon course
just like the yorkshire hill 's ! ' brownlee now takes up the world number one ranking which he carries to the next round on australia 's gold coast in a fortnight
in the women 's race , hall came home 17th to finish just under five minutes behind eventual winner gwen jorgensen of the united states
leicestershire 's hall came home in a time of 2:14.10 but fellow briton jessica learmonth suffered a mechanical issue during the bike ride and was forced to withdraw from the race .
