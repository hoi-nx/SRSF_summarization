elsie watson , who passed away last year , was sent a council tax bill â for a penny a woman who died last year aged 92 has been sent a council tax bill â for a penny
elsie watson left the paltry debt after moving from woodley near stockport into a care home whose staff forwarded the unopened bill to her son barry holland
the stockport council demand , which would have cost 60 times more to post than the penny debt , even offered mrs elsie watson the chance to pay instalments
barry holland , 72 , of cheadle heath , whose wife has paid the bill , has branded the letter ' ludicrous
' stockport council has since admitted their error and apologised
mr barry holland said : ' it is ludicrous , i really do think it is horrendous that the council can send out letters for a penny to someone who is 92 , even if they did n't know she was dead
' my mum was fiery , i imagine she would have gone down there , thrown a pound at them and said keep the change
' these people have no knowledge or feelings
' whoever sent this has cost 60 times more than a penny with a stamp
' the bill even said it could be paid in instalments on the back â how is that possible ? ' mr barry holland said his wife sandra paid the bill just to put an end to the matter
the stockport council demand said mrs elsie watson could pay it in instalments
