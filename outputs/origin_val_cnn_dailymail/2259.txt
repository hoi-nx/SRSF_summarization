tragic : humberto moura fonseca , 23 , died after attempting to drink 25 vodka shots in 60 seconds a drinking competition went tragically wrong when a student died after downing 25 shots of vodka
humberto moura fonseca , 23 , had been partying at the university of julio de mesquita in the city of bauru , in southwest brazil , when organisers suggested the drinking game to see who could drink 25 shots in less than 60 seconds
his friend rodrigo pancetti , 23 , said : ' we were all having a great time and someone came up with the idea of the drinking competition
' i knew i 'd already had too much and there was no way i was going to be able to drink five , let alone 25
but humberto moura fonseca and the others were really up for it
' on his facebook there is a quote , a motto , from the russian poet vladimir mayakovsky which says it is better to die from vodka than from boredom
i never thought that would become reality
' but once he had finished he said he felt ill and suddenly collapsed
' we assumed it was because he was drunk but then six others also collapsed , including the winner , so we called an ambulance
' medical crews rushed the students to hospital but mr fonesca died on the way
a hospital spokesman said : ' they all had alcohol poisoning and are in a critical state , with three still in intensive care
' now police say they are looking to charge the organisers with homicide
ironic : a quote on humberto moura fonseca 's facebook page says : ' it is better to die from vodka than from boredom ' drinking competition : medical crews rushed the students to hospital but mr fonesca died on the way a police spokesman said : ' two fourth year students at the university have been arrested for organising the event without a licence and for potentially causing the death of the student
' a spokesman for the university said : ' we very much regret the death of this young man and our condolences go out to his family and friends
' we would like to remind students that drinking alcohol in the university is banned
