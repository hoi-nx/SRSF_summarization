twelve thrill - seekers were plucked from a high - speed rollercoaster at universal studios by firefighters today after a malfunction
the ' high - speed rampage ' of a ride , which hits 67mph and goes upside - down seven times , came grinding to a halt tuesday evening after a mechanism went wrong
riders were left stuck on the tracks of the 16 - year - old coaster , reportedly for around a quarter of an hour , while firefighters with cherry - pickers drove up to bring them down to safety
stuck : the ride came to a halt in the orlando theme park around 5pm tuesday afternoon
a cherry - picker , which was used to get passengers off , can be seen to the right fixing up : 12 people were removed from the ride by firefighters , some of whom can still be seen investigating above local news station wesh2 , which captured footage of firefighters aboard the empty cars not long after 5pm , said that nobody was hurt in the incident
riders were left approximately 15ft off the ground while firefighters responded
in a statement given to the channel , universal studios described the malfunction as a ' glitch ' , following which ' the ride did what it was supposed to do , and shut down '
according to the orlando sentinel , the theme park is not yet certain what went wrong , and has launched an investigation
the hulk ride was built in 1999 at the island of adventure theme park , an expansion area which is next to the original universal studios , and costs a premium to enter
