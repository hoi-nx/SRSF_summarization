amazon has blasted federal regulators for being slow to approve commercial drone testing - and warned the u.s. is falling behind other countries in the potentially lucrative area of unmanned aviation technology
less than a week after the faa gave amazon the green light to test a delivery drone outdoors , the company told u.s. lawmakers that the prototype drone had already become obsolete while the company waited more than six months for the agency 's permission
' we do n't test it anymore
we 've moved on to more advanced designs that we already are testing abroad , ' said misener , amazon 's vice president for global public policy
the aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds
about 86 percent of amazon 's deliveries are 5 pounds or less , the company said
' we believe customers will love it , and we are committed to making prime air available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so , ' amazon has said
' nowhere outside of the u.s. have we been required to wait more than one or two months to begin testing , ' misener said in written testimony submitted to the senate subcommittee on aviation operations , safety and security
misener said amazon had applied on friday for permission to test a more advanced drone system and now hopes for quicker approval
the amazon case illustrates the frustrations of many companies and industry lobbyists , who say the u.s. regulatory process is not keeping up with rapidly developing drone technology that could generate new revenues and cost savings for a range of industries
misener , who was scheduled to join a witness panel at the subcommittee hearing , said european and other international authorities have more ' reasonable ' approaches that recognize the potential economic benefits of commercial drone operations
' this low level of government attention and slow pace are inadequate , especially compared to the regulatory efforts in other countries , ' misener said
' the ( faa ) already has adequate statutory authority
what the faa needs is impetus , lest the u.s. fall further behind , ' he added
seattle - based amazon , the largest e-commerce company in the u.s. , wants to use drones to deliver packages to its customers over distances of 10 miles ( 16 km ) or more , which would require drones to travel autonomously while equipped with technology to avoid collisions with other aircraft
the faa recently proposed rules that would lift the current ban on most commercial drone flights , but several restrictions attached would make package delivery and other business applications unfeasible
among other constraints , the proposed rules would limit commercial drones to an altitude of 500 feet ( 150 metres ) , allow flights only during daytime and require operators to keep the aircraft in sight at all times
the agency does not expect to finalize the rules until late 2016 or early 2017 , according to government officials
during this period , the current ban will stay in place ; companies can apply for exemptions to use drones for specific business applications
the faa has been slow to grant exemptions , however , granting only 48 of several hundred requests
the republican - led subcommittee called the hearing to examine the agency 's efforts to integrate unmanned aircraft systems , or uas , safely into u.s. airspace
industry forecasters say that drones would generate nearly $ 14 billion of u.s. economic activity in the first three years of integration and $ 82 billion over a decade
meanwhile , australia , canada , france and the united kingdom have progressed toward airspace integration and allow for commercial use , the gao ( gao ) said in a report to the subcommittee
australia has granted operating certificates to 185 businesses , while several european countries have granted licenses to more than 1,000 operators , according to the report
while the gao said overseas restrictions are similar to those proposed by the faa , it noted that france has begun to allow beyond - line - of - sight operations on a limited basis
