. getting to grips with my new " do "
the chop comes after cheryl fernandez-versini spent months with long hair extensions
whilst on the x factor she had them highlighted before swapping for a darker look once the show ended
her hairdresser , percy , who created the new look for the singer , and whose products are available on qvc said : ' creating a new look has been talked about for a while but this cut was just done on the spur of the moment
' we were backstage in cheryl fernandez-versini 's dressing room and we both knew the look we wanted to create , and so , an hour and a half later cheryl fernandez-versini had a completely new look
' i wanted to give cheryl fernandez-versini a cut that was feminine and sexy and almost an easy , ' ready to go ' cut , that daily can just fall into place
cheryl fernandez-versini showed off her new look on instagram telling her followers that she was ' long overdue ' a hair cut percy , who says his wonderbalm is great for using on wet hair before styling , continued : ' the cut is subtly graduated with a shaggier texture
it 's got a slight 70 's , joan jett texture that keeps it cool
' what i really like about this style is that it 's so wearable and easy to maintain - it looks amazing after it 's just been styled but then it also looks great the following day when it 's slightly lived in and undone
cheryl fernandez-versini has great hair , so it 's always a pleasure to cut ' this is n't the first time the l'oreal model has gone for a drastic hair - over
in the 13 years since she first shot to fame on the itv show pop idol , she 's tried out many different styles
she started out with glossy short black hair , has had bright highlights , long extensions and after famously being ditched from the us x factor she came back with a brand new blonde bob

it makes you feel new and different
