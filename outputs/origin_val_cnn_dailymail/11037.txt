the sight of birds pecking at seed or nuts from a garden feeder fills many people with joy
now , a device called the crow box could enable bird watchers to make money from their hobby , as well as watch birds develop new skills
the training aid can be used to teach crows to collect coins in return for peanuts , or simply test the intelligence of wild corvids
the crow box training aid can be used to teach crows to collect coins in return for peanuts , or simply test the intelligence of wild corvids
people who want to train crows can follow the open - source instructions to make their own box ( pictured left ) which includes a perch and funnel to dispense tasty peanuts ( right ) research has shown that crows have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven - year - old , and the birds can solve tasks previously only thought solvable by people and apes
the box is similar to a vending machine for birds , but crows have to use their brains to earn treats
so far , the brooklyn - based maker of the box has managed to train captive crows to retrieve coins in return for peanuts and hopes that wild crows will learn the same tricks
the sealed wooden and plastic box comprises food dispensers , a 12 volt power supply , two motors , cables and sensors
it is powered and run by a laptop that can be placed up to 50ft ( 15 metres ) away
research has shown that crows ( stock image ) have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven - year - old , and the birds can solve tasks previously only thought solvable by people and apes an experiment by the university of cambridge has proved that members of the crow family , known as corvids , are nât just among the cleverest birds , they are smarter than most mammals and can perform tasks that three and four - year - old children have difficulty with
scientists said that , while having very different brain structures , both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools , including imagination and the anticipation of possible future events , to solve similar problems
other experiments involving the same family of birds found that caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food , which the university of oxford âs behavioural ecology research group said is the first demonstration of spontaneous sequential tool use in a species other than humans
a study also found that rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach
urban - living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts
the device has a perch , a food tray and a funnel , designed to test a crow âs cognitive abilities and incentivise them to learn new tricks
there are four steps ( illustrated ) to training crows to find coins , involving peanut rewards to begin training , the device pushes a few peanuts and two coins into the feeder tray whenever a crow leaves the machine , which ensures food is always on offer and the sound of the machine is linked to the reward so the crow learns to accept it
the machine is then adapted so that it does the same thing when a crow arrives â training the bird to wait for its reward by visiting the machine
once visiting crows have learned patience , the machine is changed again so it only dispenses coins and not peanuts
this part of the training is the highest risk , because it seemingly removes the incentive of nuts
but the contraption is designed so that if a bird pecks or sweeps coins off the tray â which is fitted with sensors â and into a funnel , peanuts are revealed and the bird 's ingenuity is rewarded
this stage is designed to strengthen the relationship between the coins going down the funnel and food
the training is complete when crows bring coins of their own volition to unlock food
they may collect coins scattered nearby by the owners of the machine to encourage their behaviour , or travel further afield to collect bonus treasure
gabi , from seattle , washington , feeds the crows that visit her home with peanuts and they bring her gifts in exchange
the eight - year - old has built up collection of more than 70 shiny beads , buttons , pieces of metal , brightly coloured plastic and foam - all left for her by her corvid companions
perhaps the most touching is a metal fragment with the word ' best ' written on it - one half of a pendant that would be completed by the word ' friend ' if reunited with the other part
among her most prized presents from the neighbourhood crows is a pearl - coloured heart
' it 's showing me how much they love me , ' gabi told the podcast the bittersweet life and the bbc two
' they give me all the special stuff you could ever find
' we know these are from the crows that sometimes they are rusted and dirty and nothing like what a person would carry around
sometimes we find them on the bird feeder
' as gabi throws the food for the birds , crowds of crows - known as a murder - gather on telephone lines and the nearby fence
in return the crows now leave trinkets on the empty bird feeder - including a broken light bulb , earrings , pieces of lego , rusted screws , polished rocks and glass beads
the open source experiment is designed to look further into the brains of corvids
â the more people trying different things the faster we 'll all figure out how to work cooperatively with crows , â hacker and writer joshua klein writes on the crow box website
â once we âve got the system optimised for teaching coin collection we can move to seeing how flexibly they can learn other tasks , like collecting garbage , sorting through discarded electronics , or maybe even search and rescue

urban - living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts
the problem - solving creature performed the series of tasks without seeing the fiendishly difficult set up of the course beforehand
the wild crow learned to use individual props during its three months of captivity but had to work out the order in which to use them to complete the challenge and get an inaccessible treat
the animal was later released
in another astonishing test set up by bbc two , a crow called 007 completed an eight stage puzzle in two and a half minutes
it is one of the most complex tests of the animal mind ever devised .
