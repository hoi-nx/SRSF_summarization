playwright bennett , who has said that english is a nation of hypocrites and that english are ' better than all the rest ' at setting double standards we are a nation famed the world over for conquest , industry â and of course a good cup of tea
but according to playwright bennett , what english really excels at is â hypocrisy
â the writer made the astonishing attack as part of a milestone series celebrating the 50th anniversary of bbc radio 4 âs world at one
in each edition , the participants are asked to nominate what they believe to be one of britain âs world - class achievements
mr bennett , 80 , said he toyed with the idea of suggesting the national trust , medieval churches or the impressive landscape of swaledale
but in an interview with martha kearney , to be broadcast today , he says he believes that what the english are â better than all the rest â at is setting double standards
he said : â in english , what we do best is lip service
take london ; we extol its beauty and its dignity while at the same time we âre happy to sell it off to the highest bidder
we glory in shakespeare yet we close our public libraries
â a substantial minority of our children receive a better education than the rest because of the social situation of the parents
â then we wonder why things at the top do not change or society improve
it âs because we are hypocrites
â he went on to claim that too often , the english are lazy in their assumptions that problems which affect other countries do not exist in their own , saying : â our policemen are wonderful , provided you âre white and middle class and do nât take to the streets
â and dying in custody is what happens in south america
it does nât happen here
â he added : â a memorable phrase in hamlet , and one of the few that has nât been picked up as a quotation or a title for something else , is when claudius is arranging for hamlet to be arrested and executed when he gets to our shores
as part of his explanation , the writer says that policeman in english are wonderful , ' provided you 're white and middle class and do n't take to the streets ' ( file picture ) and in his letter he says ; â do it english â
and we say we do it , or we âre going to do it , but we do nât
â he was careful not to exempt himself from his own criticism , saying : â before you stampede for the basildon bond , or rather skitter for the twitter , i must say that i do nât exempt myself from these strictures
how should i ? i am english , i am a hypocrite
â in january the world at one heard nominations from the prime minister david cameron and leader of the opposition , ed miliband and other party leaders
world at one was first broadcast on 4 october 1965 on the home service and was presented by william hardcastle .
