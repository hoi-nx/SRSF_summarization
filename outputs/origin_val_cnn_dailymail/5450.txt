an anonymous artist and photographer has captured mundane objects in an entirely new way â making them very difficult to distinguish
using a reverse lens macro technique , pyanek has collated his extreme close - up shots in a series he calls â amazing worlds within our world â
featuring an array of household items , foods and objects we use on an everyday basis , the images are striking
the first use of this item in this way dates back to ad 105 and its continued production has helped shape the world , but just what is it ? number three is a cosmetic product that contains pigments , waxes , oils and emollients
the image itself looks like an onion but it âs a lot more refined than that
any ideas ? this item is both mundane and overlooked but it does serve a pretty useful purpose pyanek used the reverse lens macro technique to photograph this item in all its wiry glory created by a doctor and an advocate for vegetarianism , this item is enjoyed by people around the world image number four features a mundane and often overlooked object , but in this photograph it looks majestic
a type of fastener characterised by a helical ridge , but just what is it exactly ? number five features a small and porous bag used for its filtering properties
this item can be found in most homes around the country but we are pretty sure you have never seen it looking like rice noodles before
the sixth image features an item that was accidentally created in the 19th century by a doctor and advocate of vegetarianism
today it is produced in significant quantities
is that a cinnamon stick ? object number seven is something you would almost certainly overlook a striking image ! just what exactly is this revolutionary phosphorus item ? this image featuring a series of prisms is majestic , but can you guess what it is ? image seven captures an item you have almost certainly overlooked in the past , expect for the time you twisted it until it broke off
any ideas what this cinnamon stick - like thing is ? photograph number eight is striking
this phosphorus item has been in existence for centuries and its purpose has revolutionised the world
image number nine features a substance formed by trapping pockets of gas in a liquid or solid
the frames of the prisms in this image appear stable , but we assure you they are much more supple than they look
smooth or sharp ? the extreme close - up of this everyday household item is misleading the scratches on this useful little item presents the amount of wear and tear it goes through that looks familiar ! this image provides an insight into how this useful everyday item works despite the individual lines that appear on the object captured in photograph ten it looks smooth and soft to touch
however , this tool has the capability of producing many small splits and then a large cut to a surface
the colour of image 11 really catches the eye , but it âs pitted surface and hard to distinguish edges make it a confusing image to ... unlock
image 12 is features another object that has revolutionised the world we inhabit
this photograph is perhaps easier to interpret but it provides an insight into how the item works
this object , which appears wiry up - close , is almost certainly something you would overlook majestic : this everyday , throwaway item would appear to command more respect than it actually gets just in case you were wondering , this is what a biotic material looks like up - close , apparently a bit more difficult as object 13 is almost certainly something you would overlook , but it does have its purposes
any idea what this wiry object is ? photograph 14 is perhaps the most enchanting image of the piece
the object is practically flawless but for the few pimples that appear on it
can you guess what this single diamond - like grain is ? made from a biotic material , object number 15 is used for a variety of purposes and is associated with ritual and religious devotion in china and india
this long , thin and cylindrical item has been around since the 12th century pyanek captures the beauty of this overlooked item by utilising the reverse lens macro technique x marks the spot ! the dirty fingerprints ingrained on this object are a giveaway to what it is image 16 features an object traditionally made from durum wheat semolina
this long , thin and cylindrical item has been around since the 12th century and is now considered a staple
any ideas ? a slightly more difficult object to distinguish , image number 17 picks up the beauty of a naturally occurring solid aggregate of one or more minerals
something we use every single day with little consideration
this image brings to light a brick - in - the - wall object
