obama has had an awkward start to her visit to japan as she was pictured towering over emperor akihito and stumbling as she tried to bow , shake his hand and curtsey at once
the first lady , dressed in a florid combination of a blazer and skirt , dwarfed the emperor akihito in her silver stilettos , while he maintained his composure and smiled politely
she then squatted slightly while shaking his hand , seemingly trying to disguise the difference of height between them
mrs obama , who is 5ft 9in tall , also caused embarrassment earlier in the day when she grabbed akie abe , wife of japan 's prime minister shinzå abe , in a hug - and - handshake combination while the japan first lady was trying to bow
matters were not helped by the fact that she towers over him just nod and smile : the emperor akihito is the height of politeness as he greets mrs obama , who squats slightly as she tries to disguise the dramatic height difference between them do n't look down on me : mrs obama is back to her full height , but the incline of her head indicates that she remains intensely aware of the fact that she is at least a head taller than emperor akihito , centre , and his wife , empress michiko , right excessive physical contact is frowned upon in japan , and strict traditions govern the practice of bowing
despite intensive etiquette coaching , successive u.s. officials have famously got it wrong
in 2009 , president barack obama was was photographed bending to nearly a 90 degree angle when he greeted the japan emperor at the imperial palace
his efforts were widely mocked
in another example of over-enthusiastic bowing , the president was pictured bowing to a robot in 2014 while the japan people around him remained upright
in 1994 , then - president bill clinton went to the other extreme , causing offence by inclining his head and shoulders forward and mysteriously pressing his hands together when he met the emperor akihito
awkwardness and tension underpins much of the first lady 's visit
her three - day trip is being described as a ' makeup call ' after she ' snubbed ' the japan by failing to accompany her husband during his state visit to japan last year
japan 's prime minister , shinzå abe , is due to make a reciprocal visit to u.s. next month
mrs obama 's previous no - show upset members of the japan establishment so deeply that one politician , kazuyuki hamada , made the outrageous claim that the obamas were getting divorced , as the president had been using secret service agents to cover for his extramarital affairs
worried : japan 's first lady listened attentively to mrs obama 's speech , but it is likely that in the back of her mind , she was concerned about the prospect of further hug - and - handshakes body - check : obama attempts an ill - fated hug - and - handshake combination when meeting japan 's first lady , akie abe
