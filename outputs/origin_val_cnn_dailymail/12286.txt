moscow this was supposed to be a rally led by boris nemtsov , had he lived two more days to see it
but after the russia opposition figure was gunned down friday night , sunday 's rally in moscow took on a different theme
instead of gathering to criticize russia 's policies on ukraine , thousands of people came together to mourn the death of the former deputy prime minister
and as they united near the site of boris nemtsov 's death , conspiracy theories swirled over who killed the staunch critic of president putin as he walked near the kremlin with his ukraine model companion
ukraine president poroshenko added fuel to the conspiracists ' fire by saying saturday that boris nemtsov was about to reveal information that would be damaging to russia interests , according to ukrinform , the state - run news agency
" a few weeks ago i had a conversation with him on how to build relations between ukraine and russia , as we would like them to be
boris nemtsov said that he was going to make public the strong evidence for participation of the russia armed forces in ukraine
someone was very afraid of that
boris nemtsov was not afraid , the executioners were afraid
they killed him , " ukrinform quoted poroshenko as saying
russia authorities originally declined to issue a permit for the march when it was billed as an opposition rally
but they agreed to allow the procession honoring boris nemtsov , said people 's freedom party leader mikhail kasyanov
boris nemtsov was a top official in the party
the 55 - year - old was walking home from dinner with a companion , 23 - year - old duritskaya , when he was killed
the model later called yashin , a friend and political colleague of boris nemtsov 's , and said several men had pulled up in a car , and one opened fire , yashin said
russia tv station lifenews spoke with a snowplow driver , who witnessed the immediate aftermath of the slaying
he was identified as " sergey b. " " i got on the bridge , looked into the rear mirror and saw a man on the ground
i immediately realized he did n't feel well
i drove a little bit further and pulled over , " the driver said
" i realized we needed to call the ambulance and police
" in a statement on its website , the investigative committee for the russia said the shooter likely used a russia - made makarov pistol and 9 mm shells were collected at the scene
police say they are looking for a man with short hair who stands between 5 - foot - 7 and 5 - foot - 9 , russia 's sputnik news agency reported
the shooter was wearing blue jeans and a brown sweater
several possible motives were being investigated , the committee said , including the prospect that the shooting was a " provocation to destabilize the political situation in the country
" the committee is also exploring the possibility that the killing is related to the charlie hebdo terror attack in paris or boris nemtsov 's business activities , it said
the committee is offering a reward of 3 million rubles ( $ 49,000 ) for information about the crime , several media outlets reported
investigators interviewed duritskaya , who was not wounded
she was reportedly being kept under guard at an apartment , and ukraine 's foreign ministry has requested that duritskaya be allowed to return to ukraine , according to tass , a russia news agency
putin quickly condemned the killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting , the kremlin said in a statement
the president also wrote to boris nemtsov 's mother saying he shared her grief and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice , the kremlin said
but some of boris nemtsov 's fellow critics suspect involvement by either putin 's administration or a supporter of the president
" it 's clearly a political murder
it 's definitely a contract one , " yashin said
" i do n't know who killed boris nemtsov , but i know that it 's the government and personally putin who are responsible for it
they 've been constantly promoting a hatred towards everyone who does n't support their course and thinks different
" putin had a different theory : that the killing was a contract hit , but one meant to fire up political strife , putin 's spokesman peskov said
boris nemtsov himself had said he was at risk for assassination
he told the russia newspaper sobesednik last month that he was " a little bit " afraid his mother 's fears putin would have him killed would come true
but , he added , " i 'm not afraid of him that much
if i was afraid i would n't be heading an opposition party and do what i 'm doing
" last year , boris nemtsov spoke to cnn 's anthony bourdain
" i 'm ( a ) well - known guy , and this is a safety because if something happens with me , it will be scandal not only in moscow city but throughout the world , " he said then
critics of putin have in the past suffered miserable fates
last year , a moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the 2006 killing of russia journalist and fierce kremlin critic anna politkovskaya
business magnate mikhail khodorkovsky accused putin of corruption and spent 10 years in prison and labor camps
russia spy alexander litvinenko accused state security services of organizing a coup to put putin in power
he was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium and died in london in 2006
no killer has been caught
and before his death , boris nemtsov had been arrested several times for speaking against putin 's government
the most recent arrests were in 2011 , when he protested the results of parliamentary elections , and in 2012 , when tens of thousands protested against putin
while boris nemtsov certainly had his share of enemies in russia -- especially those who disagree with his stance on the ukraine conflict -- many left notes for the slain politician on the bridge where he was killed
" to boris nemtsov , " one letter read , " thank you for your example of courage and honesty
" human rights activists did not mince words in assigning blame for boris nemtsov 's murder
tweeted garry kasparov , chairman of the human rights foundation 's international council : " if you are popular your critics do n't have to be shot down in front of the kremlin
putin is just food in a prison , eat it or starve
" in a column on how boris nemtsov had been harassed for his regular criticism of the kremlin , human rights watch 's tanya cooper lambasted peskov , the putin spokesman , for saying the killing appeared to be an attempt to destabilize russia -- a statement cooper said could prejudice the investigation
" russia has become the kind of place where a top opposition leader can be murdered just steps away from the president 's office , " she wrote
" a country in which people are told to hate one another for difference of opinions is a dangerous country to live in
