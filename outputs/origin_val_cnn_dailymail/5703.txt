for a child , the world is a heady mix of colours , shapes and words that are constantly being learned and remembered
to make sense of many of these experiences , babies and toddlers ' map ' names to objects by assessing their surroundings and associating words with the item 's location
and now a new study has found that this association is not only affected by the child 's proximity to the object , it can also be influenced by their specific posture
when the target and another object were placed in the location , and the robot was positioned in a different way , it failed to recognise the object cognitive scientists from indiana university began by assessing the learning capabilities of a child - like robot called icub
they showed the robot an object situated to its left , and a different object on its right
this was repeated so icub learnt to associate between the objects and its two related postures
the robot consistently made a link between the object and its name - and proved this by reaching for the object - during 20 repeats of the experiment
but in subsequent tests where the target and another object were placed in both locations and the robot was positioned in a different way , it failed to recognise the object
this experiment was replicated using children aged 12 to 18 months and the researchers noticed only ' slight differences ' in the results
as with the robot , the infants failed to recognise objects if their position and posture changed , or the object was moved
in steps 1 to 4 , objects are placed left or right and are given names
in step 5 of the baldwin task , the objects are hidden while in the interference task , their location is switched
the items are put back in their correct location in 6 and 7 before being moved again in step 8
the participant is then asked to identify an object this experiment was replicated using children aged 12 to 18 months ( stock image ) and the researchers noticed only ' slight differences in the results
' like with the robot , the infants failed to recognise objects if their position and posture changed , or the object was moved the study was carried out by smith , a professor in the iu bloomington college of arts and sciences ' department of psychological and brain sciences
she worked with anthony morse , a senior post-doctoral research fellow in the centre for robotics and neural systems at the university of plymouth and viridiana benitez , a post-doctoral research associate at the university of wisconsin-madison
' this study shows that the body plays a role in early object name learning , and how toddlers use the body 's position in space to connect ideas , ' professor smith said
' the creation of a robot model for infant learning has far - reaching implications for how the brains of young people work
' a number of studies suggest that memory is tightly tied to the location of an object
' none , however , have shown that bodily position plays a role or that , if you shift your body , you could forget
' ' this study shows the body plays a role in early object name learning , ' lead author professor smith said
' the creation of a robot model for infant learning ( icub pictured ) ) has far - reaching implications for how the brains of young people work ' the humanoid called icub has been under development for 10 years
it is motivated by goals and can express six emotions on its face , including raising its eyebrows and generating a light - up smile
it was originally created by the italian institute of technology as part of the efaa project and has since been refined to crawl , walk and dance to music , manipulate objects in its hands , speak and express emotions
the robot 's goals and emotions change constantly , based on information picked up by sensors and it reacts appropriately a video recently posted by new scientist shows it playing a game of paddle war â a simple game where two players each hold a paddle - or in this case a cylinder - and try to score goals using a digital ball , while stopping their rival from scoring
the robot 's goals and emotions change constantly , based on information picked up by sensors and it reacts appropriately to whether it is winning or losing
when icub concedes a goal , it frowns and furrows its light - up eyebrows , sometimes swearing like an ill - tempered human
when it scores a goal , it smiles and says phrases like ' got it , ' although there is not much change in intonation whether a phrase is negative or positive
the video also shows how the robot can respond to being touched , a little bit like a slightly creepy human
when a human strokes its arms it affects icub 's reactions and emotions and the robot says on one occasion in the video : ' i like when you touch me this way '
tweaks to its software also mean that the robot is starting to understand language and can follow instructions that require reasoning , such as identifying two objects and moving them to a position , as instructed
she added that the experiments could provide a new way to investigate how cognition is connected to the body , as well as new evidence that thoughts , words and representations of objects are affected by the ' spatial relationship of the body within the surrounding world
' the research , ' posture affects how robots and infants map words to objects , ' is published in the journal plos one
professor smith said additional research is needed to determine whether this study 's results apply to just infants , or more broadly to the relationship between the brain , the body and memory
the study may also help learn more about developmental disorders , difficulties with motor coordination and cognitive development
