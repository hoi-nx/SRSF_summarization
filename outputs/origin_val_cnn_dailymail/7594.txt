matic has endured a difficult fortnight
he is , of course , pleased that chelsea won their first trophy in his time at the club , though his joy is tempered by missing the capital one cup final through suspension
and though he is now back from that two - match ban , he was part of the chelsea team which went out against 10 - man paris saint-germain in the champions league last 16 on wednesday
he earned his two - match ban for pushing over ashley barnes in fury after the burnley player executed an excessive shin - high challenge on him
matic received a red card and did nât even get the free - kick , ashley barnes went unpunished
ashley barnes commits a foul on nemanja matic but referee martin atkinson fails to blow for the foul matic was handed a two - match suspension for pushing burnley 's barnes at stamford bridge the 28 - year - old has missed chelsea 's last two games against tottenham hotspur and west ham due to suspension but matic maintains a degree of perspective
he is aware he is fortunate not to be have been injured far more seriously
â i was happy , to be honest , when i saw the video after the game as it was bad
and i am happy that i played against paris saint-germain
my reaction was not good but this reaction was because i thought i broke a leg
i am a happy man because i can walk , â he said
â i do nât like to say that i was right in my reaction
but this was a moment when you can not control your emotions
i saw it one time only ( on tv )
but these things happen in football
i hope that is the last time
â matic has been a revelation since returning to chelsea from portuguese side benfica last january matic will not discuss the fact that referee martin atkinson did not award a foul , let alone punish ashley barnes for the tackle
â i think that the referee saw because he was close but i think it âs not my job to comment on that , â he said
â people have been speaking about that , writing in newspapers
â asked whether ashley barnes had apologised , he said : â no. â before the visit of southampton on sunday , matic reflected on his ban and keeping focused
â it has been very hard , it is very difficult when you are not on the pitch , â he said
branislav ivanovic and nemanja matic with the trophy after the capital one cup final at wembley stadium â when you are on the pitch you can do something
when you are out , you are just watching and it is very difficult for me , i am not used to it
i hope this is the last time i am out
â it has been difficult
i was out but i was happy because we won two games
â matic is a candidate for player of the year , so impressive have his performances been since he came back to chelsea last january in a Â£ 22million deal , having initially been allowed to leave and join benfica in 2011
chelsea re-signed nemanja matic last january for Â£ 22million having previously been sold by the club in 2011 matic admitted it was hard to miss the capital one cup final win against tottenham hotspur matic does not attempt to gild the failure against paris saint-germain , and is aware of what is now required
â to be honest we did nât play well against paris saint-germain , â he admitted
â we played against one very good team with very good individuals but after the ibrahimovic red card maybe we thought it would be more â not easy â but easier for us as we had one player more
if you watched the whole game they deserved to go through
â now , we must win the premier league
we have to if we want to finish this as a good season
if we win the league we will have that and the capital one cup and it will be a good season
otherwise it is going to be bad
ibrahimovic is sent off for his part in a tackle with chelsea 's brazilian ace oscar chelsea 's players surround the referee as he sends off ibrahimovic ( second right ) in the first half â i know it is going to be difficult until the end
but manchester city also play difficult games
â if we win the premier league it âs going to be like a dream for us , because we know what we speak about every day and we know the premier league is something we have to win
we are not tired and we will be ready for the next 12 games
â none more so than matic
he knows how close he has come to missing out .
