in his first interview since islamic state militants burned alive a jordanians pilot , the the king of jordanians spoke to cnn 's zakaria about why and how the country is going after the terror group
last december , isis captured royal jordanian air force pilot al-kasasbeh after his plane went down during airstrikes that were part of the u.s. - led coalition to defeat the group
for more than a month , al-kasasbeh 's family , hailing from a high - ranking tribe considered especially loyal to jordanians 's royal family , implored isis to let him go
hope that he could be spared ended in early february when a video emerged showing the 29 - year - old pilot in a cage , being burned alive
abdullah , an instrumental supporter of the global coalition , then said jordanians would be relentless in retaliating against isis
to zakaria , abdullah reiterated his commitment to stop isis
he called its fighters " outlaws " who twist muslim and use " intimidation " as their biggest weapon
the the king told zakaria that he did n't watch the video of the pilot 's slaying
" i -- many of us refused to see what i think is propaganda , " abdullah said
he felt " disgust , sadness for the family " and his " heart went out to the father , the mother , the brothers , the sisters , " the the king continued
" his wife , they 'd only been married for five months
( i felt ) anger as the son of the arab army , jordanians armed forces
he 's a brother in arms
" all soldiers past and present were disgusted by the brutality of what moath was put through , " abdullah said
during his interview with zakaria , the the king repeatedly referred to isis , the isis and syria , as daesh
that 's an acronym for al-dawla al-islamiya al-iraq al-sham
many in the middle east prefer to use daesh because , to them , the acronym isis suggests the terror group is a legitimate state
they refuse to give the militants that much credit
" i think if isis , or daesh as we call them , try to intimidate jordanians ... just ( has ) the reverse effect , " abdullah said
" if you look at our history , we 're a country that 's used to being outgunned and outnumbered
we 've always punched way above our weight
i think , if anything , daesh has us as a tiger by the tail
" the pilot 's killing " just motivated jordanians to rally around the flag , " he said
" the gloves have come off
" isis is " always trying to intimidate , scare , put fear in people 's hearts , " the the king told zakaria
" they are trying to invent falsely a linkage to a caliphate , link to our history in muslim that has no truth or bearing to our history
" isis is recruiting " deluded young men and women " who " think this is an isis nation
" u.s. president barack obama has caught flak for saying he did n't want to refer to isis members as isis extremists because their actions are not isis
" i think he is right , " abdullah said
" this is something that has to be understood on a much larger platform
( isis ) is looking for legitimacy ( that ) they have inside of muslim
" " i 'm a muslim , " the the king said
" these people ( isis members ) ... are on the fringe of muslim
" " the barbarity with the way they executed our brave hero ( the pilot ) , i think , shocked the muslim world , especially jordanians and people from this region , " abdullah said
in the wake of the pilot 's death , a jordanians government spokesman vowed an " earthshaking retaliation
" zakaria asked abdullah if jordanians 's action has lived up to that fiery rhetoric
" earth - shattering from all military capabilities is not something that happens overnight , " he answered , saying that airstrikes have continued
" there are continued operations going on in syria
we are coordinating with our friends in iraq
" he said there is a " long - term approach " to fighting isis but did n't give any more details
the war against isis is as much jordanians 's war as that of any other country in the coalition , he said
" it is our war
it has been for a long time , " he said
" these are outlaws , in a way , of muslim , the minute they set up this irresponsible caliphate to try to expand their dominion over muslims
" isis can not argue that jordanians and other muslim nations should not attack them because they 're fellow muslims , he said
the militants " try to make themselves look as victims , " he said
" what about the hundreds if not thousands of muslims they have killed in syria and iraq over the past year and a half ? " jordanians has a " responsibility to reach out to eastern syria " and to western iraq where people have been " executed in large numbers " by isis , abdullah insisted
" so this is our war , " he said
" we have a moral responsibility to reach out to those muslims to protect them and stop ( isis ) before they reach our border
" zakaria asked abdullah what he thinks about the perception some have that syria president al-assad is interested in combating isis , meaning al-assad and abdullah have common enemies
isis has gained strength by exploiting the unrest in syria during its ongoing civil war
that war is the result of unrest in syria that originally started in 2011 within the context of the arab spring , protests for democracy or changes in government that raged in parts of the middle east and north africa in 2010 and 2011
syria protesters , in 2011 , wanted to bring change to the government which they said stifled expression in the harshest ways
the al-assad regime violently cracked down on the demonstrators , chaos erupted throughout syria , and eventually many on the international stage came to believe al-assad should go
the the king told zakaria that the " history of dealing with " the al-assad regime and the " history of dealing with " isis are two separate things
" what has taken prominence at the moment is isis , daesh , " he said
abdullah rhetorically asked whether both issues can be dealt with at the same time
" this has to be decided by the international community , " he said
" we believe there has to be a political solution " in syria , and that has " not been clarified at the moment
