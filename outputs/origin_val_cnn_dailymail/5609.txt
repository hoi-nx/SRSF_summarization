the fda is keeping a bold - letter warning on pfizer 's anti-smoking drug chantix about suicidal behavior and other psychiatric side effects , after reviewing company findings suggesting the drug does not increase those problems
the twice - a - day tablet has carried the fda 's strongest warning label since 2009 , following reports of suicidal tendencies and violent or bizarre behavior among some patients
the fda on monday outlined several updates to chantix 's labeling , including a new warning about its potential interaction with alcohol
some patients have reported unusual or aggressive behavior when drinking while on chantix
caution : anti-smoking drug chantix has carried the fda 's strongest warning label since 2009 , following reports of suicidal tendencies and violent or bizarre behavior among some patients ' the fda ( fda ) is warning that the prescription smoking cessation medicine chantix ( varenicline ) can change the way people react to alcohol , ' the agency said
' in addition , rare accounts of seizures in patients treated with chantix have been reported
we have approved changes to the chantix label to warn about these risks
until patients know how chantix affects their ability to tolerate alcohol , they should decrease the amount of alcohol they drink
patients who have a seizure while taking chantix should stop the medicine and seek medical attention immediately
' the updated labeling also includes information from several studies and analyses conducted by pfizer that found no difference in psychiatric problems between people taking chantix and other stop - smoking treatments
' these studies did not show an increased risk of neuropsychiatric side effects with chantix ; however , they did not examine all types of neuropsychiatric side effects , and they had limitations that prevented us from drawing reliable conclusions , ' the fda said
last year pfizer proposed that the fda remove chantix 's so - called black box warning based on the company 's findings and other data
warning : the fda on monday outlined several updates to chantix 's labeling , including a new warning about its potential interaction with alcohol
some patients have reported unusual or aggressive behavior when drinking while on chantix the agency 's update follows the recommendation of a panel of outside experts , who voted last october to keep the boxed warning on the drug until it can be reevaluated based on new information
new york - based pfizer is expected to complete a larger study of chantix 's psychiatric side effects in late 2015
chantix 's safety has been debated in medical journals and courtrooms since 2007 , when reports of suicide , agitation and other problems first began streaming into the fda
the drug 's labeling currently tells patients to stop taking chantix immediately if they experience agitation , depressed mood , suicidal thinking and other behavioral changes
doctors are advised to weigh the drug 's risks against its potential benefits of helping patients quit smoking
pfizer 's drug works by binding to the same spots in the brain that are activated by nicotine when people smoke
the drug , known generically as varenicline , blocks nicotine from binding to those spots and prevents the release of ' feel - good ' brain chemicals that make smoking so addictive .
