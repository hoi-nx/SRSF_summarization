having concentrated on her career up until her mid 30s , claire had still not met mr right and was conscious that her biological clock was ticking
with a professional career under her belt and financially stable , the photographer decided she wanted a baby of her own - and decided to adopt. after sailing through the process , she was shown a video of a little boy who melted her heart
â he was sitting down and then suddenly he smiled and that was it , â claire said
claire was delighted when she was told she could adopt a baby boy â i did nât want any child with a disability as i was a single adopter and i could nât facilitate that
â it said in his child performance report that he was a healthy , babbling baby boy and i was thrilled when i was told i could collect him
â it was such a special day and he was going to be my very special boy , i was very excited
â claire knew that her child had some mild developmental delay but said she felt optimistic
â i thought he could nât crawl because he had been in care and thought with a bit of determination and one - to - one care from me , it was only a matter of time
â having only seen the video and some photographs , claire , who is now 40 , started to worry when she met him and took him home two weeks later : ' â i was concerned about the shape of his head
it seemed to be very flat at the back , but even then , i did nât know what was to come , â
she said looking back , alarm bells should have rung sooner that there was something seriously wrong with her son
â he did nât do anything you would expect a child of his age to do , â she said
â he could nât roll over , he could nât talk or crawl and had very poor muscle tone
â the look of love : claire plays with the little boy she handed back to social services after the tot started suffering as many as 36 seizures a day she took him to speech therapy and would encourage him constantly , but said he never missed her if she went out of the room and did nât speak at all , other than one word , â mummy â
having adopted him in 2011 , claire had persevered and the little boy learnt to walk
however , having been to visit her parents in the lake district in october 2012 , claire âs world began to disintegrate
â i âd just pulled into a petrol station in preston when i turned around and he was in the back of the car and started to jolt - he was having a seizure
it was one of the most terrifying moments of my life
â claire took many photographs of the little boy in the two years he spent with her , including this one unfortunately , it was the first of many seizures which eventually resulted in him going to great ormond street hospital in london
â he had neurological damage , or brain damage , and had been born that way , â claire said
â he was having 36 seizures a day and his epilepsy was a symptom of something much bigger
he did nât know who i was
â at one point we were sleeping downstairs with a bag packed , always ready for the ambulance
his seizures were out of control
â he had breathing difficulties and once was in a coma
at one point it was thought he might even die
â it was very , very stressful and i had reached the end of my physical and mental strength
â claire said she felt she had no option but to call social workers who she said agreed with medics that he could no longer be cared for at home
â it was a heartbreaking decision , i loved him , â she said
â it âs certainly not something i took lightly at all , but i had nothing more to give and had to hand him back
â however , claire said that although social workers had agreed she could nât care for him , a legal â care order â is needed to hand a child back which she says implies the parents are at fault as they can not look after it
claire said she was so incensed , she went to court to win a â no fault â ruling , thus ensuring there would be no negative reflection on her , crucial if she wanted to adopt again
â i had to give him back through no fault of my own , and i wanted a record of that , â she says
claire is hoping her website will provide support to anyone else going through adoption disruption
picture posed by models now claire has launched a website called adoption disruption to provide support for others for whom adoption breaks down
â sometimes it just does nât work out and parents have no choice but to return their children , whether they are babies or teenagers , â claire said
â more needs to be done around care orders as it âs not always the fault of parents that they have to hand their children back
â claire said that the little boy is now living in a home environment where he is cared for by four people around - the - clock
currently embarking on a new adoption journey , claire hopes to be approved to adopt another child in six months â time
â i âm hoping to have a child between three and six years old , â she said
â i âm very hopeful for the future and through my website , i hope i can help support someone who might be feeling as isolated as i did , â she added .
