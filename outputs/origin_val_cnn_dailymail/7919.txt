' as a youth worker for many years i am largely immune to the occasional stupidity and vandalism perpetrated by young people , it 's usually thoughtless high spirits aggravated by lager or pot , but i witnessed an act that chilled me
' because there appear to be no other instances of vandalism , perhaps this was a deliberate political statement
' but that flag was a constant reminder of the sacrifices of many
