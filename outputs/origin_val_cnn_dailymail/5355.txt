hundreds of children were exposed to meningitis , measles and other diseases after vaccinations were stored in a faulty fridge hundreds of children were left exposed to meningitis , measles , mumps and rubella after vaccinations to protect against the diseases were stored in a faulty fridge
a letter has been sent to the parents of children treated at the brierley medical practice , near barnsley , revealing the vaccinations were stored incorrectly for five years
it warns that while a vaccine stored at the wrong temperature was not harmful , it may be less effective than normal
staff can not therefore be certain that children vaccinated at the practice from january 2009 and june 2014 are adequately protected
nhs england said a total of 515 children are affected , but only 351 are still registered at the surgery
those no longer registered at brierley will receive a letter from their new practice
hardwick 's daughter scarlett brown , one , will need every injection she 's had since birth re-doing
these include vaccines against polio , whooping cough , meningitis , pneumonia , measles , mumps and rubella
ms hardwick , 23 , said : ' i was disgusted
it 's upset me knowing we are going to have to go through that again with her
' it 's disgusting that from 2009 to 2014 they could not have found a fault in all that time - they should have picked it up before now
' i 'm not happy at all and i 'm in the process of changing to another doctor because of this situation
' another mother , seargent , recently left the brierley practice
but her 16 - month - old daughter skylar-jade hill was vaccinated at brierley
ms seargent , 36 , said : ' i 've not even received a letter
i phoned brierley surgery and was told to contact my health visitor
' but my health visitor did n't have a clue about it
i phoned my own gp and they were n't aware of it
' i 'm worried because i do n't know if my daughter is covered or not
' the surgery was taken over by a new health care team in july
a statement on the practice website reads : ' the practice has already benefited from various improvements since the take over and the trust is continuing to try and improve the practice buildings as well as planned vast improvements in patient care
' the surgery was previously run by dr selim and partners
dr selim had been the subject of several private hearings of the medical practitioners ' tribunal service and restrictions to his practice had been made
nhs england said a total of 515 children are affected
a letter sent to parents of the affected children warns that while a vaccine stored at the wrong temperature was not harmful , it may be less effective than normal
among the vaccines stored incorrectly was one for meningitis , pictured under the microscope among the restrictions imposed was that dr selim be monitored by another doctor
fiona jorden , consultant in public health for nhs england , yorkshire and humber , said : ' we would like to offer our apologies for any concern that has been caused to patients and their families by this incident
' once the problem was discovered , all affected patients were identified and contacted as soon as possible
' the vaccinations given to patients will not have caused them any harm and may have provided some protection against infections
' however , as a precautionary measure and to ensure they have the optimum protection the vaccines have to offer , all affected patients have now been encouraged to make an appointment to receive further vaccinations as required
' nhs england is committed to commissioning high - quality primary care services for patients
' a number of sessions for re-vaccination have been organised for registered patients throughout march .
