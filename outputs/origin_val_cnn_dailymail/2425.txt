a pampering few hours spent at the hair salon can you make you feel like a million dollars
unfortunately , the bill at the end for a cut , colour and blow dry can feel like it is making a million dollar dent in your bank account
now , a hair salon is offering clients the option of investing in a hair ' savings account ' with weekly direct debit payments that can be used to pay for their hair appointments
starting from $ 20 per week , clients contribute regular payments to their fund , which they make a withdrawal from to pay for their salon service
rather than saving up for months to afford their hair appointment , clients opt in to invest as much as they want over the $ 20 minimum per week , depending on how ' high maintenance ' their hairstyle is
a platinum blonde requiring regular touch ups would contribute more per week than someone with a low - maintenance colour
weekly investment : the brand likens the regular contributions to a gym membership promotion : the future hair fund is currently available in 36 salons across australian editor of cult beauty website gritty pretty eleanor pendleton is the face of the new promotion , and likens the service to ' lay - by for your hair '
she says : ' the toni&guy future hair fund will make large service bills a thing of the past by providing the opportunity for flexible payment options
' australian women ( and men ) continue to seek financial efficiency within their lifestyle choices without wanting to compromise on service quality
' new or existing clients activate the service with an initial consultation to determine the type of services they require , and book in for regular appointments in advance
if the client wants additional services ( for example , stopping in for a blow dry , or extra highlights ) and they do n't have enough in their fund to cover the service , they can simply top it up with a one - off payment
