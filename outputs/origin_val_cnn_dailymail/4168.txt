a report found staff at homerton hospital were slow to recognise patients deteriorating , and suffered breakdowns in communication an investigation into a hospital where four women died in 12 months before or during childbirth has found a series of concerns , it has been revealed
inspectors from the nhs 's london clinical senate found that staff at homerton hospital , hackney , were slow at recognising patients were deteriorating , and identified breakdowns in communication
their report identified common themes in some but not all of the deaths , including a lack of involvement from consultants
the findings came after two unannounced inspections by the cqc , following the death of a fifth woman in january this year , reports the evening standard
the first fatality occurred in 2013 , when pat williams passed away following a caesarean section procedure which she elected to have
a subsequent report found that she was over 40 , obese , had previously miscarried and had a large fibroid in her uterus
adeline keh , 40 , was the next to die in october the same year after she contracted a fatal infection following a caesarean at homerton
she was transferred from the east london medical centre to a specialist heart and lung unit in cambridge , but died after she refused a blood transfusion because she was a jehova 's witness
a report into her death found that her refusal ' may have compromised the final medical intervention ' in order to save her life
it was listed as a cause of death alongside acute respiratory distress syndrome , sepsis and an infection of the caesarean wound
the third and fourth deaths occurred in march and june last year , at which point the cqc began investigating , and the london clinical senate was called in after a fifth death in january this year

she contracted an infection after a caesarean , and refused a blood transfusion because she was a jehova 's witness in the whole of england and wales in 2013 there were just 47 maternal deaths during pregnancy , childbirth and the six - week period following birth - out of almost 700,000 deliveries

we have to devote all of our efforts to learning lessons

in response to the findings , staff at homerton have been given extra training and consultant cover on wards has been increased to 98 hours a week .
