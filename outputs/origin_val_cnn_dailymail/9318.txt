i only feel pressure when i do nât see my team playing the right way
all the other things are not important

that was what ( chief executive ) ferran soriano said to the media
but that does nât have to be one a year
â there are different ways of analysing things
winning trophies is only one of them
maybe last year nobody thought we were going to win the title but we did
to think about the future is the worst thing
i do nât do that
the most important thing is to continue playing with the same style

i know what âs best for this team
it âs not my duty to tell the media what they must think
â manchester city âs owners are desperate for success , especially in europe , and have spent tens of millions trying to improve the squad following their first premier league title success in 2012
asked about his relationship with the manchester city board , pellegrini added : â it âs not about relationships
i could have a bad relationship with the owners but it âs about how you manage this project
â every project can have difficult moments
you have the wrong opinion about the owners
they are not so desperate to win titles , they want to improve
they do want to win titles but they want to do it the right way
what âs important to me is how you win titles
