qpr director of football ferdinand has called for a rooney rule - style law to be introduced in english football to challenge what he believes is a ' lack of diversity ' in the game
fa chairman greg dyke was first to suggest the adoption of the american system - which requires nfl teams to interview at least one minority candidate for each head coaching role - in 2014
and now ferdinand has reopened the debate by insisting it could be the best way to give prospective black managers the confidence to aspire to positions they currently feel are beyond them
qpr director of football ferdinand would like to see the introduction of a rooney rule - style law the qpr director of football believes there is a lack of diversity in english football ferdinand told sky sports : ' we 're not saying you have to give anybody the job - we 're just saying " give us an interview " - that 's all
' it 's just a case of being able to sit down and put your credentials on the table
at the moment we 're not even getting that chance
' people often talk and say " i 'm not racist " and do n't even realise that they are being racist because they wo n't give you that opportunity
' you may have already decided who your next manager is going to be but if i sit down in front of you i might impress you so much that you might recommend me to someone else
' fa chairman greg dyke was first to suggest the adoption of the american system in 2014 ferdinand wants black managers to be given the opportunity to showcase their credentials at interviews greg dyke 's support for the rooney rule was not shared by others in the game with premier league chief executive richard scudamore rejecting the idea
but ferdinand 's views are shared by anti-racist campaigners kick it out , which told sky sports news : ' the access to opportunities for employment in football continue to be out of reach for many
the recruitment procedures are flawed , and there is a lack of accountability and transparency in the processes
' we need to see a level playing field established where individuals possessing the necessary qualifications and experience are able to apply and be taken into proper consideration for positions
' as it stands , many credible candidates who are suitable for jobs do not feel it is worthwhile applying as they see a closed culture which exists preventing them from having a fair chance
' the league managers association supports the implementation of a rooney rule - style law , and a spokesman said : ' the lma is committed to the fundamental principle of equal opportunities for anyone , from any background , who wishes to work and build a career , as a manager or coach , in professional football and we are focussed on the need to increase the number of managers from black and ethnic minorities who have coaching or management qualifications
