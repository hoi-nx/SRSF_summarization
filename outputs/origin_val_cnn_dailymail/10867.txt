the 200 - year - old note was uncovered as part of renovation works at the 16th century eastgate house in rochester , kent written in copper - plate handwriting , it is thought to have been written by a former pupil at the victorian girl 's boarding school addressing ' my dear little girl ' , the author - who signs their name simply as n brunenell - appears to forgive the recipient for some long - forgotten upset
it was then stashed under the floorboards and forgotten for more than 200 years
built in the 16th century as a private home , the building has since been used as a victorian boarding school , a young men 's hostel , a restaurant and a museum
my dear little girl , i am very willing to excuse you
no my dear girl i bear no malice i will come present - ly and kiss you if that will do any good
allow me to remain , my dear your friend that you are n brunenell other theories surrounding the letter suggest it may be a love note from a resident to his sweetheart during the building 's use as a hostel
but the grade i listed building is most notable for its association with celebrated english writer charles dickens
the victorian social critic is likely to have visited the building which he featured as westgate in the pickwick papers and as the nun 's eastgate house in the mystery of edwin drood
most recently the historic property was used as a dickens museum and the famous swiss chalet , where the writer penned several of his novels , was relocated from gad 's hill in the 1960s
a multi-million pound conservation project is under way to bring the building back into public use and create a community space with improved visitor facilities and access

the 16th century eastgate house was built for sir buck , mayor of medway eastgate house was built in the 1590s for sir buck , mayor of medway and clerk of the cheque at chatham dockyard
five generations of the buck family were associated with the house until 1687 where it passed into the hands of the parkers , and later the bartholomews
in 1761 the house was held by annabel darwin , but possibly let to tenants
it passed to james reed in 1791 who is thought to have originally founded the school
by 1841 it was under the governorship of rebecca norton and there were 14 boarders
it was in this guise that charles dickens incorporated it - as ' the nuns ' house ' - into his last , unfinished , novel the mystery of edwin drood
eastgate house also features as the westgate seminary for young ladies in the pickwick papers
eastgate house once again became a private dwelling in the 1870s , being the home of samuel shaw , a wholesale coal merchant
its transition to a young men 's hostel in 1890 appears to have been fairly brief as it had become a temperance restaurant by 1897 when rochester city council resolved to turn it into a municipal library and museum in celebration of queen victoria 's diamond jubilee
in 1923 an extension to the museum , a new formal garden and a caretaker 's cottage - ' eastgate cottage ' - were added
the dickens chalet was relocated here from cobham hall in 1961
in 1979 the museum was moved to the guildhall , and eastgate house became the dickens centre , with displays devoted to the author 's life and works
the dickens centre closed on 31st october 2004
work is now underway , with funding from the heritage lottery fund , to transform the house into an exhibition centre for art and history events .
