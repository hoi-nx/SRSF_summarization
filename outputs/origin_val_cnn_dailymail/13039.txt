ben carson suggested to cnn on wednesday that prisons can turn straight people gay
former arkansas governor huckabee called being gay a lifestyle choice , like drinking alcohol
i guess the next thing these two presumed 2016 presidential hopefuls will tell america is being black is a choice , too
like it or not , it 's no wonder bush is emerging as the gop 's 2016 frontrunner
of course , there is that awkward little name thing , something he seems fully aware of -- despite only being in the exploratory phase of a potential campaign , bush has already declared he 's not just another bush
" a lot of people know my dad , they know my brother
as in everybody 's family , we 're all a little different , " he reportedly told a crowd in las vegas this week
and he seems to keep trying to distance himself from his family
" do you have brothers and sisters ? are you exactly the same ? " he insisted
yet bush is banking hard on the same vault of donors and operatives his father george h. w bush and his brother george w. bush used in their presidential campaigns
he 's already raising lots of money , asking donors recently not to give more than a still eye - popping $ 1 million to his super pac
" they did n't need to be persuaded , " howard leach , a gop fundraiser for bush , told the washington post
so , what exactly is in a name like bush ? apparently , a whole lot of cash , which helps win presidential nominations and elections
and if bush wins the nomination in 2016 , it will likely be less " joyfully , " as he promised last year , than ruthlessly
after all , we 're still more than 18 months from the election and bush 's locking in many of the same kinds of consultants that worked with his brother and father
" those who hold out can sense a distinct chill , " noted a recent times article
bush 's campaign is seeking to hire " donors , advisors and operatives , " wrote the times , with " deep connections to the bush family 's past presidential campaigns and administrations
" those same family members from whom bush swears he 's different ? and if consultants do n't abide by bush 's rules of loyalty and decide to work with other 2016 gop aspirants ? " swift rebuke follows , " the times notes , pointing to the example of imge , a technology company that reportedly fell out of favor with the bush campaign after one of the firm 's founders indicated imge was hoping not to be tied to a single candidate
none of this is to suggest that bush does n't have appeal as a candidate -- i like some of the things he did as florida governor , like his record of cutting $ 19 billion in taxes and supporting school choice programs
( although i 'm not a fan of his willingness to grant illegal immigrants amnesty in any shape , fashion or form
) he seems more equipped to lead america and get things done than some others in the already cramped horse race like new jersey gov. chris christie , who seems more concerned with telling people off than sounding presidential
then there 's rick santorum and huckabee , caring christian men , but both too consumed with running for president of morality than bringing the entire country together after years of obama supposedly dividing us on race , religion and sexuality
but what troubles me a little about bush 's early attempts at " corning the market " is that he 's relying on the same consultants that have cycled through the last 20 - plus years of elections -- some of whom worked for romney 's campaign
this raises the question of why , if bush does n't want the public to view him as just another bush running for president , he seems to be relying on the bush network of consultants ? the same playbook that helped get his brother and father get elected president is n't going to work for this bush
the demographics of the country have changed , but it seems unlikely the gop and its operatives have changed with it
the truth is that any gop candidate who wins the nomination will have to refrain from business as usual
he ( let 's face it , the gop wo n't nominate a woman ) will have to hire minorities and women in meaningful campaign positions and have a strategy to aggressively compete for minority votes
this is something romney did n't do nearly enough of
bush is only in the " pre-presidential " phase , ruminating over the idea
but he appears to be assembling a lot of the same old ( white ) faces of recent losing gop campaigns we 've seen before
as a black conservative who would like to see a gop in the white house again , i hope bush is n't romney 2.0 .
