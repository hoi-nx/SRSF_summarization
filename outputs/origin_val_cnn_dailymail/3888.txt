arsenal manager wenger has warned against a quota - based system being used in the premier league believing it will dilute the quality of the division
fa chairman greg dyke would like to see the number of home - grown players in top - flight squads increased from eight to 12 , a move he feels will benefit the national team
premier league chief executive richard scudamore claims clubs were told by greg dyke at a meeting on thursday that the fa could not impose the change
arsenal manager wenger has spoken out against a quota - based system for home grown players and wenger believes those changes will not benefit the league or the national team
in an interview with bein sports , wenger said : ' i believe that we are in the world of competition
competition means who of you or me is the best one
we have to accept that
' that means as well that the rules of the game must be structured to favour the best
or we are not in a competition anymore
the arsenal boss , on the bench at newcastle before the international break , is against greg dyke 's proposals ' so we can say one of two things - we protect the mediocre or we produce the best players
' wenger warned that similar schemes in other countries had led to young players becoming ' professional subs ' , not enhancing their development but downgrading the league standard
' i give you two examples , he said
' in yugoslavia in the past they decided you had to play three players on the team sheet who were under 21
what happened ? they became professional subs
it happened in france , too
fa chairman greg dyke would like to see at least 12 home - grown players in top - flight squads ' then they decided you had to play three players ( aged ) under 21 from the start
you know what happened ? they subbed all three after five minutes
' greg dyke 's proposal to toughen up home - grown player rules has the backing of uefa president michel platini , who hinted that he intends to follow suit
should uefa implement the regulations , then the premier league would likely have to back down
