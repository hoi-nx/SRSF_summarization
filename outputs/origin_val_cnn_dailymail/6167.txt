fellows , head of birmingham county fa , confirmed the allegations , and said any players found guilty will face serious consequences a christian football team has been forced to fold after players were accused of singing ' we 're racist and that 's the way we like it ' in a changing room while a black referee was nearby
pye green towers have disbanded after they were allegedly caught singing the chant , the same one the chelsea supporters were recorded shouting on the paris metro last month
the players are said to have begun the chant while in the changing rooms of eramus darwin academy in burntwood , stafforshire , while a black referee was getting changed next door
the official was so shaken by the incident that he called for a league official to provide support during the league match against methodists last month
the methodists won 3 - 1 but the result has since been declared as void
last month chelsea supporters were filmed in paris , where their team were playing paris saint-germain in the champions league , bellowing the same song , while stopping a black man from boarding a busy paris metro train
birmingham county fa yesterday confirmed the accusations , which flies in the face of the league 's mission statement
the league was formed in 1979 ' to enable christian and non-christian men alike to participate in a capably organised league in a manner , both on and off the field of play , that is morally , decently and ethically sound of action and speech and is honouring to the name of jesus christ '
birmingham county fa discipline manager fellows said individuals found guilty of racism will face serious consequences
any fine imposed will be divided up among individual players and club officials
mr fellows , an experienced referee himself , said : ' incidents such as the one alleged here will not be tolerated , they will not be tolerated at all
' they have no place in the game or our society
we have witnessed a rise in race and gender - related complaints
' that does not mean more are taking place , it means individuals have more confidence in the way we tackle the issue and are coming forward
' we will continue to prove that confidence is justified by hitting culprits hard , very hard indeed
' on its website , the league wrote : ' following discussions between the league and pye green towers , we can confirm that they have left the league with immediate effect
pye green towers football club , which has historic associations with pye green christian centre ( pictured ) , has now left the league ' all league records will be expunged for this season regarding division two matches that they played in
fixtures and league tables have already been adjusted accordingly
' league secretary neil kovacs said : ' i spoke to the club and they did agree that it was not acceptable
from a christian point of view , it has no place in football and no place in society
' we both agreed that the club 's position in the league was untenable
they immediately folded the club
' the 54 - year - old declined to go into detail about the incident , but admitted : ' something did happen on the day which is now the subject of birmingham county fa disciplinary procedure
' the referee did go into the dressing room and say it was not acceptable
' he has thanked the league for the support offered on the day and the support that followed
he is staying with us
we are honest and straightforward
the players were alleged to have used the same racist chant chelsea supports were filmed using while pushing a black man off the paris metro last month ' it is a shame that the good work - we have raised Â£ 14,000 in 10 years for charity - does n't get reported , but this does
' a pye green towers supporter , who does not wish to be named , argued the controversy has been blown out of proportion
he said : ' as i understand it , a player was trying to explain what he 'd seen on youtube
' dave spencer , of pye green christian centre , said his organisation has had no involvement with the football club for a number of years
he said : ' historically , there was some involvement , but not now
there is no one from here who plays for the team or runs it
