' the whole process has been such an amazing learning experience and this is my favourite collection ever
i love the black suede jacket and print maxi dress , i am going to be getting a lot of wear out of the collection come summer , ' she said
millie , who is ' gutted ' that she ca n't attend glastonbury because it clashes with two weddings she has on , will be rocking her designs at coachella festival , as well as on her upcoming trips to morocco and istanbul
you 're also likely to catch her showbiz pals donning her designs - and she says seeing her friends such as millie and zara martin wearing her collection is the ' ultimate compliment '
millie 's new range is full of bold floral patterns , hippy chic maxi dresses and the kind of festival fashion staples that she 's made her signature millie wore this gorgeous tasseled jacket which would be perfect for throwing over a dress for a festival posing on location in marrakesh in the new campaign imagery to promote her designs , millie shows her fans how to work the looks - and she maintains it 's all about letting your inner hippie out
' when it comes to summer dressing , you 've just got to have fun with it

' as well as style expertise , millie , who trained as a make - up artist before finding fame , is a beauty buff with her own eyelash range
sharing her top beauty tips for flawless summer skin , the star - a self - confessed sun worshiper - says spf is essential

whilst she 's confident enough posting videos of her squatting , boxing and participating in the oh - so - fashionable but gruelling sbc class , there 's one class millie is afraid of trying
' i really want to try this music video dance class at frame studios but i am too embarrassed
i think it would be really fun and i probably need to learn to just let go of my inhibitions ! '

if that was n't enough , she 's hoping to expand her eyelash range next year , is already working on her autumn / winter 15 collection and has some exciting health and fitness projects in the pipeline
