' the worst comment i 've had is that our kids will grow two heads and we should go to tasmania , ' she said
' even last week i had a confrontation with a woman at my children 's school
she told me i should be shot and my kids taken away from us
' if what everybody said bothered us , we would n't be together

he got my mobile number off my brother and we started texting and chatting over msn
' lyle and kirstie whose father 's are brothers first met at a family wedding in perth when she was nine years old because they lived in different states the couple tried to suppress their feelings when they were teenagers and eventually kept their feelings secret from their family for a number of years kirstie said she constantly pushed her feelings for lyle aside because she knew they were related

' up until my aunt 's funeral there was the occasional time where i wished we were n't cousins
but we grew closer and by then i knew he was n't just a cousin
' i had really strong feelings for him
' their first kiss was in kirstie 's bedroom while they were watching tv one night
' i 'm the only girl of three boys so they were very protective , but they did n't think anything of him being in my room because he was my cousin
' from then on when we met up there were kisses and cuddles when no one was watching
' they talked several times about becoming a couple , but kirstie often got cold feet because she was worried what people would think

i even had my first daughter with another guy , ' she said
' that relationship ended and lyle was just at that point where he wanted to be together
' i took my daughter to visit him in queensland - he 'd moved there a few years before
that 's when we just gave up trying to ignore everything

' he bought me a ring that day and we got engaged , ' kirstie said
