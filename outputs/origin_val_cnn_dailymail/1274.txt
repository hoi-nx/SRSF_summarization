kane is likely to play a role for england in their euro 2016 qualifier against lithuania on friday kane has scored 29 goals in all competitions for tottenham so far this season england manager roy hodgson says kane will make his entry into full international football this week ' statistics speak for themselves , ' he said
' i know kane has scored 29 goals in all competitions so that fact speaks for itself
i 've seen him play at international level for england under-21s , he played in lithuania recently and he is a strong forward
' lithuania visit wembley having won two of their opening four group e qualifying campaign fixtures , with only goal difference keeping them out of the top two
but igoris pankratjevas knows his players face a unique test in north london and singled out england skipper rooney as a danger man
igoris pankratjevas says his side are realistic about their chances of causing an upset at wembley igoris pankratjevas says that england captain rooney is the anchor of roy hodgson 's side ' we are quite realistic about it , ' he said when asked about his side 's chances at wembley
' we are not dreamers , it is always history that lithuania are playing england for the first time ever
obviously none of the players have played at such a stage so we are preparing them mentally for this kind of game
' i like the england team in general recently as they have some new players along with their experienced ones
the new players give them more creativity
he is still the anchor
he has over 100 caps and he is a top player
' with key man arvydas novikovas missing through injury , igoris pankratjevas admits he is yet to finalise his starting xi for the fixture - revealing he has ' 80 per cent ' of his team , with the rest to be decided on friday
the lithuania squad trained on the wembley pitch on thursday ahead of the qualifier meanwhile , marius zaliukas will be tasked with keeping the likes of rooney and kane quiet if lithuania are to get a result and the rangers defender is hoping to prove wrong those in scotland who expect him to return to ibrox having been on the receiving end of a heavy loss
' everyone in scotland is laughing because they think it will be a big score , ' he said
' we want to disappoint them
every weekend i am watching the premier league
we all understand the kind of players we are going to see tomorrow , that makes it more special
we are not playing these teams every month or every year
' lithuania are playing england for the first time at senior international level
