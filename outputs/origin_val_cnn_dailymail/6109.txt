robbie neilson wants his hearts team to surpass hibernian 's second - tier points total hearts ended up securing their title a day after a 3 - 0 win against falkirk rangers beat hibernian to give hearts an unassailable advantage at the top of the league but , despite the league being finally in the bag , the 34 - year - old vowed there will be no let - up as hearts hope to usurp hibernian â record tally of 89 points , set under alex mcleish in 1999
should his team rise to his challenge of winning their remaining seven matches , the rampant gorgie outfit would end the season with a remarkable 99 points
â it âs a fantastic achievement to win the league
it âs a great day for the club , â said robbie neilson
â the objective for the season was to get promoted
we âve done that and that will give us a head start in planning for next season â but we need to keep winning games
â we âve got seven games left and we want maximum points
we wo nât be losing focus
if we could set a new record for points for the division , then that would be fantastic
â when you play for a club with the stature of hearts , you have to keep winning games â and that âs what we need to do
â i will rotate the squad and some guys will get game time but you have to win games
we ca nât be turning up at venues and losing games
we want to win , starting with three more points against queen of the south at tynecastle next weekend
â robbie neilson believes his side âs 2 - 1 stoppage - time win at ibrox against rangers on the opening day of the season set the tone for a fine campaign
but it was nât until a battling 2 - 1 victory at queen of the south on february 21 that he truly believed his side was destined to win the league and return to the top flight after one season away
â i do nât think you ever take things for granted until you are over the line , â he said
â but i think that queen of the south game was a big one for us away from home
we went a goal behind and we had to fight back to get all three points
we eventually got there and , from then on , i thought we had a real chance of taking the league
â but that win against rangers on the opening day was a huge one for us in terms of morale and also for our fans
a lot of times you can go to ibrox , go ahead and then rangers draw level and you âre then hoping to hang on for a draw
hearts ' genero zeefuik celebrates after giving his side two - goal lead against falkirk the hearts players celebrate as they beat falkirk and edged closer to an impressive title win â but we went straight up the park and scored again to get all three points and that set the tone for the whole season
it gave us a real belief we could go on to win the trophy and now we âve done it
â to finally get over the line is magnificent
the players have worked so hard and i could nât have asked for more
â we can now speak to players we want to get from outside the club and speak to players at the club and try to renegotiate
we âve got guys who have been fantastic for us and we want to keep hold of them
â it âs just a great day and it âs testament to the support we âve had all season from the fans , the hard work of ( owner ) ann budge and ( director of football ) craig levein and all the players
â the fans in particular have been magnificent and they deserve to have a great night and a great few weeks
â meanwhile , hearts captain danny wilson admitted it was a relief to finally get over the line after months of being billed as champions - in - waiting
hearts captain danny wilson revealed his joy after his side became scottish championship winners â it has been difficult , you know , â he said
â since maybe late december and early january people have had us installed as champions
so it âs been tough , not so much to keep your standards up but to put all that talk to one side
but we âve done that
â the way the season has panned out , we âve been going about our business in the right fashion
but if you had asked me at the start of the season whether i thought the gap would have been this big , i probably would nât have believed you
