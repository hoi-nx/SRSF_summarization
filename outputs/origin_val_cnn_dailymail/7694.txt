the 23 - year - old man was arrested on wednesday on suspicion of offences linked to data stolen from a messaging service used by department of defense employees around the world
contact information for around 800 people including name , title , e-mail addresses and phone numbers , as well as details for around 34,400 devices were obtained during the attack last june , the national crime agency said
following the attack , the hacker posted screenshots taken from the dashboard used to control the database as well as a bizarre message on the text storage website pastebin
it read : ' we smite the lizards , lizardsquad your time is near
we 're in your bases , we control your satellites
' the missiles shall rein upon thy who claim alliance , watch your heads , * * t-47 until lift off
we 're one , we 're many , we lurk in the dark , we 're everywhere and anywhere
' live free die hard ! department of defense , disa emss : enhanced mobile satellite services is not all , department of defense has no defenses
' campaign : national crime agency officers force their way in to another property during a string of raids they are calling ' strike week ' message : the national crime agency , considered uk 's fbi , has been working with counterparts from the department of defense in the united states lizard squad 's facebook page after claiming it hacked sony playstation and xbox the lizard squad took credit for bringing down the microsoft 's xbox , and sony playstation 's playstation online networks , hitting users on christmas day
the hacking group said it wanted to expose the two firms ' poor security
the consoles rely on an internet connection for many functions
one of the most popular features of the consoles , for example , is the ability to play against friends and other users
while an internet connection is not required to play all games , new xbox one consoles need to be online to be successfully set - up
many of those who received the consoles as christmas presents are thought to have experienced problems getting started
furthermore , games on both consoles often require an internet connection to be installed fully , which was ruled out by the hack
a message on the xbox status page at the weekend said its core services were ' up and running '
sony playstation engineers then confirmed its core services were also back online , but heavy traffic might continue to cause problems , as thousands of users log back on
the stolen data was used as part of an international satellite message dissemination system known as enhanced mobile satellite services
it also included imei numbers , which are the unique codes used to identify a mobile device
no sensitive data was obtained and none of the data obtained could be used to personally identify anyone or threaten united states national security , the national crime agency added
more than 40 arrests have been made this week by the national crime agency 's nccu at more than 20 separate locations across england , wales and scotland as part of a week of activity targeting cyber crime
another man was held on suspicion of involvement in a 2012 hack on yahoo!
andy archibald , deputy director of the national crime agency 's nccu , said : ' behind this week 's activity is the message that all of us , as individuals , businesses or law enforcement agencies , have a role to play in making the uk a safe place to enjoy the huge opportunities provided by the internet
' awareness of the type of cyber crime dangers which are out there is vital , whoever you are , as is collaboration between organisations across different sectors , regions and countries to develop the most effective ways of combating those threats
' we will continue to work with partners to pursue and disrupt the major crime groups targeting the uk , but also , crucially , to make the uk as difficult as possible a target for cyber criminals in the first place
' jeffrey thorpe , special agent in charge , at the united states department of defense criminal investigative service ( dcis ) , said : ' this arrest underscores dcis commitment and the joint ongoing efforts among international law enforcement to stop cyber criminals in their tracks

lizard squad is a network of hackers which bears striking similarities to the online anarchist collective anonymous and is described as ' vocal , taunting and bit obnoxious '
the group seeks to cause mayhem online ' for a laugh ' and has called itself the ' next generation grinch ' after the children 's character that hates christmas , often using twitter to boast of upcoming attacks
some reports say it mainly operates from russia but others believe it is more likely to be made up of underground networks of hackers from around the world , communicating using the ' dark web '
lizard squad has a history of targeting computer game companies , particularly sony playstation
in august it sent a bomb threat to sony playstation chief executive john smedley , the same month in which it attacked sony playstation just to cause ' havoc '
dan holden , of online security company arbor networks , said : ' if they 're coming after you , you 're going to have a bad day
