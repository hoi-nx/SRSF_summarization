work not done : 90 % of the u.s. stockpile -- 30,500 tons -- was destroyed by the treaty date in 2012 at depots in alabama , arkansas , indiana , maryland , oregon , utah and johnson atoll in the pacific
the remaining 10 % -- close to 3,100 tons -- is at two sites in colorado and kentucky
do n't burn it : residents in colorado and kentucky protested the use of incineration to get rid of the chemical weapons stockpile
the process of neutralization was adopted
pueblo chemical depot 's stockpile : the pueblo chemical depot has about 780,000 shells containing mustard agent
