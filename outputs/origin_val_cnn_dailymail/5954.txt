killed : robinet was killed in a scuffle with los angeles police on skid row on sunday , prompting protests a homeless man shot dead by the los angeles police department stole a french 's identity more than 15 years ago and was wanted for violating terms of a bank robbery conviction , officials said last night
robinet , 39 , was killed on los angeles ' impoverished skid row when he allegedly tried to grab the holstered pistol of an officer while police arrested him on sunday
the shooting was caught by an onlooker on a video that went viral , leading to protests and calls by civil rights activists for a special police commission hearing on the use of force
originally thought to be french , officials now say robinet stole the identity of a french with the same name and birth date to apply for a french passport in the 1990s , when he came to the united states to pursue an acting career
his true identity remains unknown , said cruau , the consul general for french in los angeles
according to the consulate 's account , robinet was identified as a french national in 2000 when robbed a wells fargo branch in thousand oaks , some 40 miles west of downtown los angeles , and pistol - whipped an employee
he served around 13 years in prison for the crime , in which he , an accomplice and getaway driver stole $ 33,500 in a bid to pay for acting classes at the beverly hills playhouse
but when the french consulate tried to support him ahead of his 2013 release , officials discovered the original robinet and realised the prisoner was an imposter
mr cruau said : ' the real charley robinet is in french apparently living a totally normal life and totally unaware his identity had been stolen years and years ago
above is the moment directly after the fatal scuffle , after police had backed away proof ? police say this frame shows robinet , circled center , reaching up for a police officer 's gun during the fatal encounter on sunday in los angeles while in federal prison in rochester , minnesota , the bank robber known as robinet was assigned to the mental health unit
medical staff there determined he was suffering from ' a mental disease or defect ' that required treatment in a psychiatric hospital , documents show
after his release from federal prison robinet spent six months in a halfway house before being fully released in may 2014 , said ed ross , a spokesman for the bureau of prisons
foreign nationals are usually deported after serving their sentences , but french would not take him because he could not prove was french
because of a 2001 supreme court ruling on the rights of ' stateless ' people , robinet was set free
u.s. immigration and customs enforcement spokesman virginia kice said she could n't immediately comment on his immigration history
under the terms of the man 's release , he was required to provide reports to his probation officer at the beginning of each month , deputy united states marshal matthew cordova said he failed to do so in november , december and january , leading to the issue of a federal warrant - which triggered the fatal clash with police
the head of the union rescue mission , outside which robinet was shot , told reuters that robinet had been living in a tent outside the mission for weeks and had a history of violent , erratic behavior
he went by the street name of africa and lived among one of the largest homeless communities in the united states , with more than 3,000 people
on monday los angeles police department chief beck confirmed the footage from body cameras worn by an officer and a sergeant provided a ' unique perspective ' of the incident
however , he said that the force would not be releasing the video yet
according to the la times he also would not be drawn on what the footage actually revealed
' at the end of the investigation into this officer - involved shooting ... we will release the complete investigation through the inspector general 's office , ' beck said
