a ukip candidate had to be rescued from high tides at the party 's annual spring conference after writing a note on the beach proclaiming his love for leader nigel farage
sam gould , 31 , the party 's caerphilly candidate , was pictured being hauled out of the water onto a breakwater by press officer towler when he became trapped after jumping a wall to scrawl the doting message in the sand
the debacle began after he hastily jumped down onto the beach early saturday morning to write a response to protesters
after jumping down onto the sand to write the message , ukip candidate sam gould realised he was trapped by the tide press officer towler ( right ) then intervened to help pull him up a seaweed - covered breakwater with mr towler 's help , he managed to avoid getting wet - although the press officer said lifting him ' was n't the easiest ' mr sam gould poses beside his message in the sand at margate which reads ' we love nige ' the message was written on the beach on saturday at margate during the party 's annual spring conference
mr towler told mailonline that mr sam gould - ' the enterprising chap that he is ' - decided to scrawl the message in the sand in response to messages left on the beach by protesters the previous day
' basically it was about 7.30 in the morning and the previous day some green activists had scribbled some rude stuff in the beach
ukip leader nigel farage was said to be amused when he saw the message and heard about his candidate 's struggle to get off the beach ' i knew nothing of this and i was pottering around the conference hall and i saw the snappers take off looking purposeful
' following the commotion , he stumbled across mr sam gould hurriedly scrawling the message in the sand
but it was after he finished writing the note and proudly posing for photographs that he found himself in trouble
mr towler added : ' basically , he 'd gone down and did n't realise there was no exit because the tide was too far in , so i helped him out
' it was actually quite hard because that whole breakwater that i pulled him up from - top to bottom - was covered in seaweed
it was n't the easiest yank i 've done
' however , he did say party leader nigel farage managed to see the amusing side of the debacle
' he just smiled at it
he was n't there at the time , he arrived a bit later and he saw the scribble on the beach and just laughed
' mr sam gould told wales online : ' i jumped the wall - it was about six to seven feet high - and wrote a message myself in the sand , which said " we love ukip " and then " we love nige "
' ' there were no stairs so i got stuck , hence the photo which is quite amazing
