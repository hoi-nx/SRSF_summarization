she is famed for her huge behind and since attempting to ' break the internet ' kim has faced little in the way of rivals - until now
striking a kim - like pose , this is kit kardashian the nine - year - old tabby cat who bears an uncanny resemblance to the american socialite
the moggy , who is being cared for by blue cross after her owner died , was named after charity workers noticed her extraordinary large behind - which measures 10in across
as well as her sizeable bottom , kit has also perfected a cheeky coquettish look back over her shoulder as she mimics kim 's famous ' break the internet ' nude pictures
after being admitted to the blue cross pet charity , the cat was put on a strict new diet to help her shed the pounds
kit , who was previously named phoebe , is currently being looked after by volunteer smith at her home in cobham , surrey
new rival ? kit 's bottom measures 10in across and she appears to have perfected the kim pose she is hoping the tabby can find a new home
miss smith , 53 , said : ' i have been looking after her for two weeks now
' a lady from blue cross brought her over to my home and when she came out of her cage i said ' oh my goodness , she 's a big girl '
' a colleague had already come up with the name ' kit kardashian ' after kim 's famous bottom - there is a striking resemblance
' i have two other cats here but ' kit ' weighs 8.4kg - which is more than the other cats put together
on a diet : kit weighs 8.4kg , twice as much as an average cat
the moggy 's owner recently died and although she is currently being cared for by a blue cross volunteer , the tabby needs a new home ' she was originally named phoebe but everyone seems to prefer the name ' kit kardashian '
' miss smith , who has been a volunteer at the charity for three years , said kit ' struggles ' to move but has a ' pretty face '
she added : ' i hope we are able to find her a home
she tries to run around but struggles
' but she has got such a pretty face and is such a lovely cat , i 'm sure she 'd make a new owner very happy
