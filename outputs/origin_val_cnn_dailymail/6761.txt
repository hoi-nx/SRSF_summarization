the sec said alleged fraud has continued since 2003
the sec 's decision to prosecute tilton is seen as an attempt by government regulators to impose standards on wall street

the sec claims that tilton failed her legal duty to clients to warn that some of the companies she had invested their money in were performing worse than expected

' we look forward to the opportunity to vigorously defend ourselves against the sec 's allegations
' tilton told cnbc that despite the sec 's case against her , she will continue to run more than 70 companies in her portfolio
she said : ' i am shocked
i am disappointed , saddened and ... i am certain that the allegations are ill - founded
' she said the case was ' the ultimate battle in good against evil , light against dark
' she added : ' my number one priority is protecting my company and my people so that i can maximize the value of the funds
my people need to know that i am fighting for them
i also want to live in a country where i can fight for truth without assuming that because it 's the government that i am guilty without the battle
as someone who has always fought for truth , and protected her integrity and her intent , and have prevailed , i expect to do that
' tilton claimed that her business model of investing in distressed companies does involve some failures , although she described her backers as ' sophisticated investors ' .
