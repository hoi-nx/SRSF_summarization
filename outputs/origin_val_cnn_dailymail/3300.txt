when lisa epsom broke her tooth opening her son 's juice bottle , she thought it would just require a quick trip to the dentist
in fact , it led to her losing half her face after the dentist discovered mouth cancer which was so advanced , she was just weeks from death
after a 14 - hour operation to remove the tumour , she said : ' fruit shoot bottle saved my life
' had i not opened it with my teeth , i would not be here
' i 've lost my looks and feel disfigured
people stare at me in the street but i 'm alive and i can watch my kids grow up , so it 's a small price to pay
' now i want others to be more aware of mouth cancer - because i had never even heard of it
she had only been diagnosed after breaking her tooth opening a bottle of fruit shoot and her dentist noticing a growth inside her mouth
she has since undergone surgery to cut the tumour from her face upon being diagnosed with cancer , ms lisa epsom underwent tests to see how far the cancer had spread
she was devastated to learn she would need immediate surgery to remove a golf ball sized tumour under her nose and cheek her problems began in september 2013 while at home with her baby daughter tiffany and young son maison
ms lisa epsom , 34 , recalls : ' i opened a bottle of juice with my teeth and when i felt one break , i could have kicked myself for being so silly
' i was cross with myself because my teeth had been weak since my last pregnancy
i spat the tooth into the sink and made an appointment to see the dentist in three weeks ' time
' but when the dentist examined her teeth , he seemed more concerned about a red patch on the roof of her mouth and gave her a mirror to look at it
she says : ' right away , alarm bells began ringing in my head
i 'd spotted it about a year before but a gp said it was nothing to worry about
' now i could see it was bigger , about the size of a 5p coin , with veins coming out of it
' the dentist arranged a test and ms lisa epsom feared the worst
' i had a bad feeling and just knew it was cancer
i had smoked when i was younger , ' she said
the following week she went to hospital for a biopsy and , five days later , she was told the result
she says : ' the consultant 's face said it all - it was cancerous
during the operation surgeons removed most of ms lisa epsom 's cheekbone and palate , then used tissue from her thigh ( right ) to rebuild her face
she said : ' when i woke up i felt like i 'd been in the boxing ring ' ' he said i could be dead within weeks
the first thing i thought about was my kids and who would look after them if i died
i was only 33 at the time
' ms lisa epsom , of abbey wood , south east london , was told she had adenoid cystic carcinoma of the hard palate , a rare form of mouth cancer requiring urgent treatment

source : nhs choices the single mother of four and son from a later relationship who live with her â says : ' after the doctor told me it was cancer , i went home and went through all the motions , giving my two younger children their tea , bathing them and reading their bedtime story
' but inside i felt like a robot
all i could think about was not being alive to do these things with them
' my two older kids needed me too , so i knew i had to be strong
as well as being mother to maison , six and tiffany , two , ms lisa epsom , a single mother , has two older children , sarah , 14 , and natasha , 12 , who live with their father
she said : ' dying just was n't an option for me
one of the consultants even joked that chipping my tooth was n't so unlucky after all
' ct and mri scans were arranged to see how far the cancer had spread - and there was bad news when a biopsy through her revealed a golf ball sized tumour under her nose and cheek
ms lisa epsom was horrifed to be told that had she gone another six to eight weeks without treatment , she would have died
she said : ' i had no idea i had been so close to death
it was so shocking because i 'd felt so well
' two weeks later , in december 2013 , she underwent major surgery
she said : ' i had no idea i had been so close to death
it was so shocking because i 'd felt so well ' ' i kissed the kids goodbye with tears in my eyes
i was petrified that i might not see them again
' i looked at their gorgeous faces and made my mum promise to be there for them if anything happened to me
' during the operation surgeons removed most of ms lisa epsom 's cheekbone and palate , then used tissue from her thigh to rebuild her face
she said : ' when i woke up i felt like i 'd been in the boxing ring
my whole face throbbed with pain
' i asked for a mirror straight away and the nurses hesitated but i needed to know how i looked
' i 'd been warned i would look different but nothing could have prepared me for what i saw
' i gasped and broke down in tears - i thought i looked like a monster
' my face was so swollen and disfigured
i just did n't look like me any more
' as a result , it was three weeks before she allowed her two younger children to visit her in hospital
she said : ' my mum tried to prepare them by showing them photographs of how i looked , but it was still a huge shock for them
' tiffany was terrified and hid from me
that broke my heart â she was scared of her own mummy
' maison asked if my face would ever go back to normal and i had to explain that even though i looked different on the outside , i would still be the same mummy on the inside
' he just shrugged and said " i know " and jumped on to my lap for a cuddle
' ms lisa epsom ( pictured before surgery ) says she now avoids looking in the mirror
' my confidence has gone but it 's a small price to pay
i 'm learning to live again and i 'm alive , and that 's more important than anything ' eventually tiffany got used to her mother 's new appearance
ms lisa epsom said : ' i ca n't pretend it did n't bother me , but if i had to choose between my looks and watching my kids grow up , there really is no contest
' she left hospital a month after her operation , though she still had to have six weeks of radiotherapy , from january to march 2014
and because the surgery had made it difficult to eat , she lost 4st , shrinking from a size 12 to a tiny size 4 and ending up being tube - fed. but , finally , in july last year , scans showed she was cancer - free
now , eight months on , she has started going out in public again , but says people 's stares are hard to cope with
she also avoids looking in the mirror
lisa epsom says : ' my confidence has gone but it 's a small price to pay
i 'm learning to live again and i 'm alive , and that 's more important than anything
' i 've learned so much about what 's important and that i have amazing family and friends who have supported me every step of the way
' i also know it 's vital to visit the dentist regularly
