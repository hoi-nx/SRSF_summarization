the first state visit to the u.s. of afghanistan president ghani and chief executive officer abdullah was supposed to take place in early march
but the visit was delayed because republican leaders had invited israeli prime minister netanyahu to address congress during the same time period
according to two afghanistan government officials involved in the planning for the visit , the afghanistan government believed u.s. media attention would be largely focused on netanyahu , so the first u.s. visit of the new afghanistan president was delayed by two weeks , which is a useful reminder that there is a sound reason why congressional leaders should n't unilaterally extend invitations to foreign leaders
ghani and abdullah arrived in washington on sunday and have had much to discuss with the obama administration
for the afghanistan government , the timetable of president obama 's proposed troop withdrawal is the key issue
obama says that the last u.s. troops will leave afghanistan at the end of 2016
this happens to roughly coincide with the end of his second term in office and also fulfills his campaign promise to wind down u.s. 's post- 9/11 wars
ghani is clearly uncomfortable with the pace of this u.s. troop withdrawal , telling cbs ' " 60 minutes " in january , " deadlines should not be dogmas " and that there should be a " willingness to reexamine " the withdrawal date
is obama 's withdrawal plan a wise policy ? short answer : of course not
one only has to look at the debacle that has unfolded in iraq after the withdrawal of u.s. troops at the end of 2011 to have a sneak preview of what could take place in an afghanistan without some kind of residual u.s. presence
without u.s. forces in the country , there is a strong possibility afghanistan could host a reinvigorated taliban allied to a reinvigorated al qaeda , not to mention isis , which is gaining a foothold in the region
needless to say , this would be a disaster for afghanistan
but it would also be quite damaging to u.s. interests to have some kind of resurgent al qaeda in the country where the group trained the hijackers for the 9/11 attacks
it would also be disastrous for the democratic , should it win the presidency in 2016 , to be the party that " lost " afghanistan
after all , the democratic is viewed by some as weaker on national security than the republican and it is inevitable that without some kind of residual u.s. presence in afghanistan , al qaeda would gain sufficient strength to launch an attack from the afghanistan - pakistan border region against u.s. interests somewhere in the world
on tuesday , president obama announced that the withdrawal of u.s. forces from afghanistan would be slowed and the remaining 9,800 troops would stay there through the end of 2015
but this welcome development does not change the central issue , which is the obama administration 's withdrawal date of december 2016 for all u.s. forces
merely because the obama administration will be almost out the door at the end of 2016 does n't mean that suddenly at the same time that the taliban will lay down their arms , nor that the afghanistan army will be able to fight the taliban completely unaided
nor does it mean that al qaeda -- and isis , which is beginning to establish small cells in afghanistan -- would cease to be a threat
an easy way for potential democratic presidential candidates such as hillary clinton to distinguish their national security policies from obama 's would be to say that they are in favor of some kind of long - term u.s. military presence in afghanistan and to argue that it would be needed to avoid an iraq - style outcome
similarly , as the republican starts ramping up for the 2016 campaign , potential candidates such as jeb bush can distinguish themselves from the isolationist rand paul wing of the party by saying that they are committed to a long - term presence in afghanistan
this u.s. military presence in afghanistan does n't have to be a large , nor does it need to play a combat role , but u.s. troops should remain in afghanistan to advise the afghanistan army and provide intelligence support
such a long - term commitment of several thousand u.s. troops is exactly the kind of force that the obama administration was forced to deploy to iraq following isis 's lightning advances there over the past year
selling a longer - term u.s. military presence in afghanistan would be pushing against an open door with that nation 's government
consider that within 24 hours of being installed , the new afghanistan government led by ghani and abdullah signed the basing agreement that allows u.s. troops to stay in afghanistan until december 2016
consider also that the afghanistan government has already negotiated a strategic partnership agreement with the u.s. lasting until 2024 that would provide the framework for a longer term u.s. military presence
consider also that many afghanistan see a relatively small , but long - term international troop presence as a guarantor of their stability
it is also not in pakistan 's interests for afghanistan to fall to the taliban or be thrust into another civil war
the pakistan have seen for themselves repeatedly the folly of allowing the taliban to flourish on their own soil , most recently in the taliban attack in december on the army school in peshawar that killed 132 children
it is in pakistan 's own interest that the afghanistan army is able to fight effectively against the taliban , which is more likely if they continue to have u.s. advisers at their side
other regional powers such as the chinese worry about chinese uighur separatists establishing themselves on afghanistan soil
the russians are similarly worried about islamist terrorist groups located in afghanistan and so will not stand in the way of a small long - term u.s. military presence in afghanistan as that would dovetail with their own security concerns about the country
keeping a relatively small , predominantly u.s. special forces , presence in afghanistan to continue to train the afghanistan army past december 2016 is a wise policy that would benefit both afghanistan and u.s.
both the democratic and republican parties should adopt such a plan in their platforms as they gear up for the 2016 campaign
and obama should do his successor a favor by leaving this important decision up to the next president .
