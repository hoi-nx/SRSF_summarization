taraji p. henson hit headlines earlier this week by revealing in an interview that her son , marcel henson , was stopped in glendale for no reason , then doing ' exactly everything the cops told him to do , including letting them illegally search his car '
' it was bogus because they did n't give him the ticket for what he was pulled over for , ' she told interview magazine
however the just - surfaced dashcam footage , taken in october last year , shows that taraji p. henson drove through a lighted crosswalk as a pedestrian walked across
after being questioned , taraji p. henson admitted to having marijuana and ritalin on him
he was also found to hash oil , a grinder and a knife

he said he did not have a prescription for the ritalin and that a friend had given it to him
however the officer , who seems very generous when dealing with taraji p. henson , lets the teen off with a citation for marijuana possession only
the dashcam footage was obtained by the los angeles times , which noted that race did not seem to be a factor when taraji p. henson was first pulled over
' i am not going to give you a citation for running that yellow because that would actually put a moving violation on your driving license , and you are going to have to go to traffic school and all that stuff , so i am helping you by not giving you a violation on it
all i am going to do is take the weed from you , ' the officer can be heard saying in the video
the officer told taraji p. henson he could go to court with the citation and show proof he has a prescription for medical marijuana
otherwise he could just pay a fine
' it felt like this was a little better than the other one , ' the officer said
' i am giving this to you too because you smoked weed about two hours ago â¦ and a warning if you have ritalin on you and you 're not supposed to , do n't do it
' that 's a big violation and i would n't want to do that to you
