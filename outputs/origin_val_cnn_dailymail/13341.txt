israel prime minister netanyahu 's recent speech to the congress has received disproportionate media attention across the world : the leader of united states 's most important client state in the middle eastern defies the reservations of the white house , abusing congress as a platform for his israel election campaign
disregarding israel 's already strained bilateral relations with the united states , netanyahu readily risked the consequences of humiliating the obama administration in exchange for less than an hour of political self - manifestation -- typical for a man who is domestically known to be not much of a statesman
netanyahu is a charismatic speaker and a passionate israel - advocate , however , his personal and political interests have always taken precedence over serving israel 's national interests
political survival has been the maxim of his domestic and foreign policies
netanyahu joins a long list of israel politicians overwhelmed by the plurality and polarization of domestic public opinion
so far he has been just another israel leader seeking " easy " short - term answers to fundamentally strategic problems , thereby further protracting an already protracted conflict
as a puppet of ideological , conservative playmakers who whole - heartedly reject a two - state solution , netanyahu has been held hostage by the likes of foreign minister avigdor lieberman and economy minister naftali bennett who pursue a discriminatory policy of sectarian segregation intending to contain palestinian public dissidence through mere coercion
consequently , netanyahu 's foreign policy vis - Ã - vis the peace process has been a disaster
he took over from olmert and tzipi livni -- two politicians who at least believed in a two - state solution and were ready to make sacrifices to keep the peace process alive
israel leaders typically fall into two categories : those who believe in peace and those that have the power to make peace
olmert was the former , and netanyahu long seemed like he could become the latter
in reality , however , netanyahu is neither
he has given in to a toxic form of jewish nationalism , disregarded israel 's relatively good regional position vis - Ã - vis its otherwise - occupied arab neighbors ; he has continued to build settlements out of spite , thought of ever new preconditions for bilateral negotiations with the palestinian and waged a ruthless war against gaza without a clear strategic endgame -- a war that was lost militarily and in terms of international reputation
apart from the tragic effects of netanyahu 's policy on the peace process , his stubbornness has alienated allies in european and washington
while the arab world has been widely apathetic about the israel - palestinian issue amid regional disintegration , partners on both sides of the atlantic have tried to facilitate the revitalization of constructive peace talks
yet , netanyahu chose to ignore external initiatives , retracting to a jewish nationalist rhetoric founded on security paranoia , self - victimization and the illusion of israel autarky in security and defense
as a consequence , israel 's foreign relations with its most important strategic partners have noticeably cooled
obama 's middle eastern focus has shifted from the israel / palestinian issue to a rapprochement with iran
european lawmakers are considering recognizing palestinian statehood despite israel objections
more importantly , many traditionally pro-israel western publics have turned their back on the jewish state
younger generations in particular refuse to accept the narrative that shaped their parental generation : israel as the david in a fight against goliath
israel 's monopoly on victimhood has been undermined by an inflexible , uncompromising short - minded policy towards a palestinian people under occupation whose narrative of victimhood increasingly finds attentive ears in the west
at first sight , then , the prospect of four more years of netanyahu , does not sound too promising -- at least in regards to the peace process
at a closer look , however , a continuation of netanyahu 's policies might actually help the palestinian cause
his implicit rejection of the two - state solution ; his prioritization of short - term security over sustainable security solutions ; his pursuit of a toxic jewish nationalist agenda justifying an intensification of sectarianism between israel and the occupied territories as well as within israel , are all factors that will leave israel increasingly isolated
his israel - first narrative might win netanyahu votes within a highly polarized electorate that in recent years has become more and more right - wing amid a top - down constructed climate of fear
hamas ' and hezbollah 's mid-tech missile capability , syria 's socio - political disintegration and subsequent rise of islamist non-state actors , have been used by the netanyahu government to create an arab bogyman ostensibly threatening the jewish state 's very existence -- a new bogyman coexisting side - by - side with netanyahu 's " favorite " bogeyman , iran
despite netanyahu 's pre-occupation with security , the derailment of the peace process has not been much of a topic during the campaign so far
if netanyahu receives another mandate on tuesday , israel will be further driven into the international offside , pressure from the west will increase and thereby the palestinian cause will receive ever more attention and support from policymakers and publics across the world
netanyahu has become somewhat of a villain in the west -- an untrustworthy , short - sighted politician who in comparison to his counterparts in ramallah appears to lack the willingness to compromise , cooperate and empathize
thus , while another term of netanyahu will not be in the national interest of israel , it will very likely serve the palestinian interests .
