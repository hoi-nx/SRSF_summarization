atlanta former cia director and retired gen. petraeus remains a trusted adviser to the white house on its strategy in iraq , despite being convicted of leaking classified information to his mistress and biographer , then lying to the fbi
the national security council and obama administration have been consulting with petraeus on matters related to iraq and isis , white house press secretary earnest confirmed on monday
earnest did not elaborate how long petraeus has been advising the white house since his fall from grace , but newsweek reports the retired four - star general has been in the role since last summer
" petraeus is somebody who served for a number of years in iraq
he commanded a large number of american military personnel in that country , " earnest said
" he is , i think , legitimately regarded as an expert , when it comes to the security situation in iraq
so i think it makes a lot of sense for senior administration officials to , on occasion , consult for him advice
" once considered a possible presidential candidate , petraeus plead guilty to one federal charge of removing and retaining classified information earlier this month as part of a plea deal approved by attorney general eric holder
according to court documents , petraeus admitted removing several so - called black books -- notebooks in which he kept classified and non-classified information from his tenure as the commander of the international security assistance force in afghanistan -- and giving them to his biographer , paula broadwell
after he resigned from his cia post in 2012 , petraeus told the government he had no classified materials in his possession
that claim turned out to be false as the fbi found the notebooks when they conducted a search of petraeus ' house in 2013
when he was questioned by the fbi at the time , he lied and claimed he never provided classified information to anyone not authorized to have it , according to court documents
earnest says he is unaware of any particular security precautions put in place by the white house when it consults with petraeus , despite his legal problems and lack of cia security clearance
petraeus is currently the chairman of a global institute for private equity firm kkr .
