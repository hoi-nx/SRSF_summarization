police arrested franklin in july 2010 after his dna was connected to more than a dozen crime scenes
they had linked the crimes , but did not have a suspect until a crime lab computer traced the sample to one of franklin 's family members

as news of the trial date has been announced , attorney nina salarno ashford , a board member of crime victims united , said it is not unusual for capital cases to take years to complete
deputy district attorney beth silverman said the case has been plagued by delays and that the judge has failed to hold the defense to strict deadlines to complete their investigation
but defense lawyer seymour amster blamed the prosecution , and said his expert found dna from another man at three of the crime scenes and is seeking to test more material
a firearms expert who tested guns retired last year , so the testing needed to be done again , while medical examiners at the coroner 's office have retired and will also need to be replaced
