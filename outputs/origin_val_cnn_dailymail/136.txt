for once the north london spotlight did n't fall on arsenal this sunday afternoon
after the week they 've had , arsene wenger would have been happy to shun the limelight this time
ask gunners fans prior to kick - off if they 'd rather three points or a spurs loss in the capital one cup final and you 'd have been greeted with split responses
olivier giroud connects with a corner to fire arsenal in front in the first half as they continue their bid for a top - four finish olivier giroud watches as the ball heads for goal as arsenal take the lead against everton who were suffering from their european exertions everton goalkeeper howard can only stand and watch , along with the rest of his defence , as the ball trundles into the net olivier giroud , content that the ball will cross the line , turns away to celebrate as howard makes a late but unsuccessful attempt to stop it in the end , as arch - rivals spurs prepared for their date with destiny at wembley , the gunners got their win , courtesy of goals from olivier giroud and tomas rosicky , to move four points behind second - placed manchester city
but much like their demoralising champions league loss to monaco on wednesday night , this did n't make for comfortable viewing
the 2 - 0 scoreline does n't tell the full story
everton dominated large spells of this clash - the emirates a bag or nerves until tomas rosicky 's last minute goal
nevertheless , while their participation in this year 's champions league is under huge threat , their qualification for next year 's competition is firmly on course thanks to this win
arsene wenger rang the changes following wednesday 's hugely disappointing loss
vice captain mertesacker and welbeck were axed following the loss to monaco and replaced by gabriel and oxlade-chamberlain
for gabriel , in particular , it was a huge chance to cement himself in his manager 's first - team plans
mertesacker 's role in the starting xi has been called into huge question this season following a string of below - par displays
and it seems arsene wenger 's reached the end of his tether with the german world cup winner after another disappointing display in midweek
olivier giroud struggled in arsenal 's midweek defeat by monaco but showed his delight at the emirates after firing the gunners in front olivier giroud points to the heavens after scoring ( left ) and points to his temple as if to urge arsenal to maintain their concentration arsenal ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : ospina 7.5 ; hector bellerin 7 , gabriel 6.5 , laurent koscielny 6.5 , gibbs 6.5 ; francis coquelin 7 ( chambers 89 ) , cazorla 7.5 ; oxlade-chamberlain 8 ( tomas rosicky 82 ) , ozil 6.5 , alexis 6.5 ( welbeck 87 ) ; olivier giroud 7 subs not used : szczesny , mertesacker , monreal , walcott

tomas rosicky had only been on the pitch for a matter of minutes when he fired a deflected effort beyond howard in the everton goal tomas rosicky was left in acres of space and allowed time to take aim as he made sure the points were staying at the emirates tomas rosicky and olivier giroud , arsenal 's two goalscorers , celebrate the former 's strike in the dying minutes against visiting everton a strong display from gabriel against lukaku may have heralded new central defensive partnership - alongside laurent koscielny - for the gunners until at least the end of the season
but the former villareal defender nearly fluffed his lines on his big audition in the 18th minute as he failed to deal with a long - ball to allow lukaku a free run a ospina
thankfully for the brazilian , his fellow south american bailed him out with some excellent goalkeeping
it did n't impress the gunners fans , nor did it his manager who almost saw his central defensive gamble backfire in woeful fashion
everton deserved the opening , too , after a confident start at the emirates
left - back garbutt , 21 , on only his second premier league start had made a bright start , while muhamed besic and barkley were seeing plenty of the ball in midfield
arsenal , on the other hand , started lethargically - lacking any vigour or pace in their play
that was until olivier giroud missed a guild - edged opportunity to hand arsenal a 28th - minute advantage
having brilliantly escaped the attentions of jagielka deep inside the penalty area , the frenchman had time to pick his spot from alexis sanchez 's cross - but the striker sent his close range header wide
it was the last thing olivier giroud needed after his high - profile misses against monaco on wednesday
supporters did n't get on his back this time , fans responding to by olivier giroud 's wastefulness by chanting his name
francis coquelin was forced off after initially clashing heads with a team - mate before being hit on the face with the ball francis coquelin is looked at by medics getting a bloody nose
the frenchman carried on but was later forced off with a suspected broken nose his nose already hurt , francis coquelin took another hit when the ball smacked him square in the face as he challenged for it francis coquelin 's face was left in a mess as his nose bled following the second of two incidents during arsenal 's win over everton arsene wenger probably would n't have been quite so understanding on the bench , however , having watched the striker , who he has spoke glowingly of in recent weeks , squander yet another chance
the miss , though , did herald a period of sustained pressure from the home side after their slow start
however , if gabriel had n't produced an excellent last - ditch tackle to deny lukaku in the 38th minute then the growing sense of optimism would have instantly waned
the challenge would have made gabriel feel an awful lot better after his earlier howler
and his mood would have improved further when the gunners took the lead just a minute later
so to did olivier giroud , who put his midweek woes behind him to nip in front of john stones to flick home ozil 's corner
it was the perfect response after the barracking from his own fans during the defeat to monaco
perhaps it was harsh on everton after a first - half in which , for the most part , they looked comfortable , if not the better side
gareth barry tried , spectacularly , to put the everton back on level terms inside five minutes of the restart but sent an acrobatic bicycle kick over the bar
garbutt attempts to drive down the win but his progress is stalled by the intervention of arsenal defender hector bellerin gabriel was handed a start in the heart of arsenal 's defence and he made his presence felt with this challenge on lukaku olivier giroud puts his head in as everton defender jagielka stretches his leg out in an attempt to win the ball as arsenal push forward everton forward mirallas then saw a penalty appeal rejected by andre marriner , claiming oxlade-chamberlain had handled in the box
much like the first - half , roberto martinez 's side had made a positive start after the break - garbutt 's delivery from dead - balls causing arsenal 's defence problems
the everton boss threw on lennon in place of mirallas in search of a leveller
given his spurs connections , lennon was afforded a horrendous ovation from home supporters
there 'd have been more boos in the 65th minute had ospina not tipped over lukaku 's first - time shot from barkley 's cross as everton continued to make life uncomfortable for their hosts
it was even more uncomfortable for francis coquelin who was left with a bloody nose following an accidental collision with team - mate olivier giroud
he would later be replaced after taking a ball full in the face
lennon missed a glorious chance to score on his return to the capital , firing straight at ospina deep inside the area after great work from seamus coleman down the right
the emirates was a bag of nerves
ozil should have eased the tension in the 80th minute after being sent through by oxlade-chamberlain but the german 's shot was blocked by jagielka
substitute tomas rosicky , finally , eased tensions in the 89th minute with a strike from the edge of the area that took a deflection off jagielka .
