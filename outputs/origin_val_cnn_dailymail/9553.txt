when corden was surprisingly chosen to host america âs top chat show , fans and critics alike wondered if the britain star would flourish in such an unfamiliar role
yet corden âs first week in the hot - seat on cbs âs the late late show has been so widely acclaimed that he is now being tipped as a front - runner to host the prestigious globes awards next year â the hollywood party second only to the oscars for star quality
â out of nowhere , he âs suddenly a realistic contender for one of the most coveted awards - hosting jobs of the year , â said a source close to the globes
â he âs only been hosting the the late late show for a few days , but already hollywood is sitting up and taking notice
â if he maintains this trajectory , he could find himself hosting the globes â and that would really cement his position in hollywood
â corden , 36 , who made his name as co-writer and star of cult television sitcom gavin and stacey , has already proved his ability to host a major awards show by fronting the brits for four years
if he took on the globes , he would be following in the footsteps of fellow comedy actor ricky gervais , who hosted the ceremony from 2010 to 2012
since ricky gervais stepped down , the awards have been co-hosted by america tv comedy stars tina and amy
comfortable : â corden has shown that he âs funny , can sing and dance , puts celebrities at their ease , ' said a source
pictured with patricia arqeutte and chris pine on his second night a source within the hollywood foreign press association , which stages the globes , said : â amy and tina have finished their three - year contract and have stated that they wo nât be back next year
â right now , the field for a new globes host is wide open
â another insider said : â corden combines all the attributes of the ideal host
â he has enjoyed movie success this year , starring in into the woods with meryl streep , and of course he âs had tv success in britain with his comedies
â he âs also won a tony for his broadway show one man , two guvnors , and now he âs getting rave reviews in the states with the the late late show , giving him an international audience
â while there are a string of chat show hosts who are better known in america , such as david letterman , jimmy fallon , jimmy kimmel and ellen degeneres , none has corden âs wide range of film , tv and stage success
corden âs guests during his debut week included actors tom hanks , mila kunis , will ferrell , chris pine and kevin hart
celebrities lined up for future shows include x factor tycoon simon cowell , footballer david beckham , chef gordon ramsay and actors michael douglas , courteney cox and claire danes
but not everyone might welcome corden as the globes host
he sparked controversy at the brits in 2012 when he cut short adele âs acceptance speech for winning the best british album after only 12 seconds , provoking a vulgar hand gesture from the angry singer
theo kingma , president of the hollywood foreign press association , said : â we are exploring some very exciting possibilities regarding hosts
â a spokesman for corden declined to comment .
