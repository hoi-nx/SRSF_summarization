the 25 - year - old former hull winger , who missed just two matches in his first season with the rhino in 2014 , will undergo surgery on saturday after scans revealed the full extent of an injury he has been carrying for a few weeks
' there 's a fair bit of damage in there , ' brian mcdermott said
' he 's been good for us so we 'll miss him but it gives an opportunity for handley to get some more game time
leeds ' england international tom briscoe will be sidelined for around three months with a shoulder injury ' he did okay against wigan
the acid test for ash will come in the coming weeks to maintain that level
' handley , 19 , made only his second super league appearance and scored his first try in leeds ' 26 - 14 win over wigan last friday and keeps his spot for the trip to perpignan to face catalans dragons on saturday , while liam sutcliffe will continue to deputise for skipper kevin sinfield , who is still recovering from a hamstring injury
another england international , zak hardaker , keeps his place pending the outcome of an investigation into an assault he committed on a student in leeds in february
' at some stage the club will make an announcement , ' brian mcdermott said
' i think it 's coming to its conclusion but we 're still on with it
' leeds rhino coach brian mcdermott admits tom briscoe 's injury lay - off is a blow for the team zak hardaker was dropped when the incident came to light earlier this month but recalled for the wigan game and brian mcdermott insists he is right to select the player , who was released by police without charge after paying compensation and issuing an apology to his victim
' zak hardaker gets paid to do a job , ' brian mcdermott added
' i know there is a sentiment from people out there who say ' why is he still playing ? ' but to stand zak hardaker down does n't do him any good
' if a bricklayer makes an error at work , you do n't give him time off
why would we give zak hardaker the time off to live a decent lifestyle where he can do what he wants ? ' he has to do a job for us
he is paid to do that job and he will go out and do it
i do n't feel that 's covering anything up
