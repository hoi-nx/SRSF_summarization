boston tsarnaev 's own words may determine whether he lives or dies , even if he never speaks a word at his trial
the admitted boston marathon bomber has sat in silence as people who lost limbs sobbed or glared at him from the witness stand
he slouched in his chair as jurors watched videos of him both before and after two nail - packed pressure cooker bombs exploded , killing three people , claiming 17 limbs and hurting more than 260 others
he did n't utter a peep as his tweets and words he had scribbled on the side of a pleasure boat flashed up on a big screen and were quoted in court
at issue : was tsarnaev a terrorist looking to punish the u.s. for policies he believed were harmful to muslims ? or , was he a goofball stoner who simply followed the lead of his older , more radical brother ? the defense team tried to portray tsarnaev as a confused college kid who , like countless others , watches comedy central and cracks crass jokes
" i wan na study a broad or two , " he posted on his twitter account as @ j_tsar
he jokes about not seeing commercials featuring the trix rabbit , and about " whale watching " outside a mcdonald 's fast - food restaurant
miriam conrad , a member of his defense team , tried tuesday to apply a more benign spin on tweets the government contends show him as a would - be jihadist eager for martyrdom and a free pass to paradise
his brother was dead and police knew who he was ; they were scouring the boston suburb of watertown for tsarnaev when he slipped under a tarp and climbed aboard the slip away ii , a fishing boat dry - docked in a watertown backyard
he hid for hours before being discovered
bleeding , he picked up a pencil and wrote what assistant u.s. attorney william weinreb called his " manifesto
" tsarnaev wrote he was jealous that his brother , tamerlan , had achieved paradise by dying like a holy warrior ; he was killed the night before during a gunbattle with police
the indictment against him says tsarnaev helped in his brother 's demise by running him over and dragging him along the road as he tried to run down police
about the bombings , tsarnaev wrote on the boat that he did n't enjoy killing innocent civilians , but that circumstances excused it
" the us government is killing our innocent civilians but most of you already know that , " he wrote
" know you are fighting men who look into the barrel of your gun and see heaven , now how can you compete with that
we are promised victory and we will surely get it
" streaks of blood cover portions of his message
more than a dozen bullet holes obliterate parts of words
so ended one of the biggest manhunts in u.s. history
while in the boat , he wrote that he could n't stand to see the u.s. government " go unpunished " for killing muslims
" we muslims are one body , you hurt one you hurt us all
" he ended with : " now i do n't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in islam but due to said " -- the word was lost to a bullet hole -- " it is allowed
" tsarnaev 's connections : who 's who judge george o'toole viewed the boat tuesday afternoon so he could rule on a defense request to show the entire boat " in context " to the jury
he turned down requests by the media to accompany him
the defense said the government only presented about 45 tweets out of about 1,100
many were benign , about girls , cars and food as well as sleeping and disliking studying , the defense argued
on monday , fbi agent steven kimball testified about two twitter accounts used by tsarnaev
one account shows he tweeted on the day of the april 15 , 2013 , bombing : " ai n't no love in the heart of the city , stay safe people " his last tweet was on april 17
he sent it while on the run : " i 'm a stress free kind of guy " his other account carried seven tweets , including this : " strive to be a better muslim , be greedy with your time , devote most of it to the almighty for it is his satisfaction that you need # islam " the jury also has now seen tsarnaev in videos , trailing his brother onto boylston street
he paused for four minutes , standing next to a tree in front of the forum restaurant
in front of him stood a line of children who were leaning over the barricade and watching the race
he put his backpack down at his feet and made a phone call
timeline of the bombings , manhunt and aftermath when his brother 's bomb went off a block away , heads swiveled in surprise in the direction of the noise
and there was tsarnaev walking through the crowd , looking back over his shoulder as his own bomb went off 12 seconds later
martin richard , an 8 - year - old standing in the line of kids , took the full brunt of the blast , which tore him apart
the bombs went off at 2:49 and 2:50 p.m. , about the same time as he exchanged phone calls with his brother
the next video showed tsarnaev in the crowd running
other videos show him carrying on as usual : buying milk and swiping his card at his college gym
but fbi agents were already in pursuit , collecting store security videos and looking for somebody suspicious in the marathon crowd
by wednesday night , authorities had a good idea who they were looking for
by thursday night , his photo had been released to the public
by the next morning , his brother was dead , and tsarnaev was hiding in the boat , writing of martyrdom and paradise .
