clarkson ( right ) is pictured with some of the crew while filming the popular show in 2011 clarkson started the disciplinary process himself after phoning danny cohen , director of television at the bbc , to apologise about the row
aa gill , a friend of clarkson , confirmed the presenter made the first move in the hope that it would end tension
' he explained he had lost his rag after a difficult and tiring day , ' the sunday times reported him saying
danny cohen immediately suspended clarkson and pulled the last three episodes of the popular show
clarkson is being represented by law firm olswang , which refused to comment
paul daniels , representing oisin tymon , added that his client did not wish to add a statement
the inquiry will report back to danny cohen and lord hall , director general , who will decide on the pair 's fate
it is not known how long it will take
it has also emerged that clarkson called bbc director of television danny cohen ( pictured ) after the row to apologise an inquiry will be launched tomorrow - until then it is not known what the future is for clarkson or oisin tymon
the presenter has changed his twitter biography to reflect the unknown , adding ' probbably ' ( sic ) to his description lord hall refused to ' speculate ' on clarkson 's future after details of the incident emerged and said the bbc 's internal investigation would ' get the people who are impacted by this together '
he said : ' there is a lot of speculation , we have got to establish the facts and i intend to do that before we come to a final decision
' that is what we are about to do
' but bbc management sources have claimed that top gear would survive without clarkson as other shows â including have i got news for you and strictly come dancing â have coped with the loss of a much - loved presenter
they added about oisin tymon : ' we would hope he will continue to be employed by the bbc after this matter is resolved
' meanwhile , a petition to reinstate clarkson has gathered more than 870,000 signatures
this evening clarkson jokingly made reference to the pulled show by tweeting a picture of darkness with the caption ' and tonight on top gear '
the bbc launched an astonishing attack on clarkson yesterday , comparing him to sex offender savile and urging him to check into rehab
blaming the now notorious ' fracas ' with a top gear producer on ' personal issues ' , one of the most senior corporation executives said clarkson was ' self - destructing ' and needed help
most controversially , the tv chief , who has been directly involved in the fallout from the incident , likened clarkson 's supporters â including the prime minister â to those who turned a blind eye to savile 's appalling crimes
last night , friends of the 54 - year - old presenter expressed disbelief that the bbc should make such explosive claims before its internal investigation into the controversy had even begun
' i am in total shock that someone at the bbc would attack their own talent and deliberately smear clarkson , ' said perry mccarthy , who was top gear 's mysterious test driver the stig
the comments came during a wide - ranging official briefing given to the mail on sunday by a senior bbc figure
the executive likened 36 - year - old oisin tymon 's position to that of savile 's victims , who feared they would not be believed while he was alive
' the pressure this guy [ oisin tymon ] is under is so savilesque in a way , ' he said , adding that clarkson 's support from high - level politicians recalled the way savile was once defended
' if you look at what david cameron says or what [ former culture and media secretary ] maria miller says and you swap clarkson for savile , you get this : david cameron is effectively saying that savile 's a real talent , maria miller saying savile will be savile
' the bbc executive also said that attempts to suggest the â fracas â was part of a wider battle between clarkson and danny cohen , the bbc âs powerful director of television , were misleading .
