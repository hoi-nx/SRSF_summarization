when 50 - year - old consuela went for a walk on the banks of loch ness with her daughter and granddaughter , she was simply hoping to photograph some of the stunning scenery
but now she is claiming to have witnessed the latest glimpse of the fabled monster that dwells in its depths as it came to the surface for air
however , despite having her camera in her hand she says she was too captivated to take a picture , and instead only managed to record the moment after the beast dived under the surface
tourists taking pictures of loch ness swear they spotted the elusive monster that lurks in its depths , but were too mesmerised to photograph it , instead capturing the moment after it dived under ( pictured ) consuela , 50 ( left ) , was visiting the loch with daughter reyshell avellanoza , 29 ( centre ) , and granddaughter heather , five ( right ) , when they made the sighting
ross , 74 ( centre ) , was waiting in the car park at the time a video taken at the time shows a mysterious circle of disturbed water spreading outwards from the centre of the lake , which mrs consuela swears was occupied by the beast moments earlier
miss consuela was walking beside the lake with daughter reyshell avellanoza , 29 , and granddaughter heather , both from the philippines , when the incident happened
the family had spent the day visiting nearby urquhart castle with mrs consuela 's husband , ross , 73 , when they decided to drive to the lake
mr ross stayed in the car while the others went to the water 's edge , when heather , who was seeing the loch for the first time , pointed out a strange shape
earlier this year swedish monster - hunter sjã¶strand , 52 , won a Â£ 2,000 prize in a loch ness monster spotting competition after picking out a strange object on satellite images another sighting : international paranormal investigator , jonathan bright , took this photo three years ago , which he claims shows loch ness monster 's head emerging from the loch consuela told the daily record : ' she said it looked like a big black belly
we looked and could see this big disturbance quite a way out and this big black object in the middle of it
' we were so mesmerised , we did n't immediately think of taking pictures although we had the cameras in our hands
' by the time we realised what we were seeing and began filming and snapping away , the object had sank virtually out of sight and moved away further into the loch , leaving behind a perfect circle of water - like a whirlpool

mr sjã¶strand , who has never visited scotland , won the best loch ness monster sighting of 2014 , in an annual competition run by bookmaker william hill
in 2013 , this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly having two giant flippers powering it through the waters of loch ness was photographed by apple 's satellite map app. the image was studied by experts at the official loch ness monster fan club , who concluded it is â likely â to be the elusive beast
a satellite high in the atmosphere , accessed using apple 's satellite map app , took this amazing image of a creature swimming below the surface of the world famous loch the systems administrator was at home in stockholm when he spotted a long thin object in the water on a google earth image taken above horse shoe scree on the loch 's southern side
mr sjã¶strand said : ' i am very interested in anything regarding nessie and the history of loch ness
' the reason i found this image on google earth was that i was sitting one night at home reading about loch ness monster and loch ness on the internet and thought i would check to see if i could see something from above - and that proved to turn out well
' i have never been to scotland but my hopes are that one day i will visit loch ness
' the picture is the latest in a series of possible loch ness monster pictures
in november mailonline reported that grainy footage had emerged showing a long and thin shape swaying in the water - one that bears a striking resemblance to loch ness monster âs fabled slender neck
the video shows the object waving in the choppy water , around 500ft from the loch âs shore
it was captured by collis â who counts himself amongst the most ardent loch ness monster cynics after years of fishing on the waters without a sighting
but the tree planter was so taken aback by the mysterious shape he noticed while driving along the edge of the loch that he filmed it on his iphone , and believes he might have stumbled upon the real deal
' as i was watching , i was thinking what the hell is that ? â said mr collis , 58 , who noticed the shape while travelling around a mile from fort augustus at the south - west end of loch ness
he added : â i do nât really believe in anything like that until i see it
