with her hair pulled back and wearing no make - up , the woman at the window looks no different from other young mothers soon after childbirth as she pulls back the curtains to let the sun shine in on her new baby
but there the comparison ends , for 19 - year - old heather mack faces a lifetime behind bars - or even death by firing squad - if convicted of the premeditated murder of her socialite mother , mack
a little more than 24 hours before this exclusive glance through a bali hospital window , miss mack had given birth in a caesarian operation to her 6lb 1oz daughter , stella schaefer , the last name being that of the baby 's father and her co-accused 21 - year - old tommy schaefer
although miss mack is not considered a flight risk , as a woman facing a serious charge she has to remain under guard at all time , no matter what the circumstances
joining her in the hospital room - and standing for a short time at the window - were the child 's grandmother , tommy schaefer 's mother , and other relatives and friends who had flown from their homes in chicago
and it is from his mother and relatives that tommy schaefer will have to rely for a first hand description of his baby , for he has been refused the right to travel under guard from kerobokan prison to the hospital
prison sources said he was ' pacing up and down with frustration ' in his cell as he anxiously waits for the moment when he will first set eyes on his daughter
â he âs going crazy in there , wanting to see his daughter , but he âs been told he 's a prisoner on a serious charge and there will be no hospital visits , â a prison source said
mack , 19 , was taken to hospital from kerobokan prison after she started to have contractions earlier this week mack had expressed fears that she would have to deliver the baby behind bars because she did not have a down payment that the hospital , pictured , wanted up front unless the prison grants him a special privilege to see the baby , he is unlikely to see her until - and if - miss mack takes the child with her to their next scheduled court appearance on march 24
there is every likelihood of the couple âs next court appearance - their cases are being held separately - being adjourned while she regains the strength to face the judges in the denpasar district court
earlier miss mack had expressed fears that she would have to deliver the baby behind bars because she did not have a down payment that the hospital wanted up front
but her united states attorney , anthony scifo , has told the chicago tribune - the city where the accused couple come from - that he was able to send money to indonesian earlier in the week after working out a deal with miss mack âs uncle , who controls $ 1.56 million in a trust fund set up for her by her murdered mother
miss mack does not have access to the money under her 30th birthday
mack had the baby in the wings amerta building of the sanglah hospital
the couple have claimed that the unborn baby has been at the centre of problems between mrs mack and tommy schaefer
they have told police that she objected to her daughter âs pregnancy by tommy schaefer and during a fierce argument he struck heather mack âs mother with the metal handle of a fruit bowl
if miss mack keeps to her stated intentions , she plans to keep the baby with her in the cell for the maximum allowed period of two years - unless there are dramatic developments in the case against her and she is able to leave the notorious prison
the pair ( pictured together ) , from chicago , illinois , are being tried separately by the denpasar district court sheila von wiese-mack 's badly beaten body was found in a suitcase in the trunk of a taxi at the hotel but if convicted of the charge of premeditated murder , she - and tommy schaefer - could be sentenced to death by firing squad
it is not known when she will be returned to the prison with her baby , but hospital staff suggested it could be within the next 48 hours
mack had earlier told friends who have been supporting her during jail visits that she was expecting her baby in april
this means the child was born prematurely
last week tommy schaefer told the trial that he had been attacked by mack and called a racially offensive name
he said that his relationship with heather mack was not endorsed by her mother and he went to bali to decide how to tell her they were pregnant
after meeting with mack at the hotel , they discussed how to inform von mack that mack was pregnant and agreed to meet in the hotel room where mack and her mother were staying
speaking through an interpreter , tommy schaefer said mack asked him to bring a metal fruit bowl , which he hid under his shirt as a ' precaution '
asked by a judge why it was hidden , tommy schaefer answered that he was not sure whether he would use it or not to protect himself
according to tommy schaefer , he arrived in the room and found mack weeping
he did not know why , but also saw that mack 's mother was screaming
' she ( von mack ) was angry at me when she knew that heather mack was pregnant , ' tommy schaefer said , while trying to hold back tears
heavily pregnant mack ( right ) , 19 , and tommy schaefer ( second from left ) , 21 , sit in the court room in front of what is believed to be the suitcase they are accused of using to hide the body of von wiese - mack mack , who was sitting beside her lawyer , sobbed at the testimony
he said that the victim insulted him using a racial slur and described her daughter as a prostitute who liked a black man
he said the situation got heated when mack asked her daughter for an abortion or to kill the unborn baby
tommy schaefer said that led to a quarrel in which von mack strangled him hard for about 30 seconds
' i was angry , i took the fruit bowl and hit her , ' tommy schaefer said , in tears
he added that he did not remember how many times he hit the victim
after acknowledging she was n't breathing , he tried to give her artificial respiration , while mack , who had run in panic into the bathroom for about three minutes , came back and tried to revive her mother
he said he was trembling and scared and called 911 on his mobile phone before realizing that he was not in the united states
in her first questioning in court on wednesday , mack , who is eight months ' pregnant , said tommy schaefer beat her mother with a metal soup bowl after von mack made the threat in an argument
' the blow was not so hard ... and my mother was still resisting , ' mack said
' i asked tommy to stop and then i ran into the bathroom
' von wiese-mack 's bludgeoned body was folded in half and stuffed into a suitcase with bloody sheets
the suitcase was later found in a taxi at the posh st. regis hotel in august
heather mack , 19 , told an indonesian court on wednesday that her boyfriend tommy schaefer , 21 , killed shelia von wiese-mack ( together - left ) in anger after she threatened to kill their unborn baby in february a health scare saw mack rushed to hospital after she collapsed with stomach pain and started bleeding
she was taken to bali 's sanglah hospital , the main medical centre in denpasar , where tourists and other foreigners are usually treated
hospital officials later said miss mack 's baby was safe but she had been taken to hospital for an immediate check - up because she was in pain and had lost blood
in january mack had said she vowed to bring the baby up in the cramped bali prison she shares with six others
she has told fellow prisoners in the wijaya kusuma cell block of her intentions - but that has not gone down well with several of the other women
' make arrangements to get your baby out of here , ' one prisoner is reported to have angrily told her
' we 're fed up with being woken by crying babies
' in an adjoining cell a prisoner in her late 30s is raising a baby which cries through the night , waking other inmates
' this is what your baby is going to be doing - waking us up - and we do n't want that , ' heather mack was told by one woman - according to visitors leaving the prison after delivering food to relatives in the women 's section of the notorious prison
the protests , however , have failed to dampen the resolve of mack .
