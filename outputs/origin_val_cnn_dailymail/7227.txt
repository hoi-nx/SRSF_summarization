a woman at the centre of a vote - rigging row is being parachuted into a key marginal seat by labour âs biggest union donor
murphy , a close friend of unite leader len mccluskey , was suspended by labour in 2013 and reported to police after allegations that the union had tried to manipulate the selection process in falkirk in her favour
she was later cleared and had her membership re-instated , but she quit as labour candidate in the scottish seat for the sake of â reconciliation and unity â
murphy , pictured , was involved in the falkirk vote rigging scandal in 2013 which led to her suspension unite now wants miss murphy to be selected in key marginal halifax where the current labour mp , riordan , has announced she is stepping down
her possible inclusion on an all - women shortlist , to be announced on tuesday , risks re-opening the wounds of the bitter falkirk row just weeks before the election and is proving a headache for miliband
the labour leader has been warned that his party risks losing the seat if miss murphy is selected , but the union could stop bankrolling the party âs election campaign if she is not chosen
unite has already mounted a strong campaign to ensure miss murphy is the candidate
mrs riordan , also a unite member , has taken her on a tour of the seat to introduce her to local members
the pair have also been pictured campaigning with labour councillors
unite is also organising a campaign day in the seat on sunday , two days before the candidates on the all - women shortlist are revealed
it is hoping to flood the constituency with members from all over yorkshire and humber in what is seen as a â peacock exercise â to show off the resources it could deploy if miss murphy is chosen
unite members in the region have been told their support â is vitally important â
len mccluskey , pictured , wants miss murphy included on the all - woman shortlist in halifax a spokesman for the union last night confirmed that it â hopes â miss murphy is put on the shortlist of candidates
he dismissed suggestions that mr len mccluskey had threatened to halt funding labour âs general election campaign if she is not chosen as â complete and utter rubbish â
labour yesterday confirmed that an all - women shortlist would be decided for the halifax seat on tuesday , with the local party voting on its chosen candidate next saturday
the shortlist is picked by the â special selection panel â , which mr miliband sits on
the announcement came hours after mrs riordan claimed the party had been â dragging its feet â over the selection since she made her decision more than a month ago that she would step down on health grounds
in a letter to the party âs general secretary iain mcnicol , which was leaked to the local paper , she claimed that there were suspicions the selection was being delayed so the party could impose its own candidate
the seat , where mrs riordan has a majority of 1,472 , is number 18 on the tories â target list
unite has given labour more than Â£ 14million since mr miliband became leader
nearly 130 candidates standing for the party in may have links to the union
labour âs internal report into the falkirk row , which was leaked , found party officials had concerns over the way unite was allegedly recruiting members to â pack â the local party before the vote to select its election candidate
unite has always denied any wrongdoing .
