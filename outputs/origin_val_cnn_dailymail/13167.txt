mikaela shiffrin is on course to make skiing history after claiming her third consecutive slalom victory on the world cup circuit on saturday
the young u.s. is hoping to become the first woman to win both the discipline 's world title and overall crown in successive seasons
mikaela shiffrin , who retained her slalom title at february 's world championships in colorado , now has a 90 - point lead going into next week 's world cup finale in france
" i think the first couple races of the season i was pretty arrogant and was like , ' i 'm just going to win these , i guess
' and i did n't
i was n't even close , " said mikaela shiffrin , who has won the slalom crystal globe two years running
" when you 're racing at a high level -- or doing any sport at a high level -- everybody 's going for the win
i learned that i ca n't take my foot off the gas and expect to win
these last races , i was pushing everything
any race that i won this season , i was giving my entire heart into it
i 'm proud of that

france 's alexis pinturault won on saturday to be second in the giant slalom standings ahead of u.s. ted and third in the overall competition
olympic champion ted has won the last two giant slalom crystal globes but has dropped off the pace after a disappointing second half of the season
on saturday , he was fourth behind france 's thomas fanara
" this is the first time since the change in the ski rules ( after the 2011 - 12 season ) that i 've caught the globe in gs , " hirscher said
" for me , it was two years with a lot of thinking and disappointment against ted
" i was 2.7 seconds behind ted in the first race with the longer skis
we realized that we are so far away from ted and that was the beginning of a long way and a lot of work , a lot of test and some different setup things
many people worked really hard for this success
