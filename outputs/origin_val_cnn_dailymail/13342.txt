as more details about the infamous isis executioner " jihadi john " become known , certain basic questions continue to be raised
is islam as a faith to be blamed for mohammed emwazi 's voyage to isis , otherwise known as the islamic state ? or is the " war on terror " responsible , and is this merely " chickens coming home to roost ? " the temptation is to come to simplistic answers
confronted with such brazen depravity as shown in isis propaganda videos , many take what their propagandists say very seriously : that they are , indeed , doing what their faith tells them to do
on the other hand , few believed isis when it was claimed they would negotiate with the japanese authorities to release one of their citizens captured in syria , who was later killed
taking isis at their word is probably not the most sensible course of action -- it is obviously quite wrong -- and duplicitous -- about a number of things
there have been other neo-religious movements in both muslims and christian history
the " assassins , " for example , which began in the 11th century , was a radical , heterodox movement of muslims , which eventually died out -- in its own time , similar to isis today , it was decried and depicted as deviant by muslims religious authorities as well as most muslims
among christendom , many of the nazi germany leadership in the 20th century espoused an ideology called " christianity
" it obviously never attracted much of a following , and historians claim , " only a few radicals on the extreme wing of liberal protestant would recognize such a mish - mash as true christianity
" why , then , are we not prepared to expunge islam from the mix when interrogating isis ideology ? while most churches , protestant and catholic , rejected the " christianity " of nazi germany , there is no corresponding action from the world of islam
the problem is , that 's not entirely possible
unlike christendom , islam does not admit a hierarchical , ecclesiastical authority -- so , no " muslim church " or " islamic pope " exists
having said that , nevertheless , there are systems of religious authority in islam
they are more akin to academic peer review structures -- indeed , the concept of the modern university comes from the medieval muslims seminary
since the dawn of isis , numerous muslims religious authorities have denounced the claim to authenticity by isis , on religious grounds -- none have given it that prize of legitimacy it so craves
that is , except for isis itself , and for some odd reason , some in the west who insist on taking isis at its word
religious authorities at large , and muslims in general , may recognize isis members as muslims , albeit gravely deviant ones who ought to be treated as criminals
just as europeans en masse rejected the claims of anders breivik , the norwegian mass killer , who claimed " christianity " as a motivator , without denying he considered himself to be a christian
in both cases , it is important to understand how this ideology is internally justified , and on what basis , particularly in terms of establishing methods for immunizing vulnerable people from possible recruitment strategies
that does n't , nevertheless , entail recognizing their claims as accurate -- only that they take them seriously , and others may too
that question of " vulnerability " has also been brought up a great deal in the last couple of weeks
there were some in the british who argued that jihadi john was subjected to a type of harassment by the british security services that proved to be a causal factor in his radicalization process
in one interview , the lobby group , cage prisoners , insisted in response to a question about responsibility for the beheadings in syria : " the man who cut off their heads , and if you take that back a step , the people who potentially helped in his radicalization ; in this case , the security services
" specialists in the field of radicalization took great exception to the implication , with experts from the likes of exeter university and kings college london describing it as " absurd , " and " bizarre
" certainly , there are questions to be raised with regards to the british security services -- including how jihadi john , who was known to them , was allowed to leave the country , as well as how suspects are interrogated and questioned
there should n't be any sensitivity about this -- the british security services do the job that they do precisely so british live in a society open enough to be able to ask these questions without fear or reprisal
nevertheless , the suggestion that the british security services somehow radicalized jihadi john is peculiar
there are many high - profile members of isis in syria and iraq who underwent no harassment of any sort -- for example , lotfi arrifin , a youth leader in a malaysian political party
there are also many who have undergone far more invasive encounters with other security establishments worldwide , at the hands of authoritarian governments in the arab world and elsewhere -- they did not suddenly register for service in the isis stronghold of raqqa
does it make them more vulnerable to possible recruitment ? it very well could -- but that 's not a foregone conclusion
otherwise , given the scale of autocratic oppression in recent history , we should have seen far more members of isis
there will be those who contend radical islamism theology is all we need to look at in understanding radicalization -- there will be others who will place all attention on domestic issues such as the security services , or foreign policy
the reality is , however , there is no template for explaining the voyage an individual takes in becoming a member of isis or any other radical islamism group
for different individuals , different factors make them vulnerable to recruitment
more often than not , a recruit will find him or herself looking for some kind of " meaning " in this world -- and repugnant though isis ideology may be , it does provide a sense of certainty
what makes recruits more attuned to that kind of absolutism as opposed to going down other paths ? it may be many things that condition them before they accept radical islamism as their " savior
" in all cases , nevertheless , there are two things we ought to keep foremost in mind
we must understand the context of the paths these recruits go through , to avoid others doing the same -- and we must always keep in mind that regardless of the context , only one person has responsibility for their actions
each one of them , themselves .
