a woman accused of decapitating her 3 - month - old daughter in ohio pleaded not guilty thursday to a charge of aggravated murder
watkins , 20 , was arraigned on the charge in hamilton county common pleas court , where her attorney entered the not - guilty plea for her
judge charles kubicki ordered that watkins be transferred to the twin valley behavioral healthcare facility in columbus for psychological evaluation and he increased her bail from $ 500,000 to $ 5 million
authorities said the baby had been stabbed multiple times with a large chef 's knife and that she also had a fractured arm , and the knife had been placed in her hand
authorities say watkins appeared to be suffering from serious mental issues when police found her covered in blood in a bed at the aunt 's home
prosecutors have already said they wo n't seek the death penalty watkins was considered a threat to her child and had been ' acting crazy ' and talking about demons when a juvenile court judge earlier in march placed the baby in the custody of hamilton county job and family services
janiyah had been placed in the aunt 's custody ( her home above ) after watkins was hospitalized for psychiatric problems in january social workers later placed the baby in the aunt 's care , warning her to keep the mother away from the child unless social workers were present , authorities said
prosecutors said the county welfare agency followed court orders in finding a relative to care for the baby and checking on her numerous time , but they said social workers did n't know the mother apparently moved into the aunt 's home about a week before the slaying
court documents also show that watkins was diagnosed with postpartum psychosis , and doctors declared her unsafe around the child unless she took prescribed medication .
