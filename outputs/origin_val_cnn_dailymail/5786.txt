a bungling romanian government staffer has been sacked after a minister mistakenly handed a gift to his german counterpart with a map of france , not german , inscribed on it
officials were left red - faced after german 's foreign minister steinmeier received the gift from romanian 's bogdan aurescu at the end of a news conference marking 135 years of diplomatic relations
but what was immediately apparent was that the map on the brochure , filled with the colors of the german flag , was that of france , not german
german foreign minister steinmeier and his romanian counterpart bogdan aurescu exchange the gift unaware it shows a map of france filled with the colors of the german flag mr steinmeier unwittingly holds the brochure aloft after it was given to him by the romanian government pictures show the two ministers grinning and posing for photos as mr steinmeier receives the gift unaware the obvious error is being displayed to the world
today the foreign ministry said it had fired spokeswoman brandusa predescu , saying the incident ' projected a totally unfavorable image
' romanian also said mr steinmeier had responded diplomatically , claiming he had n't noticed the mistake
immediately following the mix - up , romanian 's foreign ministry apologized , saying it had received the brochure in the morning containing the error from national news agency agerpres
its statement read : ' due to a regrettable technical error , exclusively on the cover of the booklet , the border of the maps of romanian and france - with the latter being covered by the german flag - was printed
' the romanian foreign minister has directly conveyed profound regret for this situation to his german counterpart
' new agency agerpres later apologized to both the german and romanian foreign ministries for the mix - up , as did the printing company
it is the second time in just over a month that romanian 's foreign ministry has had to apologise for a mistake
in february the romanian embassy in paris sent out invitations for a reception and accidentally attached a spreadsheet with unflattering descriptions of guests such as ' undesirable ' or ' ghastly ' .
