eagles manager pardew has encouraged wilfried zaha to aim for a place in gareth âs england squad for the european under 21 championship this summer
the tricky winger scored and set up another in eagles âs win which left qpr deep in the relegation quagmire
when the debate rages about who should play in the under 21 tournaments , premier league managers often prefer their stars to skip them
wilfried zaha celebrates with eagles team - mates after his opener at selhurst park on saturday shaun wright-phillips made his first premier league start for 770 days
but pardew has taken the unusual step of backing zaha for the tournament and will speak to gareth about including him
â i would love wilf to be on that trip because that is a big tournament for england , â pardew said
â particularly after the champions league results this year and england did nât do well in the world cup so i think gareth should have the best players available and i âm hoping wilf is one of them
but gareth âs choice wo nât be determined by a phone call from me , he is his own man
â wilf has definitely found himself a little bit more and i think gareth would like somebody in the squad who has the kind of quality that he does
but he âs got to do it between now and the end of the year and push for a place in that squad â that should be a goal for him
â zaha âs counterpart on the opposite flank yannick bolasie also starred in the victory , twice beating qpr âs teenage right - back furlong to get to the byline and send in low crosses â one for zaha âs goal and the other for james mcarthur to score
zaha slides in to open the scoring during the 3 - 1 win over relegation threatened qpr furlong was run ragged and eventually hooked at the break
yannick bolasie admitted he targeted the 19 - year - old as a weak link in the team
â my aim was to go at him straight away , â he said
â he ai nât going to come here and i âm not going to let him settle , so that was my aim to be honest
i know it â s cruel , that âs football
â a couple of the players spoke to me and i was nât aware [ of him ] , because i don â t really look at the opposition like that
but that was the aim
â furlong was at least not at fault for the third goal , which came from the other flank when zaha tricked his way through a couple of players before passing to joel ward to net for eagles for the very first time
yannick bolasie ( left ) was in great form to provide two assists for eagles on saturday afternoon qpr âs matt phillips scored a goal - of - the - season contender with a 40 - yard drive in the final 10 minutes , but it was too late and defeat left them four points adrift of safety
manager chris ramsey laid part of the blame on his players , saying : â they have realised there are only a certain amount of things you can do in preparation but you have to transfer it in the game
â sometimes i go and watch games and do nât get in until 2am
sometimes i wake up early and watch a dvd of the other teams
me doing extra hours is not going to make any difference to them
