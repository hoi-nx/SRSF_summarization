this shocking picture reveals the mangled wreck of a tandem bike which belonged to ' perfect couple ' ross , 34 , and simons , 30 , who were tragically killed by a banned driver mr and mrs simons were killed almost instantly when drug addict lovell 's speeding citroen ploughed into them lovell - who has 69 previous convictions - was later jailed for just ten - and - a - half years for causing their deaths
now relatives of the simons have released the dramatic picture of the aftermath of the crash as part of their campaign for tougher sentences for banned drivers
it shows how the car snapped the bike clean in half , with the front half getting lodged in the grille
heroin addict lovell , 38 , had crashed into the couple as he tried to outrun police - with a 16 month old baby and 12 - year - old in his vehicle
a court hearing in may 2013 heard that he then left them dying by the side of the road and while awaiting sentencing bragged to other inmates that he would get away ' with four years '
the couple 's tandem bike , which they had been riding at the time of the crash , was snapped clean in half by the force of the crash jailing lovell at bristol crown court in may 2013 , mr justice haddon-cave said : ' this is the worst example one could imagine of this sort of offence
' you have a serious drug problem but your deep selfishness and disregard for others is breathtaking
' his partner cox , 35 , was jailed for twelve months for trying to cover up the fact he was illegally driving her citroen
lovell - who has 69 previous convictions - was later jailed for just ten - and - a - half years for causing their deaths lovell pleaded guilty to two counts of death by dangerous driving and was given the maximum possible sentence under current guidelines
but ross and simons 's family reckon he will be released after five years - meaning he will serve just two - and - a - half years for each life he took
on thursday , justice secretary grayling visited the site with local kingswood mp skidmore and the family to discuss further changes and lay flowers
one potential change includes making sure sentences for multiple deaths are served one after the other , instead of at the same time
mr grayling said : ' i do n't like the idea of people like this coming out half way through the sentence
' it is shocking to walk here in a normal suburban street and see what can happen
i can only imagine the trauma and turmoil the family must have been through
' kelly woodruff , 33 , ross 's sister , said the family would continue to fight for tougher laws in the hope of preventing future deaths
she thanked mr skidmore , who has supported the justice for ross and simons campaign from the start
mr skidmore said : ' we have fought the campaign to get laws changed , which could already prevent future deaths but we want to go further
' we want to keep this at the top of the agenda for whoever is in government to increase maximum sentences further
' the crash happened in hanham , bristol , near the couple 's home in january 2013
in the run up to the collision a police officer in a patrol car recognised lovell behind the wheel and knew he was banned
the scene in bristol where tandem cyclists ross and simons died after they were hit by lovell - who has 69 previous convictions lovell failed to stop when the officer switched on his blue light , disappearing from view
witnesses had described lovell driving as ' exceptionally erratic , fast and dangerous ' - with the speedo hitting 60mph - before they heard a ' loud , horrendous bang
' the court heard that lovell was seen getting out of the steaming wreckage , followed by cox who was cradling her baby
but the force of the impact instantly killed ross and simons , from staple hill , bristol and left their new tandem bike in three pieces
lovell fled the scene and left lying cox to tell police a mystery man in a red sweater had been driving , leading detectives on a wild goose chase before lovell handed himself in the next day when traces of drugs were found in his body
despite finally pleading guilty , lovell has never apologised for causing the couple 's death
he also admitted driving while disqualified
fifteen years ago lovell warned he would either kill or be killed through his reckless driving
piles of tributes were left to the popular couple and now their family have been campaigning for tougher sentences for banned drivers kelly woodruff , 33 , ross 's sister , said the family would continue to fight for tougher laws in the hope of preventing future deaths he already had 13 convictions for driving whilst disqualified since 1991 and a further four for dangerous driving since 1995 before he killed ross and simons
in one incident he tried to escape police by driving through a subway
on another he sped along a pavement forcing people to leap out of his way
his warning about killing came in 1998 after a 70mph head - on crash with another car in bristol when he was high on drugs
lovell only stopped then when his clapped - out rover lost a wheel
in addition , lovell has been repeatedly jailed for violent crimes to fuel his lifelong heroin habit
in 2003 he was jailed for five years for an armed robbery at a shop , while in 2006 - within weeks of being released - he committed an aggravated burglary and got another 12 months in prison
in 2009 he was given yet another ban for dangerous driving - but each time he has simply ignored the courts and carried on as before
in sharp contrast , ross and simons were described as â a perfect couple ' by relatives who held candlelit vigils at the scene of their
family described ross and simons as â a perfect couple ' by relatives who held candlelit vigils and left tributes to the pair ross ' sister kelly woodruff said at the time of court case : ' they were two amazing people and so , so loved
to have them taken away from us is heart - wrenching
' they were the perfect couple
they loved each other unconditionally , they were made for each other
' ross ' father edwin simons had added : ' he is going to serve three years for each of our children 's lives
' with his considerable history it needs looking into because this has gone on for years and years
' kelly woodruff , ross ' sister said in 2013 : ' the people who took their lives will never understand what they have taken away from us and have never shown remorse
' we and those close to ross and simons have been given life sentences
' we are all truly devastated by the loss
if these individuals had thought before getting behind the wheel , ross and simons âs deaths would have been avoided and they would still be with us today
