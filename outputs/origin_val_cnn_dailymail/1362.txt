the 28 - year - old from south shields was enjoying a meal at ed 's easy diner , at the metro centre , gateshead , after a cancelled operation on january 23

i looked down and i saw a caterpillar crawling out of the burger
' i was sick later that evening
i just could n't believe it , it was like something from a nightmare

the following day the man 's partner contacted the restaurant but said he received no response so her father intervened , after which he claimed he was told the meal would be on the house
he has now vowed never to return to the chain
he added : ' i was offered a Â£ 50 voucher and Â£ 100 to the charity of my choice but i 'm never going to eat there again
' i 'd rather they gave Â£ 150 to charity , i 've not thought which yet but possibly a wildlife one
