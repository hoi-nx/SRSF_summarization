' netflix officials say their product ' is available on thousands of internet connected devices , not just the ones mentioned '
' we âre also available on smart tvs , blu - ray and home theatre systems , games consoles , smart phones and tables
devices many people already own
' finder.com.au / internet - tv claims to have launched the most comprehensive guide about internet in aussies and since its launch on monday we 've seen almost 50,000 visits by aussies wanting to compare deals and buy internet enabled tvs and products
' netflix ( like the others ) is a metered video streaming service so your allowed usage will be affected , ' finder reports
' keep in mind that streaming in hd uses a higher bandwidth and will affect your usage at a faster rate than watching videos in standard definition will
' they are fairly similar in price but what you get for that price can differ quite significantly
besides the difference in tv shows , for the packages $ 10 and under , some have from 1 and up to 3 devices you can stream shows at the same time
' generally speaking , the more you pay the better picture quality and more devices you can use at the one time
' netflix says : ' we were the pioneers in adaptive bit rate streaming , it was created to aid markets with lesser broadband infrastructure and is one of our key features
' netflix price ( per month ) : one screen - $ 8.99 ; two screens - $ 11.99 ; four screens - $ 14.99 video resolution : one screen - standard definition ; two screens - high definition ; four screens - ultra definition exclusive content : orange is the new black ( exclusive to svod in aussies , will screen on foxtel ) , house of cards , bloodline , unbreakable kimmy schmidt , sense8 , grace and frankie , marvel 's daredevil , disney films and tv shows free trial period : one month finder says : pro = 30 day trial period con = restricted amount of new content and cheapest option only offers single streaming stan price : three screens - $ 10 video resolution : high definition exclusive content : better call saul , community , transparent , mozart in the jungle , dig , lost girl s4&5 , gallipoli , breaking bad s1 - 5 , fargo , channel nine series free trial period : one month finder says : pro = 30 day trial period con = less premium content presto price : tv shows only - $ 9.99 ; movies only - $ 9.99 ; tv shows and movies - $ 14.99 video resolution : standard definition exclusive content : ( exclusive to svod in aussies ) modern family , the sopranos , the wire , sex and the city , entourage , true blood , girls , boardwalk empire , dexter , the borgias , deadwood , californication , nurse jackie , ray donovan , channel seven series free trial period : one month finder says : pro = 30 day free trial con = not compatible with apple tv quickflix price : three screens - $ 9.99 video resolution : high definition exclusive content : game of thrones , walking dead , orange is the new black as exclusively to own on qfx
but it does not carry all seasons as they premiere free trial period : two weeks finder says : pro = wide range of shows con = premium shows are expensive the price variations amongst the providers are indicative of a number of features that you should investigate and consider before making a choice : in most cases , the internet tv offerings , will eat into download quotas
' you will need to contact your internet service provider in order to find out which ones , ' she added
' for example , some companies allow for unmetered viewing of catch - up tv programming like that offered by abc âs iview
' with other providers that are metered you should note that a 60 minute program can potentially consume up to 300mb of data
' when making the switch to internet television you also need to consider how well your devices and the platform are able to stream videos
if your internet connection is too slow , tv shows and movies will not stream to your device continuously
' instead , you will be left waiting while the device struggles to catch up
some content , like hd , also requires a higher speed connection then others
' netflix has , however , structured agreements with iinet and optus offering unmetered access
but it 's not all bad news , finder said while there is no value for money for the grown - ups viewing pleasure , parents could save thousands of dollars on children âs entertainment , including dvds and pay tv subscriptions , with the aussies launch
it has found that the cost of buying all 213 kids tv shows available on netflix would cost an estimated $ 4,221.76 , which equates to 469 months or 39 years worth of the basic netflix monthly subscription of $ 8.99
netflix launched in aussies on 24 march from au $ 8.99 a month for a basic package aussies actor ben mendelsohn pictured at the ' bloodline ' netflix tv series premiere the launch of netflix ushers in what is arguably the biggest change to the aussies tv landscape in decades
but the online streaming services will still have to convince aussies - who are among the most prolific illegal downloaders in the world - to pay for content
this could prove difficult , with a new canstar blue survey finding that the majority of aussies are still not willing to pay for tv content
about one in five are willing to pay up to $ 20 a month for a service that provides a majority of content they would like to see
but this could change in future , with the survey also finding that 23 per cent of young aussies are already utilising online streaming services .
