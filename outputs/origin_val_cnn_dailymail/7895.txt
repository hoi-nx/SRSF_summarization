a paleo cookbook for infants co-authored by my kitchen rules chef pete evans has been delayed over grave concerns about a recipe for baby formula made from liver and bone broth
the cookbook , bubba yum yum : the paleo way , has been slammed by the public health association of australian as having the potential to stunt the growth of babies and impair development
one recipe is a do - it - yourself baby formula made from liver and bone broth - one of pete evans ' signature paleo creations
the cookbook is the joint venture of celebrity chef pete evans , a long time advocate for the paleo diet , baby - blogger charlotte carr and naturopath helen padarin
pete evans has previously released two best - selling cookbooks through publisher pan macmillan , including titles family food and healthy every day , and charlotte carr , the wife of australian idol contestant wes carr , runs the popular bubba yum yum website
bubba yum yum  was marketed as ' simple , delicious paleo recipes for new mothers , babies and toddlers ' by ' health crusaders ' charlotte carr , helen padarin and pete evans , who ' have seen firsthand the positive impact a paleo way of eating has had on their families ' wellbeing '
the greatest concern , especially given that none of the authors have medical qualifications , lie with the do - it - yourself baby formula , which is made primarily from liver and bone broth , reported the australian women 's weekly
publisher pan macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of march 13 pete evans posted a 2,100 word rant on social media in october last year claiming that the modern australian diet is behind the rise in autism charlotte carr ( left ) , the wife of australian idol contestant wes carr ( centre ) , runs the popular bubba yum yum website and is a co-author of the book the broth reportedly contains ten times the recommended daily intake of vitamin a for infants , but lacks other basic nutrients needed for sustenance
professor yeatman said that while adults have the choice to follow the paleo diet , which excludes dairy and grains , parents are responsible for the diet of their children and that it would be unfair for parents to force ' unproven ' beliefs on them
pete evans , who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle , has long been a passionate advocate of the diet ' that 's the really troubling thing : the infant is totally at the whim of their parents when it comes to feeding
if the wrong decision is made , they may be seriously affected , ' she said
further concerns have been raised about the inclusion of runny eggs and added salt in the recipes , which contradicts national health guidelines
federal health minister sussan ley has allegedly been contacted regarding the issue , and publisher pan macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of march 13
the department of health released a statement regarding the concerns that had been brought to its attention
' the department of health is aware of this publication and has concerns about the inadequate nutritional value of some of the recipes , in particular the infant formula , and has been consulting with experts and will continue to investigate this matter , ' the statement said
in july last year , the dietitians association of australian ( daa ) criticised the paleo diet , with the association 's chief executive officer claire hewat labelling the paleo diet was ' potentially dangerous ' and evidence of its benefits ' just does n't stack up '
the paleo diet requires people to cut out ' grains , legumes , certain dairy products , conventionally - raised meats , non-organic produce , and genetically modified and processed foods ' , which ms hewart says is not practical for many australian
a disclaimer at the back of the cookbook states that the co-authors ' in good faith ' the recipes will lead to a healthier life , ' relying on the information contained in this publication may not give you the results you desire or may cause negative health consequences

' pete evans , who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle , has long been a passionate advocate of the diet , and has come under fire for some of his more controversial claims about the australian food industry
pete evans posted a 2,100 word rant on social media in october last year claiming that the modern australian diet is behind the rise in autism , taking aim at the heart foundation and the dietitians association of australia ( daa ) as he promoted the so - called benefits of the paleo diet
his fiery rant , which was motivated by a comment from a dietician on his facebook page , challenged the idea of the heart foundation 's tick and also questioned some of the beliefs held by the daa - both of which have spoken out against the paleo diet
pan macmillan has been contacted for comment .
