records show the trend for one - off names led to more than 4,800 unique children 's names last year lisa penney , of bounty , the uk 's largest parenting club , said : ' celebrities like the beckhams are renowned for choosing unusual names for their off - spring and today 's parents are quick to follow a trend in a bid to make sure their choice of baby names stands out from the crowd
' but baby name trends can change quickly and names that first seem unusual can quickly become common in the classroom
' just a couple of years ago ava and isla were pretty uncommon as a baby girl 's name , yet now they regularly feature in the top ten
' likewise for boys , a decade ago the names jacob and noah were rarely considered , but nowadays parents look beyond previously traditional biblical names like matthew , luke and adam
' whilst certain baby names can quickly rise to fame they can just as easily fall from favour
take tilly , lexi and lacey for example , now that they are more common in classrooms across the country they no longer make the grade for new parents who want a name that no other child is likely to have in the playground
' a list of the top 100 names for boys and girls was published in december , showing jack and emily were the most popular .
