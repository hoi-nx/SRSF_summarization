league one and two clubs have been asked to consider proposals allowing premier league under - 21 clubs to take part in the football league
clubs were very much against the addition of premier league b teams to the football league pyramid when it was suggested in june 2014 , and this has now been put forward as an alternative
the proposal was one of many aired at a recent meeting at st george 's park to discuss issues arising from the football association chairman 's england
the football league could involve premier league ' b ' teams in future if plans get the go - ahead youth squads from the likes of manchester united and chelsea could soon be headed for the lower - tier cup if the football league do bring ' b ' teams into the football league , they could adopt a similar format to that suggested by greg dyke last year , meaning teams would : it would see a change in format for the football league , with a group system being brought in
a statement from the football league clarifying the situation read : ' clubs have been asked to consider the concept of permitting 16 u21 teams from clubs with category one academies to participate in the football league
' the competition would feature 16 groups of four teams with one u21 team in each group , before a knockout stage leading to a final at wembley
' given the previous concerns of the premier league and its clubs about premier league b teams playing in the pyramid , any final proposal would also be accompanied by a change to the premier league 's articles of association that would protect the current 72 club constitution , save for any changes to promotion / relegation that clubs wished to make
' therefore , having provided them with this comfort , clubs willingly debated the potential commercial , financial and player development benefits of having u21 teams in this competition from 2015/16
peterborough united manager darren ferguson holds the trophy last year - but a youth coach win it in future fans head to wembley for the show - piece final of last year 's competition in march ' no formal proposals were tabled and no formal vote taken
' instead , league one and two clubs were asked to indicate whether they were content to see the football league progress the matter , which would include discussions with the premier league and football association , so that clubs can consider a full proposal at a future point
' therefore , as yet , no club has voted in favour or against the idea of having u21 teams in the football league , they have only indicated whether they wish to consider the matter further
' ultimately any changes to this competition will only happen with the support of league one and two clubs
' what is the football league ? more commonly known as the football league because of its sponsor , the football league is a competition for the clubs of league one and league two
the competition is divided into north and south sections and runs in a knockout format to a final staged at wembley
this year 's final will be played between bristol city and walsall on march 22
peterborough united beat chesterfield 3 - 1 in last season 's final
what is a category one academy ? those clubs who have academies graded at the highest level under the elite player performance plan , an initiative introduced in 2011 by the premier league to improve the quality and quantity of home - grown players in england
category one academies have high contact time with young players , require a minimum of 18 full - time staff and an operational budget of Â£ 2.5m or more
which clubs fall into this category ? those that compete in the barclays u21 premier league are category one
in division one : chelsea , everton , fulham , leicester city , liverpool , manchester city , manchester united , norwich city , southampton , sunderland , tottenham hotspur , west ham united
in division two : arsenal , aston villa , blackburn rovers , bolton wanderers , brighton and hove albion , derby county , middlesbrough , newcastle united , reading , stoke city , west bromwich albion and wolverhampton wanderers
how would this work ? 16 of these under 21 sides would enter the football league
the initial part would see 16 groups of four teams , with one under 21 team in each
it would then be followed by a knockout stage culminating in the wembley final
would it be fair ? the current rules for the u21 allow teams to field three overage outfield players and one overage goalkeeper
that 's why you will sometimes see a player returning from injury or struggling for form playing in an under 21 match
so the football league clubs would predominantly be playing against teenage players but potentially with the odd big name thrown in
of course , the rules could be altered
how would it fit into the calendar ? while some football league clubs take the football league seriously , it is viewed by many as a distraction from the league and other , more prestigious under 21 premier league cup competitions
some clubs have fielded weakened sides in the competitions in the past
crowds are also significantly lower than in other competitions , with a day out at wembley the main attraction
for the under 21 teams , the games would have to be shoehorned in between premier league games , the under 21 premier league cup and the under 21 international cup
