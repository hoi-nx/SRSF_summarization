a british couple on holiday in goa were left with just 10p after their Â£ 2,000 spending money was stolen from their hotel 's safe
dominique pattrick , 29 and her husband brett , 31 , had been advised by staff at their three star hotel to store their valuables in a safety deposit box housed near the reception , but just four days into their trip it was raided
the padlock on the secure locker had not been tampered with but all their money , stored in two lockers , was missing
when they asked to inspect the hotel 's cctv , staff told the couple there were no cameras in the the safety deposit room as they feared it would be an ' invasion or privacy ' for guests
dominique pattrick , 29 , and her husband , brett , 31 , were left with just 10p to their name after Â£ 2,000 was stolen from their hotel 's safety deposit box the money went missing just four days into the couples sunshine break in the three star hotel in the popular resort bosses at the silver sand hotel in candolim , then landed them with a bill of Â£ 13 for using the locker
police in goa suspect the money was stolen by a rogue member of staff at the hotel using a duplicate skeleton key
mr and mrs pattrick , from bury , greater manchester were forced to ring home to get their bank to activate their credit cards so they could finance the rest of the two week trip which was booked through thomsons
now they are only be able to reclaim Â£ 250 due to a clause in their travel insurance policy
mrs pattrick , an nhs therapist said : ' it was bad enough that the money went missing from the safety deposit box but to then charge us for using it was bare faced cheek
' we were left with just a few rupees worth around ten pence and we had to ring home to unlock our credit cards to see us through
on arrival at the hotel the couple were advised to store their valuables in a locker located at the reception ' the terrible thing was people were trying to make out that no money went missing at all
' goa used to be a special place and we got married there but i would never go back now
' the couple were holidaying with friends when trouble occurred on the fourth day of last month 's trip
there were no cctv camera in the secure locker room mrs pattrick whose husband works as a mechanical engineer said : ' the hotel and thomsons themselves suggested we did not keep valuables in the room and instead use the locker at reception and we assumed that was good advice
' the money was kept in two wallets inside the locked deposit box along with a watch and four passports and the idea was to get small amounts of money every few days
it was a total shock to see the cash had gone
' the safety deposit box was not tampered with and the lock was still intact as was left accordingly
both wallets had even left zipped up as we left them
the only items not missing were our passports , watch and credit cards
' we alerted the hotel and the police but we could n't believe it when we heard there was no cctv cameras in the area of the safety deposit boxes
the manager said there were no cameras in the safety deposit box room because he did not want guest to complain about invasion of privacy
' it is pretty obvious what happened but they would n't accept responsibility for what happened to us
the manager said that the money would have been taken during the night because there were too many people around during the day and he went about calling the night receptionist and night porter to attend the police station for questioning
the police said the money was most likely stolen by a duplicate key
' a holiday rep from thomsons logged a complaint but warned the pattricks hotel staff doubted their allegations a rogue employee had taken the missing money
the group later moved to the nearby marinha dourada in arpora
the couple had previously got married in goa , but have said they would never return after the experience mrs pattrick said her holiday was ' ruined ' and she spent the whole break ' crying ' as a result of the theft mrs pattrick said : ' it was being implied we had stolen our own money or that the money was never in the safety deposit box to begin with
we were extremely distressed by what she was saying
' we felt alone and unsupported from the hotel management and thomson 's reps
we just felt we could no longer stay at the hotel and the manager stated ' it was probably for the best we did n't stay at the hotel
' nothing was done to help us other than us requesting to move hotel to a lower star rating than we had paid for
lots of distress and upset was caused and we only had enough money to buy food and drink after the theft
' our money was stolen whilst it was in possession of the hotel and they had the timerity to charged us for it
this holiday was nothing short of a nightmare and we felt very much alone and isolated
i could n't even tell my parents about it
all i did that holiday was cry
' a report by the calangute police said : ' the unknown employee ie : receptionist and room boy of silver sand hotel committed theft of 2000 pounds from the safe locker by using duplicate key
' a spokesman for thomsons said : ' thomson is sorry to hear of the group 's complaint
as soon as we were made aware of their reported loss our holiday advisors in resort did everything that they could to assist , including helping them to secure a police report for their insurance claim
' we would like to reassure customers that incidents of this type are extremely rare and also take the opportunity to remind customers of the importance of taking out a travel insurance policy when booking their holiday
