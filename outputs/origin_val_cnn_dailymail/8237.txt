it is one of those stressful moments , just before a holiday , when you realise you have packed so much you ca n't close your suitcase
and even if you manage to successfully perch on top and close the zip , who knows what state your summer wardrobe will emerge in when you arrive at your destination
which is perhaps why there are such things as ' professional packers '
ivica tot-genz , from berlin 's hotel de rome , is one such professional and is full of handy hints and tips to transport your worldly goods without the stress
packing can seem like a chore , but there are ways to make it less painful and more efficient in fact , he is so good at his job , he can pack up the perfect suitcase in 15 minutes flat
mr tot-genz learned his skills as a parachute packer in the army and states that anyone can use his tricks at home
' trousers should be rolled up with tissue paper , ' he said
' if you are on holiday and have to take party clothes , a dress or suit , just use paper towels from the kitchen
' he stuffs the arms of suit jackets with tissue paper to avoid creases and uses cardboard to easily fold shirts and help them keep their shape
' you can do these tricks at home , it 's done in a certain order , ' he said

apply a bull clip to razors that have lost their safety lid to prevent tearing of clothes the roll vs the layer heathrow airport has produced a video with tips on how to pack , advocating the layer method
this works on larger items such as dresses and trousers being laid flat on top of the case
the packer continues to layer clothes up with the lengths poking out either side of the suitcase , until all clothes are stacked
you then individually fold the clothes back in on themselves for minimal creases
professional packer ivica tot-genz uses plastic tissue between layers to prevent creasing
if you do not have any to hand , paper towel works just as well elika gibbs , of of wardrobe organisers practical princess , is also an advocate of layering
in previous advice to the mailonline , she advised : ' make sure everything is clean and pressed before you begin packing
pack things flat to stop them creasing during the journey
jackets are the most awkward : either wear one , pack it at the bottom or , if it 's a business trip , use a suit carrier
' the next layer is your cocktail dresses then your tops and bottoms
turn delicates and things whose colours might run , such as suede , inside out
' separate your clothes from items that might damage them , such as sequins , by using tissue paper
' use your underwear to fill in the gaps and put your shoes on the top , in either shoe bags or plastic bags
' the roll method is favoured by many , with creases minimised and space maximised
fans of this packing technique advise placing your shoes and heavy objects in the bag first
you then need to fill in all the space around them with your rolled up items , and fit your small accessories in the gap between clothes
if using a smaller bag for things like swimming costumes or underwear , roll the bag as well once you are ready to pack it
