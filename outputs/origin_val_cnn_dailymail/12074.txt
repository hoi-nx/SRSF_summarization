referee craig maxwell-keys angered wasps director of rugby young by producing the card after watching replays
but northampton saints director of rugby jim mallinder insisted : â it was reckless coming in with the knee and some serious consequences happened because of that
the opposition have to be very careful once the try has been scored
north could now miss a number of games after fellow player mike brown was ruled out with a similar knock the collision appeared accidental but it was deemed dangerous enough to send off the number eight â george north is ok , he âs come round , he âs in the changing room and he is up and walking about
it âs a knock to his head which is not good
we will look after him and we will make sure that he comes back when he is right
â young claimed : â when you slow anything down in slow - mo things look a bit worse
but once the crowd gets on a referee âs back , and it was a young referee , there is only one decision that is going to happen
we felt it was harsh
â first and foremost we hope that george north is all right
hughes has gone looking for him to make sure he is ok , he âs not that type of person
