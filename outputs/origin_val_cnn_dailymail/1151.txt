i was driving to the art store and i got into an accident
' it was n't that serious and i was n't hurt but it 's the first car accident i 've ever had
i drove home and that 's when the wheel came off my bmw
my assistant told me i could have died if the wheel had come off when i was on the freeway
' laughing , she added : ' then i was watching the news and saw harrison had his crash
' i 'm a bit worried it 's the curse of star wars
' the thing about harrison is that he 's always the coolest dude in the room
he just oozes manly manliness
i 'm not surprised he landed the plane in one piece and survived

i sent him some beers to the hospital with the message , ' you should have had a beer this time

as a woman you feel safe with him
i fully expect he will be back up there soon â even if he 's told he 's not allowed to
