â busy schedule : the visit is the duchess ' second in as many days and is part of her work as a champion for underprivileged families looking good : the duchess of cambridge cut a glamorous figure in her cheap chic maternity dress by online retailer asos duchess , although eight months pregnant , has had a notably busy schedule of late and spent yesterday presenting sprigs of shamrock to the 1st battalion , the irish guards
with husband william , the duchess watched as 200 soldiers from the regiment completed their traditional st. patrick 's day parade in the square at the mons barracks in aldershot
but while the cambridge opted to get into the spirit of things at the reception afterwards and enjoyed a pint of guinness , the duchess , who had earlier struggled to attach a shamrock posy to the collar of irish wolfhound domhnall , sensibly stuck to water
while the duchess was visiting children in woolwich , prince william at buckingham palace where he took part in a series of official audiences with the queen
in what will be seen as a sign of the cambridge 's increasingly central role within the royal family , william joined his grandmother as she accepted the letters patent from the new austrian and nicaraguan ambassadors
meeting ambassadors is a key part of the sovereign 's role , with foreign representatives expected to visit the queen to present their credentials when they arrive in the uk
those returning home are also expected to call on the monarch and present her with their official letters of recall before leaving
while this is the first time that the cambridge has joined the queen for audiences , he has already begun to conduct investiture ceremonies , a role only performed by the monarch or direct heirs
most memorable of his investitures so far was one that took place last month , in which he presented dragon 's den star james caan with a cbe and admitted to being a fan of the bbc show
