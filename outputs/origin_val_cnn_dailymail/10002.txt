standing in the middle of a pitch with a crowd of around 40,000 questioning your fitness and ability to get decisions right is a real test of mental strength
having a group of athletic , testosterone - fuelled players surrounding you , trying to intimidate and bully you into making a decision which favours them , is almost too much to bear
and i am incredulous that gary neville and john terry seem to think this harassment of referees is now somehow acceptable
john terry ( centre ) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following zlatan ibrahimovic 's first - half challenge in november 2006 i reported chelsea and their players for attempting to intimidate me during a game at tottenham
i asked the fa to study a specific incident , which was clear on video , when i felt intimidated and pressurised to give a decision
the fa reviewed the footage and said as i did not look frightened or intimidated , they would not be taking the case any further
chelsea captain john terry is sent off by referee graham poll during a match with tottenham in 2006 chelsea captain john terry ( left ) reacts after zlatan ibrahimovic 's tackle on oscar in the first - half at stamford bridge the chelsea players surround referee bjorn kuipers at stamford bridge as he brandishes the red card this is not a case of chelsea - bashing , although it was their players again who demonstrated that apparently anything is acceptable now in the pursuit of winning a football match
ganging up on referees is happening more and more and unless something is done to reverse the trend , it will get worse
we have former england captain john terry saying that hounding a referee is ok because everyone does it
on wednesday night i am sure that dutch referee bjorn kuipers was influenced after being harassed by chelsea âs outfield players
there was nothing in his body language to suggest he was about to reach for his red card and send off psg âs zlatan ibrahimovic until all that pressure was brought to bear
chelsea 's players surround referee bjorn kuipers as he sends off zlatan ibrahimovic ( second right ) some observers will suggest that referees could just brandish cards at players who apply too much pressure
however , players know that there is no credibility in showing multiple yellow cards at such incidents
instead , the time has come to rule that only the captains should be allowed to approach the referee .
