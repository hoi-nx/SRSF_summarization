' it 's just one of those things , ' ms cross said afterwards
' it happened and i tried to really think about it and not do it , but it 's habit
' mrs khenkina , who was at crufts watching over her prize - winning canines , has now waded into the scandal - nicknamed ' tailgate ' - backing knopa 's handler
the moscow dog breeder is adamant it can be legitimate to grab terriers by their tails
' i saw those rumours about cruel behaviour of my handler and i would call it pure trolling , ' she told mailonline
' those who say such things have no idea about terriers
terriers are hunting dogs designed for dragging animals out of holes
' and the only way the hunter can take the dog out of the hole is to grab its tail
' mrs khenkina also praised the strong bond between ms cross and the black scottish terrier
' i know cross , the handler , for a long time
she loves knopa , ' she said
' hurting her is the last thing in this world she would do
' tailgate : khenkina ( pictured ) said handler cross loves knopa and ' hurting her is the last thing in this world she would do ' murdered : knopa 's owner said the shocking poisoning of the highly rated setter at crufts was ' terrible news ' marina khenkinais adamant it can be legitimate to grab terriers by their tails : ' terriers are hunting dogs designed for dragging animals out of holes
and the only way the hunter can take the dog out of the hole is to grab its tail ' but tailgate was not the only scandal at this year 's crufts : as many as six of the competing dogs may have been poisoned , while three - year - old irish setter jagger was ' murdered ' after eating cubes of beef laced with poison , including slug pellets
mrs khenkina , speaking from poland , said the shocking poisoning of the highly rated setter at crufts was ' terrible news '
' i did not know about it when i was in england , i only read in the news on my way back to moscow - i am driving from england to russia now , ' she said
' it 's not for me to say who might have done this
' however , others online joked knopa may be a russia spy , and president putin , desperate to win the sought - after title of best in show , could be behind the death - noting the russia apparently have form with poisoning on british soil
in particular , the tweets cite the death of former kgb agent alexander litvinenko , who was poisoned in 2006 after meeting with russia associates in a top london hotel
' the winning dog was from russia , so it would n't be a surprise if the poison turned out to be polonium [ the radioactive substance used to kill alexander litvinenko ] , ' carl maxim ( @ carlmaxim ) tweeted
paddy power has even offered odds of 12/1 on putin being behind the dog 's death
trolling : khenkina , the russia owner of crufts , has dismissed the outrage surrounding the way her handler picked up the scottish terrier as ' pure trolling ' veteran : facebook page shows cross , who has a baby daughter , previously served in the military nearly 100,000 people have now signed an online petition , calling for ms cross to be stripped of her prestigious title but mrs khenkina was contemptuous of any idle jokes - and quick to make clear she had nothing to do with jagger 's death
she said : ' if anyone is comparing this to the story with alexander litvinenko , this is rubbish
' these two things have nothing in common
the dog world is a completely different place and people do n't do things from a political motive here
' mrs khenkina said she was watching another ring show the day jagger was allegedly poisoned , adding she did not care about setters because ' it is not my breed at all '
she insisted : ' our victory was a fair and clear one
we are sure in ourselves and in our victory , although we did not expect it at all
' light - hearted : some twitter users have joked russia , desperate to come out on top at crufts , may be behind the killing of jagger scandal : jagger , who is co-owned by belgium aleksandra lauwers and leicester - based breeder dee milligan-bott , died in his owner 's arms on friday , after returning home to belgium from the world famous show disgrace : mrs khenkina said the poisoning was a ' disgrace ' - and emphasised the world of canine competitions was completely separate from the political arena

' real russia dog owners are special people , they care for their dogs and puppies , they raise them with love , ' she explained
' we prefer to save somebody else 's dog
i always carry a full vet kit with me , maybe breaking the laws of other countries , crossing the borders with it but i need to have it with me and i glad to say that i did save dogs in my life and i did not care what country they belonged to
' she added : ' i have been breeding and exhibiting dogs for many years and i know that dogs can be poisoned at shows
' in the turbulent 1990s such a case took place in russia
there was also an incident in poland and in other countries , but i have not heard about such cases in england before
' it is an ugly and nasty thing to do , and it must be so hard for the owners
it is a disgrace for the breeders
' apology : ms cross ( pictured in the arena ) apologised , saying she â did nât do it on purpose , it was just habit ' celebrations : mrs khenkina - whose moment of glory was almost ruined when an animal protester stepped out into the right - is determined to enjoy her victory , and not let anything overshadow it but mrs khenkinka is determined not to let any of this get the way of celebrating her beloved dog 's victory
' [ my friends ] are all so happy about out victory - that a russia dog , bred in american but russia - owned , won the first prize
and think how politically beautiful it is , both for russia and for american , ' she said
' and the dog 's full name is to russia with love , after all
' it is far from the first victory for the five - year - old knopa , who was born in american
' knopa has won many titles before crufts , ' mrs khenkina said , proudly
' she was the junior world champion , junior european champion , interchampion and many other titles , and i was handling her myself two years ago when we got a title at crufts too
