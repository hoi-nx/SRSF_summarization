kelvin loraine , 31 , met the then 15 - year - old girl on an online chatroom in march 2013 , after which she sent him dozens of naked images of herself and performed sex acts on skype at his behest
shortly after the girl , referred to as child a , turned 16 , loraine travelled more than 400 miles from his home in durham to have sex with her in a hotel room in plymouth , the national college for teaching was told
the disgraced teacher , who taught maths at a sunderland school , admitted to also having let her watch him perform a sex act on himself via the video chat
he admitted receiving up to 40 photographs of her naked body - although he claimed this happened after her 16th birthday
a professional conduct panel of the national college for teaching said loraine admitted unacceptable professional conduct and conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute after a private meeting in coventry
he had already received a caution from durham constabulary last july for possessing an indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of the child - with whom he first came into contact in the spring of 2013
in a written ruling the panel said : ' child a would have been 15 years old at that time
they had daily contact online and by phone
mr kelvin loraine admits his communications , online and by phone , with child a were romantic and sometimes sexual in nature
' he admits he became aware she was 15 years of age at some point after the relationship commenced and at least 6 weeks before child a 's 16th birthday
' mr kelvin loraine accepts child a sent approximately 30 - 40 photographs of her naked body to him , sometimes but not always at his request
' mr kelvin loraine asserts that this did not occur until after child a 's 16th birthday and during these communications mr kelvin loraine requested that pupil a touch herself intimately using her finger , her hairbrush and a sex toy and that he viewed her performing these acts via skype
' mr kelvin loraine admits that this was for his sexual gratification
mr kelvin loraine also admits that , shortly after child a 's 16th birthday , he and child a entered into a ' slave contract ' - the written terms of which are attached to the agreed statement of facts
bad teacher : loraine met the then 15 - year - old girl on an online chatroom after which she sent him dozens of naked images of herself and performed sex acts on skype at his behest ( stock image ) ' mr kelvin loraine admits that his conduct was sexually motivated
on 30 november 2013 , shortly after child a 's 16th birthday , mr kelvin loraine arranged to meet her at a hotel in plymouth and travelled there from his home in durham
they then engaged in consensual sexual intercourse
' he agreed to the police caution on the basis she was 16 when the picture in his possession was taken and he was unaware an individual had to be 18 for such pictures to be legal
the panel said the inappropriate relationship started when she was 15 and continued after she turned 16
although he was not her teacher he did tell her he was a teacher
the panel said this had the potential for establishing her trust in him and influencing her behaviour
they said : ' the panel is satisfied it is necessary for a prohibition order to be imposed in order to protect pupils and other members of the public , maintain public confidence in the teaching profession and to declare and uphold proper standards of conduct
' they also recommended the case was so serious there should be no provision for him to apply to have it set aside in the future
paul heathcote , decision - maker for the national college for teaching and leadership panel , said : ' the panel is satisfied mr kelvin loraine 's behaviour is incompatible with being a teacher
' he was the instigator of indecent images of a child being taken which he then had in his possession for his own sexual gratification
