usually when president obama steps out on st patrick 's day , it 's his brilliant green tie which steals the show
but today another accessory won the day - the enormous new ' smart watch ' festooning the commander - in - chief 's wrist
obama was seen today wearing the hefty item - a fitbit surge device - as he walked around washington , d.c. and met with ireland prime minister enda kenny , and later lunched with congressmen on capitol hill
it uses led sensors to measure heart rate , and can function as a calorie counter and gps device
it also tells the time
the surge model is the largest and most sophisticated fitbit model , and sells for around $ 250
obama has previous expressed his interest in emergent ' wearable ' technology
in a february interview with re / code , he seemed torn between getting a fitbit and an apple watch
testing it out : obama suiting up : obama was pictured earlier today with the watch while getting dressed he said : ' i do nât have a fitbit yet , but i work out hard
word is these apple watches might be a good companion for my workouts
so i âm gon na see , i âm gon na test it out
' the testing had evidently begun by tuesday , when obama prominently wore the device for his public engagements
fitbit enthusiasts are encouraged to even wear their device to sleep , where it collects data while the subject is unconscious , and can wake them up with silent , vibrating alarms
one feature the president may be particularly keen on is that the device is programmable to have a golf mode
fitbits are set up to communicate with mobile devices regularly to store the data they collect - however the president is only allowed a blackberry because of security concerns , which is incompatible with his new toy
both the white house and fitbit have yet to respond to requests for comment .
