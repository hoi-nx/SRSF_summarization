if you want to impress a man , do n't try to be funny
research shows that men are n't hugely attracted to witty women
given the choice of a female who makes him laugh , or one that laughs at his jokes , he will choose the latter
luckily , women are n't too worried about their jokes being appreciated
they , it seems , like men who make them smile
men prefer it if a woman laughs at their jokes , rather than witty women research suggests ( stock image ) it is thought that women see the ability to make people laugh sign of intelligence â and men have evolved to show off how good they are with words
the miami researchers quizzed more than 80 men and women about how much importance they placed on having a partner who could make them laugh
they were also asked how much it mattered to them whether their partner found them funny
the answers revealed that women like men make them laugh , while men want to go out with women who appreciate their humour
in a second experiment , the volunteers were given hypothetical amounts of money to ' spend ' on designing their ideal partner
they were asked how much of the cash they 'd be willing to spend on getting someone who made them laugh and how much they 'd devote to getting someone who laughed at their jokes
as the amount of ' money ' on offer rose , the sexes became less rigid in their choices , with the males starting to splash the cash on funny females the women showing more interest in males who found them witty
the answers revealed that women like men make them laugh , while men want to go out with women who appreciate their humour ( stock image ) researcher hone said this suggests that in an ideal world , we value both traits in a partner
however , in the real world , we tend to place more emphasis on one or the other
she believes that women see the ability to make people laugh as a sign of intelligence â and of the sort of high quality genes that she 'd want in her children
given that women tend to be more choosy , men are under pressure to make them laugh
miss hone , who is close to completing her phd , said : ' given that humour requires high - level linguistic capacity , women are thought to use humour production as a sign that a man is a mentally - capable suitor
' however , she said that funny women should n't despair
there is also hope for bachelors who never remember punch lines
this is because her results were based on averages â and not everyone will have the same taste .
