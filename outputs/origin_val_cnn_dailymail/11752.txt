arsenal manager wenger will target a central defender , a holding midfielder and a goalkeeper this summer with a Â£ 50million transfer war chest
per mertesacker could pay for some poor performances this season , with borussia dortmund centre half neven subotic and aleksandar dragovic of dynamo kiev on the gunners â radar
arsenal goalkeepers david ospina and wojciech szczesny will also be sweating on their futures
petr cech is a possible target , although chelsea may not be prepared to sell to a rival
wenger is said to be eyeing a swoop for borussia dortmund defender neven subotic ( left ) aleksandar dragovic ( second right ) of dynamo kiev is also on wenger 's radar for a summer swoop arsenal manager wenger reportedly has a budget of Â£ 50million to spend on his squad in the summer wenger is a long - term admirer of southampton âs morgan schneiderlin , who is the leading contender for the midfield holding role
gabriel and laurent koscielny 's place in wenger 's plans for next season look secure
but the arrival of a new centre back in the summer is likely to have repercussions for mertesacker
the german 's performances have been criticised this season , though he was excellent in monday 's euphoric fa cup win over manchester united
wenger has been repeatedly linked with southampton midfielder morgan schneiderlin ( left ) chelsea keeper petr cech is also said to be of interest to arsenal but chelsea may not want to sell to a rival he was recently dropped by wenger , but gabriel 's hamstring injury has seen the defender handed an instant route back into the first - team
and the arrival of a new centre - half could marginalise mertesacker 's role in wenger 's plans
the capture of a new central defender could also have consequences for calum chambers
the england international has been used as cover at centre - back this season , but the club 's transfer plans could mean wenger sees his long - term future at right - back or holding midfield .
