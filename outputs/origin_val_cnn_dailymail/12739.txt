iraqi forces appear to be slowly closing in on an important tactical victory against isis
but as they press forward in their attempt to retake the city of tikrit from isis insurgents , there is an important question that the united states and its allies should be asking : could this victory actually undermine the only sustainable strategy for ensuring iraqi 's stability ? the reality is that short - term tactical victories wo n't be enough to defeat isis , especially as the reliance on iran - backed shiite militias is only likely to exacerbate tensions with the largely local sunnis population
indeed , the crucial ground war component of the campaign has so far been heavily reliant on the shiite militias , whose track record of sectarian violence is well - documented , and their involvement threatens to drive more iraqi sunnis into the arms of isis
gen. martin dempsey , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , has said the involvement of these groups " will only be a problem if it results in sectarianism
" but based on past experience , many locals are understandably more frightened by their designated " liberators " than they are of the vicious extremists of isis who have ruled their towns over the past eight months
historically , iraqi has n't always needed shiite militias under iran 's command to fight sunnis extremists
al qaeda was expelled from northern iraqi in 2007 , when its harsh rule antagonized tribal leaders that had supported the anti- united states insurgency , prompting them to make common cause with the united states in what became known as the " awakening " movement
unfortunately , once its goal had been achieved , baghdad rounded on the awakening , betraying promises of integration into the national army and polity and instead arresting and killing its leaders along with trusted sunni elected representatives
the united states looked the other way , deeming it a " domestic " political matter
that simply emboldened then - prime minister al-maliki to deepen his purge of sunni elected representatives , and to parlay the 2010 election result into a governing coalition despite his own list drawing fewer votes than a rival bloc that included many sunnis leaders
this undermined the work that the united states had done in persuading iraqi 's sunnis that fighting al qaeda and voting in elections was the best way to advance their communal interests
put simply , al-maliki 's actions made a mockery of any sunnis confidence in the electoral system or the national government
it was the resulting sunnis alienation that allowed al qaeda 's successor , isis , back into those communities
the growing fear among many sunnis has been compounded by prime minister al-abadi 's statement to parliament that any iraqi choosing to stay neutral was effectively aligning themselves with isis -- remarks that create an atmosphere that enables violence against ordinary sunnis , many of whom feel caught between the extremists and a shiite - led government from which they have been systematically oppressed and alienated
and isis has undoubtedly capitalized on the permissive environment created by such alienation , which persists despite the obama administration having convinced itself that al-abadi would somehow prove to be more inclusive than his predecessors from the same shiite islamist party
all this suggests that the " awakening " experience , which showed that iraqi sunnis will reject violent extremists if they believe they will get a fair shake from the system for doing so , is as vital as ever to the prospects of defeating isis
but the outcome must be different from the last awakening
sunnis willing to fight isis should be given control over their own affairs in northern iraqi in the way that kurdish aspirations have been accommodated
the alternative , of relying on sectarian forces to drive out the extremists , is more likely to ensure their return than to prevent it
getting to a new political order in iraqi that offers the prospect of sustainable stability and progress will require compromise , not only among iraqi but also among the regional sponsors of its contending factions -- iraqi has become a key battleground in the regional struggle between camps led by iran and the saudis
creating a political order capable of stabilizing iraqi will require a new security " grand bargain " negotiated between the key stakeholders
short - term tactical victories wo n't defeat isis , and militia involvement will more likely strengthen its appeal
the reality is that ultimately , only a political deal that guarantees iraqi sunnis ' inclusion , equality and protection -- one that is implemented by iran and its allied iraqi militia -- can resolve the isis problem
and unless all of the key stakeholders are willing to negotiate a new way of living together , iraqi is likely to remain a battleground where the united states finds itself inadvertently reinforcing the problem .
