dolce have come under fire again , this time for an ad that depicts the gang rape of a woman
just days after designers dolce and dolce called children born through ivf ' synthetic , ' critics of the brand have publicized the brand 's highly controversial spring / summer 2007 campaign ad that showed a woman being restrained by a bare - chested man as a group of men in various states of undress look on
the advertisement was banned from being used in italian publications after it ran several times when it was determined that it ' offended the dignity of the woman , ' and pulled in the united states after running just once in an issue of esquire
when the ad was first pulled in spain , the design duo referred to the people of that country as ' a bit backward
' the ad actually features one of kelly cutrone 's former costars on the mtv reality series the city , model adam senn
the duo also depicted a group sex scene featuring all men in another ad that was slightly more graphic , though the man , unlike the woman , was not being restrained
dolce said in the most recent issue of panoroma magazine ; ' you are born and you have a father and a mother
at least it should be like that
' that 's why i 'm not convinced by what i call chemical children , synthetic babies
' they are wombs for hire , semen chosen from a catalogue
and then you have to explain to these children who their mother is
' this after the men chose motherhood as the theme of their fall / winter 2015 fashion show held earlier this month in milan
parents of ivf babies , among them elton john , al roker , and ricky martin , came out against the two following these statements , as did celebrities including victoria beckham and courtney love
kelly cutrone ( left ) posted the old ad on her twitter , attacking dolce and dolce ( right ) elton john wrote on instagram following then incident ; ' how dare you refer to my beautiful children as " synthetic "
and shame on you for wagging your judgemental little fingers at ivf - a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people , both straight and gay , to fulfil their dream of having children
' your archaic thinking is out of step with the times , just like your fashions
i shall never wear dolce ever again
' now many have publicly declared they will boycott the duo 's designs
dolce meanwhile have said their statements were taken out of context , with dolce saying ; ' i am very well aware of the fact that there are other types of families and they are as legitimate as the one i 've known
