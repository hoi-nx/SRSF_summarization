the widow claimed she only learned of the dnr order four days after her husband 's death asked by assistant coroner david osborne if she had given consent for this , mrs richardson said : ' no , nothing at all
' she added : ' i visited the hospital twice a day
there would have been loads of opportunities for staff to talk to me

mrs richardson said he had been moved between various wards and when she visited him he ' seemed worse than when he went in '
although his medical notes correctly identified pulmonary fibrosis as his main condition , he was initially treated for emphysema , mrs richardson said
when she pointed this out , doctors increased his oxygen levels
she also described how her husband had been left to lie on soiled sheets and was not being regularly washed

but as they tried to save his life , a colleague checked his notes and pointed out the dnr notice so they stopped these efforts
