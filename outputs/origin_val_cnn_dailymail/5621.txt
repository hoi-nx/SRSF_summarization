most parents dream of their children growing up to become doctors , lawyers or astronauts
but when richard and sara from newport think of their nine - year - old son toby 's future , they see prison
the schoolboy , who features in a new programme tonight on channel 5 called my violent child , has suffered from bouts of extreme violence since he was very young - even at the age of four he threatened his older brother , then five , with a knife
his father richard said : ' from a very young age he was very aggressive
when he was about four , he held a knife to casey and threw bricks at casey
' he continued : ' we 've had police at the house where he 's thrown brick - a child ended up injured and needing dental treatment
' i expect for toby in his teens to be locked up , we 're expecting that
because he does n't care
' sara comforts toby after one of his outbursts the couple , who have three other children ; casey , 10 , corey , seven , and jacob , four , have been unable to control toby 's behaviour for years because they have no idea what the root of the problem is or what will start him off
sara said : ' absolutely anything sets toby off , it can be anything as daft as two items of food touching on his plate , a noise , a smell or something he sees - it can be anything
' he 's physically abusive , he 's mentally abusive , he really gets to you - to the point that he makes me want to cry sometimes
' sometimes i just let him pinch me and hit me and then he 'll calm down and sometimes he does
' i do n't want to live on edge every day when he wakes up , i should be able to enjoy being his mum
' toby attacks his mother during a tantrum sara and her son casey try to get toby off a bike during one of his outbursts the brunt of toby 's behaviour is borne by his parents - richard and sara have both been strangled by their son and during the hour - long programme , he is regularly filmed punching , biting and kicking them both
but the violence also extends to his brothers , including four - year - old jacob , who is filmed being kicked by toby in the park
his nature has become so unpredictable that sara reveals she is worried about leaving them alone in a room
sara reveals that she often just allows toby to kick and punch her to calm him down sara said : ' i ca n't leave him with his brothers because i know he 'll hit them
' the strain has become so great on sara and richard that it has almost split them up several times
richard said : ' it has driven us to the point where we could have parted ways many times
' when there 's no more you can do for each other and we 're struggling , it gets to the point where it would be easier to turn and walk away
' in an effort to find out what is causing toby 's outbursts , the programme makers call in parenting expert sarah
following a discussion with sara , she discovers that the very early years of his life were fraught with stress from the family 's living situation
from left : father richard , casey , 10 , toby , nine , corey , seven , jacob , four , and sara sara and richard had their eldest child casey when sara was just 14 years old , then 10 months later she gave birth to her second son toby
because of the strain of having two children so close together , sara reveals that she was very stressed and admits that she did n't bond with toby as well as she would have hoped
sarah then talks the family through a series of tricks that she can use to enforce the bond between mother and son and explains that much of toby 's behaviour may be down to the lack of affection
sara attempts a bonding exercise with toby as sara starts to use tactile behaviour , including hugging toby when he is having a tantrum or lightly touching his hand , she sees that her son starts to come out of his tantrums much quicker
sarah also discusses the importance of richard spending time with his family
richard works long hours six days a week in a car business in order to provide for his family , but jane emphasises that his children also need him to be around at home
the family then spend a day at the farm together and the couple admit that they are beginning to see big improvements in their son
sara said : ' it is early days but i hope that if i persevere with it then we 'll get results down the line and i think that day will come
