they are two of the most glamorous of europe 's royals and today was no exception for the dutch ' queen maxima and denmark 's crown princess mary
the two royals were visiting the carbon - neutral samsã¸ island , a small speck of land just off denmark 's jutland peninsula , and just about managed to hold on to their hats during a blustery ferry ride there
thanks to the churning baltic waves , the two also suffered a wobbly moment as the ferry , called kalhave , lurched beneath them
joined by frederik , 46 , and king willem-alexander , 47 , the two royals , who are long - standing friends , traded quips as they made the crossing
glamorous though the royals looked , they looked even more so during an evening reception celebrating dutch culture at the royal library in copenhagen
queen maxima , resplendent in a russet one - shoulder floor - length gown studded with rhinestones , showed no sign of fatigue , instead displaying a gorgeous golden tan
the royal kept things informal , however , by wearing her long blonde hair loose and curled while king willem-alexander was dapper in his dinner jacket

in contrast to her dutch counterpart , the australian - born royal had pulled her hair into a sleek low chignon and wore eye - catching diamond - shaped gold earrings
equally glamorous was denmark 's margrethe who donned a rose - pink gown with a white lace bodice and fur shrug
the men too looked good , with margrethe 's husband prince henrik natty in a dark blue dinner jacket while their son frederik scrubbed up well in a matching number
chic : dutch king willem-alexander , denmark queen margrethe , dutch queen maxima and prince henrik glowing : queen maxima traded her usual large jewels for a discreet diamond necklace and matching earrings the cultural celebration topped a busy day in which the two sets of europe royalty experienced the best of denmark weather on a sunny but blustery ferry crossing
the dutch royals are currently in the middle of a three - day trip that began on tuesday with a royal welcome at copenhagen 's kastrup airport
after spending a low - key afternoon meeting students at the university of aalborg , things took a turn for the glamorous during their first evening , courtesy of a banquet at christiansborg palace
with prime minister helle thorning-schmidt and the scandinavian country 's 74 - year - old monarch margrethe also in the room , the dinner saw plenty of toasts - and even better fashion
all smiles : the two royal couples appeared to be in good spirits as they arrived on samsã¸ island hanging on : at one point , the baltic breeze threatened to send both royals ' hats flying as is her wont , queen maxima pulled out all the stops in royal blue , while margrethe rose to the occasion in a spectacular pale blue dress
not to be outdone , crown princess crown princess mary looked wonderful in white , while her sister - in - law , french - born marie , shimmered in lilac
on wednesday morning , it was back to business with the two couples travelling to samsã¸ island to visit a special type of denmark boarding school called an efterskole
most denmark teenagers spend at least a year at the state boarding schools , where they are encouraged to focus on specific interests such as music

frederik and crown princess mary have suffered a bumpy few months , thanks to a film about the frederik 's playboy past that is set to be screened later this year
a second programme , this time being made for australian 's channel ten , could also cause some discomfort , thanks to claims that crown princess mary had had second thoughts in the run - up to her 2004 wedding
by contrast , queen maxima and king willem-alexander have enjoyed a smooth ride of late , with queen maxima in particular becoming increasingly popular
one of the most glamorous royals in europe , the argentina - born mother - of - three has proved a hit with her dutch subjects , thanks in no small part to her charity work
she will have plenty of opportunity to do more of that during this week 's state visit , with a trip to bispebjerg hospital also on their itinerary today
