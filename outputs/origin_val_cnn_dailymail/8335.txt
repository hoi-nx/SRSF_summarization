a woman accidentally set light to Â£ 20,000 cash that was meant for her husband 's staff after hiding it in a wood - burning stove and forgetting it was there
hao bin , 35 , stashed the wad of money inside the cooker to keep it safe for her husband wang so he could pay builders
the next morning mrs bin went to make a pot of tea , throwing a lighted match and kindling into the stove with burning paper so she could boil some water
mrs bin , from shaoshan in central chinese 's hunan province , threw water onto what was left of the cash , but it was too late
the devastated woman took the charred remains to the bank of china , but officials told her that , as less than half of each note was left , they could not exchange them for new money
mr hao bin , 39 , who owns a small construction company and needed to pay his workers a total of Â£ 20,000 , said he had forgiven his wife
bank of china officials refused to replace the burned money as less than half of each note was still intact mrs bin only realised her grave error when she went to through more wood on the fire and saw the money ablaze mr hao bin said the fire was a ' hard blow ' but that he would be able to cope , despite losing Â£ 20,000 cash he said : ' we had not been paid ourselves yet for our work , but i needed to pay the workers so we borrowed the money from friends and family , and we wanted somewhere to keep it safe for a day before paying it out
' it was a hard blow , and my wife is devastated
but i have forgiven her , and we will survive
' many chinese people choose to hide money at home because of a lack of trust in banks , with some hiding them in pillowcases and socks to keep them safe from thieves .
