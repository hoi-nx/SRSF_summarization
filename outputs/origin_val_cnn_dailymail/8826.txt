mapbox , a popular custom online map tool used by companies including pinterest and uber , has created a new set of maps that are out of this world
the amazing maps of mars were made using data from nasa and esa spacecraft
they are in high - resolution , and allow users to zoom in to the surface and see key features across the red planet
scroll down to use both maps washington dc - based mapbox have created interactive maps of the surface of mars
they use data from nasa and esa spacecraft to create the high - resolution detailed maps
the mars satellite map , shown , uses black and white imagery taken by the mars orbiter camera on the mgs ( mgs ) the maps are named mars satellite and mars terrain , and were created by data analyst and mapping strategist matt greene at mapbox
in december 2014 it was announced an instrument on the curiosity had identified spikes of methane that scientists believe may have come from bacteria - like organisms on the surface
the discovery , reported in the journal science , followed studies of gas samples by curiosity 's tls ( tls ) - an instrument that uses intense light to carry out chemical analysis
â we love space , and we think it 's amazing how much detail is mapped of our distant neighbour , â said mapbox on their website
â that 's why we 're using mapbox 's tools to make it possible to explore mars from anywhere
â the mars satellite map uses black and white imagery taken by the mars orbiter camera on the mgs ( mgs ) , provided by nasa and malin space science systems
nasa âs mgs was operational in orbit around mars from 12 september 1997 to 2 november 2006
it was a global mapping mission that examined the entire planet , including its atmosphere and surface
data from the mgs mission has been used to identify landing sites for rovers and landers on the surface
the whole surface of mars is then rendered in high - resolution , with landing sites and geological features on the surface highlighted
nasa âs mgs , illustrated , was operational in orbit around mars from 12 september 1997 to 2 november 2006
it was a global mapping mission that examined the entire planet , including its atmosphere and surface one of the most interesting is olympus mons , an enormous dormant volcano that is one of the largest mountains in the solar system , measuring 16 miles ( 25 kilometres ) tall
a second map called mars terrain uses vectorised hillshades and contours from digital elevation models of mars to visualise the surface
this uses information from the mars orbital laser altimeter an instrument that was also on board the mgs
it also uses data from the high resolution stereo camera on esa âs mars express , which has been in orbit around mars since christmas day in 2003 and is still operational today
