are you curious and creative but a bit standoffish ? then you 're probably a londoner
think of yourself as more dependable and down to earth ? you may well live in the midlands
and if you pride yourself on your friendliness and ability to stay calm in a crisis , you 're most likely to be scottish
this is according to experts at cambridge university , who have marked out a personality map of the whole of britain
revealed : the moody map of britain details the country 's most and least friendly inhabitants the profile revealed that inhabitants of the capital are the least welcoming of all
the welsh also fare badly , with the researchers declaring them to be exceptionally shy and neurotic
the scottish , however , can hold their heads high , as they are the friendliest and most emotionally stable people in britain
to find out what where we live says about us , psychologists asked almost 400,000 britain a series of questions designed to assess five key personality traits
they then looked to see how common each of the five characteristics â agreeableness , extraversion , openness , conscientiousness and neuroticism â was in each of the 380 council areas in england , scottish and welsh
characteristics : people in the midlands were among the most conscientious ( left ) , suggesting that like residents of the scottish highlands , they are dependable , reliable types
meanwhile those who lived in the capital scored highly on extraversion ( right ) , as did the people of manchester mapped out : the scottish scored highest in agreeableness ( left ) , which covers friendliness , trust , co-operation and concern about others
the scottish also emerged as the least neurotic ( right ) and the most calm and contented
the colour red means a greater level of an attribute , while blue is for the opposite new experiences : inhabitants of the east midlands and the east of england were the least open â leading to them being labelled ' conventional , down to earth and traditional ' the result is a fascinating , and at times controversial , snapshot of the psychology of britain
the scottish scored highest in agreeableness
the first of the five traits polled , it covers friendliness , trust , co-operation and concern about others
people in devon , somerset , east anglia and yorkshire are also highly agreeable sorts
and at the other end of the scale are the residents of london , who were found to be the least friendly of all
rather than being warm and welcoming , they are likely to be uncooperative , quarrelsome and irritable , the journal plos one reports
those who lived in the capital , however , scored highly on extraversion , as did the people of manchester
in contrast , those living in the scottish highlands and parts of lincolnshire were among the most quiet and reserved
londoners fared badly in the study - they were found to be among some of britain 's least friendly residents city - dwellers also did well on another trait , openness
this is a measure of curiosity , imagination and intellect , and was particularly high in london , oxford , cambridge university , brighton , bristol , manchester and glasgow
residents of some parts of welsh were also deemed creative and curious
inhabitants of the east midlands and the east of england were the least open â leading to them being labelled ' conventional , down to earth and traditional '
however , people in the midlands were among the most conscientious , suggesting that like residents of the scottish highlands , they are dependable , reliable types
londoners and the welsh fared badly once more , with the survey finding them to be among the most slapdash and unreliable
the welsh 's answers also led to them being branded the least emotionally stable and the most anxious , depressed and temperamental
the scottish emerged at the other end of the scale , as the least neurotic and the most calm and contented
people from devon were found to be highly agreeable , the study showed
pictured is the charming seaside town of woolacombe , devon researcher rentfrow said some of the results can be explained by people moving to areas that better suit their personality
the local economy and even the weather may have an impact â with lots of rainy days putting a dampener on happiness
but with personality traits linked to various illnesses , as well as rates of crime and even the way people vote , the results are more than just a bit of fun
dr rentfrow said : ' geographical differences are associated with a range of economic , health and social outcomes â and hence how important resources are allocated
