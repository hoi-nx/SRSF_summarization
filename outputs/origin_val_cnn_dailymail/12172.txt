think it 's taking you longer to get to work ? has your job moved farther from your home ? you 're probably right on both counts
a new study from the brookings says the number of jobs within a typical commute distance for residents in major metro areas of the u.s. fell by 7 % between 2000 and 2012
despite trends that indicate a greater desire for millennials to live in dense urban areas , suburbs are still doing well , according to some researchers
employers have tended to move toward the suburbs , away from city cores -- and away from many workers , the study says
moreover , even if you already live in the suburbs , it does n't mean you live close to the suburb where the jobs are
" suburban residents saw the number of jobs within a typical commute distance drop by 7 % , more than twice the decline experienced by the typical city resident ( 3 % ) , " kneebone and holmes wrote in the study 's summary
the issue disproportionately affects poor and minority residents , the authors added
" residents of high - poverty and majority - minority neighborhoods experienced particularly pronounced declines in job proximity , " they wrote , observing that 61 % of high - poverty tracts and 55 % of majority - minority neighborhoods experienced declines in job proximity between 2000 and 2012
high - poverty neighborhoods were defined as tracts with poverty rates above 20 %
the brookings study comes as metro areas are coping with increased stresses on infrastructure
tuesday 's new york times was filled with letters complaining about a subway fare increase and crowds at all hours in the new york system
in atlanta , one suburban county recently added mass transit for the first time since 2010 -- even as the georgia legislature has been gutting portions of a transportation bill
and a detroit man garnered nationwide headlines in february because of his 21 - mile commute -- a hefty chunk of which he walked due to a lack of transit options
the brookings study observes that solving commuting issues " will require collaborative solutions " across jurisdictions
" the dynamics that have shaped these job proximity patterns across and within metro areas did not emerge by themselves , " kneebone and holmes wrote ( pdf )
" local , regional , and state leaders put them in play ( whether purposefully or by default ) through policy decisions
to foster growth that is truly regional in its reach and that does not exacerbate inequality or leave low - income and minority residents behind , communities will need to coordinate and collaborate as they plan and implement policy decisions that affect metropolitan development patterns
