' he has four children which requires a great deal of dedication
' karl and his brother were simply standing in the reception when karl saw his brother being attacked and he 's then reacted to it
' the single punch he threw with the glass in hand was not intentional and he did not intend to use it as a weapon
' he was trying to stop this man from attacking his brother
he regrets his actions and insists there was no bad blood previous and there is none now
' kate barnes , also for the defence , said : ' he has no previous convictions and left school with a number of qualifications
he strongly denies spiking anyone 's drink that night
' it was supposed to be a happy day and on that occasion he had drunk in excess , something he does not normally do
' he is not unintelligent and has a great deal of insight into what happened that evening
he expresses full remorse for his actions
' his part in this was to deliver one or two blows which seemingly are n't responsible for any of the victim 's injuries
' karl storey was given a suspended sentence at newcastle crown court ( pictured ) and his brother dale storey was also given a similar sentence karl storey pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding and dale storey pleaded guilty to common assault
ms recorder turner , sentenced karl to a 12 month suspended sentence , with an 160 unpaid work requirement and a compensation charge of Â£ 500
the judge sentenced dale storey to a 12 month community order with an 100 hours unpaid work requirement and a compensation charge of Â£ 100
the judge said : ' the 31st of october should have been a very happy day because it was your wedding day and your wife had given birth to a baby boy
' you had both enjoyed the wedding and were celebrating that and the new arrival of the baby boy to the family
you both had far too much to drink and this is something you must watch
' i am not going to send either of you prison today but i still want you to realise this is a very serious matter
' i have watched the cctv and it seems something was troubling the complainant
what followed after that was an attack that lasted quite some time
' you must understand that you ca n't keep acting like this and you 're lucky that the victim did not have more injuries
' ordinarily , it seems you are both decent young men and i believe both of you do not pose a real threat to the public
' ' let 's hope this was just a minor blip in both your lives
