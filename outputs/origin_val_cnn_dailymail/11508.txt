liverpool goalkeeper mignolet is too modest to claim the club âs recent revival is partly due to his own impressive personal comeback after he had been dropped earlier in the season by manager rodgers
nevertheless , the facts show that the resurgent reds go into saturday 's potential top - four decider against manchester united at anfield having been beaten only once in 19 domestic games â a capital one cup semi-final second leg against chelsea â since mignolet returned to the side on boxing day
prior to that , they had lost four out of seven in the premier league and had slipped to 10th place
mignolet has been in impressive form for liverpool during their resurgence in the premier league the liverpool goalkeeper was dropped from the side earlier in the season after a number of mistakes the belgian first found out he had been axed the day before liverpool faced manchester united in the reverse fixture at old trafford in december when manchester united won 3 - 0
â the gaffer took me into his office to tell me i would nât play against manchester united
it was disappointing and i could have let my head drop , but i decided to be positive to make sure my period on the sidelines was as short as possible , â said mignolet
â i trained the next day to make sure i âd be ready in a better way when the opportunity arose
â his wish came true
when in - favour brad jones injured his thigh four matches later at burnley , mignolet came on , kept a clean sheet and has not looked back since
a 1 - 0 win at swansea on monday was his sixth consecutive clean sheet away from home â the first time that has happened since the days of bill shankly
mignolet makes a fine save from a gylfi sigurdsson strike during the win against swansea on monday the belgian keeper kept his sixth consecutive premier league away clean sheet against the swans victory against manchester united would lift liverpool into the top four and they would then be favourites to join chelsea , manchester city and arsenal in next season âs champions league
the loss at old trafford when rodgers first introduced a three - man defence and played sterling up front now appears to be a watershed in the club âs campaign
â i do nât think it âs anything to do with me personally , â said mignolet
â the gaffer changed the system [ to 3 - 4 - 3 ] and since then things have been very organised
we do nât give many chances away and everybody is willing to work for each other
â it âs all about working as a unit
we have dealt well with set - pieces and at the other end , scored goals
â having been heavily criticised for key mistakes earlier in the season and dubbed â dracula â by former liverpool goalkeeper bruce grobbelaar for being indecisive with crosses , mignolet is not taking recent good publicity for granted , even though he was liverpool âs man - of - the - match at swansea following crucial saves from gylfi sigurdsson and bafetimbi gomis
mignolet , who was dropped earlier in the season , trains alonside joe allen and markovic liverpool have only lost once in 19 domestic matches since mignolet returned to the side â as a goalkeeper you âre only remembered for your last game
i know i played half - decent against swansea but if things turn around against manchester united on sunday , no one will mention that , â he said
â i know how it goes and how football is
you have to accept it , but that is also something positive because there âs always something new around the corner
â the next game is always the biggest one
that âs what we say
â after last season âs thrilling challenge for the league title , rodgers reacted bravely when the first half to this campaign did not go according to plan
liverpool impressed at old trafford in december but fell to a 3 - 0 loss after a david de gea masterclass emre can has emerged as a key figure in liverpool 's three - man defence in the past few months summer signings mario balotelli , markovic , lovren , lallana and rickie lambert were sidelined , while club captain steven gerrard was allowed to negotiate a deal to join la galaxy this summer
instead , sterling was used as a centre - forward until daniel sturridge âs recent return from injury as rodgers returned to last season âs quick - passing style
at the back , midfielder emre can was asked to be part of a back - three with martin skrtel and the restored lovren
as results improved , markovic and lallana were brought back in and the team remain unbeaten in the premier league in 2015 , having taken 33 points from a possible 39
liverpool have narrowed the gap on manchester united from 10 points to two
they are rediscovering the art of scoring goals while keeping it tight at the back
the reds have n't tasted defeat in the premier league since the outing at old trafford â swansea was an example where we had to grind it out
it was 0 - 0 at half time and then we came out and put pressure on them high up the field
and we scored out of that [ through jordan henderson ] , â added mignolet
â i think that âs what we are about
the 3 - 0 defeat away to manchester united was a while ago and there âs no point in reflecting too much on what has been
professional footballers have to adapt to any system
it is more to do with the organisation and how everybody does their job rather than the system itself
â at the moment , the players are all working really hard
if the gaffer points something out , everybody is ready to listen and make sure it gets done
â there is no point looking over your shoulder [ at the past ] because what we are thinking about is preparing ourselves the best we can for the manchester united game
