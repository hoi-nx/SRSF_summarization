it started as an easy way to pay to park a car when you ran out of coins , or a strategy to avoid long queues as bus drivers desperately searched for change
. but now the system of paying to park using your mobile phone , follow the trend of using passes instead of cash on buses , could be the latest sign that britain is moving towards a cashless system
brighton and hove council has announced it will scrap half of its coin operated parking meters in favour of people using their phones to pay for and top up their car parking
this is already used on buses across the country where cash is no longer accepted , and particularly in london , as well as in a number of work canteens that operate card - only systems of payment
the popularity of non-cash payments has also been seen on the streets with an unemployed man travelling to mayfair armed with a card machine so people can give him money using their cards
britain is on track to make more non-cash payments - defined as paying by card , cheque , direct debit , standing order and mobile phone - than cash for the first time in 2015 , according to predictions by the payments council
this year non-cash transactions are expected to reach 19.9billion , outstripping the predicted 19billion cash exchanges
this is forecast to happen at some point in 2015because while cash payments are remaining fairly constant , the number of non-cash payments has been steadily increasing
the growth in online shopping and the rise of new , innovative ways to pay have led to consumers turning to a growing range of payment options in recent years
some have predicted the end of coin - operated marking meters ( right ) could spell the end of cash about three - quarters of britain now shop online , compared with just over half in 2008 , according to ons ( ons ) figures released last year
in brighton councillors have decided to remove half of its coin - operated parking meters because of the popularity of doing this through mobile phones and the ease of its use
the move by brighton follows similar methods such as only accepting payments by card and oyster card on buses in london ( left ) as well as the launch of the barclays pingit app ( right ) ian davey , a transport councillor in brighton , said : ' it 's actually a lot easier than messing about getting the right change
you can also top up your parking time remotely if you need to stay longer , which is a lot easier than walking back to the car
' and preston-booth travels 200 miles every day to mayfair in london to sit outside an london restaurant and beg , using his wireless card machine
the 37 - year - old travels by bus , train or rental car from preston in lancashire to mayfair and spends thursdays to sundays taking cash from passers - by and card payments from ' regulars '
preston-booth , 37 , commutes from preston to london to beg in mayfair armed with his own chip and machine , and is pictured here taking money from simon cowell and offering him a sweet in return contactless payments have also had a significant boost in the last year , with Â£ 2.32 billion spent using the method in 2014
this was more than three times the total value of contactless spending the previous year
contactless payments can be used on transactions worth up to Â£ 20 , and the limit is due to be increased to Â£ 30
and in another move towards getting rid of cash , barclaycard has launched a ' ping - it ' app where people can make payments in a similar way to sending a text message
the bank also revealed it is developing pairs of contactless ' tap and pay ' gloves , which people can use by swiping the back of their hand on the reader at the till , in a similar way to making contactless card payments
preston-booth , 37 , is believed to be on esa ( esa ) for his depression , which could earn him up to Â£ 108 a week
the government allows esa to be paid to people of working age who are too ill to work because of a health condition or disability
you must be under state pension age , not getting statutory sick pay or statutory maternity pay and not receiving any jobseeker 's allowance
in order to qualify you will have be assessed and after that can earn another Â£ 104 a week on top of your benefits for certain types of work
but mr preston-booth 's begging - which is illegal in britain and punishable by a Â£ 1,000 fine - could be considered benefit fraud
the department for work and pensions told mailonline it never comments on individual cases
however a spokesman said : ' benefit fraud is a crime and our fraud investigaters will look into all suspected cases
' if you suspect someone of claiming benefits fraudulently you can report it to the benefit fraud hotline on national benefit fraud hotline 0800 854 440 '
richard koch , head of policy at the uk cards association , said : ' instead of having pockets full of coins or carrying wads of notes , people are increasingly choosing their cards instead
' three in every four pounds spent in britain shops is now paid with cards and we 're all using them for smaller purchases too
' it 's the rise in convenient contactless payments for lower sums and smaller transactions online which in particular are changing the way we choose to pay
' and the amount we spend with cash is dwindling too , with the british retail consortium estimating we now spend an average of Â£ 9.47 in coins and notes
however the payments council said the popularity of cashless payments do not spell the end of britain 's monetary system in its entirety
while card and other non cash payments will continue to become popular , the council predicts that by 2023 we will still be making 12.9 transactions using coins and notes
this will be significantly lower than the 27.5 billion transactions without cash that are expected
mark bowerman , a spokesman for the payments council , said cash is still a vital payment method for many consumers , with students , people who need to tightly control their budgets , older people and people with a disability being particularly high users of cash
he said : ' we are not forecasting that cash will disappear
' cash is widely used for day - to - day purchases by virtually everyone and for some people ( around 3.5 million ) cash is the only method that is used
