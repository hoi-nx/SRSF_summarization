they say nice guys finish last
now , scientists have confirmed there is truth in the old adage â at least when it comes to salaries
a study claims friendly staff receive lower wages than their less agreeable colleagues
despite working just as hard , they are often reluctant to push for pay rises , too focused on team work and overly concerned about being liked
researchers at the university of sheffield made the discovery while looking at the impact of personality traits on workers ' productivity and pay
a university of sheffield study claims friendly staff receive lower wages than their less agreeable colleagues their study found : ' more agreeable workers tend to earn less in the actual labour market , but their productivity is similar when measured in the laboratory setting
' they defined agreeableness as being compliant , modest , trustworthy and sympathetic
the study found women were most likely to show agreeable personality traits , perhaps one reason for the gender pay gap
being agreeable made workers more successful in team work , but had three negative effects on their performance
friendly staff are often reluctant to push for pay rises , too focused on team work and overly concerned about being liked , according to the study ' first , helping others may reduce individual productivity , ' the study found
' secondly , agreeable people may be less effective when bargaining their wage
finally , agreeable individuals may enter less stable , lower paid occupations
' the study was presented at the royal economic society 's 2015 annual conference in manchester yesterday by ana nuevo-chiquero , of university of sheffield , who conducted the research alongside australian and spanish academics
they analysed the personalities and productivity levels of students at the university of new south wales in laboratory conditions , and analysed a host of academic reports on personality and wages
it found that , while conscientious and emotionally stable workers earn more money , being too open could harm your career
while openness with colleagues indicated an artistic , curious and imaginative worker , it could make them less likely to obey the rules , which could cause problems at a formal workplace
neuroticism , which researchers linked to mood swings and unpredictability , also impacted performance as these workers often lacked self - confidence and were insecure .
