two months before man set foot on the moon for the first time , gordon strachan stood on the hampden park terraces to witness a halley 's comet moment
just 12 at the time , he could hardly have known 46 years would pass before a scotsman scored another international hat - trick
' i was here when stein scored four , ' said the scottish boss after fletcher 's star turn against gibraltar
' it 's a long time ago â and a few stone ago â but i was there

the old ash wooden steps are long gone , but the technical area provided an excellent vantage point to watch the landmarks tumble down as heavily as the rain over glasgow
fletcher climbed back into his lamborghini as the first scotland player to drive home a hat - trick since stein in an 8 - 0 win over cyprus in may 1969
gordon strachan 's team became the first in dark blue to rack up half a dozen goals since a 6 - 0 thrashing of the faroes in 2006
and , to prove history comes in all shapes and sizes , marshall became the first keeper to lose a goal to the minnows of gibraltar in a competitive international
' mcgregor and gordon strachan now love me , ' said gordon strachan , only half joking
' they think i 'm the best manager in the world for not picking them â they 're not in the history books
' rightly , scotland 's boss was quick to hand credit to the visitors
fletcher took the headlines with his first goals for his country since april 2009 , maloney scoring two penalties and steven naismith the other
yet this was a patchy , unconvincing performance at times
the scottish won the three points and are still on course in group d. the gibraltar team of semi-pro part - timers put together by scot davie wilson made the first half an astonishing affair at times
their tally of goals against is now 27 in five qualifiers
but for 10 minutes the one they scored threatened to break the worldwide web
' i 'm so proud of all the players , ' said gibraltar 's interim coach
' they 've given us everything
and now we 're even getting free fish and chips to celebrate â the blue lagoon chippie in glasgow sent a card to the hotel this morning saying they were laying them on for us â¦ ' presumably the fish was as battered as their defenders at the end of a long 90 minutes
scotland 's breakthrough came from the penalty spot in 18 minutes via a dubious award
matt ritchie , earning his second cap , played a pass inviting maloney to give chase
the attacker got to the byeline first , knocking the ball past keeper robba and out of play
had the keeper kept his hands to himself gibraltar would have survived
instead he sent the striker tumbling rashly
it took a word from the assistant behind the goal to make the finnish ref 's mind up , maloney tucking home
that , we assumed , was that
with a goal at their back scotland would make short work of the spirited , plucky underdogs
so there was widespread disbelief when gibraltar refused to be patronised or quelled
it was glorious stuff , in truth
the very essence of football
the visitors had already caused panic in the eighth minute when joseph chipolina threw in a cross from the left flank which keeper marshall flapped at horribly , the ball careering off his own crossbar
maloney ( left ) won the first penalty and picked himself up to score and put scotland in the lead lee casciaro ( second right ) hauled gibraltar level 72 seconds later with their first ever international goal casciaro 's goal sparked jubilant celebrations from gibraltar 's players as hampden park was stunned into solence gibraltar 's team celebrate as they draw level in the euro 2016 qualifier against scotland gibraltar had around 500 supporters inside hampden park to witness their teams first ever competitive international goal fletcher ( left ) scores scotland 's second and his first of the game to return his team into the lead maloney scored scotland 's third and his second of the game which also came from the penalty spot trying â and failing â to adapt to the novelty of a three - man defence featuring one central defender and two full - backs in a 3 - 2 - 4 - 1 formation , scotland were caught cold in the aftermath of the opener
' we took it for granted gibraltar were not going to score , ' admitted gordon strachan
it was a big mistake
andrew robertson was out of position when lee casciaro wrote himself into the history books , racing onto a pass by aaron payas to slot through the legs of marshall for 1 - 1
pre-match expectations of a rout suddenly felt rather foolish
scotland spent 10 minutes at home tied with a british overseas territory of just 30,000 people
they reclaimed the lead in 29 minutes , fletcher scoring his first since april 2009
a right - footed cross from the left flank by ikechi anya was headed unconvincingly up into the air by defender david artell
fletcher reacted first , nodding the ball inside the right - hand post as the keeper scrambled in slow motion across his line
he savoured the moment , sliding on his knees in relief as much as anything
the monkey , at last , was off his back collectively , there would be no repeat of the calamity which followed the first goal
in the aftermath of the third goal , in 34 minutes , the game followed its pre-ordained script
it came from a second penalty of the game , rightly awarded for a bizarre flying challenge from gibraltar scorer casciaro on steven naismith
maloney opted for the tried and tested , going for the same corner , but a little higher
it flew into the net for 3 - 1
gibraltar were now a busted flush
fletcher hit the outside of the post with a deft effort , but the fourth goal came seven minutes before the interval
the visitors played themselves into trouble in their own area , anya managing to stay onside before picking out steven naismith with a cut - back
he netted smartly for 4 - 1
the scoreline , as half - time beckoned , had a more acceptable hue
oddly , however , scotland refused to apply a foot to the throats of their fading visitors
fletcher , in truth , might have had five here
he blew a wonderful chance from an alan hutton cross in 62 minutes but improved markedly when rhodes appeared to provide some back - up in attack
the only disappointment was that rhodes did n't claim a goal or two as well
he had his chances , controlling a long diagonal ball from fellow sub barry bannan in 76 minutes before thrashing the ball into the side - netting
he atoned within a minute when his cross from the right flank picked out fletcher for his second goal â a downward header
the sunderland striker should have had his hat - trick four minutes from time when he thumped a neat rhodes lay - off towards goal but robba saved
yet the gibraltar keeper was merely delaying the inevitable
with one minute of normal time to play , fletcher produced the kind of calm , composed finish which comes of renewed confidence , passing the ball into the bottom corner from 16 yards for a small , long - awaited slice of scottish footballing history
