labour mp austin mitchell has been told off by the party âs high command for poking fun at miliband âs two kitchens
mr austin mitchell , 80 , who is standing down as an mp in may , last week mischievously tweeted a picture of his own kitchen â complete with an unpacked bag of shopping and half - full glass of wine on the table â under the heading â this is what a real labour kitchen looks like â
yesterday he was sent a rebuke by turner , the shadow solicitor general , for the â attack â on the party leader , warning him â if you ca nât say anything supportive , keep your opinion to yourself â
austin mitchell tweeted this photograph with the caption : ' this is what a real labour kitchen looks like ' it is just the latest twist in the drama about mr miliband âs domestic set - up after he and wife justine were filmed for a bbc interview having tea in a very small , empty kitchen with no seating area
in response to criticism , a family friend tweeted that the kitchen in the milibands â Â£ 2million north london townhouse was â lovely â and that this was a â functional kitchenette â for making â tea and snacks â
while most labour mps have resisted comment on the issue , mr austin mitchell fuelled the fire this weekend by tweeting : â labour âs new pledge card promises two kitchens for all by 2030 , two toilets by 2035
â last week , in a jibe at the conservatives â so - called bedroom tax , the veteran mp for grimsby , had said : â tories to introduce spare kitchen tax â
mr turner wrote him a letter , which mr austin mitchell duly published on his website yesterday , which read : â you âre a joke austin
it âs very sad to see it but it âs becoming increasingly apparent
you think it clever to attack us
' it âs not clever and you âve had plenty out of the party
â i am reluctant to pull you up publicly because you love the attention so very much
if you ca nât say anything supportive just keep your opinion to yourself
' we need to retain grimsby
you âve done little to help with that
and i doubt you âve ever had a kitchen in grimsby
â it is just the latest twist in the drama about mr miliband âs domestic set - up after he and wife justine were filmed for a bbc interview having tea in a very small , empty kitchen with no seating area mr turner , the mp for hull east , added that mr miliband â has one in donny [ his constituency in doncaster ] and mine âs massive in east hull
â it is a reference to labour mps â thinking that mr austin mitchell has done little to help them campaign to keep the seat
it is the only labour seat in the country which pollsters believe ukip has a chance of winning
the veteran mp , who is an outspoken eurosceptic , has also infuriated the leadership by claiming in a recent article that his party was promoting too many young women
he said labour , which has used all - women shortlists to boost their numbers of female mps , was â undergoing the biggest process of feminisation and rejuvenation embarked on since fabulous pink camay soap promised to make us look a little lovelier every day
â mr austin mitchell claimed that as a result , labour was becoming more â family - friendly , gentler â but â less prepared for all - night shenanigans of the parliamentary kind â
he also claimed that â ageism is rampant â in the party , and that while he was standing down because â i âd rather not die in public â other labour mps over 60 , were being â carried out kicking and screaming â .
