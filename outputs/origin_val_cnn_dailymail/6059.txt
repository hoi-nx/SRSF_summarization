history man fletcher has spoken of his pride as he ended a six - year international scoring drought to become the first scotland player to net a hat - trick since 1969
the sunderland striker hit his treble in the 6 - 1 triumph over gibraltar , with two shaun maloney penalties and a steven naismith strike also helping hampden park recover from the shock of lee casciaro âs first - half equaliser for the group d minnows
not since colin stein bagged four against cyprus in 1969 had someone scored more than two for the national side

â i got asked after the northern ireland game if i could get a hat - trick and i laughed it off , â said fletcher
â i said i would be happy with one goal as i have nât scored for a while
so to get the hat - trick was really pleasing

â i thought kenny would have managed it so i am very happy and proud to be part of history
â it means a lot
it âs really good and it will be one of the best achievements of my career
â i âve got the match ball and i âll probably put it in a little glass cabinet
i have another one from my hibs days when i scored a hat - trick against gretna , so i will put it next to that
that was my last hat - trick so it will go beside that one
â fletcher had last scored for scotland against iceland in 2009 , and had drawn a blank since his return from a 19 - month international exile in 2011
the 28 - year - old gave thanks to gordon strachan for sticking by him and hopes this boost will help him over the remainder of the euro 2016 campaign , which continues with a crunch trip to dublin in june

i get told every day , â he said
â it âs good to get off the mark again , especially after being out for a long time
was it getting to me ? not really
i was still confident going in to games
â to be honest i have nât had many chances in games but i had a lot against gibraltar
i could have scored more than three but i was just happy to get the goals
â getting the hat - trick will definitely help my confidence going into the summer
hopefully i have done enough to stay in the gaffer âs plans and i âm looking forward to it
â the manager likes my link - up play
i know people have been saying i have nât scored but i âve been doing other parts
â he âs praised me for that and if i can keep doing that , and add goals , then i âll be happy
â he âs been a massive support to me
he âs been great with me since i came back into the scotland squad and i owe a lot to him
