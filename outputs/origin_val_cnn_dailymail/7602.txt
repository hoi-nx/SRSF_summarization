manchester city and chelsea are set to challenge manchester united for the services of gareth bale this summer
the pressure on gareth bale at real madrid has intensified in recent weeks and a move back to the premier league is on the cards
it has been assumed that if gareth bale does leave real madrid then a move to manchester united is a ' shoo - in '
but both chelsea and manchester city are in need of attacking stimulus , especially in the context of champions league football
gareth bale is attracting criticism in the spanish capital and chelsea and manchester city are interested the reality is that it will be how each club manage to finance a Â£ 100million deal plus near Â£ 300,000 - a - week wages and stay within ffp rules
and in the case of manchester united they have priorities in other areas of the pitch
chelsea , on the basis of transfer sales and turnover , will have the ability to push the boat out to get gareth bale
the blues are also looking to sign real madrid centre - half raphael varane
chelsea could demand as much as Â£ 20million this summer to let petr cech leave the club
in what may well be a merry - go - round of elite goalkeepers this summer , petr cech is a target for arsenal , tottenham , liverpool , manchester united , real madrid and psg
although petr cech is now chelsea âs no 2 , he is still just 32
former arsenal keeper jens lehmann has urged the gunners to sign petr cech , arguing that he could well be entering the best period of his career
petr cech is wanted by a raft of top clubs and arsenal have been urged to sign him by jens lehmann liverpool are prepared to play poker with sterling and his advisors over a new contract
and the merseyside club remain convinced they will win
the reds do nât believe there is genuine , firm interest from clubs such as bayern munich , real madrid , chelsea or manchester united as has been reported , as talks over a new Â£ 100,000 a week deal have repeatedly stalled
certainly liverpool believe that if they slap a Â£ 50million - plus price tag on the england forward then none of those clubs would make a move this summer
sterling is reportedly wanted by europe 's elite , but liverpool are n't buying that talks on a bumper Â£ 1000,000 - a - week deal have stalled between sterling and liverpool indeed the club believe sterling constantly being linked with a range of ' platinum ' clubs is part of a strategy from the player âs camp to force their hand and offer wages of up to Â£ 140,000 a week - the sort of level steven gerrard and suarez were on
but the view of the liverpool hierarchy is that in stages of progression sterling does not yet command such a figure in the context of their wage structure nor in how they deal with ffp regulations
the club want sterling to understand that the current offer is generous , especially given that despite his rapid emergence he has yet to prove himself as a consistent force , and that a new Â£ 100,000 - a - week five - year deal would have re-negotiation stages built in
the obvious concern of the club is that if they bow to the demands of sterling âs advisors now , they could have a talented 20 - year - old player on their hands who suddenly lacks sufficient motivation and incentive to fulfil his potential
brendan rodgers bluntly told sterling not to wave goodbye to liverpool it was telling that manager brendan rodgers said pointedly on saturday : â i think it is quite obvious when you look at it is that anyone with his [ sterling âs ] best interests at heart knows his best option is to sign a new deal for liverpool
â the club also does nât want to unsettle the rest of the squad by bowing to sterling 's demands
liverpool are also relaxed about the situation not least because sterling âs current contract does not expire until the summer of 2017
sam allardyce 's days are numbered as west ham manager
the club are set to sever his contract on may 25 , the day after the last game of the season against newcastle
even if the west ham have a good end to the season there is no way back for sam allardyce whose current contract expires in july
the 3 - 0 defeat at arsenal took west ham 's premier league run to just one win in 12
sam allardyce looks aggrieved during west ham 's latest capitulation at the emirates the west ham board still harbour hopes of luring carlos tevez to the club next season from juventus in their last season at the upton park before moving to the olympic stadium
the club âs hierarchy see former cult hero carlos tevez as a platinum signing that can help attract a new fan base
carlos tevez is wanted by the west ham as a marquee signing in their final year at upton park everton could move for chelsea âs misfit striker loic remy this summer if they decide to cash in on wantaway romelu lukaku
radamel falcao , as revealed by the football grapevine , will not stay at manchester united beyond this season âs loan deal from monaco , where indeed the colombian could well be playing his football again next season
radamel falcao could return to monaco after a frustrating first year in the premier league i am hearing tottenham âs danny rose is set to get an england call - up for the euro 2016 qualifier against lithuania later this month to prevent him opting to declare for jamaica
btw suarez last week claimed it was english media which forced him to quit liverpool last summer and join barcelona
the main reason suarez left liverpool is because he had been hankering for a dream move to spain for over a year
and he also wanted to nearly double his salary
suarez looks glum as liverpool 's title hopes evaporate on a crazy night at selhurst park last year suarez grins from ear to ear as the uruguayan is turning it on for la liga leaders barcelona yes the press reported various indiscretions by the uruguayan , including a race row , a propensity to dive and a habit of assaulting opponents from time to time
that âs part of the job
what did suarez expect ? high fives ? or flowers ? yet for all that , the english press still honoured suarez last season when the fwa ( fwa ) voted him as their player of the year
that âs hardly hounding a player out , is it ? i-say jamie carragher labelled the behaviour of chelsea players in champions league defeat by psg as a â disgrace â
fellow sky sports pundit souness described the manner in which the chelsea players pressurised referee bjorn kuipers to send off zlatan ibrahimovic as pathetic
zlatan ibrahimovic called the chelsea players â babies â
i ca nât disagree with any of those verdicts
i just found it embarrassing
yet in the commentary box , neville almost paid the chelsea players a compliment by calling them â shrewd â
really ? chelsea players surround bjorn kuipers as the dutch official sends off zlatan ibrahimovic matches between manchester united and tottenham have often been entertaining and full of goals down the years , although this season âs encounter at white hart lane ended 0 - 0
coral offer 12 - 1 on the same outcome
for the more adventurous , they offer 50 - 1 for 3 - 3
harry kane is 6 - 1 to be first scorer
shrewd is being clever , not cheating then is it ? does an employee of the football association-neville has a role as england boss roy hodgson âs assistant - advocate cheating ? let âs not forget one of the main roles of the fa is to act as custodians of the game , uphold discipline and even offer a moral lead
once again there would seem a conflict of interest with neville being an opinionated media pundit and a senior member of the england coaching staff
after all , do we want to see england players acting in the same pathetic manner , as souness put it , as the chelsea players did last week ? i think not .
