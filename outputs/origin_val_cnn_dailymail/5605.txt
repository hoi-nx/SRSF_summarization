sarah mills with cat , spot , who got stuck up a tree for six days and fire crews refused to rescue her firemen refused to risk their safety by rescuing a cat that had been stuck in a tree for six days â so two young men stepped in to save the day
the pair climbed about 50ft to bring down spot from a leylandii in stroud , gloucestershire , after firefighters said the branches were too thin to support their weight
several attempts were made to lure her down and the fire service visited the scene twice , after the rspca was called
gloucestershire âs deputy chief fire officer , andy hermiston , said : ' this is the second time we were called out because a cat was stuck 50ft up a tree
the first time , a month ago , the cat managed to get down itself
' on both occasions , we quickly discovered that the branches at the top of the tree where the cat was stuck were too thin to support the weight of a firefighter
' while rescuing animals is an important part of our work , it can not be at the risk of our firefighter 's safety
' although the service can not condone members of the public putting themselves at risk we 're pleased the cat has been safely returned to its owner and that the young people involved were not injured whilst carrying out the rescue
' however , we must also be mindful of the fact that the rescuers may have put themselves at serious risk and , as we have seen in the past , would - be rescuers can become victims , sometimes with tragic consequences
' spot 's owner sarah mills was relieved and eager to thank the rescuers , who climbed the adjacent trees with torches at around 8pm , and plucked the tortoiseshell to safety
' i would like to thank them , i do n't know who they are , ' she said , adding that she will be keeping spot indoors and will take her to a vet for a check - up
' she is a bit thinner but i think she will be ok
' when firefighters arrived at the scene they realised branches of the leylandii tree ( stock image ) were too thin to support their weight
