andrew jose , who has styled the tresses of alanis morissette , jamie campbell bower and louise redknapp , says : ' this type of bleach blonde look goes beyond fashion and if done well can look high - end and powerful
' be warned though , this look is definitely not for the faint - hearted
not only does maintaining the regrowth take a lot of commitment but the chemical process of bleach on the hair can be incredibly damaging

kim has been showing off her bright blonde hair for the last couple of weeks after debuting her new look at paris fashion week andrew jose says : ' of all the colouring methods , bleach is the most damaging , and should always be done professionally and slowly
' bleaching raises the cuticle on the hair , removing colour pigment permanently from the hair shaft , a process which is called oxidation
' bleaching can permanently raise the cuticle , leaving hair dry , brittle and porous
overlapping bleach in the same place leaves hair feeling weak and elastic , which can then lead to hair breakage
' he added : ' overuse and repeated application of bleach to the scalp can strip the hair of moisture and damage the follicle
' this may cause the hair to either fall out from the root or to break at the weakest point along the hair shaft
' any would - be blondes should think about trying a toner before giving the bleach a go , says andrew jose
