manchester united have been linked with summer moves for both bale and ronaldo
but who would you buy if you could only pick one ? we asked our experts ... bale and ronaldo have both been linked with a move to manchester united martin keown - ronaldo bale is a better long - term investment but if you âre talking about a transfer this summer that would make an immediate impact , then it has to be ronaldo
manchester united have gone from dominating at the top to fighting for fourth
signing ronaldo would bring manchester united instant success and put them back on the map
he understands the club and would appreciate the enormity of the task , but he more than anyone else would breathe new life into the fans
what a statement that would be
ronaldo enjoyed six successful years under sir alex ferguson at old trafford neil ashton - ronaldo this feels like a trick question
ronaldo and lionel messi are two of the greatest players we have ever had the privilege to watch
ronaldo has done it all before at manchester united - and we would love to see him do it all over again
ronaldo trains ahead of el clasico against barcelona in la liga on sunday night rob draper - ronaldo there âs no real debate
no disrespect to bale , but the all - round game of ronaldo , from his range of skill , shooting , free - kicks , finishing , heading is just better
that does nât make bale a bad player - just not as good
in financial terms you could make a case for bale being five years younger but i âm pretty sure you could rely on four good years out of ronaldo
ronaldo celebrates after scoring in the champions league tie against schalke earlier this month joe bernstein - bale it is purely an age thing
ronaldo is unlikely to be as good in the next three years as he has been in the last three years and as his body language showed last weekend , you would nât want him around if he feared he was in decline
bale âs game is tailor - made for the premier league and if his pace was added to the current manchester united technicians they would be champions bale trains at the valdebebas training ground before heading to barcelona for the crunch clash riath al samarrai - bale no doubting ronaldo is the better player but bale has age on his side and is not so unbelievably selfish as a person that he would pout if a team - mate scores
pete jenson - bale bale , no question
the former spurs man is only going to get better
bale would make a sensational return to the premier league if he joins manchester united
