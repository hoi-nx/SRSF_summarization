when oakland raiders nfl running back drew retired recently at just 29 years old , he said his life had been focused on football for 24 years and he needed a change
it 's no wonder he wanted out
he has been playing football since he was 5 years old
sound too young to strap on a helmet ? not really
jones - drew is no different from thousands of other boys whose parents introduce them to the gridiron just a few years out of diapers
football is america 's favorite sport
we pride ourselves on our toughness , on our ability to get back up when we 're knocked down
what better sport is there to teach those lessons ? but today , youth football is not looking like the best option
in 2012 , an estimated 225,287 children -- down 9.5 % since 2010 -- between the ages of 5 and 14 played pop warner football , in which the weight class for the 5 - year - olds ranges from 35 to 79 pounds
with such lightweight boys competing with children more than twice their size , it 's no wonder parents feel less inclined to put their kids in this sport
but not too long ago , parents thought nothing of sending their children out on the football field to run around and burn up a little energy
many parents still insist youth football is safe
what could be healthier for a boy ? certainly , it beats sitting in front of a computer all day
that 's exactly what debra pyka thought when she signed up her son , chernach , for pop warner football in wisconsin , then later in michigan , when he was 11 years old , in 1997
if only she knew then that her son would be dead at 25
chernach hung himself in his mother 's shed on june 7 , 2012
his brain was later found to have severe cte , a degenerative brain disease that has been linked to concussions in football
chernach had played sports , including wrestling , pole vaulting and football most of his young life
but he spent almost four years playing pop warner football from ages 11 to 14
" my son was the class comedian , loved school , always fun to be around , " debra pyka told me
" but we noticed after high school chernach changed
he got depressed , angry , paranoid and withdrew from sports and his friends
we just did n't know why
after learning about cte , i knew he had it even before we got the results
the symptoms were all there
" debra pyka is convinced those early days playing pop warner football triggered her son 's cte
last month , debra pyka and her son 's estate filed a lawsuit against pop warner football for $ 5 million , claiming the nonprofit failed to protect its youngest players and warn them and their parents about the permanent dangers of head trauma
the lawsuit further alleges that debra pyka 's son and other children were intentionally put in danger because pop warner used amateur coaches with short tenures , who were never properly trained in the game of football , injury prevention , concussion or head injury identification
so now , this mother is on a mission
she wants to stop children younger than 14 from playing tackle football in youth leagues
" i do n't want any kids to suffer the way my son suffered , the way my family suffered
young children should not be allowed to play tackle football until they reach high school , " said debra pyka
since filing her suit , debra pyka , a registered nurse , said she 's found some solace by connecting with other parents who want to make football safer for children , but she also has received plenty of hateful emails criticizing her for allowing her son to play in the first place
critics say that she knew what she was doing when she signed her son up to play football and some even suggest that debra pyka should be charged with murder for allowing chernach to sign up for football , debra pyka told me , clearly upset
" i did n't sign my son up to get a brain disease , " she said
" we wanted him to play sports , to be active
we knew nothing about concussions then
it was n't discussed much
it 's still not talked about enough today
should we all be arrested for letting our kids play football ? " clearly , the lawsuit faces obstacles , especially since chernach did play other sports and it may be hard to prove the cte was triggered by injuries suffered while playing for pop warner
but debra pyka and her attorney , johnson , at the brain injury law group , which is representing chernach 's estate , insist this case is not just about winning
they are going after the economics of youth football leagues
and if they win the lawsuit it may be less possible for those leagues to buy the insurance policies that allow very young children to play tackle football
" we have to prove that pop warner was a substantial factor in him getting it [ cte ] , and we knew from research that playing under 12 is when you 're most vulnerable , " johnson told media when he filed the suit
" the airing of these issues will benefit everybody , " he added
jon butler , executive director of pop warner , told me on thursday via email : " pop warner has been , and will continue to be , at the forefront of addressing player safety
... while there is incredible sadness in this story , we question the merits of singling out four years of youth football amid a career of sports that lasted through high school
" still , when the lawyer talk is done , debra pyka wo n't get her son back
and amazingly , she did not sound bitter
and she 's not out to end football
but " a 5 - year - old playing football , it 's ridiculous to have them out there banging their brains around
" some good has come out of all this , said pkya
more people are talking about cte
she said it 's important that parents listen closely to nflers like 24 - year - old borland , the san francisco 49ers linebacker who retired this week after just one season
borland said he quit because he was afraid of brain injuries
he understands how his decision may affect parents and he has a message : " parents ... if you weigh the risk and decide this is something you want to partake in
... it 's a free country
... but if i could relay a message to kids and their parents it would be twofold : number one : make an informed decision
and number two : do n't play through concussions
who knows how many hits is too many ? " considering the consequences , it just may be one of the toughest decisions a parent has to make .
