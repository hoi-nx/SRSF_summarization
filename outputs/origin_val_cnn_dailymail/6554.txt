peyton was saved when she was able to crawl out and get help from a passing bicyclist
in a video , obtained by wisn , the girls both say they told peyton they wanted to go bird watching , this after planning their attack on the school bus
' people who trust you become very gullible , ' morgan told police
' and it was sort of sad
' anissa is more emotional during her interview , wiping away tears at one point
' we told her we were going to get help , ' she told police about the moments after the two stabbed peyton
" ' but we were n't
we were going to run and let her pass away

i knew we 'd get in trouble
' when she described the actually stabbing , she said ; ' it just sort of happened
it did n't feel like anything
' anissa said at one point slender man would kill their families if they did not kill peyton morgan and anissa said they stabbed their friend to appease the slender man as for slender man , morgan described him as a man with ' tendrils that are very sharp
' ' i see him in my dreams , ' she told police , anissa said in her interview that she did not have the same visions as morgan , but knew she had to kill her friend for the slender man
' i decided to go along , tag along , to prove the skeptics wrong , ' she said
