what does it sound like to land on the surface of saturn âs titan or fly past the martian moon phobos ? thanks to the european space agency you can listen to these sounds - and more - recreated by processing data from various spacecraft
the amazing collection of clips include some that have been artificially amplified to be audible to humans , and others that are simply as they originally sounded
the recent launch of a soyuz rocket that took two europe satellites into orbit can also be heard in one amazing clip
it took off from french guiana at 9.46pm gmt on friday 27 march ( pictured ) , carrying two satellites that will expand europe âs galileo system the various noises from space are shared on european space agency 's esaops soundcloud page
one clip uses audio data collected by the huygens probe probe as it descended onto the surface of saturn 's titan on 14 january 2005
the spacecraft carried with it acoustic sensors on the huygens atmospheric structure instrument ( hasi ) , which recorded the surroundings as the probe descended
according to european space agency they â give a realistic reproduction of what a traveller on board huygens probe would have heard during one minute of the descent through titan 's atmosphere
â with its thick atmosphere and organic - rich chemistry , titan resembles a frozen version of earth several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere
because titan is smaller than earth , its gravity does nât hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly , so the atmosphere extends 370 miles ( 595 kilometres ) into space
as on earth , the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons , although the seasons on titan are about seven earth years long
titan 's â water â is liquid methane , ch4 , better known on earth as natural gas
regular earth - water , h2o , would be frozen solid on titan where the surface temperature is -180 â° c ( -292 Â° f )
with titan 's low gravity and dense atmosphere , methane raindrops could grow twice as large as earth 's raindrops
as well as this , they would fall more slowly , drifting down like snowflakes
but scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades
one clip uses audio data collected by the huygens probe ( illustrated ) as it descended onto the surface of titan on 14 january 2005
the spacecraft carried with it acoustic sensors on the huygens atmospheric structure instrument ( hasi ) , which recorded the surroundings as the probe descended elsewhere , the famous sounds of comet 67p churyumov-gerasimenko , as heard by the rosetta spacecraft and philae probe , are also replayed
rosetta âs plasma consortium ( rpc ) recorded oscillations in the comet âs magnetic field at 40 to 50 millihertz
the â music â was far below the frequency heard by humans - which typically ranges from 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz - but increasing the frequencies makes the noise audible
elsewhere , the famous sounds of comet 67p churyumov-gerasimenko ( pictured ) , as heard by the rosetta spacecraft and philae probe , are also replayed
rosetta âs plasma consortium ( rpc ) recorded oscillations in the comet âs magnetic field at 40 to 50 millihertz the landing of philae on the surface of 67p on 12 november 2014 is also heard in a brief clip , which is the actual recording of mechanical vibrations as it made its touchdown
philae subsequently bounced twice on the surface before coming to rest in an unknown location , wedged under a cliff somewhere in partial darkness
scientists at european space agency are hoping that the probe will wake up in the coming weeks as sunlight recharges its batteries , letting them perform more key science on the surface
philae 's first landing on the surface , seen here as pictured from the rosetta spacecraft , can be heard in a short clip
the probe then bounced twice before coming to rest in an unknown location the recent launch of a soyuz rocket that took two europe satellites into orbit can also be heard in one amazing clip
it took off from french guiana at 9.46pm gmt on friday 27 march , carrying two satellites that will expand europe âs galileo system - a civilian - run analogue to the us - run global positioning system ( gps )
other launches include the radar imaging satellite sentinel-1a , which is tracking earth âs environmental changes , and 1999 âs xmm-newton x-ray observatory .
