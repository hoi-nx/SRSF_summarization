' it meant a lot that he stuck with me , but that 's the way he is , ' fletcher told www.uefa.com
' the gaffer 's made a point of standing by the guys who 've got us to this position and saying that , whatever anyone else says , he knows we 're good players
i 'm delighted to have repaid a bit of that faith

' i feel my game 's about more than goals but you know as a striker that people do n't judge you on how many times you link up play , but on how many you score , ' the 28 - year - old said
' so i was conscious of the fact it had been so long
that said , my confidence genuinely has n't been dented
you just enjoy these days when they come along , and they do n't come much better than scoring a hat - trick for your country
' i only realised after the match that i 'm the first scottish player to do that in so long
i wondered if shaun might get there first , but a few of the lads came up after my second and said : ' go on , make sure you get the match ball '
' you 'd have seen from my celebrations how much the goals meant to me , especially the first
that seemed to take an age to go in
