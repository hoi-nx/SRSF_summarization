the next time someone accuses you of acting like a neanderthals , do n't be offended
just say " thank you
" a new study published this month suggests neanderthals were more " cognitively advanced than we give them credit , " kansas university 's frayer said in a release
frayer , a professor emeritus of anthropology , was a part of the study published in the journal plos one that looks at eagle talons found in present - day croatian
the talons are among the thousands of human remains , animal bones and tools originally excavated between 1899 and 1905 in the area by croatian scientist dragutin gorjanovic-kramberger
only recently , however , did frayer identify the cut marks and notches on the 130,000 - year - old bones as ones modified by humans
" i was stunned , " frayer said of the discovery
" it 's so obvious that these are cut
" the markings , including polishes and areas where the bones were " rubbed together , " show that the talons were " manipulated into a piece of jewelry , " frayer said
frayer co-wrote " evidence for neanderthal jewelry : modified white-tailed eagle claws at krapina " with three other croatian scientists
their research indicates neanderthals were more than just the cavemen - like characters depicted in geico commercials , but sophisticated creatures concerned with ornamentation and possibly even an " advanced level of prowess " in catching birds , according to frayer
" we ca n't prove it , but we suspect that they were catching these birds , " he said
even with modern technology , catching an eagle is an enormously difficult thing to do
frayer believes neanderthals must have had excellent " planning skills and ritual " they would 've used in catching the bird
" neanderthals are often thought of to be simple - minded mumbling , bumbling , stumbling fools , " frayer said
" but the more we know about them the more sophisticated they 've become
