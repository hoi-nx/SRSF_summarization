' american college students like to drink shots at frat parties but here they like to drink three types of wine at dinner
' i got my room by chance but in the states they would find the fact that sometimes they assign rooms on test scores baffling - the idea that you get a better room based on grade just would n't happen in new york
' only certain people of a certain status can walk on the lawns - i think if i did n't write my blog or take photographs , my american friends just would n't believe that these things happen
' it 's archaic and almost medieval sometimes
i do think it 's snobby , and slightly ridiculous but in an incredibly endearing british way and i find the old traditions just mesmerising

' but then may week came and it was fabulous
i had to sell a kidney to pay for all the balls , ' she joked , ' but it was totally worth it
' she continued : ' tickets vary from Â£ 90 going all the way up to Â£ 250 for certain balls , which are white tie and only happen every three years
' i do n't think american even really know what white tie is
i certainly did n't when i first came here
it 's just a totally different type of glamour , it is another world
' american does a lot of things well : hot dogs , obesity and fun - but we do n't do glamour like the brits
' i went to trinity ball last year
it is held in the most stunning setting , the girls all look beautiful and the men look like they 're from a bbc period drama

but her absolute favourite thing about cambridge ? the british accent

' i want to clarify that i am not one of those tragically old - fashioned girls who goes to college only to find a husband
i love my degree , period
but i 'm not complaining about all the dashing british accents
' i love that everyone sounds so proper and lovely , even when i ca n't understand what 's going on around me - there 's nowhere else i 'd rather be
