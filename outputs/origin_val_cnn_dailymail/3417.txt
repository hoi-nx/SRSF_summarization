ben cooper , controller of bbc , said yesterday that he would n't expect members of his family to put up with such treatment at work and that the allegations must be ' dealt with in a very serious way '
' if my son or daughter went to a place of work where they were shouted at , abused and someone threw a punch at them , then i would want there to be an inquiry and i would want that to be dealt with in a very serious way , ' he said
tory mp whittingdale also waded into the row last night , warning that the bbc should not make any special allowances for clarkson , pictured yesterday on his bike , regardless of his show 's popularity
mr whittingdale , chairman of the culture , media and sport select committee , said : ' clarkson should be given no special dispensation
he should be treated like any other employee at the bbc and the same disciplinary rules should apply to him as to anyone else
' he added that it would be ' hard to see the case ' for keeping clarkson if he is found to have punched producer tymon
ben cooper , controller of bbc , has said the allegations against clarkson , pictured on a bicycle in west london yesterday , should be ' dealt with in a very serious way ' clarkson was suspended by the bbc two weeks ago , following allegations of a â fracas â with producer tymon ( left ) over hot food top gear is sold in more than 200 countries , bringing in around Â£ 50million a year for the bbc
clarkson was keen to stress his commercial clout in next month 's top gear magazine , which was written before the latest row erupted and will go on sale on friday
he warned against top gear becoming boring , saying : ' we could talk about fuel economy
but , if we did , we 'd be left with almost no viewers in the uk , and no foreign sales
' clarkson allegedly punched mr tymon when he was offered cold cuts instead of a hot steak after a long day of filming
he is also said to have called the producer a ' lazy irish * * * * ' , during what the bbc described as a ' fracas '
lord tony hall , bbc director - general , is expected to deliver his verdict on clarkson 's future as soon as today .
