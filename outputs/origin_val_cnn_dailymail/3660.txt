zafar ansari and mark wood could be beneficiaries of the uncertainty around an test squad whose reputation has been left in tatters by the world cup
question marks remain over the fitness of moeen and woakes ahead of wednesday âs naming of the party for a three - test series against the west indies that peter moores desperately needs to win if he is to remain test coach
moeen and woakes were injured towards the end of test âs disastrous world cup campaign and are far from certain of being fit ahead of the first test in antigua on april 13 that follows two warm - up games in st kitts
zafar ansari could be named as part of the test squad ahead of the three - test series against west indies the 23 - year - old is an all - rounder who bowls left - arm orthodox spin and opens the batting for surrey the 23 - year - old zafar ansari is an all - rounder who bowls left - arm orthodox spin and opens the batting for surrey
is he any good ? just ask kevin pietersen ! so often a victim of left - arm spin , the former test batsman was dismissed by a 19 - year - old zafar ansari as cambridge university beat surrey by 10 wickets in 2011
zafar ansari has 54 first - class wickets and a batting average of 30.16
anything else i need to know ? zafar ansari would probably be among the smarter cricketers in test âs tour party , having studied politics at cambridge
he admits he is often ribbed by his team - mates for having a crossword out in the dressing room
that means surrey âs left - arm spin - bowling all - rounder zafar ansari and durham pace bowler mark wood could be named to travel with the squad as cover for moeen and woakes in the early days of the month - long tour
zafar ansari , 23 , is predominantly a batsman and topped 1,000 championship runs last season but is perhaps the nearest equivalent to moeen on the circuit
mark wood impressed test âs outgoing fast bowling coach david saker during a training camp in south africa before christmas and only fitness concerns have held the 25 - year - old back from full international recognition
it seems certain that trott , now returned to full fitness after leaving test âs last ashes tour with a condition later diagnosed as situational anxiety , will return after a successful tour of south africa as lions captain
test âs test middle order is settled following the success of gary ballance , root and bell in the three successive victories over india last summer , leaving trott to battle robson to become cook âs opening partner
mark wood ( centre ) could also be included in test 's test squad to face the west indies question marks remain over the fitness of moeen ( pictured ) ahead of the test series peter moores desperately needs test to defeat the west indies if he is to remain coach cook , sacked as one - day captain on the brink of the world cup , returns to action for mcc against yorkshire in abu dhabi starting on sunday and will then seek to build on the progress made by test in test cricket last summer
bairstow , one of the casualties of the fall - out from the last ashes , is favourite to tour as reserve wicketkeeper ahead of kent âs exciting sam billings , while rashid and tredwell will compete for the other spin place
rashid , a more mature performer than when he was thrust into the test squad prematurely in 2009 , looked a certainty to tour until he bowled poorly for the lions in south africa and may now be pipped by the more reliable tredwell
such is the desperate state of english cricket after the world cup that the pressure will be on not just peter moores but also managing director paul downton when test take on a west indies side who look sure to be weakened by the indian premier league
chris gayle , for one , is likely to retire from international cricket after the world cup and west indies should be even more vulnerable than test
