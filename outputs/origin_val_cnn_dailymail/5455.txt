militants fighting for the islamic state in northern syria have carried out another mass cigarette burning , as the terror group steps up its anti-smoking campaign
photographs taken in the northern town of barqah , close to the border with turkey , show members of isis ' feared religious police force setting light to vast piles of cigarettes in a field
the images emerged as it was revealed isis has erected shocking anti-smoking posters throughout its self - declared caliphate featuring images of burning human lungs , in the hope it will convince militants to reject the ' slow suicide ' caused by cigarettes
flames : petrol is seen being poured over the boxes of cigarettes , which are then set alight shocking : the cigarette burning images emerged as it was revealed isis has erected shocking anti-smoking posters throughout its self - declared caliphate featuring images of burning human lungs images of the mass cigarette burning have been widely shared by isis supporters on social media
the terror group has ruled that smoking cigarettes causes cancer and is therefore a form of suicide
taking your own life is deemed a major sin by isis and failed attempts - or in the case of cigarettes ' slow ' attempts - are considered comparable with murder
despite this many fighters continue to regularly smoke and abandoned isis positions are often found littered with cigarette butts - suggesting a thriving black market exists in the vast swathes of syria and iraq under the militants ' control
to counter this , isis appears to now be relying less on threats and punishments to convince militants to give up smoking , and more on using similar shocking images of cancer victims that now appear on packets of cigarettes in the west
in typical isis fashion , however , the terror group took the method to its logical extreme , showing grisly images of lungs being set alight to symbolise the damage smoking does to a human body

moreau , 27 was the first french citizen to be tried for joining isis and was sentenced to seven years jail by a court in paris
moreau , who has 13 previous convictions ranging from armed robbery to assault , is a muslim convert
he moved to syria in 2012 to join isis after becoming radicalised in french
but he returned to french just two weeks later , unable to cope with the strict isis regime , and was swiftly arrested
moreau told the court : ' i really struggled with not smoking ... it was forbidden by the katiba
i had brought nicorette gum with me , but it was n't enough
i left my gun with my emir and i left
' french intelligence officials remain concerned about the number of french nationals involved with isis
it is believed at least 930 are actively fighting in iraq and syria .
