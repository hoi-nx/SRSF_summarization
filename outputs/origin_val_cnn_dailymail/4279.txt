a boy who was just 11 when he was charged with fatally shooting his father 's pregnant fiancee has launched an appeal to dismiss the charges or grant him a new trial
brown , now 17 , was jailed in 2012 for the fatal shooting of 26 - year - old houk and her unborn son with a shotgun in february 2009 because he was jealous that the child would be given his room
the court heard houk , then eight months pregnant , was sleeping when brown approached her with a blanket - covered 20 - gauge shotgun and fired a bullet into her head
however , brown 's attorneys claim the evidence used to convict him was insubstantial and he was the victim of a rush judgement
' rush judgement ' : brown ( pictured left aged 14 ) , was convicted of shooting his father 's fiancee keznie houk ( right ) when she was eight months pregnant and sleeping
he claims the evidence was insubstantial shock : his father chris ( pictured ) spoke out about his shock after the attack when the boy was just 11 filing for retrial on thursday , defense attorney colafella said : ' i think the trial court has , at a minimum , no choice but to give us a new trial
' we feel strongly there was just not enough evidence to convict him beyond reasonable doubt and are confident of an acquittal
' the supreme court first raised questions about the case in december
brown 's defense attorneys said both sides were asked to file written arguments before the judge issues a final ruling in a few weeks and that they expect a favorable ruling
state prosecutors did not immediately comment following the closed hearing in lawrence county
state police and prosecutors have repeatedly said none of the evidence points to anyone but brown , who is now 17
the defense contends the investigation amounted to a rush to judgment against the boy , fueled in part by houk 's family
they have told investigators and reporters that the boy was spoiled by his father and jealous of houk and her unborn child who , they contend , was going to be given brown 's room in his father 's farmhouse in wampum , about 40 miles northwest of pittsburgh
tragic : houk left behind a seven - year - old jenessa ( left ) and a four - year - old adalynn ( right ) brown 's defense lawyers claim houk 's family fueled animosity towards brown during the 2012 trial brown 's attorneys claim he was the victim of a rush judgement prosecutors contend brown approached houk with his youth - model 20 - gauge shotgun hidden under a blanket then shot her in the back of the head as she lay in bed
she was more than 8 months pregnant with a son , who also died
brown 's father had left for work and houk 's two daughters , ages 7 and 4 , were the only others in the house when she was shot , prosecutors said
an empty shotgun shell was found on the long driveway between the house and the road , where brown walked before a school bus picked him up that morning , and police said they found gunshot residue on his clothes and no male footprints leading to or from the house except for brown 's
but colafella said pictures from the scene show a ' muddy mess ' outside the house that does n't clearly show what footprints were and were not there and that police did not thoroughly canvass four entrances to the home to see whether someone else could have come in
' jealousy ' : brown was allegedly jealous that his father 's new son was going to be named chris after him the defense also said brown frequently shot his gun and that gun powder residue found on his clothes that day could have come from a winter jacket he had also worn during a turkey shoot days earlier
police have said houk 's ex-boyfriend was eliminated as a suspect by their investigation , but the supreme court noted defense arguments that brown saw a truck resembling the man 's near the house that morning
colafella also said houk 's seven - year - old daughter first told police she did n't hear anything unusual that morning , only to later recall hearing a loud bang after additional questioning
houk 's body was found after the four - year - old went outside to tell men hired to cut trees that she thought her mother was dead , police said
jack houk , the dead woman 's father , did not immediately return a call seeking comment after the hearing
the defense has told investigators and reporters that the boy was spoiled by his father and jealous of houk and her unborn child who they contend was going to be given brown 's room in his father 's farmhouse
