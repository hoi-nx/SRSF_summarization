look out for barbary apes , grins our guide : ' we often get raided , especially in the harvest
' ahmad , aged 72 , finds most things funny
he owns a donkey called ' easyjet ' and tells us that most of his neighbours will live to 105
our week in the rif , a mountainous region of morocco , follows this pattern - it is full of surprises
the tops of the mountains are dusted with snow , and yet , around the bottom , you can buy oranges as big as a baby 's head
a rif you 'll want to hear forever : the rif mountains are a beautiful - yet less known - part of morocco on ahmad 's country walks we see mountain women wearing wide - brimmed hats festooned with pom - poms
one minute we 're clambering through gorgeous terraces of onions and fruit , the next we 're in a paddock of cannabis ( or kif )
' just for the farmers , ' says ahmad airily
' the long - haired ones do n't come any more
' but strangest of all is our first town , chefchaouen
the old parts are all a bluey - purple , as if the entire medina has been flushed with ink
to my daughter lucy , aged ten , this is enchanting , and we tour every alley and knobbly passage , poking our heads into all the old caravanserais
there are no cars in this beautiful labyrinth of mauve , and in the mornings everyone rushes out to the public taps
we stay at the lina ryad , a little bit of the 21st century dropped in among these dreamy scenes
it even has a modest swimming pool , in a town where most people think a traffic jam has hooves
this is not a place for ordinary shopping
we somehow end up with an old pair of slave 's manacles ( Â£ 7 ) , a large flag ( Â£ 6 ) and a very battered silver headdress ( Â£ 30 )
most of the time it is enough just to wander
from the kasbah ( or citadel ) we can peer down into people 's lives
as the day warms , housewives head out to the stream to rinse out their carpets
after a few days , we head north
country and city : a woman from the rif region in traditional dress ( left ) ; the back streets of tangier ( right ) the rif may not be morocco 's tallest range , but it 's thrillingly wild
great rivers burst through the boulders , and we can just make out tiny villages perched high up in the valley walls
then , suddenly , we tumble out into tangier
this fabulous antique city feels only half - african
for a long time , it was ' the international zone ' ( 1923 - 1956 ) , and european appeared in droves
they left cafes , cannon , art deco , a long corniche and a whole cemetery of kind hearts and baronets
some came for the view , and we tour the celebrity roosts
there 's still a piano bar at the el-minzah ( churchill and rex harrison ) , although the hotel cecil ( tennessee williams ) now has palm trees growing through the roof
meanwhile , at grand hotel villa de france , you can visit matisse 's bedroom ( number 35 ) and gaze out at the scenes he painted
others came to misbehave , particularly the beat poets
it 's fun trying to find their old haunts around the medina
although dean 's bar was wreathed in dust and padlocks , you can still get a whiff of the fifties at cafe baba
however , for lucy , the best moments are when we head for the souk
one stall sells huge blocks of nougat ( which have to be chopped with a cleaver ) ; another has only magic charms and musket balls
captivating : tangier - with its medina to the forefront - has long tempted european travellers to morocco deep in the medina , little alleyways turn into grand arabian palaces ( like al-makhzen ) , or perhaps the house of barbara hutton , once the richest woman in the world
my favourite is the old american legation of 1821
from the outside , it looks typically dusty and medieval , but step inside and a glorious georgian residence appears
such excitement requires a cosy bolthole , and we have la tangerina
hidden in the ramparts , this tiny hotel has been lovingly restored
there are log fires and almond cake for tea , and time seems to have paused at 1956
enjoy this mad city , walk everywhere , do everything and then retreat to the hotel 's roof
in one direction lies spain ( only eight miles away , across the med ) and in the other lies the rif , now looking pink and mysterious and deceptively tame
