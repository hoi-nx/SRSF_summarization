seager attempted to rob the bookmakers by claiming the tin of pilchards he was carrying was a bomb a hopeless robber has been spared jail after he tried to hold up a bookmaker 's shop with a tin of pilchards
seager , 18 , owed a friend Â£ 1,800 and spent the day ploughing his last pennies into roulette machines hoping to win the money until he was down to his last pound
the 6ft 4in teenager then hit upon a plan to rob the bookies , where he was a regular customer
he bought a 99p tin of john west pilchards from his local corner shop and burst into a william hill in ilford , essex , on 20 december last year
seager demanded cash and claimed the tin of fish in tomato sauce he had in a black bag was a lethal explosive device , snaresbrook heard
' i 've got a bomb , ' he told astonished cashier awomudu , who simply walked off into a secure room at the back of the shop
seager hurled his fishy snack across the shop in frustration and left
mr awomudu had recognised him and seager was arrested shortly afterwards , confessing to his bungled plan immediately at the police station
he admitted attempted robbery and one count of communicating false information about a bomb hoax
edward franklin , prosecuting , said : ' in respect of the bomb hoax , this was n't a classic bomb hoax in that the security services were n't alerted and there 's no evidence that any action was taken by the authorities
' both my learned friend and i agree that this is best dealt with as an attempted robbery - you can say you have a knife or a gun , in this case it was a tin of pilchards masquerading as a bomb
' judge king remarked : ' the thing that moved the man behind the counter to go behind the safe and into the secure room was undoubtedly the belief that the defendant had a bomb
' carberry , defending , said seager he had been suffering from diagnosed but untreated depression and psychosis at the time of the incident , and has tourette 's syndrome
' these are serious offences and i accept the custody threshold has been passed , and normally these types of offences would merit an immediate sentence of imprisonment
' she continued : ' he 's far from someone who fits the profile of a robber of a small business , it 's a great irony that seager went into a bookmaker somewhere he frequented , somewhere he was known - he knew the man behind the counter
' she added that seager 's own mother also works at a bookies , and the fact that he chose to rob a similar premises to his mother 's indicated he ' had n't given it much thought '
in a letter to the judge , seager wrote : ' i just want the judge to know i need help and i will be an outstanding member of my community
' ms carberry added : ' this was entirely out of character , this was an aberration in this young man 's life
' seager was attempting to rob the william hill in ilford ( pictured ) , which he had frequented as a customer sentencing seager to a two - year suspended sentence , two year 's supervision by the probation service and ordering him to undergo mental health treatment , judge king said : ' there can be absolutely no doubt that what you did was to commit a very serious offence
' the court heard seager threw the tin of pilchards across the shop in frustration when his plan to pretend it was a bomb failed he added : ' one can only imagine how petrified he must have been
' you secreted this item in a black bag , no doubt to give it a more convincing air to what you were doing
' he continued : ' you are young man suffering from a number of psychological conditions that had gone untreated , but you had got to the age of 18 without having descended into criminal activity
' the disorders from which you suffered were long standing disorders and one can only commend members of your family for being able to cope for so long
' it is in that context i have to decide how i want to deal with you , i 'm satisfied that the custody threshold has been passed - what i am about to do is exceptional and does not reduce the gravity of your offence you committed
' i am persuaded that i can suspend the sentence
' judge king also barred him from an betting shop for the next 12 months and ordered him to pay a Â£ 100 surcharge
seager , of ilford , wiped away tears as his sentence was read out and thanked the judge before leaving the dock
one of seager 's family members shouted ' you are a just and a fair man your honour ' as the judge left the bench .
