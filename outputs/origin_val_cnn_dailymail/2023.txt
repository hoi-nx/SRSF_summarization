taylor , 21 ( left ) , is facing life in jail today after he was found guilty of murdering wilson , 25 , after becoming convinced he was dating his ex-girlfriend jodie emery , 26 ( right ) during the struggle he used a knife he had bough on a previous holiday with miss jodie emery to fatally stab mr wilson in the thigh
during his trial at preston crown court , taylor tried to claim that that there was no innocent reason for mr wilson being in the house , and denied intending to kill him , but a jury took just an hour and a half to decide he was lying
today he was handed down a life sentence and told he can not apply for parole until at least 2040
judge anthony russell qc told taylor : ' the victim was someone completely unknown to you and had done you absolutely no harm at all and yet was murdered by you for no other reason other than he happened to be the person at the home of emery
' this was a particularly shocking murder because it was pure chance wilson was the person who you vented your rage on because you were unable to accept your relationship with emery was finished
' people have to accept that sometimes things go wrong in their lives and relationship do sometimes end
you were not prepared to accept that
taylor kicked down miss jodie emery 's front door on september 22 last year , and began fighting with mr wilson ( pictured ) , fatally stabbing him in the thigh ' you persistently badgered her to the extent that you became a nuisance
' you were not prepared to let her move along with her life or yours because of your obsessive jealousy
she was perfectly entitled to see other people , it was none of your business if she did so
' you murdered this man for no other reason other than he was in a place he was perfectly entitled to be
he had done no wrong
' the court earlier heard that taylor , a slaughterhouse worker who spent his days deboning animal carcasses , had been in an eight - month relationship with miss jodie emery
the pair had shared a caravan holiday together in scarborough , but after they returned home miss emery secretly terminated a pregnancy
when taylor found out he flew into a rage and the pair split
unable to accept the break - up taylor began texting and calling miss jodie emery on a regular basis begging for them to get back together , and often went to her house to watch her , often coming up to look through the windows
two days before the murder took place taylor was at pub the tardy gate
when he spotted one of miss jodie emery 's former boyfriends he became angry , smashed a window and tried to punch the man
louise blackwell qc said on the day of the killing taylor texted miss jodie emery saying : ' i miss you
maybe in time you 'll want to try again '
she asked him not to contact her but later that evening he sent her another text saying : ' can i come for cuddles ? ' miss jodie emery responded , ' you being weird then ' , to which he said : ' i 'm not my head is just f.
ked ' and he allegedly rang his mother asking for a knife he bought during his holiday with miss jodie emery
the court heard he was spotted cycling towards her home during which he sent her another text asking her who she was with
she texted back , ' on my own i keep telling you ' at which point taylor said : ' last chance otherwise things are going to turn sour , tell me who is there , last chance '
emery replied ' wtf ' and tried to call him three times with no response
miss blackwell added : ' the defendant then arrived at the front door and used considerable force to kick his way through the bottom panel
' once inside the incident starts immediately in the hall between the defendant and wilson and spilled into the lounge
' miss jodie emery was trying her best , obviously unsuccessfully to break apart and stop the defendant being able to get at wilson but it did not stop
' all three of them ended up on the sofa in the living room
wilson was on the bottom , jodie emery had got herself between him and the defendant lay on top but she described the repeated blows being struck to wilson
during his trial at preston crown court , taylor ( pictured right ) had tried to claim there was no innocent reason for mr wilson to be with miss jodie emery , and denied intending to kill him , but a jury ruled otherwise the court heard that after miss jodie emery split from taylor following an eight - month relationship he became jealous , constantly texting and calling her , and often going to her house ( pictured ) to spy on her ' she did not initially realise there was a knife involved but after a period of time during which blows were being reigned down , the defendant then stood up
' at that stage she saw he was armed with that knife , a knife she had seen before which he has bought when they were on holiday in scarborough
' taylor fled the scene and dumped the knife as miss jodie emery rang for ambulance
mr wilson was pronounced dead in hospital just an hour later from the 6cm long and 7.5cm deep fatal wound which was to the inner right thigh
doctors also found cuts on his back , buttocks and legs , and abrasions on the rest of his body that were consistent with a struggle
on the night of the killing taylor text miss emery saying '' ast chance , otherwise things are going to turn sour , tell me who is there ' before kicking in her front door while her two young daughters were asleep upstairs when taylor was arrested he said : ' no you are not serious are you , you are joking , he is dead ? he attacked me i have done nothing wrong '
shortly afterward police recovered the black - handled and blood - stained knife
in a video interview miss emery said wilson was ' just a friend ' whom she had known for a couple of months
she said taylor would turn up at her home and she she believed he would carry on turning up if she did not reply to his messages
she said : ' taylor had been constantly texting all the time
i made sure i was answering and replying to the phone calls
i did n't tell him that i was with anyone because i knew he would not like it
' in a statement wilson 's mother diane said : ' wilson would have been frightened at time of his death
i 'm so angry at the compete irrationality to understand how someone could do that to my son
