the documentary is presented by dunn bbc bosses have sparked outrage by broadcasting a historic film presented by a notorious child sex campaigner â and have refused requests to remove it from the internet
the documentary is presented by dunn , one of the founders of the pie ( pie ) , which campaigned to legalise sex with children
it is one of 30 archive films on the bbc âs website telling the history of the gay rights movement
the 30 - minute documentary â glad to be gay ? â portrays dunn as a legitimate gay rights activist and makes no reference to his role in setting up the reviled group
victims of child abuse described as â horrifying â the decision to upload the film
when the mail on sunday contacted the bbc to point out the documentary was causing offence , the broadcaster refused to take it down â on the grounds that it is a â significant â work on the history of gay rights
the documentary , first shown on the bbc in 1976 , shows the lives of gay people at a time when homosexuality was still illegal in scotland , and featured interviews with future foreign secretaries cook and rifkind
it was an episode of a public access tv series called open door , and the bbc website states it was made by the smg and credits dunn as a presenter
dunn , who died in 1998 , is shown describing the work of the group in edinburgh , while mr cook and mr rifkind were interviewed about their opinions on gay rights
the footage includes dunn calling for the age of consent to be lowered , stating : â we think a boy considered old enough to take responsibility of bringing up a family is surely old enough to make up his own mind
â but there is no mention in either the original documentary or on the bbc website of dunn âs role in campaigning for adults to be allowed to have sex with children
when mos contacted the bbc ( headquarters pictured ) to point out the documentary was causing offence , the broadcaster refused to take it down â on the grounds that it is a â significant â work on the history of gay rights in october 1974 , dunn had co-founded pie as an offshoot of smg , and wrote that its goals were to campaign â for the legal and social acceptance of paedophilic love â
last night representatives of victims of child abuse said the bbc âs decision was at odds with refusing to show repeats of top of the pops featuring disgraced djs jimmy savile and dave lee travis
catherine allen , of sexual abuse victims â charity one in four , said : â this is horrifying and shows complete contempt for those who suffered at the hands of dunn and other members of pie
â i believed the bbc had learned lessons from the savile saga but they still are nât taking sexual abuse seriously
â dr jon bird , of the national association for people abused in childhood , called on the bbc to remove the film or amend it to make viewers aware of dunn âs warped views
the bbc said : â this video â which does nât involve or discuss any children â was considered a significant programme on gay rights and has been online for many years
