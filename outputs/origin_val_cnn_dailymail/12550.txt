in washington , we are seeing the re-emergence this year of a phenomenon that many america were afraid had gone extinct : real live no - joke bipartisanship
heavyweights from both parties are attending the march 26 bipartisan summit on criminal justice reform
the event is co-produced by gingrich productions ( on the right ) and by my project , # cut50 -- an initiative that aims to safely halve the number of people behind bars within 10 years
attorney general eric holder will be speaking
so will newt gingrich , the republicans former house speaker
sen. cory booker , d-new jersey , will be there
so will democrats strategist and cnn commentator donna brazile , a co-host of the summit
republicans power players like former texas gov. rick perry , ohio gov. john kasich and sen. mike lee , r-utah , will address the gathering by video
progressives like myself will rub shoulders with representatives from koch
everyone keeps asking me , " how is this possible ? " i have five words for you : " liberty and justice for all and justice for all
" the ever - expanding incarceration industry has begun to violate some of the deepest and most sacred principles of both major political parties
therefore , conservatives , libertarians and liberals have their own objective interests in reform -- and their own values - based incentives to make real changes
for example , the right takes very seriously the concept of " liberty
" conservatives and libertarians want to defend the rights of every individual to pursue his or her dreams
they hate massive , failed , bloated government bureaucracies that suck up more and more money and get more and more power , no matter how badly they perform
in america today , we have 5 % of the world 's population -- but we have nearly 25 % of the world 's incarcerated people
nearly 1 in 100 america adults is behind bars
one out of every four people locked up anywhere in the world is caged in america 's prisons and jails
and most people come out more damaged , more hopeless and less able to thrive than when they went in
( so much for " corrections " ! ) that 's the opposite of limited government -- and liberty
on the other hand , progressives like me care passionately about the " justice for all " part -- including racial justice and social justice
we are incensed by a system that locks up the poor and racial minorities in numbers that are massive -- and massively disproportionate
we oppose a system that forever tars people as " felons , " deemed permanently unfit for employment or the right to vote , possibly because of one mistake , early in life
when any system violates the principles of both " liberty " and " justice , " america of all stripes should stand together to change it
that is exactly what is starting to happen
this year , we are seeing the birth of an honest - to - goodness " liberty and justice for all " coalition
still struggling to believe me ? i was on " anderson cooper 360 " on monday night to discuss the movement for criminal justice reform
here is a quote : " a lot of kids i grew up with , grammar school , middle school , high school , were in prison
they were the poor kids and they had drug addictions
they had drug problems , they did n't have any money , they got caught , and they got caught in the poverty cycle , and they are at the bottom of society and they ca n't get out of it
... people with drug problems , people who have mental illnesses , they probably should n't be in the criminal justice system
and people who make mistakes , let 's not write them off forever , let 's give them a chance to reintegrate and reenter society
" there is just one catch : i 'm not the one who said that
that is a direct quote from mark , senior vice president of koch
on practically every other issue , the koch brothers and i are still fierce opponents
i doubt if we will ever agree on tax policy , campaign finance reform , environmental rules or the keystone pipeline , to name a few
but on criminal justice reform , it 's different
mark speaks eloquently about the way the criminal justice system violates the bill of rights and criminalizes behaviors that should not result in prison terms
and he is not alone , on the right
fiscal conservatives decry the money wasted on a system that is too expensive and produces poor results
that 's one reason that red - state governors , like georgia 's nathan deal , have acted boldly
leaders with roots on the religious right , including summit co-host pat nolan , insist on the christian value of redemption and second chances for those behind bars
our values may not always be identical , but they can find common expression in fixing this broken prison system
progressives and conservatives do n't have to trust each other -- or even like each other -- to vote together on this issue
usually , " bipartisanship " is just another word for cheap , political gamesmanship
it is too often invoked by one side , simply to gain advantage and to cloak a more narrow set of interests
but on criminal justice reform , something different is happening
criminal justice reform is the one place where many republicans , democrats and libertarians actually agree -- and are willing to work together to get something done
over the last 30 years , both parties helped lead us down the path to mass incarceration
it will take both political parties to reverse course
perhaps the march 26 bipartisan summit will represent the first major bend in the road back toward sanity .
