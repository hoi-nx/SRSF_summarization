to play for scotland at hampden , maloney will fly 500 miles
then add a zero on the end
when chicago fire âs visit to the new home of san jose ended in defeat on sunday night , the 32 - year - old confronted the reality of life in mls
a 5,000 mile journey from california to glasgow , lasting the best part of a day , for a midweek friendly with ireland followed by a euro qualifier against gibraltar
the crowds for both games will be modest
maloney made the 5,000 mile trip from chicago to glasgow in order to represent his country scotland international maloney , pictured scoring against the republic of ireland , loves playing for his country scotland are just three points behind group d leaders poland in the race to qualify for euro 2016 yet it only took a five - minute call to strachan to convince him the jetlag was worth it
that the arrangement can work
â we had a conversation , which was pretty brief , â said the man whose stunning goal against ireland invigorated scotland âs latest qualifying campaign
â but although it was brief , it was really important for me
â i asked him if it would have any detrimental effect on my international career ( moving to the states ) and he said , â no â
that was all i needed to know
â i absolutely love playing for my country
it makes me very , very proud and it âs an honour to do it and i will try my hardest to continue to make the squad no matter what league i am in
â how he might feel when the air miles mount is another matter
significantly easier ways to add more caps to the display cabinet
leaving troubled , relegation threatened wigan in january , there was a firm offer from leicester
speaking during celtic âs winter break to gran canaria , ronny deila had also expressed an interest in taking him back to parkhead
â i think the quotes by the celtic manager were just him being very polite about me as a player , â claimed maloney
â i was a previous celtic player
i did nât think there was too much else in it
â there were options to stay in england , but i spoke to the manager and the owner in chicago and i think my mind was pretty much made up in january
maloney rejected interest from england and scotland in order to seal a move to mls outfit chicago fire â you have to respect any club that offers you a contract in england or scotland
but i really wanted to try this
â he had been around the block in england and scotland many times
two spells at celtic left nothing new to discover , other than a landscape with no old firm games
at aston villa and wigan , he had also been seen the contrasts of england football , winning an fa cup medal before flirting with a relegation battle in the championship
a Â£ 750,000 move to leicester was close , but fell down
chicago âs magnificent mile and sears tower were always appealing options
â i have always thought about playing in this league , â he continued
â i think the timing just worked
it âs a completely different lifestyle , everything is new
the stadiums , the clubs i am playing against , everything
it â s all very exciting
â we had a disappointing year as a club last season and the play - offs are our ambition this year
i do nât think it âs beyond us
â the early signs suggest otherwise
after three matches , maloney has yet to play in a winning team and crossing the atlantic to face ireland in a friendly is a big commitment
without a point in the eastern conference , fire host philadelphia union hours after scotland âs qualifier with gibraltar on sunday without one of their prized , high - profile designated players
caught between a rock and a hard place , maloney insisted : â i will always make myself available for scotland
maloney ( left , pictured with steven naismith ) is pleased to be playing under scotland boss strachan â we will cross the friendlies bridge as we come to it
â his respect for the manager is a factor
effusive in his praise of strachan , his former celtic manager , maloney has new enthusiasm for international football , admitting : â look , the manager has been excellent
â i would nât want to disrespect craig levein the previous manager at all
but the impact strachan has had has been monumental
â the players have bought into the system that he wants and we have some outstanding players in steven fletcher and steven naismith at everton
â i would probably put scott brown in that same category and then beyond that our manager is our biggest asset
we are very fortunate to have him
â asked if this is the best scotland team in 20 years or so he is blunt
technically , there have been better players in dark blue
yet strachan âs organisational skills and tactical nous are doing a decent job of covering up the cracks on the surface
â individually , we have probably had better players â or players playing at a higher level and more of them , â he said
â but as a group and as a team there is a feeling about it i have nât had in quite a long time
scotland are currently preparing for their upcoming matches against ireland and gibraltar â we are a good side
we played very well against ireland and were brought down to earth a little bit against england
â but we have to realise what our strengths are and our weaknesses and try to get better
â germany are still favourites to qualify
poland second and after that it âs between us , ireland and georgia for a spot in the top two and if not third and a play - off
â scotland against ireland in dublin is a big , big game and the result will have big ramifications for the group â as any game does now
â ireland are strong at home and poland were very good in warsaw , as well
â i could nât call it , i really could nât
â there was a brief exchange with san jose âs glasgow - born coach dominic kinnear before the long journey home
kenny miller found the travel from vancouver in canada gruelling
chicago is less northerly when it comes to flying to venues like california , yet san jose was still a 4,000 mile round trip
â you never know where and when things can change in this game , â he admitted
â i âve only spent a short time in chicago , but it âs a great sporting city , it is going to be a massive lifestyle change and i am looking forward to it
â i want to be part of a team which makes the city proud
and an international team that makes the country proud
