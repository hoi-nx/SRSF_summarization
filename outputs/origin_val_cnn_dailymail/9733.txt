the gruesome images which emerged on social media show the men 's limp bodies suspended from their feet off a tall structure in the town of hawija
the notorious black flag used by islamist groups like isis is displayed above them as horrified onlookers inspect the scene
some of the deceased men appear to be wearing military fatigues but it is not known if they were iraq soldiers

a shocking video released in february showed orange - clad captives being paraded in cages in the same city of hawija
frenzied crowds taunted the kidnapped men during the merciless procession which echoed the terrible death suffered by captured jordanian pilot moaz al-kasasbeh
he was also caged before a film of him being burned alive , implying the same fate would befall the trapped captives in hawija
it was seen as revenge against the kurdish forces who dragged the bodies of isis fighters through the streets of northern - iraq earlier that month
previous reports suggest he is an iraq national from the town of almere and the heads once belonged to members of the syrian army whom the militants captured and beheaded

since isis first invaded the city in june 2014 , it progressively conquered neighbouring villages until it gained enough support from locals to establish its new headquarters there
over the last nine months , its main base in iraq has been in iraq 's second - largest city mosul which it took over last year
it has offered islamic state a military advantage due to its proximity to the syrian border , which allows them to smuggle both weapons and soldiers
but a us - led coalition has attacked the city with airstrikes for many months - targeting isis convoys and weapons stores

their presence in hawija gives the militants access to anbar province and another road leading to the baiji oil refinery they lost to the iraq military in november 2014
hawija has been a hotbed of violence april 2013 - two years after the us withdrew its troops from the country
it began when the government 's forces raided a camp of rebels in the city on april 24 and killed dozens of civilians in the process
