wenger fears sanchez is running out of steam and is searching for the right moment to give the Â£ 32million chile striker a well - earned break
only per per mertesacker has played more for arsenal this season than sanchez , who has played for 3,326 minutes in his debut campaign , scoring 19 goals but only one in his last 11 appearances
' he 's a bit fatigued and in a position where he has scored less , ' said boss wenger
' he wants to force his game and then is more involved in physical battles
maybe goalscoring is on his mind , so he wants to do too much and he wants to force his game
sanchez has played more minutes this season than every arsenal player except per mertesacker manager wenger has considered resting the chile international because he is fatigued but wenger concedes the games are too important to leave out his star 19 - goal forward despite his early - season form the former barcelona attacker has only netted once in his last 11 games ' i 'm tempted to give him a break at some stage
i have been for a long time
it 's not that he wo n't let me , i will decide that
it 's just that every game now is so important , you always have a hesitation to do it
' arsenal are at newcastle in the premier league on saturday , and wenger will expect a reaction after sliding out of the champions league on tuesday
the trip to tyneside may present a good opportunity to rest sanchez , with plenty of available options , including tomas rosicky set to return after illness , and the manager attempting to keep his squad fresh for the fa cup defence and to finish as high as possible in the premier league

i believe chelsea still has a very good cushion and very good security
