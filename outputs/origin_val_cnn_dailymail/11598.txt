an abandoned dog has saved the lives of ten sick , newborn puppies and their weak mother after incessantly barking to alert passersby and then leading them to the dogs ' location in dense woods
the labrador mix , who has since been named hero , had spent weeks eluding members of dogrrr-rescue , rehab , reform in texas , who were trying to rescue him from a south dallas park
but on tuesday night , he greeted rescuer tarashevsce and dog behaviorist miller with persistent barking
every time the pair moved closer to him , hero inched backward and barked
deciding that the dog was trying to alert them to something , ms tarahevsce and mr miller followed him into nearby woodland
a short while later , they came across a burnt - out tree , situated by a creek
five days on , the 11 rescued animals have been transferred to a warm and caring foster home , fox news reported
they have been joined by hero himself , who remains constantly by their side
according to dogrrr-rescue , hero may be the puppies '' father , although this is not confirmed
but regardless , he will undoubtedly be ' the most loving and nurturing dog dad ' , the group remarked
speaking to ' fox and friends weekend ' on sunday , ms tarashevsce said she and mr miller were greeted by a ' loud barking ' when they walked across the park to retrieve black - furred hero
' when i got there in the evening , hero was barking really loudly , ' she told the program
' and it was n't just a regular bark
he just would n't stop and it sounded like he was in distress of some sort
' ms tarashevsce said that she had often seen hero with mona , whom she suspected to be pregnant , in recent weeks , so she assumed that something must be wrong with the expectant mother

and we heard little yelping of the puppies , so this is how we found them
