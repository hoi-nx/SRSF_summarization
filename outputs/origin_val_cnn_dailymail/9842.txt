deila believes he will soon be fending off interest in johansen from premier league clubs
the norwegian midfielder has thrived since his former stromsgodset manager moved to glasgow last summer
on the verge of adding the domestic treble to the championship he won a year ago , the 24 - year - old is also a forerunner for the player of the year awards
celtic boss ronny delia believes premier league clubs will soon come calling for midfielder johansen and , speaking to a norwegian tv station this week , deila was asked how long he could keep the player at celtic park
he replied : â it âs clear it âs difficult
he is good enough to play in the premier league but then it is a question of whether he wants it
â i think johansen is very fond of celtic and it âs a much bigger club to play for than for example west bromwich
â johansen made a wise choice when he chose to go to celtic
here he is allowed to develop , not least physically
he has been playing regularly at a high level
â johansen , who also spoke with the norwegian broadcaster tv2 , was adamant that he had no immediate desire to leave celtic , though
the 24 - year - old is adamant he has no immediate desire to leave the scottish giants at present â the reason why i âm doing so well now is that i enjoy where i am , â he said
â i see no reason why i should change clubs
i âm at a club that will win trophies , who have the ambition to play in europe
