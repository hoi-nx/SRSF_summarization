gibson is sitting in a restaurant in wimbledon , recalling the 12 absurd and wonderful chapters of his life that were spent in this part of town
â it was nuts , â he says
â you did nât need fash and jonesy to lie about what went on â the reality was mad enough
â in time , gibson will come back to the sore point of how the wimbledon side of the eighties was represented in a recent documentary
gibson laughs whilst recalling his eventful spell playing for wimbledon 's crazy gang he will address the myth that the crazy gang was ruled by the bullying of fashanu and vinnie jones , even if there is a memory of the former stripped to his underpants and covered in baby oil ahead of a dressing - room fight
but , for now , gibson wants to laugh rather than seethe
the little striker , who won the fa cup , once told alex where to go and pocketed Â£ 200 for scouting zabaleta , wants to present a fuller picture of life at plough lane
â i remember dennis wise , â he says
â just after we won the fa cup in 1988 players were getting sold and he was desperate for gould to give him a big move
we went on a trip to sweden and he âs bought a load of fireworks
back at the hotel , wisey is letting them off from the fifth floor into a crowded street
the locals are running for cover
gould knew he was trying to force a move and would nât budge
just another day at wimbledon
â the wimbledon players celebrate having won the 1988 fa cup at wembley against favourites liverpool gibson poses for the camera when speaking to sportsmail 's riath al-samarrai about his career gibson laughs
â there was a time when fash was telling the newspapers he was getting threatening letters at the training ground , â he says
â we all knew it was rubbish so one day i cut out letters from a newspaper , like in the films , and spelled , â fash , we are watching your every move â
i slipped it in his pocket and when he found it he starts panicking
he disappears with his big mobile phone and the next day âs papers say fash has had another threat
he always was a drama queen
â gibson adds : â my first day at the club , i saw wisey pinching the volkswagen badge off vinnie jones âs dad âs truck
vinnie jones was panicking that his dad was going to kill him
â there were a lot more laughs than people might have thought based only on the documentary
â fashanu , in action during his wimbledon playing days , was certainly a character in the crazy gang gibson , like most associated with the programme , the crazy gang , has taken exception to claims from fashanu that he was â the leader â and ruled by fear
â the truth is we tolerated fash , â says gibson , who spent six years at the club
â he was a bit of a clown
he was the perfect player for us but he always tried to present himself as something he was nât , even then
â yes , you had to be very tough to survive at the club
but there was so much more to how wimbledon achieved what we did
for fash to imply he controlled our dressing room with intimidation is just false
â of course there were fights but fash exaggerated
jonesy told the story about fash locking the dressing room and throwing an unnamed player against a bench and splitting his leg open
stitches , etc. gibson was former team - mate sanchez 's assistant at wycombe , northern ireland and fulham â the lad was robbie and , as i remember it , fash strips to his pants and covers himself in baby oil
they slipped around a bit and no punches were thrown
yes , robbie badly injured his calf on the bench but it was not split open with blood everywhere
â the stories were all embellished
it was no mafia , it was more a boarding school of very naughty boys
â a deeper perspective is found in gibson âs new book , giant killer
it âs a wonderful autobiography , self - written across three years
the book charts his rise from spurs , to coventry , to united and on to the high points at wimbledon , before gibson became sanchez âs assistant at northern ireland , fulham and wycombe
the 52 - year - old , in action for wimbledon ( right ) works for sky sports , commenting on spanish football â the game changed a bit in those three decades , â he says
â when spurs signed me as a kid they offered my parents a holiday and i was hoping they would choose somewhere abroad â they asked for this camp in dovercourt ! at least the club sent a limo
â it was at coventry that gibson played alongside sam and pearce
â we went to bisham abbey once , â gibson says
â pearce and micky adams were sharing and grimes was in with sam
we âd all had a drink one night
â micky and pearcie got into the others â room at something like 3am and tossed all their gear in the courtyard
sam and grimes go to fetch it but get locked out in the rain
god , they were out there for maybe an hour
sam was getting all this abuse , pearcie and micky calling him a northern so - and - so and laughing at him , saying , â no wonder millwall got rid of you â

sam has found a fire extinguisher and thrown it through their window
i can still hear sam saying , â oh s * * *
i did nât mean it
â after three good years at coventry , gibson joined united for a difficult 18 months , in which he repeatedly felt â belittled â by atkinson
â you could see the glow of his sunbed from the training pitch , â gibson says
â he just picked on me for reasons i never understood
â at one point , gibson pulled out of a move to watford because he correctly anticipated atkinson would be sacked and a fresh start might await
atkinson âs exit meant alex âs arrival
â alex was always honest with me â a good man , â gibson says
â i got the hairdryer once after a reserve game and told him to shove it all up his a * * *
gibson endured a difficult 18 months at united ( left ) and was brought to wimbledon in 1987 â the next morning i went to apologise and he said he admired my spirit
i liked him but it never worked out for me at united
â gould brought gibson to wimbledon in 1987 â the manager allegedly ate 12 sheep testicles to get sam hammam to sanction the move â and his playing career re-started
â i could have done a book on wimbledon alone , â he says
in retirement gibson went on to form a fine coaching partnership with sanchez at northern ireland , which included capping jonny evans from united after â my son realised from playing championship manager on the computer that he was eligible for us â
gibson has detailed his eclectic career in a book called giant killer , which is available at terrygibson.london in a career of surreal moments , it seems about right
there was also a Â£ 200 - a - week scouting position for manchester city in spanish that saw him recommend zabaleta
â the club did ok out of it , â he says
these days the 52 - year - old commentates on spanish football for sky sports and is happy to be out of the thick of it
â i think i âve had probably enough of that craziness in my life , â he says
