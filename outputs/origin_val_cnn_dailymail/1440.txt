voters called on balls to come clean about labour âs plans for higher taxes yesterday
members of the public rounded on the shadow chancellor on live tv as he suggested britain âs budget deficit could be filled by taxes on the rich â and refused to apologise for the economic crash
mr balls â who will today rule out a rise in vat â was accused of â tinkering round the edges â when he suggested that britain âs problems could be solved by reinstating the 50p tax for top earners and bringing in a mansion tax
he was accused of â tinkering round the edges â after suggested that britain âs problems could be solved by reinstating the 50p tax for top earners but mr balls was forced on to the defensive while taking questions from a studio audience on sky news
one member of the public called on him to apologise for crashing the economy
another called on him to come clean about his plans for the economy , describing his plans for taxes on the rich as â tinkering around the edges â and asking him : â when are you going to do the big stuff ? â and he came under fire over the mansion tax , with voters asking why a tax levied almost exclusively on homes in the south east of england would be used to pay for more nurses in scotland
mr balls will attempt to get on to the front foot today by ruling out a rise in vat if labour seize power in may
members of the public rounded on the shadow chancellor on live tv as he suggested britain âs budget deficit could be filled by taxes on the rich in a speech in birmingham today , mr balls will make a â clear pledge â that labour will not raise vat from its current level of 20 per cent
he will say : â we will not put up vat
and we will not extend it to food , children âs clothes , books , newspapers and public transport fares
â we will not raise vat because it âs the tax that hits everyone
it âs the tax that hits you every day
and it hits pensioners and the poorest hardest
â but labour last night refused to rule out raising other major taxes , such as income tax and national insurance
tory sources said that , with mr balls apparently committed to a further Â£ 30 billion of deficit reduction , further tax rises under labour were inevitable
a party spokesman said : â labour have let the cat out of the bag
balls is confirming his real plan â big hikes in the jobs tax or tax on hard work
â labour have already announced a raft of tax rises , but all but one of these would fund their spending pledges
ed miliband and balls have repeatedly said they will raise taxes
it is time that they came clean with the britain public about which taxes they will raise â income tax or national insurance ? â mr balls refused to apologise for leaving britain with one of the biggest budget deficits in the developed world when it left office
he apologised for labour âs failure to regulate the banks â but said others had also failed to spot the looming dangers
ed miliband ( right ) yesterday all - but guaranteed mr balls ( left ) the chancellor âs job if labour win the election mr balls said : â we should have been tougher ( on the banks )
i âm sorry about that
actually , my opponent osborne continually criticised me because he said i was being too tough on the banks
â he said that labour had started to reduce the deficit when it left office â a claim that is contradicted by the facts
and he said that raising the top rate of tax from 45p to 50p would raise Â£ 3 billion , despite analysis by the treasury and hmrc which suggests it would raise almost nothing
osborne , who was also quizzed by voters on sky news , acknowledged that there was â a lot more work â required to repair britain âs public finances after five years in power
the chancellor also admitted that continuing low interest rates were a problem for savers saying that was the reason he had made a cut in the savings tax the centrepiece of his budget last week
mr osborne was challenged over tory plans to hold an in / out referendum on european , but insisted it was not deterring business investment
â i think we âll achieve that reform , we will get a better deal for britain in european , â he said
â it âs not damaging business now because we are getting more investment in to britain than any other european country
â so businesses are still voting with their jobs and their investment in to the britain
