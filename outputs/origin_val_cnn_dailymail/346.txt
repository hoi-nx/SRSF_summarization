school friends of mr konstandinos erik scurfield say he was always popular in his youth and was n't one to get into fights miss hyman said : ' he was such a people - person and when he went into the forces it was a big surprise
he was n't a fighter
' he did n't get into any fights at school or anything like that
you put people in groups - certain things they might do with their lives and i would never have had him down as becoming a soldier
' she said he also had long hair at school , where he was an extremely popular student and was also very clever - in the top sets for everything
she said he came to royston high , which no longer exists , in his early teens from nottingham and was immediately noticeable because he did not have a barnsley accent and was ' really well - spoken , very polite and very respectful '
she said : ' everybody loved him because he was a real character
he was one of those people who you could n't find anything negative at all to say about him
he was friendly and funny and really laid back
he had such a cheeky smile
miss hyman added : ' we 're trying to organise something so we can all get together and remember him
it 's at the early stages at the moment
it 's a shame we are going to all come together in these circumstances
