a self - styled lord who was released from prison as an â act of mercy â when he convinced judges he was gravely ill is clearly enjoying life as a free man
edward davenport , nicknamed â fast eddie â , was jailed for eight years in 2011 for masterminding a Â£ 4.5million fraud where he hoodwinked the rich and famous
last may he was released early after claiming he was ' at death 's door ' because of kidney problems and suffering the ' ordeal ' of having to leave prison each week for life - saving dialysis
but eight months on socialite edward davenport looks to be close to a full recovery as he had fun with a friend on saturday
new life : eight months after being released from prison on health grounds edward ' fast eddie ' edward davenport is seen here kissing a friend on saturday he was seen kissing and hugging an unnamed woman as they walked through central london
as a property developer and party organiser he made millions and boasted of befriending guests including supermodel kate moss and princes william and harry
his Â£ 30million home , a mansion in london âs west end , was the former sierra leone high commission and was used as a location for the oscar - winning film the king âs speech
but the socialite was ruined when he was exposed as a fraudster who duped victims out of their life savings through bogus start - up loan schemes and jailed - only for his health to falter
last year he was pictured handcuffed to a prison guard in hospital after undergoing a second kidney transplant
he said at the time : â i know i âm fighting a death sentence
â i feel like an old man shuffling around , chained to a prison officer even when i want to go to the bathroom
' i ca nât even wear my own silk pyjamas â i have to wear the hospital ones
the truth is i feel shaky
i know i âm at death âs door '
fall from grace : edward davenport was one of london 's richest and most popular socialites until he was convicted of a multi-million pound fraud and later required a second kidney transplant contrast : a grey - looking edward davenport shortly before he was jailed for almost eight years in 2011 and , right , enjoying the sunshine in central london with a companion over the weekend judges agreed to his plea for clemency and cut his sentence by a year to allow him to be released early after serving around three years
edward davenport 's fall from grace is a far cry from his days at the heart of the london party scene in the 1980s
his black - tie gatecrasher balls , aimed at wealthy public school teenagers , quickly became synonymous with drunkenness and debauchery and helped him make his fortune
but it also led to his first fraud conviction and nine months in jail
despite the setback , edward davenport never lost his love of taking risks â even though it repeatedly landed him in trouble
in 1998 , he and two other men were charged with running up an Â£ 18,000 bill at the luxury gleneagles hotel in scotland during a five - day new year party while posing as aristocrats
they denied the claims and charges were later dropped
a year later , he bought the lease of the sierra leone high commission building in london for just Â£ 50,000 while the country was embroiled in civil war
the property is said to be worth Â£ 30 million and was used to film scenes for the oscar - winning movie the king âs speech
but in may 2011 edward davenport was given eight years for his part in a Â£ 4.5 million fraud
the judge described him as the â ringmaster â who was careful not to leave â footprints in the snow
â recovery : a year ago the fraudster was getting treatment in hospital in south london where he had to be accompanied by prison officers an handcuffed to his chair the con artist , born edward ormus sharington davenport , promised millions of pounds to investors which never materialised after he had pocketed the administration fees and advance payments
princess diana âs wedding dress designer elizabeth emanuel lost the life savings she invested with edward davenport
after his latest conviction a defective kidney failed and meant he needed repeated visits to hospital - where he was handcuffed to his bed while undergoing treatment
last march his sentence was reduced to six years and eight months by judges at london âs criminal appeal court , who said that , although there was nothing wrong with his original punishment , it should be reduced as an act of mercy and meant he could be freed two months later .
