you may have experienced the eye - watering pain of an ingrown toenails , but imagine if you weighed 15,000 lbs ( 7,000 kg )
scientists are working to prevent painful and potentially deadly foot diseases in captive elephants by finding the best way to trim their feet
wild elephants benefit from walking long distances on different surfaces and rubbing their feet in abrasive dirt , but their captive peers can experience problems without these â natural pedicures â
dr olga panagiotopoulou , from the university of queensland âs school of biomedical sciences , is working with collaborators around the world to understand how captivity influences elephant foot form and function , as well as identifying the best method of preventative foot trimming
â elephants are the largest terrestrial mammals alive today and can weigh up to eight tonnes , with their whole body mass supported by their tiny feet , â dr olga panagiotopoulou said

earlier this month , researchers found that elephants excel at identifying explosives by smell , stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives
elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones
three elephants passed smell tests conducted on a game reserve in south africa
sniffing at buckets , they were rewarded with a treat of marula - a tasty fruit - when they showed that they recognised samples of tnt by raising a front leg
the elephants detected tnt samples 73 out of the 74 times that they encountered in a line of buckets , according to ashadee kay miller , a zoology student at the university of the witwatersrand in johannesburg
they only got this wrong 3.6 per cent of the time over 502 buckets that contained the explosive , which was dissolved in acetone on filter paper
in a second set of tests , the elephants scored 100 percent , detecting tnt in 23 out of 23 buckets when â distractor odours â such as tea , bleach , soap and gasoline were placed in the other buckets , she said
it 's been suggested that unmanned drones could collect scent samples from mined areas and bring them to a trained elephant , which would smell them and alert handlers to any sign of explosives
â preliminary data has indicated that foot pressure is more evenly distributed across the sole of the foot when the animals walk on natural grounds , but when they are walking on surfaces such as concrete the pressure is concentrated around parts of the foot that are more prone to disease , such as the lateral toes
â she said that while a range of foot - trimming procedures are followed and typically involve filing the nails and rough skin , none have been tested
elephants ' toenails typically grow between five and seven millimetetres a month
â our research involves testing different techniques to see which one will be most beneficial for the animal , â dr olga panagiotopoulou said
working with zebris biomechanix in germany , she has developed pressure platforms to measure the pressure and forces applied to elephants â feet while they are walking
â the plates were recently transported to the adventures with elephants safari park in south africa to study the foot pressures of elephants kept in semi-wild conditions with natural terrains , â she said
â the elephants were trained to walk over the pressure platforms and the individual footsteps were processed using a state - of - the - art neuroimaging technique called statistical parametric mapping , which , in simple words , gives us a high - resolution image of foot pressure changes over the foot
â we hope to develop smaller versions of these pressure platforms for zoo keepers and managers to use as diagnostic tools
â if a captive elephant walks over a pad and a different digital pressure pattern from normal is seen , this can be investigated further
â dr olga panagiotopoulou said that early diagnosis is important because elephant foot diseases such as osteoarthritis and osteomyelitis are often diagnosed too late for treatment , meaning elephants have to be euthanized
