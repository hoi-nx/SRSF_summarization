khan wants to fight brook within the next year , paving the way for a spectacular return to wembley for britain boxing
as recently as monday khan was talking down the chances of a grudge match between himself and britain âs other leading welterweight , who has spent years calling out khan
but now there appears to be a genuine chance of this fight happening , with khan saying on tuesday that a meeting is inevitable , either at the end of this year or in 2016
after brook 's victory over jo jo dan on saturday , he called out khan in a post-match interview brook demolished jo jo dan in sheffield , beating him in just four rounds to retain his ibf world welterweight title the bargaining tool of brook âs ibf world title remains a draw for the bolton fighter , but a major factor has been the public pressure , which has grown enormously since brook demolished his mandatory challenger jo jo dan on saturday
with that in mind , it remains to be seen how much of what khan is saying is lip service
certainly , brook âs team are waiting for formal talks to start before they get excited about a fight they have long craved and which would surely match carl froch âs 2014 rematch with george groves at wembley
khan said : â i âd love to go in the ring and fight brook
it will happen within the next 12 months but i have already given my word to an opponent and i want to be a man of my word
â after watching his ( brook âs ) last performance , i know i can do a deal , winner takes all
it shows it is not about the money , it is about the pride
it could be his last fight , i would give him that much of a beating
â brook , pictured celebrating his win over jo jo dan on saturday , appears to have got his wish to fight khan khan 's last fight came against devon alexander in december , whom he beat to take his record to 30 - 3 khan has previously refused a fight with brook , but now promises it will take place within 12 months he added : â it âs all about timing : if i âve got a different route and i want to face the likes of the ( floyd ) mayweathers and ( manny ) pacquiaos out there , then brook will have to wait
â khan also tweeted : ' they doing a very good job making the public believe i do n't want the fight , trust me i do ! keep building the hype cause winner takes all ! ' any plans promoter eddie hearn had of staging the fight on june 13 - he has a provisional booking with wembley - are scuppered by khan âs claim to have promised a fight to a different opponent
he is expected to announce his next fight this week
sportsmail understands khan would have made Â£ 4.5million from a june date with brook , but with the rivalry likely to rumble loudly into 2016 he could take up to Â£ 5m
brook âs camp are in talks with mexican legend juan manuel marquez over a summer fight , while wba regular champion keith thurman and brandon rios are also possibilities .
