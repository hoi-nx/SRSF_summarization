in the wake of the washington post 's revelation and coming almost six weeks after dowling 's departure , the white house released a statement on tuesday in which it praised her ' lively and colorful ' creations , which reflected the ' historic rooms which they graced

' within an hour of the first lady 's official confirmation , dowling also felt compelled to release a statement about her sudden departure weeks before

the first lady 's office released a statement on tuesday which praised the work of florist dowling who had unexpectedly departed her post more than a month before ' over the next few weeks and months , i 'll be launching a new platform for my work as an author , speaker , instructor and design consultant that builds on the creative ideas and partnerships i 've formed during my tenure there
' it 's been such an honor to work at the white house and i will always be grateful for this incredible opportunity
' but dowling 's unexpected departure and the sudden release of two statements more than a month later has prompted speculation that all was not well between dowling and the first lady

just days before the florist 's departure , the old family dining room had been re-opened after being refurbished by the first lady to showcase modern art and design , according to the white house website
dowling 's predecessor , nancy clarke , had lasted through six presidential administrations
