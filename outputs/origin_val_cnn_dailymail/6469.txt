england boss hodgson has criticised tottenham , claiming they should not be taking kane on a 21,000 - mile post-season trek to australia if they think he needs a rest
kane gushed with pride on thursday after being rewarded for his fine form with a maiden england call - up
the 21 - year - old is in line to make his international debut against lithuania on march 27 or in italy four days later
kane has been called into the england squad for the first time by hodgson kane is set to play for the under 21 side in summer ' it is an honour to be called up to the senior side , something i always dreamed of as a kid , ' kane told spurs
' i 'm excited , when i got the message i was going to be in i was full of joy and hopefully it is the first of many
' having started the season as spurs ' third - choice striker , few expected kane to score 26 goals for the club
but now he is the club 's poster boy and , for that reason , the north londoners are determined to take him on their post-season jaunt to australia , where they will play sydney fc in a friendly on may 30
hodgson is not so keen on the idea , however
kane will , more than likely , be included in the england under-21 squad for the european championship - which takes place from june 17 to june 30 - as hodgson wants him to experience international tournament football
gareth southgate 's team will play at least one friendly between the end of the season ( may 24 ) and the start of the tournament on june 17
hodgson has noted mauricio pochettino 's concerns about kane 's potential tiredness , but he thinks spurs have a perfect opportunity to rest the striker by leaving him out of the squad for the 42 - hour round trip to australia
' this is a marketing game as far as i can understand , ' the england manager said
' personally speaking , playing for england at under - 21 level at a tournament is more important than a friendly in australia
' i would be very hypocritical if i did n't give that answer
' if he needs a rest , there 's a great opportunity when the season ends before our under - 21s get together to give him a rest
' you ca n't expect me in good faith to say : ' oh no , i understand he should n't be resting for the australia trip , he should be doing that and then resting when the under - 21s pitch up
' i ca n't go along with that
' having represented spurs across four competitions , kane could amass well over 50 appearances for the club before the end of the season
and the argentinian expects the forward to push himself to the extreme to impress hodgson
mauricio pochettino will relay his concerns to hodgson when england train at the club 's enfield base next week in the build - up to the two internationals
' i will see mauricio pochettino , ' hodgson said
' i do n't think it 's a problem there
do n't forget these decisions are sometimes commercial and taken out of a coach 's hands
' mauricio pochettino will take his tottenham side to australia at the end of the season
