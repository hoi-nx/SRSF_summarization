being locked up in prison cuts a person off from every aspect of everyday life , including intimacy with a partner
but if a couple are married , in may countries the inmates are allowed are allowed conjugal visits from their husband or wife
in 2007 , romania changed their penal laws to allow such visits and built bedrooms in their prisons for the liaisons to take place
romania photographer cosmin bumbut has travelled his country taking pictures of conjugal visit rooms in prisons , like this image of iaèi prison , which he took in 2011 romania photographer cosmin bumbut has spent the last few years photographing these rooms at 35 different jails across the country
he has now published the collection of images in a new exhibition called camera intimä ( the intimate room ) , which has been shortlisted for the sony world photography awards in the architecture section
cosmin bumbut told femail that the romania prison system has changed a lot over the last decade
he said : ' once romania joined european union , in 2007 , the prison system was reformed ; the biggest change was to introduce the right to private visits
' aiud , 2008 a woman 's prison in tã¢rgèor , 2011 bistrièa prison , 2011 he continued : ' a prisoner who is married has the right to receive , every three months , a two - hour private visit which takes place in a separate room inside the prison compound
' the project developed by chance while cosmin bumbut was taking photos for a separate collection on prisoners in the romania city of aiud in 2008
he was taking shots of a man and his wife during a conjugal visit and realised that the rooms would make an interesting series on their own
gherla prison , 2011 arad prison , 2013 oradea prison , 2013 cosmin bumbut said : ' in 2008 , i took the first photos inside the intimate room with an inmate and his wife after their private visit
' i realised that these rooms represent the institutionalisation of love , the cancellation of tenderness
' in 2011 , i started photographing the intimate rooms systematically until 2014
' i shot the rooms and some absurd details and also some footage from the point of view of the inmate lying on the bed
' chilia veche prison , 2013 juvenile detention centre in tineri , bacäu , 2011 satu mare prison , 2011 botoèani prison , 2011 cosmin bumbut added that although many prisons have got to the effort of making the rooms appear relatively warm , they are all tinged with sadness
he said : ' in this cold space , with information about stds and safety hung on the walls , two people meet their loved ones , after months of waiting
