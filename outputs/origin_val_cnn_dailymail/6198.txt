convicted terrorists will soon be banned from speaking and writing letters in arabic during visits and phone calls at one of australia 's highest - security prisons
under tough new restrictions , 13 prisoners , who are classified as ' extreme high risk restricted ' at supermax , the compound located within goulburn jail in nsw , will only be allowed to speak english
state attorney general hazzard has called on the laws to take place in a bid to stop radicalisation of muslim inmates from converting other prisoners , sunday telegraph reports
the law pledges to have prison officers strictly monitor conversations between inmates and visitors as well as refuse or terminate visits if arabic or any other languages are used
convicted terrorists will soon be banned from speaking arabic during visits and phone calls at supermax it comes after the australian federal police revealed the terror alert for police had been raised to ' high ' in the wake of terror plotting attacks and anti-terrorism raids across the country
last september , it was revealed that inmates were able to plot acts of terror from behind bars because they were allowed to write letters , make phone calls and have visits
' one of the issues that came out of that process was that some of these people , these high - risk Â­ inmates , were conducting their Â­ discussions in arabic , or at least not english , ' mr hazzard said
but in rare cases , mr hazzard said inmates will be allowed to speak another language when their 90 - year - old grandmother visits for instance but an immediate translator must be supplied
' we do n't want to create a situation where they feel there 's no sense of humanity , because there will be , ' mr hazzard said
' but they have to understand the people they 're visiting have put our community at risk
there has to be some clear boundaries and rules

mohammad kiad , 25 , and omar al-kutobi , 24 , are also behind bars at supermaz after they were both charged with terrorism offences
the initiative was prompted when prison officers started noticing a rise of inmates converting to islam , after switching their diet preferences from western meals to halal , sunday telegraph reports
meanwhile , four ' young , white males ' have lodged an application to have their diets changed at the long bay correctional complex at malabar in sydney on monday
the law pledges to have prison officers monitor conversations strictly between inmates and visitors last september , it was revealed that inmates were able to plot acts of terror from behind bars because they were allowed to write letters , make phone calls and have visits it 's reported that bassam hamzy , who was sentenced to life in jail for a 2002 murder and ran the ' brothers 4 life ' gang , is the first to be banned from speaking arabic
the strict laws follows as prison authorities have banned islam prayer meetings in some of sydney 's jails after intelligence found some key jihadist figures were operating from behind bars
but mr hazzard added that he has called on the department to recruit imams to lead prayer sessions with ' moderation and decency ' as it reveals prayer sessions will now be held in english .
