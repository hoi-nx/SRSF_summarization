everywhere you go on the isle of man , you 'll see isle of man flags - three conjoined white legs on a red background
for the isle of man , the triskelion is a powerful symbol of independent spirit and endurance , the motto being : ' whichever way you throw , it will stand
' lately , it 's become a symbol for me too , of three islands
there 's the island i 've called home for the past 11 years , the island i write about in my novels , and somewhere in between , perhaps , a deeper truth about this beautiful rock in the middle of the irish sea
independent spirit : the harbour at ramsey , the isle of man 's second biggest town legend : a carving of the sea god manannan can a place with a reputation for being safe and sleepy really also be home to spies , killers and evil spirits that feature in my books ? i like to think so , and here are a few reasons why
the weather might be mixed but the landscape is dramatic , whether seen from the sea , walking the coast path , or taking the electric railway to the top of the island 's solitary mountain , snaefell ( from where , on a clear day , you can see the distant humped blurs of scotland , england , ireland and wales )
the rich variety of locations is something i 've grown to appreciate in my books , and something the isle of man film industry has thrived on during the past decade
need a spooky cottage ? the island has plenty
the same goes for lush glens and lonely coves
but the island provides more than great backdrops
it 's compact , with a population in the region of 85,000 , and while that makes it ideally manageable for a weekend visit , it also fosters something all writers rely on - rumours and hearsay
my first isle of man - set thriller , safe house , grew out of a rumour i heard almost as soon as i moved here - namely , that it 's used as a place to relocate people enrolled in uk witness protection schemes
is the rumour true ? i do n't know for certain , but it seems credible to me
the island is isolated and has lots of out - of - the - way spots
the isle of man also its own very distinct identity
where else could the population swell for a fortnight every june in celebration of a controversial motorbike festival that pits man against machine over a course run on almost 38 miles of public roads ? the isle of man is isolated , with some out of the way spots , lush glens and lonely coves racing glory : every summer the island hosts the world - famous tourist trophy races , with motorbikes reaching 200mph the tourist trophy ( tourist trophy ) races have been in existence since 1907 , with recent competitors recording top speeds of 200mph
but while most islanders are proud of the long tradition of racing greats who have tamed the course , the event is not without its critics
like many others , i find it hard to reconcile the number of fatalities that have occurred with the racing glory , but i ca n't fail to admire how brave the riders must be
another local oddity is hop - tunaa - the isle of man 's version of halloween
taking place every october 31 , it shares many similarities with halloween , but is still marked by some unique isle of man twists
for example , hop - tu - naa traditionalists carve lanterns from turnips instead of pumpkins , and children call from door - to - door singing nonsense songs instead of trick - or - treating
in fact , one of the songs was striking enough to become the basis for my new thriller , dark tides
it 's a short step from rumours and hearsay to myths and legends , and the isle of man has some of the most interesting i 've ever heard : from the sea god , manannan , who cloaks the isle in a veil of mist to protect it from outside threats , to the moddey dhoo , a big black hound that haunts peel castle
