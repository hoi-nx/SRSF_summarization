carragher would not select club captain steven gerrard for liverpool 's top - four showdown with manchester united at anfield next sunday
while gary neville says angel di maria , available again after serving a one - match suspension , should return to louis van gaal 's side in favour in juan mata despite manchester united 's convincing win against tottenham at the weekend
steven gerrard made his first appearance for brendan rodgers ' side since early february when he came on as a second - half substitute against swansea on monday
steven gerrard returned to the liverpool team as a second - half substitute against swansea on monday former defender carragher says steven gerrard should not start against manchester united on sunday liverpool remained unbeaten during steven gerrard 's recent injury lay - off carragher says he will have to settle for a place on the bench and sportsmail columnist carragher would not bring the captain back into the starting xi for the crucial clash at anfield ' no i would n't , ' carragher said on sky sports ' monday night football show
' the team is playing well
they 're on a great run since steven gerrard 's been out the team
' unfortunately , and he 'll know himself , when you go out the team and they continue on a great run it 's hard to get back in
' it 's unfortunate for him but we 've all been there towards the end of our careers
there are players playing too well that you ca n't leave them out
' carragher says that jordan henderson and joe allen can not be dropped from the team carragher would also play raheem sterling up front , like he did during the win against man city sportsmail columnist carragher would sacrifice daniel sturridge because he is not back to his best yet carragher also thinks brendan rodgers should sacrifice daniel sturridge and move raheem sterling up front , adopting a similar style to in the man city game , which liverpool won 2 - 1 earlier this month
' the problem you have with daniel sturridge is , he is your best striker and you want him in your team , but he 's not quite right yet
he 's not quite 100 per cent
' he 's not actually producing and these games are becoming vital
but you need to play him to get back to his level
gary neville says he would select angel di maria after serving his one - match suspension gary neville would drop juan mata for di maria because the argentine 's pace could be key against liverpool former manchester united defender gary neville would make di maria for juan mata the only change to the side that beat tottenham ' but i go back to that man city game and that may come into brendan rodgers ' thinking
that was liverpool at their best , that high intensity and that pressing
that 's what you get from raheem sterling at the front that maybe you lack with daniel sturridge
' meanwhile , former manchester united defender gary neville believes angel di maria 's pace could prove vital against liverpool and says he would bring the argentine in to replace juan mata
' i think nine of them are absolute certainties , rest - aside injuries that could happen in training , ' gary neville said
' i think valencia , chris smalling , phil jones , marouane fellaini , michael carrick , ander herrera , ashley young and wayne rooney will all play
' the big decision is di maria or juan mata
i would go with di maria for pace
i think they will need to play on the counter attack and also match the speed of moreno and philippe coutinho ( on the liverpool left )
