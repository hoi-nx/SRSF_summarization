it has a starring role in the classic movie the italian job â in one of the most memorable opening sequences in cinema history
a stunning orange supercar races through the alps , before disappearing into a tunnel
then , in a heartbreaking moment for car fans , the lamborghini crashes in a ball of flames
the smashed up wreckage is dragged out of the tunnel by the mafia and pushed into a ravine by a bulldozer â followed by a wreath for the driver
the millions who have seen the iconic film since it was made in 1969 must have assumed the car was an irrecoverable write - off , never to be driven again
pictured : joint owner tyrrell but now the mail on sunday can reveal the car seen powering through the alps has been found in pristine condition â and is worth more than Â£ 1 million
described as â the holy grail of supercars â , it has been tracked down by two british businessman
the car âs new co-owner , tyrrell , received a tip - off at christmas that the lamborghini miura had resurfaced
he said : â i was initially sceptical because no one had seen it for 46 years
but my source was a credible one so i started to pursue it
â he was invited to see it â but given just three hours to verify the vehicle as the genuine article
â it was all very james bond - ish â i had to go to paris to inspect the car in a secret underground car park , â he said
mr tyrrell learned that the thrilling sequence that opens the italian job was shot using two cars â both supplied by lamborghini , but one of them was already smashed up
it is the first , intact , car that has now been found
mr tyrrell said : â lamborghini is the holy grail of supercars precisely because no one knew what happened to it after the film
i have a life - long passion for these cars but i just assumed this particular vehicle was out of reach
â as the lamborghini miura is still in near - mint condition , mr tyrrell â who owns cheshire classic cars â was able to cross-reference its original features with stills from the film
he has also checked the car âs history at the lamborghini archive
he said : â after inspecting the car , there is no doubt in my mind that it is the lamborghini miura from the italian job
top gear magazine named the lamborghini , featured in the opening sequence of the italian job , the coolest car in the world in the 1969 iconic film the stunning orange supercar races through the alps , before disappearing into a tunnel the lamborghini crashes in a ball of flames and is then dragged out of the tunnel by the mafia before being pushed into a ravine by a bulldozer the opening sequence of the film was shot using two cars , but one was already smashed up â there are certain quirks within the interior of the car , such as the trim and the stitching
they are like a fingerprint or a birth mark
they ca nât be replaced
â research has uncovered that the filmmakers , paramount , hired the car from lamborghini and after filming it was sold to a dealer
michael caine and maggie blye in the movie the dealer then sold the lamborghini miura to an unidentified buyer
in 2005 , after it had changed hands a few times , ferretti , a luxury yacht manufacturer , bought it
this transaction brought a remarkable coincidence to the saga â as mr ferretti was the son of the dealer who originally bought it from lamborghini after the italian job
incredibly , it seems that both he and its previous owners had been completely unaware of its role in the movie
mr tyrrell and his friend and co-owner , keith ashworth , now plan to display the lamborghini around the world , although they have not ruled out selling it on
the car âs value is likely to increase substantially in the light of its history
but the lamborghini miura mystery has not been entirely solved
the smashed - up lamborghini , vanished without trace after it disappeared down the mountainside
mr tyrrell said : â when the production team went back to salvage the remains of the crashed car the next day it had gone
the whole car had disappeared and had obviously been stolen
â built between 1966 and 1973 , the 170mph lamborghini miura is widely credited with kick - starting the trend for high performance two - seater sports cars
in 2004 , top gear magazine voted it the coolest car in the world .
