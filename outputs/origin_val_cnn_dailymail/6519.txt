prosecutors in south africa want pistorius convicted of murder for shooting his girlfriend multiple times in a bathroom in his home on valentine 's day in 2013
labour shadow minister liz kendal said david cameron should sack mr peers in december , judge masipa granted prosecutors permission to take the case to south africa 's supreme court of appeal and challenge her own ruling to acquit pistorius of murder and find him guilty instead of a lesser charge comparable to manslaughter
pistorius 's lawyers had argued that the judge should not have allowed that appeal
the olympian and multiple paralympic champion is currently serving a five - year prison sentence for culpable homicide , or negligent killing
the 28 - year - old could be eligible for release from the jail in the capital , pretoria , in august to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest
if prosecutors succeed in their appeal against the culpable homicide conviction in the supreme court of appeal and have it upgraded to murder , pistorius would face a minimum of 15 years in jail
judge masipa , who presided over pistorius 's seven - month murder trial and the start of the appeal process by prosecutors , made her latest ruling after a short court session in johannesburg
pistorius 's trial now looks set to be reviewed by a panel of judges at the supreme court of appeal , which sits in the central city of bloemfontein
no date has been given for that appeal but cases can sometimes take two years to reach the court , legal experts have said .
