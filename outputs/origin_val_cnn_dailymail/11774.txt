uk is a nation of soap lovers , but it âs not just us humans that like to watch some on - screen drama
apparently dogs â well a particular shetland sheepdog â just can not get enough of popular soap opera eastenders
videoed lying on the sitting room floor , the dog named alfie initially appears to be content minding its own business
suddenly , graham broad âs iconic drum roll that features at the start of the famous eastenders theme tune is audible from the television , and the dog turns towards it in anticipation
as the melody picks up , the dog , which is now staring intently at the screen , lifts its head back and lets out a little howl
at first it appears to be like any other dog singing along to a particular tune of their choosing
the shetland sheepdog named alfie initially appears to be content minding its own business but it âs only as the song continues that the dog âs musical prowess is shown off in all its glory
howling in a relatively controlled manner , alfie actually appears to mimic the exact notes present in the song
and better still the dog does n't just howl over the top of the melody , but instead stops in time for the breaks within the composition
the dog listens to the sound of graham broad âs iconic drum roll that features at the start of the eastenders theme tune the video was captured by the dog 's owners at home in whitehall , london
composed in 1984 , the eastenders theme tune is the work of simon may and leslie osborne
the theme tune was cited as the most recognisable piece of music in the uk in a 2008 poll conducted by prs for music , seeing off competition from the english national anthem
alfie appears to mimic the exact notes present in the song and even pauses for the breaks
