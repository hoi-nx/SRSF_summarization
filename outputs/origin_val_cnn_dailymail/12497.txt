as cheap oil and western sanctions continue to batter russia 's economy , president putin slashed kremlin salaries -- including his own -- by 10 % friday , according to state news service tass
government documents released in 2014 put putin 's annual salary at nearly 3.7 million rubles -- worth about $ 61,000 today thanks to soaring inflation
putin 's ruble reduction for his top ministers comes some two months after he canceled their holiday vacations , citing the same economic woes
" the government and its various structures can not afford such extensive holidays , at least not this year , " putin told government ministers at the time
" you know what i am talking about
" but it was n't just top cabinet members that would feel the pinch
" president putin also reduced the wages of kremlin administration , government staff and the chamber of accounts by 10 % as well , " according to tass .
