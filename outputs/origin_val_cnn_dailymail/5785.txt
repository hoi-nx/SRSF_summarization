a spectator has been killed during a horror crash at the infamous nurburgring circuit in germany after a british racing driver 's car flipped over the safety barrier and into the crowd
driver jann mardenborough was cresting a hill in the northern part of the track when the car flipped upright , travelling 100ft before slamming into a barrier , sending it spinning into the air

as of 2010 a total of 68 professional drivers had been recorded as killed on the track , with many more dying on popular open days during which members of the public are invited to drive the circuit

the track also has several sections in which spectators are allowed close to the track
despite this , accidents involving fans are rare , though exact figures are not widely available
