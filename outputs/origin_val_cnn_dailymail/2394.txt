' the controversial decision came after jurors deliberated for five days over the 2008 murder which arias was found guilty of in 2013
arias , a 34 - year - old former waitress from salinas , california , was found guilty of the murder in 2013 , but jurors at the original trial deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty
prosecutors accuse arias of murdering her ex-partner , travis alexander , in a jealous rage , but she says she acted in self - defense
alexander , 30 , was found dead in a shower at his phoenix - area home
he had been stabbed multiple times , his throat was cut almost from ear to ear , and he had been shot in the face
in closing statements , defense attorney nurmi called for arias ' life to be spared , describing her as a remorseful and mentally ill woman who had been abused since childhood
prosecutor martinez accused arias of acting in a cold and calculating way and said there were no factors preventing the jury from giving her the death penalty
on tuesday , the jury of eight women and four men were told by maricopa county superior court judge sherry stephens to try harder to come to a decision , after apparently deadlocking
arias decided not to plead her case directly to the jury at the end of the sentencing retrial after sherry stephens denied the defendant 's request that the courtroom be closed to the public and media during her comments
the original trial in 2013 was broadcast live and drew a large audience with its gruesome crime scene photographs and sexually explicit testimony

defense attorney nurmi said in court that jurors were at an impasse , though the judge and prosecutor martinez never confirmed that in open court
jurors posed two questions to sherry stephens , who did n't reveal details
the judge and lawyers held closed - door discussions shortly before jurors were brought into the courtroom
sherry stephens told them that she did n't intend to force a verdict and said in her instructions that jurors should n't weigh evidence based on the views of other jurors
if the current jury ca n't decide on a sentence , the death penalty would be removed as an option and the judge would decide if arias serves life in prison or gets a chance for release after 25 years
last week , nurmi pleaded arias ' life , saying she was physically and emotionally abused as a child and by former boyfriend alexander
a judge declared a mistrial thursday in the travis alexander sentencing case after a jury deadlocked on whether the convicted murderer should be executed or sent to prison for life for killing her lover in 2008
tragedy : arias ' 2013 trial became a sensation with its tawdry revelations about her relationship with alexander and that she shot him in the head and slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated arias stabbed alexander 30 times , nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead alexander 's body was found in the shower of his phoenix home by his friends five days later nurmi said alexander was a conflicted mormon , who used arias to satisfy his sexual desires and called her ' soulless '
' those words have impact and they got to her , ' nurmi said
arias cried as prosecutor martinez displayed gruesome autopsy photographs of alexander on a large screen during his closing argument
martinez described arias as a liar who was trying to trick the jury into believing she was the victim
he then pointed to the photograph of alexander 's decomposed body , covered in stab wounds , his throat cut and a gunshot wound to the forehead
' that 's what she wants you to believe , ' he said
' but actually , in reality , it 's this
' alexander 's family and friends sobbed in the courtroom as the gruesome photographs were displayed
so concluded the five - month sentencing phase that was much quieter than the 2013 murder trial that made arias a cable television and tabloid sensation .
