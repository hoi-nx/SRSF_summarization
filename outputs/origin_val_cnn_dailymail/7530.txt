he is now suing the 30 - year - old billionaire , who lives in his adjacent mansion with his wife , zuckerberg , based on allegations including fraud and misrepresentation
and in new court papers , voskerician 's realtor openly mocks the facebook founder , who her refers to as ' just a kid

in the letter , voskerician apparently told the tech executive , who is worth an estimated $ 33billion , that the mansion would have a direct view of his home , including his ' yard and master bedroom '
if ' zuckerberg plans to live there long term , he has ' one shot to ensure his privacy is where it needs to be , ' the developer wrote in an email to once of zuckerberg 's people , according to bloomberg
however , he then made zuckerberg an unusual offer
deeming himself a ' good neighbor ' , he proposed to sell a slice of the property at ' 100 per cent premium ' to grant him more privacy
two weeks later , the pair came to the agreement that zucerkberg would buy voskerician 's contractual rights to the entire house for $ 1.7million , which the latter described as a ' steep discount '
billionaire 's mansion : in the letter , voskerician apparently told the tech executive , who is worth an estimated $ 33billion , that the mansion would have a direct view of his home ( pictured ) , including his ' master bedroom ' disputed properly : if ' zuckerberg plans to live there long term , he has ' one shot to ensure his privacy is where it needs to be , ' the developer told zuckerberg 's people

' second , i wanted to meet and shake hands for the transaction and discuss your offering of working with you in the future as you stated you have built facebook on connections that you have with others in silicon valley
' he also told zuckerberg one of the reasons he sold him the house , aside from privacy , was ' your offering to help me get my homes , development projects , in front of your facebook employees '
voskerician says that although both he and zuckerberg agreed on the deal , nothing was put into writing
however , the facebook founder 's lawyers have strongly denied the claims
email exchanges suggest that zuckerberg and his inner circle had no intention of helping voskerician in anything other than a ' light ' way
but the developer 's lawyer has disputed this
unless both parties reach a deal , the case will go to trial
if voskerician wins , he may be awarded back the property , situated in hamilton avenue in the once - ordinary california area
