germanwings co-pilot lubitz was hiding an illness from his employers and had been declared " unfit to work " by a doctor , according to german authorities investigating what could have prompted the seemingly competent and stable pilot to steer his jetliner into a france mountain
investigators found a letter in the waste bin of his dusseldorf , german , apartment saying that lubitz , 27 , was n't fit to do his job , city prosecutor kumpa said friday
the note , kumpa said , had been " slashed
" just what was ailing lubitz has n't been revealed
the new york times and the wall street journal , citing unnamed sources , reported friday that lubitz suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer
a dusseldorf clinic said he 'd gone there twice , most recently 17 days ago , " concerning a diagnosis
" but the university clinic said it had not treated lubitz for depression
german investigators said they still have interviews and other work to do before they 'll be able to reveal just what they found in the records in lubitz 's apartment in a quiet , suburban neighborhood
they found no goodbye note or confession , authorities said
but the fact that investigators found " ripped , recent medical leave notes , including for the day of the offense , leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment , " prosecutors said
authorities left lubitz 's apartment friday night with boxes of papers and evidence folders after spending about 90 minutes inside
according to authorities in german and france , lubitz was a co-pilot on germanwings flight 9525 between barcelona , spain , and dusseldorf on tuesday when he apparently locked the captain out of the cockpit , then activated a control causing the plane to descend toward rugged terrain
germanwings said the plane dropped for about eight minutes from its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet before crashing
the only sounds , authorities said , were those of pounding on the cockpit door , lubitz 's steady breathing and , eventually , screaming passengers
an 8 - minute descent to death lubitz and 149 other people on board the plane died in an instant , authorities say
mother , daughter among 3 american victims what could have prompted lubitz to deliberately destroy the aircraft , killing everyone on board , remained the focus of investigators in german
officials said lubitz was not known to be on any terrorism list , and his religion was not immediately known
he had passed medical and psychological testing when he was hired in 2013 , said carsten spohr , ceo of lufthansa , which owns germanwings
while the ailment lubitz had sought treatment for has n't been revealed , that he was declared unfit for work is an important detail , aviation analysts say
pilots are required to maintain their fitness to fly and must tell their airline if they 're found unfit , cnn aviation analyst david soucie said
reuters reported that a german newspaper said lubitz had been treated for depression about six years ago
citing internal documents forwarded by lufthansa to german authorities , bild reported that lubitz had suffered a " serious depressive episode " around the time he took a break from his pilot training in 2009 , reuters reported
the bild report said he then spent about 18 months getting psychiatric treatment
lufthansa officials and german prosecutors declined to comment on the bild story , reuters said
who was co-pilot lubitz ? although authorities have recovered the cockpit voice recorder , the flight data recorder remains missing
it could shed crucial details about what happened inside the cockpit , authorities say
rescuers have found bodies at the rugged crash site , but few of them are intact , naffrechoux , captain of rescue operations at seyne-les-alpes , told cnn
dangerous and windy condition at the remote site , which covers more than a square mile , are hampering efforts to recover bodies and evidence , he said
officials with experience traversing the french alps are helping technicians who do n't have alpine skills , he said
" since they do n't know the mountains , you need to provide them with equipment , you need to hold them with rope , give them crampons so they can work well and as precisely as possible , so that no evidence , no body part could escape their vigilance , " naffrechoux said
workers are now looking into the possibility of building a road to the site , naffrechoux said
recovery teams have made good progress , a france senior paramilitary police official told cnn
gendarmerie lt. col. bloy , who is coordinating the helicopter operations for the crash site , said there will be two aircraft deployed over the scene saturday
there were five on friday , bloy said
as that difficult work continued , relatives and friends of the victims traveled on lufthansa flights to an area near the site where their loved ones perished
they held prayers in le vernet , near seyne-les-alpes , a village serving as a staging post for the recovery operation
flowers and pictures sat on the ground , candles flickering in the cold air
germanwings said it was setting up a family assistance center in marseille , france , with family briefings to start saturday
another flight carrying victims ' relatives was due to arrive in marseille from barcelona on friday
" our focus in these darkest hours is to provide psychological assistance to the families and friends of the victims , " said thomas winkelmann , a spokesman for the germanwings executive board
it could be weeks before all the bodies are recovered , identified and released to the families , authorities said
meanwhile , the european aviation safety agency issued a temporary recommendation that cockpits always be staffed by at least two crew members
" while we are still mourning the victims , all our efforts focus on improving the safety and security of passengers and crews , " the agency 's director , patrick ky , said in a statement
lufthansa and other german airlines have already adopted the rule , the airline said
an official with the german aviation association told cnn that it was only a matter of hours , or a day at most , for this rule to be implemented across all big german airlines
a pilot aboard a germanwings flight friday morning spoke out at the beginning of the trip to " reassure passengers that there will be two people present in the cockpit at all times
" lufthansa will now keep two crew members in cockpits cnn 's catherine e. shoichet , greg botelho , claudia rebaza , frederik pleitgen , nic robertson , margot haddad , stephanie halasz , khushbu shah , bharati naik , ingrid formanek , sandrine amiel , rosie tomkins , will ripley and anna maja rappard contributed to this report .
