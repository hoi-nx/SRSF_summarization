villa supporter mark villers needed his hair cut and wound glued together on saturday night mark villers , 20 , shows his blood - stained trainers after being hit by a seat during the midlands derby at villa park â it was mental , â said mark villers , 20 , who attended the game with two friends
â we could see them throwing down the chairs after we scored the second so we walked down to by the advertising boards
we did nât think they âd be able to reach
â all of a sudden , everyone shouted , â duck â and stupidly i turned around
it literally hit me bang on the forehad , head on
â it was a shock but i did nât think anything of it
then i felt the blood pouring down my face
i âve never bled that much
it was pouring out all over my clothes
it was a bad cut
â the pain was nât that bad , it was the shock of seeing blood come down my face
i knew it had hit me quite hard but i did nât think it would cut me
it must have been caught by the sharp bit
â there were quite a lot of seats
after we scored the second goal things started flying down
to guess at the end it must have been 20 or 25
one landed on the pitch
mark villers claims that baggies supporters threw chairs at villa supporters during the fa cup tie the fan 's jeans and shoes were seen to be covered in claret after the trouble â i did nât need to go to hospital
i went to the stewards and they ushered me down the tunnel where the paramedics were
they held the tissue on and then the villa doctor came , took me into the medical room , and glued it up for me
â he had to cut my hair unfortunately so i âve got a bit of a bald patch
he cleaned me up and sent me on my way
â at least i got to go down the tunnel ! i was sat down on a stretcher and saw jack grealish come through after he got sent off
then i saw everyone going mad with the pitch invasion
â the pitch invasion is bad but i do nât think it âs as bad as people throwing chairs
