end in sight : windslowe , 45 , finished testifying friday in her buttocks - injection murder a transgender hip - hop artist finished testifying friday in her buttocks - injection murder trial but not before she asked to say something more to the jury
padge-victoria windslowe looked dejected when her lawyer quickly shut down her request
' i wanted to say something from my heart , ' windslowe grumbled
the 45 - year - old windslowe testified for two and a half days about the 2011 death of a london dancer she injected with silicone at an airport hotel
â my client 's not a murderer , â defense lawyer david rudenstein said in closing arguments friday
â it 's clear she gave butt injections to people
that does n't make her guilty of third - degree murder or aggravated assault
â big - city doctors at the time were only first seeing patients injured by black - market silicone injections , but windslowe had experienced only good results , he said
and he urged jurors to avoid bias about his client 's lifestyle , which included her turn as â the black madam â running an escort service ; as a dominatrix in slickly - produced music videos ; and as the faux surgeon â lillian â catering to strippers and fellow transgender women
â the case is not about lifestyle , about whether you ... personally disliked the defendant , â david rudenstein said
â the people who saw my client came from a certain walk ( of life )
they were n't going to a medical office
they were going to a hotel room
they were all kind of in it ( together )
â prosecutors were set to give their closing arguments later on friday
it is not clear if the six - man , six - woman jury will begin deliberations before the weekend
windslowe complained of chest pains at the courthouse monday as she prepared to return to the witness stand
she was released late wednesday and back in custody at a philadelphia prison where she has been held since her arrest in 2012
on trial : windslowe ( left ) , 45 , has been charged with killing 20 - year - old london dancer claudia aderotimi ( right ) the defendants proved to be a riveting witness during three days on the stand , claiming in her many colorful tangents that she crossed paths with rappers kanye west and nicki minaj , model rose and ed rendell , the former pennsylvania governor and ex-mayor of philadelphia
windslowe bragged that clients , among them celebrities , chose her to perform silicone buttocks injections over licensed surgeons because of her deft work
but authorities believe windslowe caused the death of claudia aderotimi in 2011 and injured several other women through shoddy silicone injections
she clashed with assistant district attorney carlos vega who questioned why people like rose and her friends would choose an unlicensed practitioner over a los angeles plastic surgeon
' i was the best , and i do n't mean that to be cocky , ' windslowe said in earlier testimony
windslowe said she learned the lucrative buttocks injection business from doctors in thailand and ecuador â vaguely referred to as dr. morales , dr. chimchoke and dr. vu â who performed her sex - change surgeries
she said she has since performed thousands of the procedures on devoted clients including rappers , strippers and women in customer - service jobs , earning the name ' the michelangelo of buttocks injections
' on the stand friday , windslowe denied that she was on the run in the 18 months following claudia aderotimi 's death , when windslowe acknowledged that she changed addresses at least five times
tragic death : claudia aderotimi died in 2011 after she was injected with low - grade silicone , which spread to the woman 's lungs , liver and brain she said she believed that investigators were still trying to find out why the woman died , given that so many of her other clients , she said , had no problems with the injections
' if you wanted me , you would have come and got me , ' windslowe said
claudia aderotimi died after she was injected with low - grade silicone at philadelphia airport hotel
doctors have told jurors during the two - week trial that the syringe hit a vein and sent silicone to the woman 's lungs , liver and brain
two other women testified they spent months in the hospital with similar injuries after visits with windslowe , including 23 - year - old stripper sherkeeia king , who received an injection on a dining room table at a ' pumping party ' that sent her to the hospital vomiting blood
windslowe faces 20 to 40 years in prison if convicted of third - degree murder in claudia aderotimi 's death , and potentially more time for aggravated assault and practicing medicine without a license
seedy side buisness : windslowe said her nickname ' black madam ' came from years spent running an escort service employing male , female and transgender sex workers big business : although she was unlicensed , windslowe charged about $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 per session depending on the amount of silicone requested she said she started doing body sculpting two decades ago to help transgender friends
transgender women often want to plump up an indent in the side of the buttocks they call ' the boy pocket , ' she said
windslowe charged about $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 per session depending on the amount of silicone requested
some clients , including a pole dancer she discussed last friday , saw her a half - dozen times .
