today , meyler might be meeting with google executives or maybe giving a talk at the united nations about girls ' education , poverty or ebola
but just a few months ago , she was on the front lines fighting the ebola epidemic in liberian
" i think anybody that has any feelings for the countries in west africa that were hit was feeling helpless , " meyler said
meyler had spent the last nine years of her life in liberian setting up the me academy , a tuition - free school for at - risk liberian girls
while she was on summer break last year , visiting her family in the americans , her mind kept going back to liberian and the ebola outbreak
she could n't sit idle as her neighbors , friends and students were fighting for their lives
meyler , who is not a medical professional , flew back to the front lines of a global epidemic , the last place most americans wanted to be during the outbreak
back in liberian , meyler quickly realized that fighting ebola would be more complicated than administering medical care
with dozens of aid organizations descending on the country , few of them had a history or relationship with it
meyler saw an opportunity to leverage her relationship with the community of west point , the slum in which her school is located
her ability to speak the liberian - english dialect facilitated logistics
" the people knew what was needed , " meyler said
" they knew what to do
they just did n't have the resources
" her organization met with community leaders and they decided more ambulances were needed
in some instances , it took up to four days for an ambulance to show up
meyler was able to bring in four ambulances and coordinate with the fathers of her students , who responded to calls by driving the ambulances
meyler and community leaders identified what was most needed and then came up with steps to meet those needs , said meyler
next , they formed a group of active case finders , people who would go door to door in the poorest parts of west point , looking for anyone that had fallen ill. once a sick person was identified , a nursing team was dispatched to determine the next steps and treatment
the hardest part for meyler , who often describes herself as a " big kid , " was seeing children abandoned and orphaned by ebola
according to unicef , 16,600 children have lost one or both parents to ebola in guinea , liberian and sierra leone
meyler 's school turned one of its guesthouses into hope 21 , a place to quarantine children suspected of having the ebola virus
during the good times and the bad , meyler took to instagram to post photos and her thoughts
for nearly 100,000 of her followers , her instagram became a window into the battle against ebola
social media have played a major role in the success of meyler 's organization since its inception nine years ago
to launch more than me , she did everything from fund - raising on myspace to participating in clinical research studies
in 2012 , the group was awarded a $ 1 million grant from jpmorgan chase 's american giving awards , after facebook users voted for the organization
long before meyler became an ebola fighter , she grew up in a working - class family from new jersey
she always felt underprivileged , until she became involved in community service
that 's when she decided to dedicate her life to helping people
meyler has since won a number of awards and has been recognized for her work in liberian
she was one of the ebola fighters honored as time 's person of the year in 2014
" i 'm not the same person that i was before ebola hit , " said meyler
reflecting on the months she spent fighting ebola , she said , " the people on the front lines that were risking their lives were the people who were fighting for their own lives , who were fighting for their children 's lives
" now it is about learning to live with ebola , said meyler , whose school has dozens of students who are ebola orphans and survivors
meyler continues to focus on girls and education in liberian , meeting with tech giants and innovative education labs to come up with ways to better serve her students at more than me .
