daniel kapp , 46 , was diagnosed with prostate cancer last month and used the web to learn more about the illness
but when he opened facebook the following day he said he was ' bombarded ' with ' insensitive and tasteless ' adverts for funeral directors
the consultant also tweeted about his surprise ( shown ) the adverts included promotions for funeral directors , including one called bestattung himmelblau wien - which translates to funeral vienna sky blue
it showed an elderly couple with the tagline : ' wir helfen ihnen gerne ! ' or ' we 're here to help
' mr daniel kapp ( pictured ) is a strategic consultant in austria
he described the facebook adverts as ' scandalous ' ' i was just knocked off my feet to see that there on the screen , ' said mr daniel kapp , who works as a strategic consultant in austria
' it is just completely insensitive
and every time i tried to delete it , it appeared again
' he blamed facebook for monitoring the data about the searches he had done and then using it in order to sell it on to potential advertisers
the consultant also tweeted about his surprise : ' after going public on having cancer via fb i 've started getting sponsored ads for funeral parlours # wtf # epicfail [ sic ] ' ' i think it 's just tasteless and scandalous , ' mr daniel kapp continued
' but it seems that anyone who is looking for information under the string search ' life expectancy ' or ' cancer ' on google can then expect to get inappropriate adverts on social networks
' when contacted by local media , the directors of the funeral companies said they were shocked their adverts were being used to target people in this way
one said : ' i can confirm that this should never have happened
