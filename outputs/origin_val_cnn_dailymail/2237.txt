cameron , hague and michael gove were left humiliated last night after commons speaker bercow survived an attempted tory coup
the conservatives used the last day of parliament to lead a so - called ' payback plot ' on the controversial figure
but the move was defeated by 228 votes to 202 yesterday and an emotional mr bercow appeared close to tears as he announced the result
the prime minister and his senior colleagues immediately faced criticism over the ' grubby ' plot â in which they wanted to change the rules to make it easier to remove a speaker from parliament
as the speaker glared at the government front bench following the ambush yesterday , labour mps ignored commons protocol by leaping to their feet and cheering the result
one of mr bercow 's few friends on the conservative benches , walker , wept as he gave a speech in support of the speaker
senior tory said the debacle meant mr michael gove was certain to be moved as chief whip after the election
he is being tipped as a potential party chairman
mr hague , the leader of the commons , was accused of damaging his reputation with what labour called a ' grubby ' and ' squalid ' attempt to ambush the speaker on his final day in parliament
the prime minister , who raced back from an election campaign visit to take part in the vote , also faced criticism from opponents
mr cameron , who has a personal feud with mr bercow and referred to him as a ' dwarf ' in a speech in 2010 , was heard declaring as he strode into the commons : ' i would n't miss this for the world ! ' however , some of the speaker 's friends conceded it was clear that parliament is bitterly divided over his stewardship
they say he may now need to signal his intention to stand down within the next two years
former conservative vice chairman michael fabricant , a critic of the speaker , said : ' the question now being asked by labour mps is will bercow survive the confidence vote on the first day after general election ? ' unpopular with senior tory and lib dem ministers because of his intemperate outbursts , critics wanted to replace mr bercow with deputy speaker lindsay hoyle or the dup 's nigel dodds immediately after the election
commons leader hague today defended the move which labour branded ' petty and spiteful ' the coalition parties wanted to change the rules so that mps who vote to remove a speaker can do so in a secret ballot
that way critics could try to oust him without fear of reprisal if he survived , making his removal far more likely
the sway of a speaker over an mp 's career is such that few are ever prepared to make public criticisms
the rule change would also have brought the parliamentary practice of secret ballots in line with elections for the chairmen of commons committees and those for a new speaker
labour sources revealed last night how mr bercow gave them extra time to draft mps back to parliament in sufficient numbers to save him
with labour having already let many of its mps leave parliament early to take part in election campaigning , it initially appeared the government would pass the reform with ease
cameron was all smiles as he visited a factory with boris johnson this morning , but in the commons his attempt to ambush mr bercow dramatically back fired but mr bercow 's decision to allow three separate urgent questions gave the opposition crucial hours to haul mps back to the commons
some 23 tory also voted against the government â saving mr bercow 's skin â including 1922 committee chairman graham brady , former leadership contender david davis and former frontbenchers bernard jenkin , cheryl gillan and sir edward leigh
the intervention of mr walker , the conservative chairman of the commons procedure committee , appeared to help swing the vote
he was in tears as he told the commons he had been ' played as a fool ' by mr hague and mr michael gove , who had failed to tell him that they planned to spring the move
' i have been played as a fool and when i go home tonight i will look in the mirror and see an honourable fool looking back at me and i would much rather be an honourable fool in this and any other matter than a clever man , ' the mp said
mr hague defended the proposed reform as ' fair , democratic and thus completely justified ' and denied it was linked to any ' grudge ' against the speaker
' i think a secret ballot frees members of this house completely from pressure from their parties or from the chair , ' he said
tory anger at mr bercow has been brewing for months , if not years
he has frequently clashed with mr cameron , who has often mocked his height
in april last year mr bercow tried to humiliate the pm in the commons by cutting him off mid-sentence
during raucous exchanges at pm 's questions , mr cameron was shouted down by labour mps and interrupted by mr bercow
as the pm tried to protest that he had not finished , the speaker hit back : ' he can take it from me that he is finished mr bercow also sought to humiliate home secretary theresa may over government plans for a vote on eu powers , including the european arrest warrant
he frequently interrupts debates to berate mps , including frontbenchers
he told michael gove to stop ' gyrating around ' and teased cameron 's parliamentary aide gavin williamson that his job is to ' fetch and carry notes and to nod and shake his head in the right places '
tory mp michael fabricant has been branded a ' silly man ' and guy opperman likened to a ' perspiring postman '
senior tory mps got so fed up with bercow 's rudeness last year that they formed what has been called ' the bbb club ' , members of which complain they have been ' bol * * * * ed by bercow '
they even created a lapel badge , featuring three bees , which they planned to wear in the commons
the design of the badge was calculated to poke fun at the speaker 's extreme phobia of wasps and bees , which is said to date back to his childhood .
