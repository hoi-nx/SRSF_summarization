it may have been the slowest chase ever when a tortoise attempted to run down a television presenter who interrupted it having sex with its mate
paul rose - who hosts national geographic 's pristine seas - was on assumption island , north of madagascar , when he heard an animal call , which he described as a ' blowing sound '
as he walked towards the strange noise , it soon became apparent rose and his cameraman had stumbled upon a male and female tortoise mating
as rose and his cameraman stop and try to observe the ritual , the giant tortoises stop mating
the presenter said he did not know whether or not they had stopped because of their close proximity or they had finished
the animals are seen touching noses as rose and his cameraman watch from behind bushes
he was on assumption island - north of madagascar - when the incident happened during filming rose and his cameraman were there taping for his national geographic show , pristine seas the host heard a ' blowing sound ' while he was walking the island and went towards , discovering the tortoises almost immediately the male tortoise spots them and slowly begins to turn himself around , pointing himself in the direction of the television crew
the animal then starts to make its way towards them , with as much gusto as it can muster
rose is heard telling his cameraman , ' do n't move ' , as it becomes apparent the tortoise is after them
as the reptile gets closer and closer to the camera , he shows no sign of stopping and so the cameraman jumps back
what ensues is a very low speed chase where the tortoise tries to defend his territory and take a bite out of rose
the male tortoise slowly turned around to start running after the pair who were startled by the move humouring the reptile , rose continued to slowly back away from it instead of running , observing its behaviour rose said it was the male tortoise 's way of protecting his territory and getting him away from the female later , the host said the tortoise had ended up chasing them for about 365 metres in a circle ' this is the male saying , " hey i think you 've interrupted my mating session " , ' rose told the audience as the tortoise inches closer
' you ca n't blame him he 's in the bushes over there mating on this beautiful , private island and i pitch up to take a look
' rose continued to humour the tortoise instead of running away
he said it was completely relentless in his pursuit , chasing them around in a 365 - metre - loop .
