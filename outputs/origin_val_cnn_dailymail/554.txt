a man who admitted tricking his girlfriend into having a msicarrage by giving her a smoothie laced with abortion pills says he feels like a ' sh * tbag ' for his actions
the 26 - year - old from trondheim in central norway pleaded guilty to inflicting serious bodily harm and also to terminating a pregnancy without the mother 's consent after appearing in court
the man says he gave his former partner , with whom he already had a child , the drugs after he found out she was pregnant after they had a one - night stand at a mutual friend 's party
the man told trondheim court , pictured , that he felt like a sh * tbag after giving his ex-girlfriend the smoothie laced with the drugs he told the court in trondheim that after she refused to have an abortion , he gave her pills that were meant to induce a miscarriage after buying them online and telling her they were painkillers
but when they went for the first scan , and the midwife told them that the baby was healthy , he admitted being devastated
the man then bought more of the pills online and made a smoothie out of them for the woman , aged 20 , who was immediately hit by stomach pains
she then visited her gp , who confirmed that she had suffered a miscarriage brought about by a high dosage of abortion pills
the man told the court : ' i had a bad conscience and felt remorse , but thought that it was the only way out
' i read online that pills could cause deformities if they did not work
the man had bought the pills online and first gave them to the woman , telling her that they were painkiller ( file picture ) ' after the first attempt did n't work , i thought that if it was my fault that the child was born with major malformations , i would not be able to live with that
so i decided to try again
' i felt like a total sh * tbag when it dawned on me what i had done
' state prosecutor kaja strandford is calling for the man to be sentenced to the maximum of seven years in jail
she told the adresseavisen newspaper : ' he imported these substances
all of it was precisely and cynically planned
the defendant will return to court for sentencing next week .
