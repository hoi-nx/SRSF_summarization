it 's normally women accused of high maintenance beauty routines and spending hours to get ready
but are men starting to taking over as the main bathroom hogs ? in a new interview , peter andre has revealed that although he takes just 15 minutes to get ready each morning , that 's only after he 's spent an hour or more indulging in a pampering regime
' if i have to be somewhere in the morning , the actual getting ready takes 15 minutes , ' peter andre told the guardian
' peter andre 's far from ready to walk out of the door after his morning beverage ritual however , which consists of a double espresso and glass of water , for both a caffeine and hydration boost
next , comes jumping in the steam shower he has preheated , before tackling his hair and skin
he said : ' my hair is curly , so if i 'm , going somewhere on my own , not a work event , i will run the straighteners over it
i also use coconut oil as a moisturiser
' you can do anything with it - eat it , cook with it , use it on your skin
' who hogs the bathroom in this house ? part of peter andre 's morning routine involves preheating his steam shower for an hour while he drinks a cup of coffee in silence
so when does fiancÃ©e emily macdonagh ( right ) get her turn ? then , comes the agonising decision of what he 's going to wear each day
picking an outfit the night before just is n't an option for the popstar
instead , peter andre needs to walk into his wardrobe and pick out clothes which match his mood for the day
' i could pick out a million things the night before , but if i wake up and i do n't feel as good as i did the day before , i wo n't want to wear any of it
' in contrast , british model and it girl alexa chung has said she can be up and out of the house in a mere seven minutes
british fashion icon alexa chung may give everyone style envy on the front row , but the model claims her daily ' getting ready ' routine takes her a mere seven minutes

but for fashion week , i try and put in a bit more of an effort
' for alexa chung however , more of an effort means just three minutes added to her normal routine
compared with peter andre 's painstaking grooming process , alexa chung 's final fashion week regime takes her a maximum of 10 minutes
fashion week ready in 10 minutes or less ? it girl alexa chung claims that to get ready for big events like sitting front row at fashion week , she needs just an extra three minutes of preening time
