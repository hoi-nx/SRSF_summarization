the sobbing that cooks have endured while chopping onions in the kitchen could soon be a thing of the past
scientists say they have managed produce a tear - free version of the vegetable thanks to cutting - edge technology
japanese scientists disabled the production of the powerful substance that an onion releases as the knife slices into it , cutting down on the pungent fumes that bring tears to the eyes
no more tears : scientists say they have managed to disable the production of a powerful substance an onion releases as the knife slices into it , cutting down on the pungent fumes that bring tears to the eyes in a press release , scientists said that the typical burning sensation of a raw onion was reduced too
the enzyme responsible is known as lachrymatory factor ( lf ) synthase
when an onion bulb is cut it causes a chemical reaction that generates propanthial s - oxide
this makes up the lf enzyme and is responsible for causing tears
this reaction also creates thiosulphinate , which creates the onion âs distinctive flavour

this reaction also creates thiosulphinate , which determines the onion âs flavour
during tests , scientists found that lf is formed in the presence of an enzyme called alliinase ( al ) , typically found in garlic , as well as prencso
if any one of these three components in the reaction was omitted , levels of lf dropped

the company 's researchers led by shinsuke imai won the ig nobel prize - an award handed out to honour achievements organisers consider unintentionally funny - in 2013 for their discovery of the biochemical process behind how onions make people cry
their research paper was published in the journal nature in 2002
however , a spokesman said no decision had yet been made on whether they would commercialise their tear - free onions
earlier this year , uk supermarket asda began selling its sweet red onion which has ' lower pungency levels '
this results in a milder flavour and fewer tears
this particular onion was grown by farmer alastair findlay of bedfordshire growers and costs Â£ 1 .
