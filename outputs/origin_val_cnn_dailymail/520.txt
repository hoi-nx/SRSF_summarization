two sisters have defied the odds after giving birth within minutes of one another in the same hospital
dwynwen williams had her son celt only three minutes after iola roberts gave birth to her daughter mirain on february 19
midwives gave the sisters , who live in wales , beds side by side to each other in the same ward at ysbyty glan clwyd hospital , after the births
sisters iola roberts ( left ) and dwynwen williams ( right ) gave birth three minutes apart in the same hospital in adjacent rooms
the sisters are pictured here with mirain ( left ) and celt ( right ) the sisters , who were both overdue , had booked to be induced on separate dates but astonishingly both went into labour on february 19 this year dwynwen williams , 38 , and iola roberts , 39 , who both already had two children each , were thrilled to fall pregnant at the same time last year
neither sister knew the other was pregnant , and the announcements were a huge surprise
they went through ante - natal appointments together , also at the same hospital
iola roberts , who lives in nebo , north wales , with husband paul and their older children brenig , six , and brillaen , three , was given february 9 as a due date
while dwynwen williams , who lives in llangernyw , north wales , with husband dewi , a farmer , and their older children mabon , seven and llywarch , five , was due on february 13
older sister iola roberts , who works as a nurse , said that despite their due dates being so close they had never expected to go into labour at the same time
she said : ' everyone kept joking we might have the babies on the same day but i did n't think it was possible
the consultant - led unit where the sisters gave birth is currently under threat so both iona and dwynwen williams are both backing a national campaign supporting the unit
pictured : dwynwen with her three children in hospital ' both of my sons were born early so i expected this one to be the same
' but both babies were overdue and the sisters were booked in to be induced three days apart
however , both sisters went into labour before their appointments came
dwynwen williams , 38 , said : ' when i was on my way to hospital , i texted iola roberts to say what was happening , and i could n't believe it when she sent one back to say she was also on her way
' iola roberts , who arrived at the hospital shortly after dwynwen williams , added : ' when i arrived at the hospital , i was told i 'd have to wait because there was someone in the treatment room being examined , and i replied : " tell her to get a move on ! " ' the midwife was shocked until she realised it was my sister
' the sisters were allowed on a ward together in the early stages of labour
they then gave birth in adjacent rooms , within three minutes of each other
dwynwen williams said that having her sister there made the experience even more special
' it was just so nice to have iola around
it turned out she gave birth to mirain at 1.11am , and i gave birth to celt at 1.14am
' iola roberts agreed : ' it was like a family reunion on the ward
it was lovely having my sister next to me
' the mums were then given beds side by side in a maternity ward
after giving birth both of the sisters were kept on the same ward before travelling home the next day
iona is pictured here at home with her two elder sons and baby daughter mirain iola roberts says that the amazing coincidence attracted a lot of attention from the staff in the hospital
' the midwives could n't believe what was going on
they said they 'd never come across anything like it before , and people were taking photographs as the babies looked so similar and were almost the same weight
' dwynwen williams 's son , celt , had a suspected heart murmur so they stayed in hospital for an extra night
but the next day he was given the all - clear and allowed home
the sisters are enjoying bringing up their babies together and hope they will grow up to be as close as they are
they are both also supporting a campaign to keep doctor - led maternity services at the hospital where the two cousins were born
the consultant - led unit is currently under threat of downgrade , but without it , the sisters say their story might not have been such a happy one
dwynwen williams said : ' i needed a consultant with me all through the birth because of complications
if i had n't been able to go to glan clywd i would have faced a much longer journey to hospital , meaning my baby could have been danger
' people like me , living in rural areas , rely on glan clywd as a lifeline
' both sisters are now backing a national campaign in wales to keep doctor - led maternity services at ysbyty glan clwyd , in north wales , where their babies were born .
