isis has executed another nine men for allegedly being spies in an unknown location in the middle east
each man is forced to give interview before their murder in which they admit to spying on the terror group 's location , movement and armament
all nine of them - blindfolded with hands bound behind their backs - are then escorted outside by masked terrorists who eventually instruct them to kneel and place handguns to their heads
they pull the triggers without hesitation , sending their victims jerking forward until their limp bodies hit the dusty ground
the masked isis commander who introduces the latest senseless propaganda video says the men ' were sentenced to death for betraying the religion of allah '
but the scenes in which the senseless murders take place come six minutes and 30 seconds after the start of the seven minute video
it begins with a bizarre setup of a masked isis commander sitting in a corporate office , flanked by two other soldiers
he say that islamic state succeeded in arresting an entire ' cell ' of spies who were tasked with monitoring their locations back to their commanding officer
the unnamed militant then claims three of the men who squealed on the others , adding : ' we took the investigation to a judge and after collecting evidence , they were sentenced to death for betraying the religion of allah
' each of the nine kidnapped men are then forced to give interviews before their impending doom - presumably under duress - in which they confess to being spies
their nationalities and professions are as yet a mystery , but some of the men look visibly terrified as they speak in trembling arabic
this is the second video of an islamic state execution to surface this week following the equally brutal mass murder of eight ' informers '
mastermind : the second gruesome execution video to surface this week begins with a masked fighter who says the men were ' sentenced to death for betraying the religion of allah ' captured : the unnamed isis commander also claims that three of the alleged spies squealed on their comrades execution : after being escorted onto what appears to be a bridge by armed fighters , the blindfolded men are instructed to kneal terror : the gruesome video is the second to surface this week following the footage of eight other alleged spies being killed in a similar way on thursday in the video which emerged on thursday , the terror group justified the killings as vengeance for the military operations against them in syrian and iraq
the gruesome propaganda video cut from scenes of the men being killed to footage of people who isis claims were killed during coalition attacks on its locations
cutaways include footage of dead children underneath the rubble of destroyed buildings and body bags
as with the latest video which features interviews with the doomed captives , it featured graphics which ' profiled ' each of the men about to be murdered
the videos emerge amid claims that isis is using chlorine gas as a chemical weapon against peshmerga fighters in iraq
kurdish authorties made the allegation following a suicide bomb attack involving a truck on january 23
murdered : militants claim the eight men were informers , engaged in military operations against isis revenge : the militants have justified the killings as retaliation for air strikes against land they hold in a statement , the kurdistan region security council said the alleged chemical attack took place on a road between iraq 's second - largest city of mosul and the syrian border
it was there peshmerga forces who were trying to seize a isis supply line - and discovered ' 20 gas canisters ' loaded onto the back of the truck involved
video provided by the council showed the truck racing down a road with white smoke pouring out of it as it came under heavy fire from peshmerga fighters
it later showed a white , billowing cloud after the truck exploded and the remnants of it scattered across a road .
