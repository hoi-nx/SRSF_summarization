a teenage girl has been beaten to death and set on fire in a nigeria market after being accused of being a suicide bomber
police officers said a second suspected teenage girl was also accused of being a suicide bomber and was arrested at the muda lawal market , the biggest market in bauchi in north east nigeria
a yam vendor said people discovered one of the girls had two bottles strapped to her body so they clubbed her to death , put a tyre doused in fuel over her head and set it on fire
but police spokesman mohammad haruna said it seemed doubtful the girl was a bomber and described her as the victim of ' mob action carried out by an irate crowd '
a spate of such attacks has been blamed on nigeria 's homegrown boko haram extremist group , which wants to enforce strict islamic law across nigeria
last year the terror group kidnapped hundreds of schoolgirls from the town of chibok - sparking fears they are being used to carry out the suicide bombings

the first female suicide bombing was reported in june 2014 when a middle - aged woman blew herself up at army barracks in gombe , northeast nigeria
this incident was the first in a wave of suicide attacks by women and girls in nigeria
there were then six such attacks in six weeks
since november there have been several attacks by female suicide bombers each month
in total , 27 women and girls have reportedly been involved in suicide attacks in the country
in 2014 , nigeria saw around 85 percent of all female suicide bombings around the world
the group has increased the number of suicide attacks over the last year , particularly those involving girls and women
recently girls as young as 10 have been used to carry explosives which were then detonated in busy markets and bus stations
it is unclear whether the girls detonate explosions themselves or whether the bombs are controlled remotely
president goodluck jonathan last week condemned boko haram for choosing soft targets and said the series of bombings are a response to the nigeria military 's recent success in seizing back towns that had been in the hands of the extremists for months
the group has threatened to disrupt nigeria 's march 28 presidential and legislative elections , saying democracy ' is a corrupt western concept '
