the ronnie corbett sitcom ' sorry ' that poked fun at a middle - aged man living with their parents would be a ' documentary ' today , gove claimed tonight
the government chief whip said it was too hard for people to get on the housing ladder today , forcing people to stay at home later in life
he said new plans to build 200,000 cheap ' starter homes ' for the under 40s were needed to help a generation buy their first home
gove said the ronnie corbett sitcom ' sorry ' would be a ' documentary ' today because of the cost of buying a first home mr gove 's remarks , to lbc 's iain dale , came after it emerged more than 30,000 people have registered for the new ' starter homes ' schemes within 48 hours of its launch
cameron yesterday announced that under a future tory government 200,000 new homes will be sold 20 per cent cheaper than the going rate - but only for those under 40 who have n't yet bought their own home
mr cameron said building cheap new homes for first time buyers would be the centre - piece of the tory 's house - building strategy after the election
mr gove tonight said the proposal was necessary to help young families get a leg onto the housing ladder
he said : â what cameron has been talking about is extending the number of what have been called â starter homes â
these are homes that we will make available to people under the age of 40 so they can get onto the housing ladder
â the right thing to do is to help those people who , traditionally , would have been able to expect to get a home before they are 40
â i remember when we were growing up , there was a situation comedy called â sorry â with ronnie corbett
â it was a comedy because you had a man in his 40s living with his parents
well , it was a comedy then â it is a documentary now
we need to make sure we have more homes for young people

the pm said : ' there is a particular kind of security that comes with owning your own home [ but ] too many people have been denied that security
' the young people in their 20s and 30s still living with their parents , desperately saving for their own place
' the couple who want a child but ca n't afford to upsize â even though they both have full - on , full - time jobs
it should n't be this way
' our goal is a britain where everyone who works hard can have a home of their own
