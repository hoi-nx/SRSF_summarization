ashe admits scotland are desperate to avoid a six nations whitewash â even if victory over ireland today means handing the championship crown to old rivals england
defeat at murrayfield today would ensure a fourth wooden spoon and third whitewash in 12 years for the home side , who have been relegated to a mere sideshow in what is set to be thrilling finish to this year âs tournament
ashe is determined to spoil the irish party at murrayfield on saturday the day kicks off with italy playing wales at the stadio olimpico , before scotland host ireland and then england round things off against france at twickenham
wales , ireland and england are all locked on six points each , with the destination of the title set to be decided on points difference
as things stand , england are in the driving seat with a points difference of 37 from their first four games , with ireland on 33 and wales off the pace with 12
the irish will be determined to run in the tries against scotland , so as to apply pressure to stuart lancaster âs men when the take on the temperamental french
ashe , for his part , is determined to spoil the party
â ireland are focusing on a big win and looking forward to taking the title but we do nât want to let that happen , regardless who goes on to win the championship , â said the glasgow warriors forward
ashe does n't think his selection was a gamble for such an important match â i would say there is more pressure on us going into this match because we have been losing games while playing well
â yes , ireland have got a lot of pressure on them to win the championship â but that could be taken out of their hands by us
â ashe , who has been brought into the scotland side at the expense of rob harley , denied it was a gamble throwing him in from the start of a such an important match
the 21 - year - old , who picked up a neck injury playing against new zealand back in november , said he was now at peak fitness despite playing a total of just 94 minutes of professional rugby in 2015
â i played in the munster game a few weeks ago and that was my first game back after three months out , â said ashe
â i had a bit of a reaction with my neck a few days after but it settled down quickly enough
that was always going to happen coming back from my injury
â although i have not played much rugby , i am hungry for it
i am not just physically ready but also mentally ready , too
i want to go out there and give everything i âve got against ireland
â it was tough missing the first three six nations games through injury but i am glad to be back involved and able to do my part
