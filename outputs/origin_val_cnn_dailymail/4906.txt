spanish 's otaegui will take a two - shot lead into the third round of the tshwane open after threatening to record the first ever 59 on the european tour on friday
nine birdies in the first 16 holes at pretoria country club , including five in a row from the eighth , left otaegui needing two more to break the magical 60 barrier
however , the 22 - year - old former british boys champion narrowly failed to chip in from the edge of the green on the 17th and then dropped his only shot of the day on the last after finding a bunker off the tee
otaegui made an impressive nine birdies in his round of 62 , and came close to going under 60 the resulting 62 gave the world number 403 a halfway total of 11 under par , two shots ahead of south africa 's merrick bremner , who birdied four of his last six holes to add a 66 to his opening 65
merrick bremner 's compatriots keith horne and trevor fisher jnr , who won the africa open on sunday , were a shot further back on eight under alongside england 's david horsey and italy 's edoardo molinari
otaegui , who is mentored by former ryder cup captain jose maria olazabal having played most of his junior golf at the latter 's home club in fuenterrabia , said : ' i was focused and did n't know that i had made five birdies in a row
it was an excellent round from the spaniard , who leads in pretoria after two rounds ' i was playing well and made a few putts , that 's all i was thinking about
the best golf is when you think as little as possible , and this was one of those days
' we were first to tee off this morning , conditions were perfect , the greens were perfect
i like playing this early so i really played well , made many birdies and am happy with my round
' david horsey added a second round of 69 to his flawless opening 63 , but joint overnight leader morten orum madsen - who had finished his opening round with a hole - in - one on the eighth and eagle on the ninth - took five more shots to play those holes on friday as he struggled to a 72 to lie five under
david horsey , who made a brilliant 63 on the first day , is four shots behind after a second round 69 ' i gave a few silly ones away and missed it on the wrong side occasionally as well , ' david horsey said
' it 's a little bit disappointing i suppose but i still managed to make my fair share of birdies to keep it under par. ' i am three behind but there is a long way to go and this golf course can yield a lot of birdies as well as bogeys
i am in a nice position ; i would have taken that if you had given me it on wednesday
' home favourite and club member george coetzee is four off the lead after a 66 , with defending champion ross fisher three shots further back following a 67
european ryder cup captain darren clarke chipped in on the ninth for an eagle and repeated the trick on the 10th for a birdie , but also had two double bogeys in a 67 which left him on two under
defending champion ross fisher is some way off the pace after a second round of 67 in pretoria
