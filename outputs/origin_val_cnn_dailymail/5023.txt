taking a stance : openly - gay apple ceo tim cook criticized new laws that critics say will allow business owners to openly discriminate apple ceo tim cook has spoken out against two new laws in indiana and arkansas which critics say will allow business owners to refuse service to homosexual customers based on ' religious liberty '
tim cook condemned the laws , saying they were ' very dangerous ' , went against the founding principles of u.s. , and would take the country back to the days of ' whites only ' signs in shop doorways
he added that , as a baptist , he supports religious freedom , but said : ' i was never taught , nor do i believe , that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate
' tim cook , 54 , who came out as gay in october last year , made the comments in an op - ed for the washington post
he wrote : ' in total , there are nearly 100 bills designed to enshrine discrimination in state law
' on behalf of apple , i 'm standing up to oppose this new wave of legislation
' these bills under consideration truly will hurt jobs , growth and the economic vibrancy of parts of the country where a 21st - century economy was once welcomed with open arms
' he also addressed legislation in texas that ' would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples
' he said such bills ' rationalize injustice ' by ' pretending to defend ' religious freedom , which actually eroding the freedoms of others
tim cook drew upon his background growing up in the south in the 1960s and 1970s , during and immediately after the civil rights movement when blacks were still heavily discriminated against
he says u.s. 's ' days of discrimination ' must remain ' deep in the past ' and said freedom and equality is a value that is at the heart of his company
he added : ' apple is open
open to everyone , regardless of where they come from , what they look like , how they worship or who they love
hb1228 is also named the religious freedom restoration act , and uses the same wording as the indiana legislation
the indiana bill forbids the state or local government from ' substantially burdening ' a person 's religious beliefs unless that burden is ' essential ' to further a ' compelling ' government interest , and is the ' least restrictive ' means of achieving that aim
it allows people or organisations to use the legislation as a defense in court against claims of discrimination against them , and if the court rules in their favor , allows reparations , including compensation payouts
indiana 's religious freedom act says that the state and local government ' may not substantially burden a person 's right to the exercise of religion ' unless that burden is ' essential ' to furthering a government interest
it will be up to the courts to decide what counts as ' substantial ' , but the legislation was largely designed to fend off lawsuits against those who refuse to participate in gay marriage ceremonies
for example a florist who refuses to supply flowers for a same sex ceremony
supporters say that such provisions already exist in 20 other states , and were actually signed into federal law by bill clinton in 1993
but opponents , including tim cook , claim these laws form part of a wave of discriminatory powers that threaten to reverse years of progress on equality issue it will be up to the courts and judges to decide what constitutes ' substantial ' , but critics fear that the broad scope of the law and the tough tests that must be passed to override it , mean that it will allow business owners to openly discriminate in how they operate
tim cook is far from the only one opposing the new law in indiana , with musician miley cyrus , and actors ashton kutcher , james van der beek and george takei all speaking out against it
the nba , wnba , the indiana pacers , and indiana fever issued a joint statement saturday reaffirming their commitment to non-discrimination
hillary clinton also messaged to her three million twitter followers saying that ' we should n't discriminate against people because of who they love ' following the bill 's passing on thursday
businesses are also lining up to oppose the legislation , threatening to pull investment or even boycott the state altogether in protest
website angie 's list also announced plans to cancel a $ 40 million expansion to its indianapolis headquarters because of the new law
' angie 's list is open to all and discriminates against none and we are hugely disappointed in what this bill represents , ' the company 's ceo bill oesterle said in the statement
salesforce.com founder and ceo marc benioff also announced on twitter that he would no longer send employees or customers to indiana
proud : tim cook said that , being born a baptist , he supported religion , but added : ' i was never taught that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate ' ( tim cook pictured centre at gay pride parade in san francisco ) making a statement : tim cook previously expressed opposition to the new laws in indiana and arkansas on his twitter page tim cook 's op - ed came after thousands gathered outside the indiana statehouse on saturday to rally against the law , waving rainbow coloured flags and chanting slogans such as ' no hate in our state '
since the law passed , pence senator pence has robustly defended it , saying that it is necessary to help people defend themselves against ' government overreach '
he also ruled out any possibility of repealing the law , which is due to take effect in july , telling this week with george stephanopoulos , that ' the law will stick
' pence said there was a ' tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding ' surrounding the legislation , forms of which are already enshrined in law in 20 other states
pence told the indy star he will support legislation to ' clarify ' the controversial law , and expects it to go before the general assembly this week
while he did not discuss the wording of the new bill , he has previously said the intention of the law is to block government intervention in matters of conscience , rather than allowing people to discriminate against others .
