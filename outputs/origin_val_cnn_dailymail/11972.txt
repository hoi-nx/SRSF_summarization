as if running on the treadmill was n't already hard enough work , a man has performed a dance routine on one
choreographer dean has posted a video of himself performing a high - speed , energetic routine to bruno mars ' catchy hit song , uptown funk
and to add to the talented feat , he does n't lose his balance once or even appear to break into a sweat
choreographer dean , starts his uptown funk routine with a series of turns on the treadmill throughout the dance , dean , who is based in los angeles , california , carries out a series of jumps , spins , high - kicks and even a flip - all while maintaining his balance
the professional dancer , choreographer , singer and actor posted the short clip , lasting a minute and a half , on youtube
it was supposedly intended to be a short workout video , with the caption alluding to the lyrics from the bruno mars song : ' the best cardio workout ! do n't believe me just watch
' but it 's unlikely that many non-professional dancers will be able to imitate his acrobatic ' cardio workout '
the routine starts off slowly with a dean strolling to the beat on the treadmill , alternating between going backwards and forwards
his movement gets progressively more high - energy , eventually introducing nifty footwork and turns
the professional dancer / choreographer , actor and singer starts to use the arms of the treadmill to conduct a series of tricks dean moves on to more high - energy moves and high - kicks , all while remaining sweat - free by the end of the video , dean uses the arms of the treadmill to lift himself up and employ high leg - kicks
but by far the most impressive moment , is when the choreographer once again uses the support arms of the treadmill to curl up and do a small flip
the viral video has already racked up 2,658,243 views , as well as 18,549 likes , with viewers amazed at dean 's slick moves and cool composure
