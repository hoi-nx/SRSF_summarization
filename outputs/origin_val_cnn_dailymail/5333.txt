' there is no mention of speaking welsh
council - owned waste management company cwm environmental in carmarthen , wales , has put out a job advert in which it states : ' the ability to speak and understand polish is an advantage but not essential ' however , 30 of cwm 's 100 workers are from europe , mostly polish
cwm said it made sense for them to be able to communicate in polish for health and safety reasons
the council said the firm was entirely responsible for recruitment
but welsh conservatives said local workers were being disadvantaged
a spokesman for the welsh conservatives said : ' this is an extraordinary attempt by a labour - run council to recruit migrant workers , at the likely expense of local jobseekers who speak english or welsh
' ed miliband promised to ban recruitment agencies which try to undercut local wages by hiring only migrant workers , yet here is a labour - led council aiming a job advert at polish speakers - with such rank hypocrisy , it 's no wonder voters ca n't trust ed miliband on immigration
' putting local workers at a competitive disadvantage and exploiting foreign workers is clearly beyond the pale
' official figures show more than 40 per cent of the population of carmarthenshire speak welsh as well as english - but there is no mention of speaking welsh in the advert
