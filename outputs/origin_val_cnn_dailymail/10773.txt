a south coati which was wrongly mistaken for a ' small bear ' has been captured after it spent two months on the run
the animal escaped from its private owner in fawley , in buckinghamshire , just after new year and the rspca were inundated with calls from people claiming to have seen a ' small bear '
animal welfare officers began hunting the clawed coati after he was spotted up a tree in a garden in marlow , last month
dennis lovell , the charity 's animal collection officer , said the caoti had been missing a month before they were contacted
he said : ' in early february we received a flurry of calls regarding a small bear like animal that was spotted in and around the marlow area
' it was eventually established it was actually a coatimundi that was on the loose after escaping from a home in the area
' we soon discovered where he had escaped from and were in contact with the owners about getting him home safely
' the coati seemed to be favouring three gardens by the river to visit for food so we laid a humane trap with pieces of fresh fruit at one of the properties
' thanks to the help of the nearby householders we were able to keep an eye on the trap and as soon as he was in there i was able to go down , collect him and return him to his owners
caught : the coati escaped from its private owners after new year and was finally captured in a humane trap ' considering he had been on the run for around two months he was in a very good condition and it was lovely to be able to reunite him with his owners
' coatis , full name coatimundis and distant relatives to the raccoon , can be difficult to look after because their needs are so specialist
they are native to south , central and parts of north america and are commonly found in tropical forests , living primarily on a diet of insects
the rspca has recommended that anyone considering getting one as a pet thoroughly researches the species .
