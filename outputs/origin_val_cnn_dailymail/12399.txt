ferguson city manager ferguson resigned tuesday in the wake of a scathing department of justice report
the report blames ferguson , missouri , police and courts for abusive behavior that disproportionately targets african americans residents
" over the last several months i have done everything in my power to work with countless groups to bring about positive change and strengthen our community , " ferguson wrote in his resignation letter
he continued : " during this time i have also worked closely with the department of justice to identify opportunities to improve , and then moved quickly to implement its recommendations for change
" and while i certainly respect the work that the department of justice recently performed in their investigation and report on the city of ferguson , i must state clearly that my office has never instructed the police department to target african americans , nor falsify charges to administer fines , nor heap abuses on the backs of the poor
any inferences of that kind from the report are simply false
" ferguson 's resignation was announced the same day the city council voted 7 - 0 on a mutual separation agreement with ferguson
residents elect city council members , who in turn appoint the city manager
the city manager directs and supervises all city departments , including the police department
along with other officials , ferguson was heavily criticized by the department of justice report , which found that authorities in ferguson frequently saw residents as " sources of revenue
" in fact , the city enjoyed so much success in issuing tickets and fines that ferguson , population 21,000 , was ranked in the top eight of the 80 municipal courts in st. louis county by having more than $ 1 million in revenue in 2010 , the report said
in one march 2012 email , the captain of the patrol division reported to ferguson that court collections the previous month reached $ 235,000 -- the first month collections exceeded $ 200,000
the city manager reported the email to the city council , congratulating police and court staff on their " great work , " the report said
when ferguson court revenues exceeded $ 2 million for the whole of 2012 , the city manager responded to the police chief in an internal email : " awesome ! thanks ! " according to the federal report
the department of justice 's probe came after public outcry over the death of unarmed black teenager michael brown , who was shot by ferguson police officer darren wilson in august
darren wilson , who was not indicted on any charges , has resigned from the police department
but when ferguson resident schmidt defended darren wilson at tuesday 's city council meeting , she heard vocal objections from those in the crowd
" i 'd like to say a lot of people in this room owe darren wilson an apology , " schmidt said , prompting laughter by some in the audience
" the same justice report that you 're basing all your opinions on cleared him 100 %
" cnn 's jennifer feldman , holly yan , sarah aarthun and michael martinez contributed to this report .
