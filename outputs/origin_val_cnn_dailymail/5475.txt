south 's president visited injured u.s. ambassador lippert on monday amid an outpouring of public sympathy and support for the envoy who is recovering from an attack by a knife - wielding man
lippert has been hospitalized since thursday at seoul 's severance hospital , where president park geun-hye also received treatment in 2006 when she was knifed by a man with a box cutter during an election rally
park was then an opposition party leader
park was quoted as saying ' my heart is aching more ' because lippert is hospitalized at the same hospital due to a similar attack
lippert told park that he and his wife have been moved by the support the south government and people have showed to him , according to a statement from the presidential blue house
conservative activists and christians have wished lippert a quick recovery , held pro- u.s. rallies and conducted dance performances near the u.s. embassy in seoul
high - level government officials and politicians have visited him , and one well - wishing man even tried to offer dog meat to him
hospital officials said they expect to release lippert on tuesday
' he has strongly expressed his desire to go back to work , ' said yoon do-heum , general director of severance hospital said
the alleged attacker , known as an anti- u.s. activist who was previously convicted of hurling a piece of concrete at the japanese ambassador in seoul in 2010 , was arrested friday
