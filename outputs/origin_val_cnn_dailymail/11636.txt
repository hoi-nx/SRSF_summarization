here 's the bad news for rock : despite the camouflage we can see what you 're wearing at the trophee hassan ii on thursday
the 37 - year - old englishman turned heads at the european tour event by wearing an ostentatious blue and pink camouflage jumper , and in the process added to golf 's long list of crimes against fashion
rock has arguably the most famous hair in golf thanks to his insistence on being one of the few players not to wear a sponsored cap , leaving his carefully - coiffed mane on view at all times
tiger woods got a fine view of the do when rock claimed a brilliant victory by beating the 14 - time major champion at the 2012 abu dhabi championship
rock shows off his camouflage jumper at the trophee hassan ii in morocco englishman rock hits his tee shot on the 11th hole on his way to a two - over - par round of 74 rock is still visible against the trees at golf du palais royal despite his camouflage but , sadly , neither the hair nor the jumper could inspire a better score than 74 - two over par - in the first round at golf du palais royal in morocco on thursday
that left the staffordshire man nine shots behind the leader , adrien saddier , with three rounds to go after the frenchman 's opening 75
rock is far from the first offender when it comes to golfers breaking the laws of fashion
there are too many examples of awful golfing attire to list here , but among the chief culprits are loud - mouthed and loud - trousered us john daly , numerous ryder cup teams down the years and , of course , the not - so - shrinking violet , ian poulter
here is a taster of some of golf 's fashion hall of shame ... big - hitting us john daly has an infamous collection of loud and proud golf trousers tiger woods , davis love and phil mickelson show off the awful shirts of the 1999 us ryder cup team ian poulter wore his claret jug trousers ( left ) for the the open in 2005 and the union jack pair in 2004 rickie fowler wears his garish all - orange outfit on sundays and as a tribute to his alma mater , arizona state university ( left ) ; graeme mcdowell wears a horrific tartan jacket ( right ) , but to be fair to the northern irishman it was his ( rather dubious ) prize for winning the rbc heritage tournament at harbour town in 2013 woody austin shows off during the open at royal birkdale in 2008 ( left - no prizes for guessing his nationality ) ; and what do you ink about billy horschel 's octopus - print pants at the 2013 us open ? colin montgomerie and nick faldo wear matching pink tank tops at the ryder cup in 2005 oh , and if you want to wear the rock look yourself , visit wolsey.com and get ready to shell out Â£ 130
good luck trying to get your local members ' club to let you on the course , though ...
