the collapse of marriage in our poorest communities -- and its tragic impact -- is a familiar story
but increasingly , marriage is becoming a marker of class privilege in america , something increasingly reserved for the affluent
if progressives want to tackle the scourge of inequality , then the retreat from marriage is an issue they ca n't ignore
the reality is that the retreat from marriage is pervading the working middle class -- the two - thirds of america without a college degree
this is occurring even as in upscale america , marital bonds remain comparatively strong
" this is the marriage gap , and it 's something new in america , " declares a manifesto on " marriage opportunity " unveiled in a recent washington monthly cover story
it was penned by four astute social and political analysts , blankenhorn , jonathan rauch , barbara dafoe whitehead and bill galston
( full disclosure : i 'm a signer of their statement
) " over the past several decades , the norm of marriage has eroded across all economic and educational classes , but much less among the elite , " they write
" but for millions of middle - and lower - class america , marriage is increasingly beyond reach , creating more fractured and difficult family lives , more economic insecurity for single parents , less social mobility for those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder , more childhood stress , and a fraying of our common culture
" true , overall america marriage rates have fallen from 72 % of america adults in 1960 to just 51 % in 2012 , according to the economist
but drill a little deeper into the data , and a marital class divide emerges
less than half of men with high school degrees are married , compared with 76 % of men with college degrees
the pattern is similar among women , except that those with graduate degrees have somewhat lower marriage rates than those with four - year college degrees
and because the college - educated tend to look for mates with similar education and earning power , their unions push them even higher up the income scale -- further widening the economic gulf between marital haves and have - nots
marriage in america , it seems , is becoming another luxury item for economic elites to enjoy
so why should we worry ? " declining marriage rates may not be concerning on their own , but while america are forgoing marriage , they are not forgoing childbearing , " say isabel sawhill and joanna venator of the brookings institution
more than 40 % of children are born outside wedlock today ( including nearly three - quarters of black children )
and a raft of social research shows that children who grow up in married , two - parent families do better in school and in life than those who do n't
it 's true that more children are being raised by cohabiting couples , but in the america ( unlike some european countries ) these relationships tend to be unstable and short - lived
some see the decline of marriage as stemming from a tectonic cultural shift -- the rise of feminism and the surge of women into work -- that has blurred the old division of familial labor between male breadwinners and female homemakers
but economic changes , mainly the disappearance of manufacturing jobs , automation and wage stagnation , have played a big part in the story , too
liberals are eager to talk about their favorite economic fixes for inequality : raising the minimum wage , bolstering unions and taxing the rich to pay for new social benefits for families of modest means
but they seem uncomfortable talking about marriage , which is seen as an unwelcome distraction from issues of economic power
it 's tempting to blame such reticence on president bush 's ill - fated healthy marriage initiative , which triggered a flurry of new federal marriage promotion programs over the previous decade
a centerpiece of bush 's " compassionate conservatism , " the initiative managed to polarize the social policy community while having a negligible impact on falling marriage rates
in truth , though , liberals have a long tradition -- at least since daniel patrick moynihan 's warnings in the 1960s of the consequences of family breakdown in black communities -- of shying away from " cultural " explanations for poverty and inequality
they need to get over it
inequality as we know it today arises from the intricate interplay of economic and cultural changes , and wo n't be reversed simply by redistributing income from affluent to downscale families
high marriage rates in upper middle - class america make the link between family structure and economic success abundantly clear
for example , economists robert lerman and w. bradford wilcox estimate that the median income of families with children would be 44 % higher today if america had the same marriage rates we had in 1980
today , a record number of america -- one in five adults 25 and older -- have never been married
it 's probably not because our society is evolving away from a fundamental social institution that has endured for , oh , most of human history
in fact , researchers say aspirations to marriage are as high as ever , but the practical barriers are getting harder to surmount
which brings us back to the " marriage opportunity " manifesto
rather than actively promoting marriage -- something government has shown it does n't really know how to do -- the opportunity agenda aims at removing impediments to marriage , especially for non-elite america
this includes a raft of familiar policy proposals for boosting the economic prospects of low - income workers and making taxes more family - friendly
intriguingly , the four authors point to the one cultural shift that 's bucking the trend toward diminishing demand for weddings -- the public 's dramatic turnaround on same - sex marriage
they envision a possible political bargain in which conservatives accept gays as allies in fortifying marriage , and liberals recognize that family breakdown is magnifying america 's disparities of wealth and income
could expanding marriage opportunity really become common ground in america 's intensely polarized culture wars ? it seems like an extravagant hope
but blankenhorn and company are emphatically right that both progressives and conservatives have a big stake in reversing the retreat from marriage .
