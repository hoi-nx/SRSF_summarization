melbourne man coram , who lost his sister and nephew in the germanwings disaster , says he is not angry about what happened and feels sorry for the parents of the co-pilot accused of deliberately crashing an airbus a320 into the alps

the passenger jet , en route from barcelona , spain , to dusseldorf , northern germany , came down early in the 90 - minute flight on tuesday
mr coram on monday visited a memorial to them and the other 147 victims in the tiny alps village of le vernet , near the crash site
the refrigeration mechanic was joined by his daughters , georgina and philippa , who are nurse carol 's nieces and acoustic engineer greig 's cousins

' this is as close as we 're going to get
' it was very , very sad
you just sort of look at it ( the memorial ) and say a few words like ' i love you '

wow , how would you feel if your child did that ? ' carol 's other two brothers have remained in australia ' still in denial ' , mr coram said
' we have decided to treat this as an accident at this stage and thus deny the perpetrator his wishes
' there 's never going to be conclusive proof of what happened
we like to think of it that way
' it 's better off being calm ... there 's no point being angry
' the corams will stay in the alps for a few days

' i hope to get more members of the family over here in the next few months , ' he said on monday

andreas lubitz was treated for suicidal tendencies ' several years ago ' before he received his pilot 's licence , germany prosecutors said monday

since the plane crash , greig 's facebook page is now serving as memorial with posts on climate change , world heritage , and gay rights issues

she 's a woman who 's demonstrated that her social perspective in helping others is not something she 's just done in her working life but she has certainly been involved with working with refugees when they came from kosovo to australia back in the late 90s , ' she said
