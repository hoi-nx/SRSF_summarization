john and margaret ross were ' absolutely devastated ' when they found what they thought was their missing cat lying dead in the road , before sending him for cremation
but two weeks later the couple from hackney , east london , were stunned to receive a phone call from a vet who said their 19 - year - old feline amigo had been discovered alive and well
mr and mrs margaret ross , both 73 , immediately realised that they had cremated somebody else âs pet cat - which looked identical to their own white , black and tan maine coons
he 's back : margaret ross and ross with their 19 - year - old cat amigo - who they thought they had cremated found : the couple received a phone call from a vet in london to say their cat of 15 years was safe and well retired barrister mr ross said : â it was exactly the same cat as ours , same colour , same everything
it had been badly injured and was definitely dead
we picked him up and took him home
â we said â this is our cat , he has been killed , can we have him cremated ? â we did nât check the microchip
we thought there was no point checking the chip of our dead cat
â the couple , married for 52 years , asked a vet to send the cat to the cambridge pet crematorium in thriplow heath , hertfordshire , on january 17 - which was 12 days after he vanished
but last tuesday - two weeks after paying Â£ 130 for the cremation - they received a phone call from the wanstead veterinary hospital in east london to say their cat of 15 years was safe and well
presumption : mrs margaret ross said the couple ' never suspected ' the dead animal ' might be somebody else 's cat ' missing feline : mr ross said the dead cat was ' exactly ' the same as amigo - ' same colour , same everything ' mr ross said : â three weeks later we got a call from the veterinary hospital to say they found amigo but i said â we âve cremated him , it ca nât be â
we shot off to the hospital and there was amigo
â we said â is he completely deaf ? has he got cysts on his back ? â the vet said â yes â , and we knew he was our amigo
we could nât believe we got him back
' but then it struck , we âd cremated the wrong cat
we rung the crematorium and said if somebody wants the ashes of that cat then please give them the ashes
â mrs margaret ross , a retired english lecturer , added : â we never suspected it might be somebody else âs cat - if it had been an ordinary moggy then maybe , but maine coons are really quite rare
it had been a messy accident but it had the same white paws and white fluff as ours
â a crematorium spokesman said the ashes of the unidentified cat would be scattered in its gardens .
