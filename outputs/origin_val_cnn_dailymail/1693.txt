hospitals are paying up to Â£ 3,200 a shift to hire locum doctors in a&e
short - staffed trusts are forced to pay exorbitant amounts as they compete to attract agency medics
full - time doctors say it is â demoralising â working alongside locums earning three or four times as much
united lincolnshire hospitals , which runs lincoln county hospital , pictured , paid Â£ 3,258 for a consultant to work a 24 - hour shift in a&e between christmas and new year figures obtained by sky news show that united lincolnshire hospitals paid Â£ 3,258 for a consultant to work a 24 - hour shift in a&e between christmas and new year
not all the money went to the doctor as the agency employing them will have taken a sizeable cut
nonetheless , it is still a considerable amount bearing in mind the locum will have spent much of the shift asleep but â on - call â â where they need to attend only in an emergency
leeds teaching hospitals in west yorkshire paid Â£ 2,099 for a doctor to work a nine - hour shift in a&e over the same period â equivalent to Â£ 230 an hour
three more trusts â the royal berkshire in reading , derby hospitals and north bristol â each paid around Â£ 1,800 for an a&e nurse to work 12 hours
the figures , obtained under the freedom of information act , show that at one trust , airedale in west yorkshire , more than 70 per cent of all doctors â shifts between christmas and new year were filled by locums
as they are generally less experienced and competent than full - time doctors employed by the trust , there is concern that such over-reliance could put patients at risk
the royal berkshire in reading , pictured , derby hospitals and north bristol each paid around Â£ 1,800 for an a&e nurse to work 12 hours at the heart of england nhs trust , 58 per cent of shifts between christmas and new year were filled by locums , while at the royal bolton it was 52 per cent
the nhs is short of a&e doctors partly because staffing levels have not kept pace with the rising number of patients , so trusts have to pay vast amounts to agencies
dr clifford mann , president of the royal college of emergency medicine , said : â market forces really are quite extreme currently , with the lack of permanent people to employ
â it means hospitals are desperate to try to find people to fill these slots and are having to pay super premium rates
it can be very demoralising to be working alongside somebody with much less experience , much more junior , who is earning a multiple income compared to you
â last month a scathing report by the public accounts committee warned that doctors and nurses were quitting to become locums because the pay rates were three or four times higher
it also highlighted how spending on agency staff had soared by a quarter in the past year to Â£ 2.6billion dr mark porter , chairman of the british medical association âs council , which represents doctors , said : â locums play a vital role in the nhs but they should not be used as a long - term solution
greater reliance on locums is a sign of stress on the system and the result of poor workforce planning by government
â the department of health said : â since may 2010 we have more than 9,500 extra doctors and nearly 8,500 extra nurses
we want to reduce reliance on agency staff and soon hospitals that do nât have their finances in order will have to make significant progress towards halving their agency spend or risk tough consequences
