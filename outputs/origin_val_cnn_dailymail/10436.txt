so everton continue to fly england âs flag in europe and there is no sense they are ready for this adventure to end
this has been a hugely frustrating domestic campaign , one in which everton have lurched to the brink of calamity
but the europa league has provided excitement and opportunity and did so again , with everton now 90 minutes away from the last eight
true , it will be difficult to get there
allowing dynamo kiev to score an away goal means everton will require a performance of strength and discipline in ukrainian next week but at least they can travel with confidence thanks to lukaku âs 82nd - minute penalty
lukaku celebrates his late penalty which gives everton a precious lead ahead of next week 's return leg in the ukrainian capital after a long wait , a nervy lukaku put the ball to olexandr shovkovskiy 's left and his penalty just about beat the keeper to nestle in the net steven naismith celebrates his leveller as the scot 's instinctive finish restored parity before the break after great work from lukaku steven naismith coolly slips the ball beyong the onrushing olexandr shovkovskiy to raise the roof at an expectant goodison park oleg gusev slips away from ross barkley on the far post , darts toward the near post and connects with a corner to steer past tim howard oleg gusev wheels away in jubilation after giving the visitors the lead to give everton fans plenty to think about on a nervy europe night lukaku reacts after squandering a chance to put everton ahead , but the club 's Â£ 28m record signing made amends later with his spot kick everton ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : tim howard 6 : coleman 6.5 , antolin alcaraz 6 , jagielka 8 , luke garbutt 7 : james mccarthy 6.5 , gareth barry 7 : steven naismith 7.5 , ross barkley 6 ( leon osman 74 , 6 ) , kevin mirallas 6 ( kone 64 , 6 ) : lukaku 7 subs not used : joel , gibson , besic , atsu , browning

on a filthy night when the rain tumbled relentlessly , it would have been easy for them to buckle
as it was , they kept going
there were excellent performances , not least from captain jagielka and gareth barry , and there was also courage , not least from lukaku
his seventh europe goal of the campaign may just be the one roberto martinez needs to turn things around
â it has to be a turning point , â said the everton manager
â our fans know that we have got an honest group of players
when we get the tempo right and have that expression in our play , we have shown that we are a good team
â you can not underestimate how important it is to win in europe
our intensity was very pleasing
that was us at our best level
we know we have a good side
â usually for such contests , there is a crackle of anticipation around goodison park but things were markedly different
everton âs dreadful form through a bleak midwinter has left many fans sceptical and miserable performances have sapped their energy
a positive start would have quelled anxieties but everton , playing in all blue on orders from uefa to avoid a clash with dynamo kiev , were sluggish and horribly short of confidence
no one was prepared to take charge or provide a run to open gaps for others
sensing they could profit , dynamo kiev began to venture forward with increased purpose , and after 14 minutes they inflicted the kind of blow that roberto martinez had spoken of with dread in the build - up , a goal to complicate an already difficult task
in many ways , it highlighted everton âs current ills
andriy yarmolenko flung in a corner , james mccarthy was too slow to react and oleg gusev nipped in to direct a volley into the roof of the gwladys street net
standing on the touchline in the downpour , roberto martinez looked shell - shocked
when sergei sydorchuk then tested tim howard with a shot from 20 yards that skidded off the greasy surface , the groans were becoming louder and there was a definite sense that rebellion was in the air
steven naismith finished off some wonderful work from lukaku to give everton a foothold in the game

â we gave a cheap goal away but i could not be more proud of our reaction , â said roberto martinez
the momentum shifted when jagielka charged down a loose ball and surged upfield , passing to lukaku with dynamo kiev keeper olexandr shovkovskiy stranded outside his area
had lukaku returned the pass , jagielka would have had an open goal to aim at but instead the belgian shot horribly wide
everton had a spark and in the next attack , after 37 minutes , luke garbutt âs inswinging corner was met flush by jagielka but the england defender âs header was cleared from under the bar by silva
antolin alcaraz then smashed the rebound over the bar
gareth barry leapfrogs sergei sydorchuk as the veteran midfielder battles for possession in the everton engine room kevin mirallas and silva battle for the ball during a gritty encounter on merseyside which leaves everton neatly poised to progress lukaku terrorises three dynamo kiev players as the everton talisman attempts to showcase his attacking prowess this was a significant improvement and soon everton were level
lukaku can infuriate with his ability to make the wrong call but his play to create the equaliser for steven naismith was outstanding , bull - dozing his way past three challenges before slipping in the scot , whose finish was admirably cool
as he wheeled away to celebrate , steven naismith made a point of signalling to jagielka and for good reason
he had played a captain âs role , taking the game by the scruff of the neck and driving his team forward
half - time came but it did not check everton âs impetus
they came out of the blocks for the second period with purpose and lukaku âs hulking presence continually unsettled silva and forced him to make mistakes
one such error led to a corner from which steven naismith almost scored with a header
that steven naismith missed was not a problem
the mood around the stadium had completely changed
everton looked dangerous every time they attacked and the suspicion was that shovkovskiy would buckle if they kept testing him , as the impressive luke garbutt did with a fizzing free - kick
luke garbutt lies on the sodden turf and winces as everton 's europa league campaign continued in sterling fashion roberto martinez shares a moment with sergei rebrov as the former spurs and west ham striker made a losing return to england the travelling fans were in good humour and voice as the leaders of the ukrainian premier league travelled to merseyside en masse each raid forward attracted encouragement from the stands and aware of the difference the crowd could make , lukaku urged them to keep making a noise
suddenly it felt like everton could pinch a lead and so it proved with eight minutes remaining
when silva handled substitute leon osman âs cross , referee carlos carballo had no hesitation pointing to the spot
lukaku did the rest , firing his penalty straight down the middle
warsaw on may 27 , for the moment , remains an aspiration.lukaku said : â the team reacted well after the first half
we should have maybe scored three goals to be safe but they have top - class players
it âs up there with my best performances
if we want to save the season we have to keep playing like this
