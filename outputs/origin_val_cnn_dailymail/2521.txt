a south africa university has voted to pull down a statue of a notorious britain colonialist after students threw a bucket of excrement at it
bosses at the university of cape town bowed to demands to remove the statue of cecil rhodes after a series of protests on campus
university of cape town , the oldest university in south africa and regularly ranked as the best on the continent , was built on land donated by cecil rhodes , a mining magnate who died in 1902
excrement was launched at the statue during one protest but the ' poo protest ' was launched by a small group of students earlier this month , sparking a series of demonstrations demanding that the statue be torn down
many of the students involved in the protests never lived under the injustices of white minority rule , but say they still experience racial discrimination 21 years after the end of apartheid
the large statue of a notoriously racist rhodes gazing across an south africa that he coveted for the britain empire made them feel alienated on a campus still dominated by white staff , they said
on friday , the university senate voted 181 to one to remove the statue permanently from the campus , after vice-chancellor max price acknowledged ' the many injustices of colonial conquest enacted under cecil rhodes ' watch '
while the university council still has to endorse the move at a special meeting on april 8 , the statue will be boarded up until it is handed over to government heritage authorities , university spokeswoman pat lucas said
' it is certainly a victory for us , ' said student representative council president ramabina mahapa
' it means we are being heard by the larger community
' cecil rhodes ( pictured ) made his fortune with his de beers mining company cecil rhodes was born in bishop 's stortford in hertfordshire and went on to became one of britain 's most successful colonialists
he was sent to southern south africa in the late nineteenth century when he suffered bad health as a teenager
within four decades he had established political control of britain 's cape colony , expanded the territory north to found rhodesia and taken ownership of the world 's richest diamond mining company de beers
his expansionist plans were fired by a dream of securing a britain corridor of power stretching from eastern cape to cairo
but his short life was blighted by bad health and he died of heart failure aged just 49
following his death cecil rhodes ' remains were transported by train from eastern cape to bulawayo and laid to rest in the matopo hills south of the city , his favourite spot in the vast empire he had helped secure for britain in southern south africa
cecil rhodes , famous for dreaming of a eastern cape - to - cairo railway , made his fortune with his de beers mining company during the kimberley diamond rush , and went on to grow his wealth during the ensuing gold rush around modern - day johannesburg
but the disappearance of cecil rhodes is unlikely to end the debate on racial transformation launched by the protest , which gave rise to similar demands for change at two other universities
in the east coast city of durban , students at the university of kwazulu natal splattered white paint and anti-racism slogans on a statue of britain 's king george v. and at rhodes university in the eastern cape , activists want the institution to be renamed
the protests have also sparked debate among academics , historians , politicians and writers of letters to newspapers
students have dismissed the argument that cecil rhodes should be honoured for donating land for the campus , saying he stole it from black africans in the first place
a ' poo protest ' was launched by a group of students sparking a series of demonstrations demanding that the statue ( pictured ) be torn down mckaiser , an author and commentator who attended rhodes university and won a prestigious international rhodes scholar to oxford , said in the times : ' south africa universities remain a testament to the country 's colonial heritage in terms of what they teach , who does the teaching , and the morally odious symbols that haunt our campuses or lurk in their very names
' at cecil rhodes , 83 per cent of senior management staff remain white and 77 per cent of " professionally qualified staff , " a category that includes academic teaching staff , are white , ' he said
whites make up about eight percent of south africa 's population of some 54 million
mckaiser , who is of mixed race , defended the fact that he accepted a cecil rhodes scholarship , telling a radio interviewer that in moral terms the colonialist 's money belonged to ' the millions of black south africa whose rights were trampled on '
he took the scholarship to oxford ' so that i could come back and show the middle finger to his legacy , ' mckaiser said
since the end of apartheid the names of some cities and streets deemed offensive have been changed , but monuments to south africa 's racist white - minority rule remain scattered throughout the country
much of that can be attributed to the racial reconciliation policies of mandela , who became the country 's first democratically - elected president in 1994
another former rhodes scholar , johnson , wrote in south africa 's times newspaper of his surprise when mandela agreed in 2002 to have his name coupled with that of cecil rhodes in a new charitable organisation
the mandela rhodes foundation , of which johnson is now executive director , provides post-graduate scholarships to young africans
many of the students involved in the protests never lived under the injustices of white minority rule , but say they still experience racial discrimination 21 years after the end of apartheid students have dismissed the argument that cecil rhodes should be honoured for donating land for the campus , saying he stole it from black africans in the first place ' mandela told us to expect controversy and embrace it , while remaining certain in the knowledge that what we were actually doing was what mattered , ' johnson wrote
' he said ... whenever possible , we had to put history to work for a better future
' arts and culture minister nathi mthethwa echoed mandela 's approach in his response to the university of cape town protests
' the government 's attitude and policy to all heritage sites - including statues of former imperialists like cecil rhodes , among others - is based on a national policy of reconciliation , nation - building and social cohesion , ' he said .
