boston dun meng knew to pull over his mercedes-benz suv to respond to a text message that night in april 2013
that 's when a man got out of another car , jumped into his suv and pointed a gun at him
" he asked me , ' do you know the boston marathon explosion ? ' " dun meng told a crowded courtroom thursday , speaking in halting english
an interpreter who spoke dun meng 's native mandarin sat next to him but was not needed
" he asked , ' you know who did it ? i did it and i just killed a policeman in cambridge , ' " dun meng said a man later identified as tamerlan told him
dun meng was on the witness stand in the death penalty trial of admitted boston marathon bomber tsarnaev , tamerlan 's younger brother
he recalled seeing the flashing lights of police cars in cambridge earlier that night
" after that , how did you feel ? " assistant u.s. attorney william weinreb asked
the whole world is looking for him at the time
... i thought it was just a typical robbery
" there was nothing typical about the days after the boston marathon bombings , which killed three people and hurt more than 240 others
timeline of the bombings , manhunt and aftermath prosecutors say tsarnaev and tamerlan had earlier killed mit police officer collier because they wanted his gun
but their efforts to take it were thwarted by a safety holster
tsarnaev , who was 19 at the time , does not dispute he was present when collier was killed on the evening of april 18 , 2013 , nor does he deny that he participated in the bombings three days earlier
he is being tried on 30 charges -- 17 of which carry the possibility of the death penalty
tamerlan , 26 , would not survive the night
he was killed in a chase and gunbattle with police that began with reports of an " officer down " at mit
it was after collier 's killing that dun meng encountered the tsarnaev brothers
tsarnaev 's ' manifesto ' : ok to kill civilians at the time , he was working on his master 's degree at northeastern university
dun meng , a partner at a company that created a food delivery app , recalled feeling tired after work
he drove along the charles river with no destination in mind
he pulled over after receiving a text message
" i 'm a traffic engineer , and i know it is unsafe to text while i 'm driving , " he said
a car pulled up quickly and stopped
a man in the car walked over
dun meng said he thought the man wanted directions
instead , the man pulled open the suv door and climbed in
dun meng said tamerlan demanded cash
he said he had about $ 45 on him
" he said , ' that 's not enough
where 's your wallet ? ' so i give him my wallet , but there 's no cash in the wallet
" the man pulled the magazine out of his handgun
he showed meng it was loaded
" i 'm serious , " dun meng testified that the man told him moments before admitting to being the boston marathon bomber
" so do n't be stupid
" jurors see tsarnaev 's writings on boat after he handed over the cash , dun meng said the man ordered him to drive
he said tsarnaev followed in a honda but later got in the backseat of the suv
" he ordered me to every direction , " he said of tamerlan
" we had a conversation
... he asked me my name and he asked me where i 'm from
first few minutes my hands were shaking and i was having trouble driving
" dun meng said his name was manny
the man laughed when he thought dun meng said nanny
" i said i 'm chinese
he said , ' ok , you are chinese
i am muslims and muslims hate americans
' i responded , ' i 'm chinese
chinese are very friendly toward muslims
' " at one point , the carjacker asked dun meng for the pin code on his bank card
" i tell him the pin code , " he testified
" it started with 86 , somebody 's birthday
he asked me if i was born in 1986 , and i said yes
" dun meng testified that he asked tamerlan : " are you going to kill me tonight ? he told me , ' i 'm not going to kill you
' " the witness pointed to tsarnaev as the man who later sat in the backseat behind him
the men played a cd as they drove around
" i would say weird , " he said of the music
" new surveillance footage revealed at one point , tsarnaev went into a gas station convenience store to pay for gas and load up on snacks , dun meng testified
tamerlan fiddled with a gps device
dun meng unbuckled his seat belt , opened the suv door and got away , dashing across the street to another service station
dun meng begged a worker to call the police
he hid there until officers arrived
it was " the most difficult decision in my life , " he said
" i could feel he was trying to grab me
his hand was so close to my left hand i could feel the wind
" cambridge police officer nickerson had to talk dun meng out of a gas station storage room when he arrived
" he was trembling , " nickerson testified
" he was very scared
you could tell he was a victim of something
