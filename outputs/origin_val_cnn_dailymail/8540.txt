a mother has described how she heard a doctor asking her husband about switching off her life - support as she lay in a medically - induced coma after collapsing from a rare condition
bone , who was feared to have catastrophic brain damage after going into cardiac arrest , lay listening to the life - or - death conversation but was paralysed and unable to intervene
she recalls her husband john ruling out ending her life â despite a previous conversation when she said she wanted to die if incapacitated permanently
the 40 - year - old later recovered and now says she is relieved he went against her wishes
near death : bone , 40 , pictured , was in a coma in hospital but heard doctors discuss ending her life only for her husband to refuse to switch off her life support machine much - loved : mrs bone , pictured with her son david and husband john , had said she would want her life support switched off , but mr mrs bone refused to give up on her â i was aware of conversations around me , â she said
â the most frequent one was being turned in the bed
a familiar â ready , steady , turn â would come from the nurses
â the most alarming was between a doctor and my husband enquiring as to my wishes surrounding being kept alive on a ventilator and that they were unsure whether my mental ability had been impaired due to lack of oxygen while they were attempting to restart my heart
starting again : a year on from her near - death experience mrs bone is back at work and also took part in a charity run , pictured â there was an agreement that i should continue to be kept on the ventilator to give a chance for an mri scan to be done to see if i had any brain function
â i was not even responding to a basic reflex test , which is why the doctor thought i was not going to have a chance of recovery
i am very pleased my husband gave me that extra time
â mrs bone , a government building surveyor , felt pins and needles in her legs on march 14 last year but still went to work
she was alone in a tower block in central london when she collapsed as the pain moved up her legs
she managed to catch a train home to leighton buzzard , bedfordshire , and went to her gp who immediately sent her to luton and dunstable hospital with a letter saying she might have guillain-barre syndrome syndrome
the condition involves the immune system attacking the peripheral nervous system â the network of nerves outside the central nervous system â leaving the brain unable to control muscles
she and her husband claim the letter was handed over but not acted upon and she was initially told she had a chest complaint
hours later she stopped breathing and went into cardiac arrest
she was given a tracheotomy to help her breathe and was placed in a light medically - induced coma
she was on a respirator in an intensive care unit when a doctor raised the subject of ending her life a few days later
mr mrs bone , 58 , who is also a surveyor , explained : â he said they did nât know how long she was deprived of oxygen and there could be a range of deficits and it could be time to turn the machine off
i said it was far too early
â he said , â we have got to be realistic about what might happen , â but again i said it was too early
â new life : mrs bone , pictured left and right during her recovery , had been minutes from death before she was diagnosed with rare autoimmune disease of the nervous system guillain-barre syndrome while in intensive care mrs bone was finally diagnosed with guillain-barre syndrome
doctors realised she had a chance of surviving if kept in the coma to allow her body to repair itself
she was given intravenous immunoglobulin and had a plasma exchange
shortly after returning home she began taking her five - year - old son , david , to school with the aid of a walking frame
now , one year on , she is back at work and has completed a 5km charity run , negotiating the course while leaning on a walking stick
the couple have made a formal complaint to the hospital about the gp âs letter being ignored
a hospital spokesman said : â we are glad that mrs bone is recovering from her illness
however , we are sorry she did not have a positive patient experience
we are investigating the concerns raised
â renowned neurosurgeon munchi choksey said : â sometimes the sedation wears off a bit , so she might have been hearing some of the conversations around her
â but some of the drugs like opiates [ she may have been prescribed ] can in some cases induce hallucinations
so it could be she was in a dream - like state and imagined what was happening
