this photograph was taken on october 6 , 2014 the satellite images form part a un report due for release tomorrow that will present analysis of the impact of four years of war on the middle east nation
un investigators used their satellite program unosat to gather the startling photographs which , according to an advance statement detailing the report , document ' indiscriminate attacks on civilian population , including barrel bombing , destruction of schools , hospitals , residential areas , markets , power plants and the vast cultural heritage of syrian
' comparing images taken shortly before the start of the war in 2011 with those captured in recent months , the un has been able to show the geographical changes caused by relentless fighting between various groups , as well as the displacement of an estimated 6.5 million people
the images emerged as the syrian air force has carried out a chlorine gas attack on a northern town , killing six people , according to activists , as amnesty said separate government air strikes on the islamic state ' capital ' could amount to war crimes
the britain - based syrian observatory for human rights and the local co-ordination committees said gas attacks on the town of samrin injured dozens more people
historic : this photograph dated september 4 , 2011 shows the ancient syrian border city of dura-europos , which was considered a unesco world heritage site target : holes in the ground around dura-europos reveal the extent of looting in the area by april 2 , 2014 an opposition official in the area of this morning 's chlorine gas release said there were two attacks - the first targeting rebels while the second hit a residential area
he said the six killed were members of the same family , including three children

earlier , amnesty said air strikes on the isis stronghold of raqqa on november 25 killed dozens of civilians
the human rights group said it had documented a series of syrian government air strikes between november 11 and november 29 that killed up to 115 civilians - including 14 children - in the city
raqqa has been isis ' seat since it declared a caliphate in areas under its control in iraq and syrian
amnesty said the ' unlawful ' killings violated international humanitarian law and some of the attacks could amount to war crimes
the london - based group said the air strikes included attacks on a mosque and a busy market ' crammed full of civilians ' as well as some buildings not being used for military purposes
clear : the satellite images form part a un report due for release tomorrow that will present analysis of the impact of four years of war on the middle east nation ravaged : schools , hospitals and refugee camps are seen destroyed in towns and cities such as aleppo , kobane , homs and isis ' raqqa since the country was torn apart in 2011 luther , director of amnesty 's middle east and north africa programme , said : ' syrian government forces have shown flagrant disregard for the rules of war in these ruthless air strikes
some of these attacks give every indication of being war crimes
' they have carried out repeated attacks on civilian areas without clearly identifying military targets , a blatant violation of the requirement to distinguish between civilians and military targets
' syrian authorities said at the time that the attacks were meant to target is members and bases , but amnesty said the evidence it gathered shows that , in most cases , no military targets could be identified
on november 25 , syrian government forces bombed a number of civilian areas , striking a mosque , a busy market , shops , a transport hub , a storage facility and a residential building , amnesty said
mr luther said : ' the residents of raqqa already have to endure the reality of life under brutal is rule
punishing an entire civilian population simply because the city where they live is now under is control can never be justified
