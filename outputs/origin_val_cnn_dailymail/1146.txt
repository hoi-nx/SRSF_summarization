george osborne vetoed plans for a ' patronising ' tory election slogan which said ' well done you ' in an attempt to thank voters for putting up with spending cuts
according to one source , the slogan was dreamed up by advertising agency m&c saatchi , which is working on the tory ' campaign ahead of may 's poll
but it was quickly rejected by the chancellor , who said it was ' patronising and insensitive '
a source said : ' there was general astonishment when it was suggested ' well done you ' was a good message
it is patronising and would rightly have been greeted with a large raspberry by the electorate
' we already have a struggle on our hands to rebut labour claims that cameron and george osborne are rich and out of touch
short of putting a picture of marie antoinette on it , i ca n't think of anything worse
' it did n't take very long for george osborne to tear it up
' m&c saatchi went back to the drawing board and later produced the far more successful image of labour leader ed miliband peering out of the top pocket of former scottish first minister alex salmond
the agency was set up in 1995 by maurice and charles saatchi
the brothers ' previous firm , m&c saatchi and saatchi , designed margaret thatcher 's famous ' labour is n't working ' poster in the run - up to the 1979 election
last night a tory spokesman said of the slogans : ' we do not talk about campaign matters
' clegg is banking on female ' floating voters ' clegg is banking on female ' floating voters ' to save the lib dems from an election wipeout
officials revealed they were targeting ' undecided ' women voters in the party 's vital marginal seats
they cited research across 18 seats showing women switching to the lib dems as polling day approaches
aides to mr clegg boasted that women warmed to party pledges such as improving mental health treatment and cutting income tax by Â£ 400
one said : ' our progress since 2014 suggests we are winning the battle for women voters
' mr clegg , who launches his election campaign today , will spend the opening days supporting the party 's ' key female candidates '
he will also unveil the lib dems ' battle bus , complete with radio transmitter so he can do his call - in radio show on the road
some party insiders confess the lib dems face a huge battle to hold on to even half their current 57 seats .
