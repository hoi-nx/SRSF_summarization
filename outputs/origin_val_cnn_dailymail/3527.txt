forget football and the beauty salon - according to a new study , women seek well - travelled , cultured and informed guys , while men seek ambitious , active and creative girls
in a recent eharmony survey of more than 100,000 members , it was revealed that some hobbies can have a significant impact on boosting a single âs chances of scoring a date , while other pastimes may actually be doing more harm than good
speaking to daily mail australia , lloyd and kellie davis-slade , who met on eharmony in 2012 , say they were instantly attracted to each other 's profiles , although they admitted many users secretly make up hobbies in the hope of attracting the opposite sex
47 - year - old lloyd davis-slade ( pictured right ) and 38 - year - old kellie davis-slade ( pictured left ) met on dating site eharmony the couple , who are now the proud parents to one and a half year old daughter elena rose , hit it off on the first date
47 - year - old lloyd , who hails from new york , had been married before and was looking for the love of his life
he knew straight away that 38 - year - old kellie davis-slade was different to the other five women he had been on dates with from the site
' i liked the idea of eharmony because you could put in all the information about yourself and who you are and what you âre looking for in life and what your interests are , ' lloyd told daily mail australia
' i did it for about a year and i was at the end of it and starting to get discouraged a little bit because i was just going through this series of meet ups and dates and they just were n't going anywhere
all of a sudden , kellie davis-slade , who was born in the chester in the uk , came into his life
she liked the same movies as lloyd , had the same musical taste and most importantly had the same life goals

' our hobbies were different but the thing that really attracted us to each other was our life goals and our plans and what we wanted out of life , ' a besotted lloyd said
' we both wanted to meet somebody that we could fall in love with
we both wanted to get married
we both wanted to start a family
we both wanted similar life plans
' i saw her ( kellie davis-slade ) , she was lovely and beautiful and she was a good listener and it seemed like she was keen and was looking for the same things as i was
' just eight months after meeting the pair got married in september 2012 and ten months after that they welcomed their baby girl elena into the world
kellie davis-slade , who is an it professional was interested in kung fu , while lloyd , who works in harley davidson , was obsessed with motorcycles according to the findings , men with an interest in politics are considered the most attractive to women , followed by those with an interest in travel , health and exercise , food and theatre
on the flipside , the top five hobbies and interests listed by women that are most likely to capture men âs attention are personal growth , health and exercise , food , family and dancing
however , kellie davis-slade disputes these findings and said politics would not be on the top of her list when looking for the perfect partner
' politics has no effect on how i felt about anyone , ' she said
' for me it was having a varied interest
i looked at the outdoors so somebody who liked that as well
you just want to see that somebody has interest in a few different areas
' while kellie davis-slade said exercise was important , she believes some of the men on the site put too much emphasis on their physique
kellie davis-slade believes men who come across like they only have one interest are a major turn - off and show that they do not have time in their lives for anything else ' i noticed when i was on eharmony most of the guys would upload a photo of when they are overseas , a photo where they 're exercising , ' she said
' men will try and make themselves seem more active than they were so they would make out like they cycled all the time or lifted weights everyday , when that âs not really the truth
' people do try and demonstrate that they have varied interests on the site
although dating was n't always plain sailing on the site for kellie davis-slade and lloyd
while one woman had posted on her profile saying she did n't have any kids , she suddenly revealed to lloyd on one of their dates that she actually had an 18 - year - old son
kellie davis-slade found out the hard way that one man was n't exactly mr right after he failed to let her know he was still living with his ex-girlfriend
lloyd was different - he made kellie davis-slade laugh and had the same life goals as her
' we just clicked straight away , ' she said
lloyd said he was very honest with kellie davis-slade very early on , that way there was no confusion or secrets to be found out later
the pair were married within eight months of meeting and now have a one and a half year old daughter called elena ' i was always up front
it actually scared some women away because i came on too full on
it scared away the fails and my attitude was : why else are you on this thing unless you âre planning on settling down ? , ' he said
' i think there âs a lot of fear and doubt out there and they âre scared and people so much want to impress somebody and fall in love with somebody , they âre willing to fudge the truth in the beginning
' really the best way to get in the door is just to be upfront and truthful in the beginning and that way the right doors open not the wrong doors
' both kellie davis-slade and lloyd believe many people 's profiles can be a major turn - off , with lloyd claiming women who paraded their wine glasses on their cover photo turned him away
' there âs a high number of women who put their profile photo up of them drinking
i do nât want to judge but i âm sober , so when i saw that it was a turn - off , it kind of gives the wrong impression , ' he said

' a lot of men on the profile said they were into football , ' she said
' really sports mad is really off - putting , especially for me because i do nât like going to sports games
' a lot of men would really push it
one of the questions was : what are your five favourite things ? and some of them would put football for all five
i 'm sure they thought it was funny but it was just an immediate no. ' though the findings suggest that personal hobbies and interests can have an impact on how we âre perceived by the opposite sex , eharmony matches its members based on core personality traits and values , which , in the long run , are far more significant than superficial factors like hobbies which evolve over time .
