convicted bali nine drug smuggler chan who turned to god after being handed a death sentence in indonesia has been ordained as a christian minister
after six long years of study inside bali 's kerobokan jail , the 31 - year - old was ordained inside the prison 's chapel last month as he found out his and myuran sukumaran 's plea for clemency from indonesia president joko widodo had been rejected again
the sydney man was ordained by buckingham , a senior pastor with the bayside church in melbourne , who bought with her a letter of accreditation approving chan as a christian minister in australians
reverend buckingham told the sydney morning herald : ' i have never experienced a student like chan , and probably never will again
he has such a determination to learn , in fact almost a desperation
' ' he is the real deal , and myuran sukumaran [ sukumaran ] is as well
they are living proof that people can change , circumstances can change
indonesia should be proud of the impact they are having , ' she added
myuran sukumaran and chan await transfer from kerobokan prison to the death island of nusakambangan , where they are set to face the firing squad myuran sukumaran ( left ) and chan ( right ) are both said to be changed men since they were arrested in 2015 on heroin smuggling charges reverend buckingham first met the pair in 2011 after her friend founded indonesia charity group yayasan tangan kasih ( arms of love ) which works in kerobokan prison
in february , a former inmate of kerobokan prison told daily mail australia how he was baptised by the bali nine member
he said chan helped him kick his 20 - year drug addiction , and called on the indonesia government to show the australians mercy
when mirdjaja first spoke to chan in prison in 2011 he mocked him for his religious beliefs
the pair knew of each other from the previous three times mirdjaja had been ordered to serve time but had never spoken
after mirdjaja was baptised , he and chan ( second left ) started up a bible study group inside kerobokan prison it was not until mirdjaja ( pictured ) personally witnessed chan 's devotion to god that he started to believe in christianity in 2011 , the indonesia - who is now 40 years old - was imprisoned for robbery
' [ the first time we spoke ] we had a debate about philosophy and christianity , ' mirdjaja told daily mail australia
' at that time , i mocked him because i said that ' the christian foundation is a really silly thing to believe
how do you as a christian believe in someone who died on the cross and could n't save his own ass and you expect him to save your ass ? '' mirdjaja said chan did not get offended by this exchange and just smiled at him
after the first conversation , they continued their debates about religion , philosophy and history , which the australians ' knows a lot about '
this photo taken in 2006 shows enforcer , myuran sukumaran ( left ) and mastermind chan in a holding cell at denpasar court chan and myuran sukumaran admitted their roles in the bali nine drug ring as part of a appeal against their death sentences myuran sukumaran ( left ) has been awarded his associate degree in fine arts , a cause for joy in his darkest days on death row ' one day he came to me and said ' you ca n't fit god in your brain man , no matter how big your brain is , you can not fit god in your brain because god is in your heart , so you have to fit god in your heart ' , ' mirdjaja said
' he said that to me ... at that time i had addiction to drugs inside prison still [ to heroin ]
' during that period , he gave me a bible but i just threw it away and again chan never got offended
' it was not until mirdjaja personally witnessed chan 's devotion to god that he started to believe in christianity
' a spiritual encounter happened during that period [ when mirdjaja was still addicted to drugs ] , one of them was when chan helped me get through my addiction so he laid down and prayed on me and then he did it constantly , ' mirdjaja said
the pair are said have helped countless other prisoners during their time in jail ' chan did n't intend to ask me to stop drugs at that time but how he approached me was helping [ me to be ] free from my addiction
' i had my addiction for 20 years and that 's when i stopped and i realised that he taught me a lot about christianity
i made the decision to be baptised in prison , so chan baptised me
' after mirdjaja was baptised , he and chan started up a bible study group inside kerobokan prison
according to the indonesia , this is one of many programs chan and his fellow bali nine inmate , sukuraman , have pioneered to help rehabilitate ' hundreds ' of prisoners
mirdjaja left prison in 2013 and has now started to preach at churches in south - east asia , while trying to roll out rehabilitation programs started by the australians to help others at 17 different prisons around indonesia
mirdjaja visits chan five times a week when he 's in bali
mirdjaja said he had witnessed chan and sukuraman change people 's lives in prison and they deserved to be spared
' these guys have love and compassion and a genuine heart
my life before i had seen so many lies , i 've seen all the people speak the other way around with their behaviour , ' he said
' they do a good thing in their right hand but bad thing in their left hand
[ chan and sukuraman 's ] message is simple - love and compassion
they never judge other people
' last week myuran sukumaran was awarded his associate degree in fine arts , a cause for joy in his darkest days on death row
myuran sukumaran 's mentor and friend , archibald prize winner ben quilty , announced news of the degree from curtin university on friday
the news came as myuran sukumaran and chan await transfer from kerobokan to the prison island of nusakambangan , where they are set to face the firing squad .
