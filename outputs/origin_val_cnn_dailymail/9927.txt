' it encouraged people to like and share a picture of a qantas first class lounge ' complimentary invitation ' , saying that winners will be notified on tuesday
the airline confirmed it is a scam and has nothing to do with qantas

qantas also reported the page to facebook and it has been removed
' we are aware of a fake facebook account masquerading as facebook fans are invited to like and share a post to win free first class flights , ' a spokeswoman said
