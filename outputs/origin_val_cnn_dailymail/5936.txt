a skydiver narrowly avoided death after a double parachute malfunction resulted in him plunging to the ground at around 25mph
the footage captured on the skydiver âs head camera begins with a trio jumping from a plane over perris , california
initially the jump appears to be a success as the skydiver picks up images of the plane , his fellow skydivers dressed in wingsuits and the california landscape on his camera
so far so good : the skydiver captures his fellow jumpers on their descent over perris , california but suddenly , the bridle , which connects the pilot chute â a small auxiliary parachute used to deploy the main parachute â to the deployment bag containing the parachute , wraps around the pilot chute
it then appears that the reserve parachute , which is automatically deployed via an rsl ( reserve static line ) system after cutting away from the main parachute , becomes tangled
this sends the skydiver spiralling out of control , and he begins a dizzying descent back down to earth from a height of more than 1000ft

but as he slams into the earth with a crunch he groans in pain and shock before attempting to rise to his feet
the man was later taken to the hospital where , remarkably , he was only treated for mild concussion and bruising
writing online after the incident , the skydiver said that he was very lucky to be alive and that some of the people who witnessed the fall expected it to be fatal
