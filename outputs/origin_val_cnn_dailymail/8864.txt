a top policeman told his officers to â go away and gather evidence â so they could blame drunken fans for the hillsborough disaster , a court has heard
former inspector clive davis claimed police were ordered to look for beer cans by the side of a motorway and talk to locals , off licence owners and pub landlords about the behaviour of liverpool supporters at a â call to arms â meeting of top brass just two days after the tragedy
he said chief superintendent terry wain , who lead the briefing at the headquarters of south yorkshire police , told his officers : â we are going to put the blame for this disaster where it belongs : on the drunken , ticketless liverpool fans
â ninety - six liverpool fans died from the crush at the sheffield wednesday 's hillsborough stadium as the fa cup semi-final against nottingham forest got under way mr clive davis , who was giving evidence at the new inquests into the deaths of 96 liverpool supporters , later took part in a bbc panorama programme for the bbc in which he likened the culture of the force in april 1989 to a â tudor court
â the hearing was told that chief constable wright was a strict disciplinarian , an all - powerful henry viii figure , running his own â wolf hall â where mistakes were never admitted or allowed to enter the public domain
mr clive davis said mr wright could make or break careers â helping further the prospects of those who did his bidding and stifling the development of those he did nât approve of
he said there was no doubt chief superintendent wain , whose briefing he described as the start of the police â fight - back , â was acting on the orders of chief constable wright and had been simply â given a job to do
â former inspector clive davis claimed police were ordered to look for beer cans by the side of a motorway in the days after the tragedy mr clive davis said he was told by his boss to attend the meeting , on the monday morning after the abandoned fa cup semi-final between liverpool and nottingham forest , because it would be a good way to get noticed â career-wise
â he said chief inspector norman bettison , who was his superior , told him the disaster was â the biggest thing to happen in south yorkshire police â and it would benefit them â to be a part of what was going to happen in the wake of it
â the inquest heard that then chief inspector norman bettison , pictured said the disaster was â the biggest thing to happen in south yorkshire police â but the jury were told that senior officers disputed that the meeting , on april 17 1989 , ever took place
no documents or minutes of the â jaw - dropping â briefing , supposedly held on the fifth floor of south yorkshire police headquarters , in sheffield , have ever been found
mr clive davis , who retired from the force in 2006 , admitted he kept quiet about the meeting because he would have " become the problem â and forced to leave his job
but after hearing senior officers continue to blame fans , following the publication of hillsborough independent panel report in september 2012 , he finally decided to act
mr clive davis said he contacted relatives of those who died via the hillsborough family support group and also agreed to talk about the meeting for a bbc panorama programme the following year
referring to what he heard at the briefing , on april 17 1989 , mr clive davis said he was left â more perplexed â than â outraged â because it seemed very early to come to a â decisive , definitive conclusion â about what had happened
cross-examined by chris daw qc , representing retired chief superintendents terry wain and donald denton , mr clive davis was accused of telling â bare - faced lies
â but he remained adamant the meeting happened and that he had no problem saying so on oath
