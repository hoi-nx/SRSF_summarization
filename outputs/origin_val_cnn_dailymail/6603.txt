a married couple who were so desperate to be parents they sold all their valuables to fund costly fertility treatment finally have the baby of their dreams - after winning a competition
chris and amanda , from nevada , had tried unsuccessfully for 12 years to fall pregnant , attempting to conceive naturally - even experimenting with fertility - boosting yoga hanging upside down after intercourse
but after finding themselves broke after almost a decade of unsuccessful attempts , the pair ended up winning the chance to have a baby in a competition run by an ivf charity - and this week celebrate the second birthday of their son noah
chris and amanda , from nevada , celebrate their son noah 's 2nd birthday this week noah , pictured newborn , was conceived after chris wrote a heartfelt plea to the charity babyquest explaining the couples years of fertility struggles after starting to after visiting a fertility clinic in december 2009 , tests found mr schlatter had low testosterone levels and mrs amanda was diagnosed with endometriosis , a polycystic ovary and a blocked fallopian tube
the couple started iui â intrauterine insemination â which involves separating out the fastest moving sperm and placing them in the womb
but the costly treatment meant they were forced to sell possessions in their home to cover the $ 10,000 ( Â£ 6000 ) cost
' we became so desperate to get pregnant we sold everything of value in our home , to fund the iui , ' mrs amanda , 30 , said
amanda and chris on their wedding day : ' when i married my wife my intention was to give her the world , but instead we have known struggle ' chris said in his prize - winning letter left : the couple when they first met ; right : pictured recently with noah as he turns two ' with each treatment i hoped we 'd get pregnant
and when each one failed we 'd pin our hopes on the next
but we had six goes and none of them were successful
' my wife and i have seen hardships but none greater than what we currently face
' in the first months of our relationship amanda and i would sit and talk for hours about our future children
' our initial failures did not alarm us , our panic did not begin until we 'd been trying several years
' we understood conceiving a baby can sometimes take more time for some than others
we needed to try harder but nothing worked
' after several failed attempts the heartbreak became more intense
' when i married my wife my intention was to give her the world , but instead we have known struggle
' as we read about your [ the charity 's ] work , our hopes began to rise to know there are organisations that still exist to help people and ease the pain of others
' the pain of infertility is brutal and the tears have been frequent
with your [ the charity 's ] help , those tears can finally be dried
' ' i felt bitter that other people had children and felt sad and jealous when friends started having babies
' in the end our doctor said : " any further treatment along these lines would be a waste of money " '
' ivf became our only option after this , but we knew it would be expensive , and we 'd run out of things to sell by this point
' amazingly , it was mr schlatter 's magical words that saw them get pregnant after they beat 99 other couples to win funding for ivf treatment
after researching treatment options online , the couple came across a charity , baby quest foundation , which was granting struggling couples the funding for ivf
so mr schlatter , 34 , applied , explaining why he and his wife would make perfect parents , and should receive the help
' his letter was so heartfelt , ' mrs amanda explained
' he wrote about our struggle to conceive and about how heart - breaking it had been for us with every negative pregnancy test
' incredibly , two months later , in april 2012 , the couple got the call to say they 'd won the funding
and less than a year later , in march 2013 , their son noah was born
mrs amanda said : ' when the doctor said the words i never thought i 'd hear â ' you 're pregnant ' i could n't stop smiling
' after eight years of trying we were finally going to have a family of our own â thanks to chris ' beautiful words

' chris and i had first spoken about having kids a year after we met when i was 18 and he was 22
we were young , but all we ever wanted to be was parents
' speaking of her struggle to fall pregnant naturally , mrs amanda continued : ' it just did n't happen naturally for us
so we tried natural treatments
i took vitamins and did yoga to boost my fertility
' i even hung upside down , any stupid thing that was suggested , to get me pregnant
' we tried not to worry , but as our friends started having families we could n't help it
' our sex life became like a military operation
each day i 'd take my temperature , and work out which day of the month i 'd be most fertile
then we 'd take time off work specifically to try and conceive
' having sex stopped being romantic
it was like a chore and not fun
' mrs amanda said of noah ( pictured recently ) : ' we have nothing but thanks for the charity who 've made our family possible
noah is our miracle baby ' mrs amanda , pictured pregnant , is due to start the process of trying to get pregnant again , with the embryos created during their winning ivf treatment during their plight to be parents , mrs amanda admits convincing herself that she was pregnant every time her period was late , and whenever she had an ache or pain , she put it down to a symptom of pregnancy
the mum - of - one , said : ' every month another test would be negative and i 'd make excuses , like i 'd tested too early , and try again
' we did hundreds of tests and they were always negative
it seemed like the one thing i wanted i could n't have
i was ashamed that i could n't do what a woman is supposed to do , or give my husband what he wanted
' the couple , who celebrate noah 's 2nd birthday this week , are due to start the process of trying to get pregnant again , with the embryos created during their winning ivf treatment
mrs amanda added : ' we have nothing but thanks for the charity who 've made our family possible
noah is our miracle baby , and we hope now to give him a brother or sister
' without winning that treatment , chris and i would still be struggling to have a baby and still going through all that heartache
we really could n't be more thrilled that we won
noah is by far the best prize we could 've hoped for
' the mum - of - one , said : ' every month another test would be negative and i 'd make excuses , like i 'd tested too early , and try again
mrs amanda , pictured pregnant , said before winning the competition : ' ivf became our only option after this , but we knew it would be expensive , and we 'd run out of things to sell '
