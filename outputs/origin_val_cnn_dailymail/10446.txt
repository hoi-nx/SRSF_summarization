stuart pearce believes neville needs to get managerial experience of his own before he can be considered as a possible successor to hodgson as england head coach
neville is currently a member of the england coaching staff and has been linked with the top job once hodgson , who has been in charge since 2012 , leaves the post
however , former manchester united captain neville has never managed a club or international side before and stuart pearce has described suggestions the 40 - year - old could take over the national team without that experience as ' incredible '
stuart pearce does not believe neville has the experience to replace hodgson former manchester united defender neville has been tipped to replace hodgson ex-nottingham forest boss stuart pearce , who was in charge of england under-21s for six years and also took caretaker charge of the senior team following capello 's resignation , told bbc radio five live 's sportsweek : ' you only really know what it 's like to manage when you 're in that technical area and you 're the manager
' to even suggest that neville could take over , for me , is incredible really
the top job in english football , you need experience and i think you have to gain that experience by managing either at club level , at international level , or hopefully a mixture of both
' you ca n't replicate what it 's like to be in the technical area when all pressure falls on you
' i 've been with capello ( capello ) to the world cup and in press conferences , and the pressure that 's put on him ; ( someone ) who has been around and knows the game and has a strong personality ...
you need someone in that position that 's got the experience of that position
' neville will get that eventually , but i think he needs , like anybody , to gain the experience , maybe in club football , as a manager and after that probably in international football as well
