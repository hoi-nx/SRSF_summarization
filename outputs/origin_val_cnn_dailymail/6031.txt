maxwell ( right ) is set to join the philadelphia eagles from super bowl runners up seattle seahawks frank gore ( right ) is also to join the roster and will complete a move from san francisco 49ers since taking over as starter from brandon browner in 2013 , maxwell was used as an outside corner and in nickel packages
he was frequently targeted instead of shutdown corner richard sherman and fared well , with two interceptions and 12 passes defenced last season
rated as the top cornerback in nfl âs top 101 free agents , maxwell strengthens a threadbare secondary after the release of cary williams and with bradley fletcher entering free agency .
