two moms started a science - themed clothing line for girls after they realized they could n't find clothing featuring rocket ships and dinosaurs outside the boys ' department
jennifer muhm and malorie catchpole 's buddingstem line has dresses , leggings , t - shirts and underwear with rocket ship , train and dinosaur patterns for girls between 18 months and eight years old
the moms said that though they have no experience in the business of fashion , the idea for buddingstem-stem stands for science , technology , engineering and math - came out of experiences with their own daughters
we just think there needs to be more than just that offered for our girls , ' jennifer muhm , 37 , of shoreline , washington , told abc
she said her now - five - year - old daughter wanted to be an astronaut for halloween in 2013 , but noticed the costume catalog only had boys wearing the costume
' she looked at me and said , ' i ca n't be an astronaut
they 're only for boys ' , ' jennifer muhm told abc
after seeing pictures of sally ride , joan higginbotham and other female astronauts , however , her daughter still dressed up as an astronaut , according to the moms ' kickstarter page
jennifer muhm said her daughter wanted to be an astronaut for halloween , but was put off by the fact that only boys wore the costume in the catalogs jennifer muhm and malorie catchpole said that their daughters are interested in things that are not usually found on girls ' clothing , including space ships , dinosaurs and trains jennifer muhm told malorie catchpole , 34 , also of shoreline , about the issue and they were both frustrated
malorie catchpole told abc that her three - year - old daughter is ' very into trains ' and when she and her husband wanted to buy train - themed underwear as a gift to their daughter for christmas , they could only find boy 's underwear
' i was actually at their house on christmas and saw the boys ' underpants under the tree , and it was that moment that it kind of clicked , ' jennifer muhm said
' i said , ' you know what , malorie catchpole ? we should make underpants with trains on them â¦ and then we thought why just underpants : there are no dinosaurs or rocket ships on leggings or dresses for girls ' , ' she added
the women , who have no experience in the business of fashion created dresses , leggings , t - shirts and underwear for girls between 18 months and eight years old buddingstem-stem standing for science , technology , engineering and math - was registered as a business in april 2014
since the business 's origination , the moms have raised more than $ 52,500 for the company through a kickstarter and so the pair filed their business registration for buddingstem in april 2014
' if there is something that is not fair - because my daughter will say that it is not fair - you can actually start working toward doing something about it , ' said jennifer muhm
with help from a textile designer and a kickstarter that helped them raise $ 52,500 to date , the clothing line will be available in july
' one of the things that i 'm happiest about â¦ is what i think we 've shown our daughters , ' malorie catchpole said
' we 're two working moms
we do n't have a background in fashion , and we saw a need and we worked hard
