even by their own self - proclaimed standards , this sunday on sky had the prospect of being even more super than normal
a top of the league clash and a cup final saw everybody from the channel involved on the day setting their alarms alarming early , and making their way to wembley
and it was neil ashton who opened proceedings with a special sunday supplement from sky ' studio high in the stands
there he welcomed among the guests a new face on the team here , oliver holt
and early in the discussion , ollie proved most prophetic in discussing the game that would take place below them later in the afternoon
with a cup final and a top league clash it was always likely to be a super sunday that lived up to its billing philippe coutinho scored a fantastic goal for liverpool in sky 's first game of the day from anfield he acknowledged the league cup was probably ' bottom of the league for top clubs '
but as he then went on to point out , both ten years and today , for jose and chelsea ' this competition can act as a catalyst '
well , as it turned out , we 'll now have the opportunity to find out how that pans out
next up it was goals on sunday , during which chris kamara very nearly scuppered the super
during the show , kammy managed to wrestle himself away from pitch side with ben , and went exploring
a very entertaining paul robinson then told us about a previous tottenham visit to wembley under juande ramos , before which the usually circumspect boss had arranged a team ' stag do ' , complete with ' archery , a mock casino ... and a shed load of cheese toasties ' , during which time kammy had made his way to the chelsea dressing room
here he went on a dizzying tour of the space , where we even got to see the ' tea - making facilities '
so , so far , so good
there was even a great chat with chelsea kit man gary who explained that john terry took his captain 's duties so seriously , he was like ' a second kit man '
and that didier drogba was a fastidious preparer , who would ' stuff his boots with newspaper '
' the french paper , l'equipe ' , added gary
which is where it all started to go wrong
the other guest on the show was shaun wright-phillips , who was also in the dressing room
reluctantly , he found himself being dragged from his seat by kammy ; ' i do n't want to ruin my shoes ' muttered the poor fella
to no avail as they went for an impromptu keepy - uppy session which yielded a best total of one
' you wo n't see this quality anywhere else ' , cried kammy
you 'd struggle to argue with that
luckily , though , the always gregarious co-host redeemed himself later when he produced a knife and fork he 'd ' borrowed ' from the bobby moore suite to present as a gift to ben
so at least he 'd provided some decent service
the next action came from around 300 miles north of the north circular with liverpool welcoming manchester city to anfield
another welcome guest was gary neville on sky ' co-commentary who , it has to be said , did n't have much nice to say about his neighbours from up the m62
what 's more , he carried on not saying it
as the boys in blue toiled away against the men in red , gary had no sympathy
' with the experience they have ... i 'd be embarrassed ' , he sighed
and he went on , saying it was also ' painful to watch ' , and that ' i keep seeing the same mistakes being made
( they 're ) so easy to play against '
not much super going on around those parts for gary , then
time to head back to wembley , where host simon thomas and his excellent trio of jamie redknapp , glenn hoddle and thierry henry not only had the run of wembley , but also a seeming age to fill before kick off
there also appeared to be a mobile analysis buggy that would n't play fair , and a stadium pa system they could probably hear back up at anfield
it all made for a painful build - up
john terry fires the ball home via a deflection off eric dier to put chelsea in front at wembley after the game at sky headed back to wembley to see tottenham 's failed quest for the league cup gary neville was critical of manchester city after their ' embarrassing ' defeat to liverpool at lunch time for their cup final coverage sky put together a team of glenn hoddle , thierry henry and jamie redknapp glenn hoddle kept thierry henry focused on football as the ex-arsenal man put in his best peformance since joining sky luckily , though , the boys decamped at kick - off to the studio where the day had begun
where as the game got under way , things started to get back to nudging super
all of which was certainly aided at the final whistle by the frequent images we saw of a surprisingly uninhibited chelsea gaffer , who even managed to take a fall - yet still retain his pride
' i 've never seen him so happy ' , said jamie redknapp
even if on interview he was a little more the familiar jose
' celebrations ' , he agreed were in order , but ' in 20 minutes , over
things were back to normal for the pundits , too
what 's more , i think this was also the best we 've seen of thierry henry since his formal arrival at sky
with the insightful experience of glenn hoddle on one side , and the encouraging cajoling of jamie redknapp on the other , thierry henry was sharp , punchy and keen as mustard to talk football
with jamie redknapp steering him through from a ( thankfully ) fully functioning tv monitor , his dissection of diego costa 's goal was nigh on a masterclass
' if i 'm the striker there ' , he enthused
which indeed it was , in the end
not to mention , even a bit super .
