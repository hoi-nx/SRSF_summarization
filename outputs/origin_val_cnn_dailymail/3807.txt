ms perry , who heads hamlin fistula ethiopia , told the commission former headmaster paterson groped her ' i would describe it as between a pat and a grope , ' ms perry told the commission
' he then slid his hand right down to cup my buttocks and [ i ] felt him touch my genitals outside of my clothing
' ms perry continued : ' i was humiliated in front of the boys and i heard the boys cheering
' i was disgusted with paterson 's behaviour and thought he was demonstrating to the knox grammar school boys that it was perfectly acceptable , even admirable , to be disrespectful to girls
' the now 41 - year - old , who was in her teens at the time of the 1989 incident , said students cheered when he touched her bottom and genitals ms perry , now 41 , was not interested in pressing charges against dr paterson but changed her mind in 2009
' i wanted to let police know that i was happy to provide a statement if it was going to be useful to demonstrate the culture of disrespect engendered by the school and to highlight the environment and attitudes fostered by the headmaster , ' she said
dr paterson 's solicitor harrowell asked her if the headmaster was just positioning her on the stage
' i would suggest to you mr harrowell that positioning girls by their bottoms is not the best way to do that , ' she said
