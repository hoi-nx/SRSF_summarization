' i 've seen the video and it 's not convincing
' ' mr houda also the trial had been prejudiced by tony abbott , who read out details of that video in parliament
' he wants to milk this situation politically for all it 's worth , ' mr houda told media in february
' the unfortunate result is that it will also bring unfair prejudice to the matters before the court and also undermine the court process
' the case will return to court in may
