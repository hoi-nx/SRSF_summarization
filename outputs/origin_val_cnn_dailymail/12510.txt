last november , the americans people placed a great amount of trust in gop when they gave them complete control of congress
voters bought the illusion that a gop congress would govern effectively , help the middle class and focus on important issues like jobs and the economy
now , after two months , that illusion has been shattered
over the last two weeks , we have seen the congress manufacture , then escalate , a political crisis by threatening to shut down the dhs
there is no government task more basic than keeping citizens safe
and yet gop are recklessly putting our national security at risk to protect their own political security
by failing to do a full extension of dhs funding â holding it hostage with demands that the legislation roll back the president 's immigration actions -- gop are leaving uncertain the livelihoods of more than 240,000 men and women who proudly serve as employees of the border patrol , transportation security administration and other dhs agencies
local law enforcement will continue to be denied access to the grants that help them keep our streets safe
the federal emergency management agency and other agencies that respond to natural disasters , like major winter storms , would have their operations disrupted
all so gop can try to score a few cheap political points with their base
but while this shutdown crisis is scary , what is even scarier is that this dysfunctional governing style is becoming a pattern with the gop
the congress seems more intent on bickering with itself , pushing an agenda to help special interests and catering to the most extreme wing of the party , than working for the middle class
these last two months have been a disgrace , a disservice to our country , and the americans people wo n't soon forget what a reckless disaster republicans in congress have turned out to be .
