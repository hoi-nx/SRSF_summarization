experts studied the brain activity of adults learning 150 ' nonsense ' words
part of the brain associated with learning was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) in volunteers taking part in the study
it showed the visual word form area changed as people learnt fake words
over time , neurons responded as though they were learning real words
study said this shows the brain is ' tuned ' to recognise complete words
researchers have dubbed this mechanism the brain 's ' visual dictionary '
it may help develop new ways of teaching people with reading disabilities
