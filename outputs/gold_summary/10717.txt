two craters in canada may not have been formed by a binary asteroid
the clearwater lakes were thought to have both formed 285m years ago
but analysis of rocks suggests the east lake is much older
it is thought to have been created separately 460 million years ago
this means the craters were formed by an extremely unlikely coincidence of two asteroids landing in the same spot , 185 million years apart
