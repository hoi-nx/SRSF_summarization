axelrod took credit in his memoir for a plan blaming republican dirty - tricksters for a listening device the fbi planted in a philadelphia mayor 's office as part of a criminal probe
but another democratic operative claims it was all his idea â and axelrod thought it was a bad one
it 's the second time the obama confidant 's book has been branded dishonest
a mitt romney aide said last month that axelrod lied when he wrote that the republican candidate suggested on election night 2012 that obama only won because his outreach targeted black voters
axelrod has a long career in democratic politics and landed a six - figure consulting contract with britain 's labour party during this year 's elections
