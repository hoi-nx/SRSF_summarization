rick abath was college drop - out working night shifts at boston 's stewart isabella gardner museum in 1990
was fooled by thieves dressed as police , who tied him up in the basement
they then stole works by rembrandt , vermeer , degas and manet
half - a - billion heist remains unsolved , and fbi has never even come close
gardner museum continues to display empty frames , and is offering $ 5million reward for the return of the works
