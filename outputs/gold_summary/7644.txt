scientists report cape fur seals have been attacking and killing blue sharks
the unusual behaviour was spotted by divers off the coast of south africa
the seals themselves are usually hunted and killed by great white sharks
blue sharks are about the same size as fur seals but mainly eat smaller fish
the seals were seen to pounce on the sharks and then eat only their guts
this is thought to be the most energy dense part of the shark for the seal
