biologists at temple university created a spiral shaped view of evolution
they used data from ' molecular clock ' studies on more than 50,000 species
these analyse mutations in dna to calculate when species evolved apart
it shows dogs and humans shared a common ancestor 94.2m years ago
crows and chimps separated from each other more than 290m years ago
the study shows the diversity of life on earth has grown at a constant rate
this contradicts the traditional view of evolution as occurring in bursts
