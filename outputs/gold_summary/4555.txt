triggs came under fire in a senate estimates hearing on friday
she called for a refugee who killed his wife to be awarded $ 350,000
' fair - minded ' australians should agree he deserved the money , she said
she claims john basikbasik was ' arbitrarily held ' for the past eight years
after spending seven years in jail he was still seen as a danger to society
refugees ca n't be deported so he was held in villawood detention centre
ms triggs said this was ' lawful ' but a breach of his human rights
