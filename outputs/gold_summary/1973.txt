he always considers the potential buyer when planning renovations
valentic recommends investing in the ' wet areas ' of the house - the bathroom and kitchen as these are draw cards for potential buyers
have a separate bath , separate toilet , tile all the way to the ceiling , and make sure the quality of fittings is consistent throughout
