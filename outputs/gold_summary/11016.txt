the dead men âs eyes prototype was developed by dr stuart eve
it uses augmented reality to lay virtual images onto the real world
setup uses the camera on an ipad to see the virtual world on the screen
this can include anything from a reconstruction of a wall to entire villages
dr eve has also created a prototype â dead men âs nose â device
this emits odours designed to make the environment smell like it would have done in the past
