more than 120 feral cats live on aoshima island , where they have just a handful of humans for company
the cats were originally brought to the remote japan island to kill mice living on fishermen 's boats
most of the local residents left aoshima island to work on mainland japan after the second world war
but the cat population stayed and have since multiplied - meaning they now massively outnumber humans
