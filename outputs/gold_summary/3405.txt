two californian inventors have come up with a new type of transport
the sbyke is a mix of a bike , scooter and a skateboard
it has handlebars and a big front wheel , but the back has a flat section
the rider , young or old , propels themselves like a scooter
the inventors say using it is like ' skiing on a pavement '
a smaller version costs Â£ 99.95 and a bigger version is Â£ 159.95
