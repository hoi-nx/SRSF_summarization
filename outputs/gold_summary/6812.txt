the moon will pass between the sun and the earth in this landmark event
it will cast a deep shadow over the planet 's surface in a partial eclipse
unlike 1999 it will not be a total eclipse over britain - that will happen over the north atlantic and the spectacular event will finish over the north pole
go as far north as you can to get closer to the path of the total eclipse
eclipse glasses , a colander or a bucket of water can all be used to view it
the next similar eclipse will not take place over britain until august , 2026
