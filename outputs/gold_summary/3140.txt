richard âs coffin leaves leicester university for bosworth in a black jaguar hearse , escorted by four police outriders and limousines , to start the preliminary leg of its journey . the oak coffin was made by michael ibsen , richard âs nephew 17 times removed , whose family âs dna was used to identify the king âs skeleton .
the bones have been packed in wool and richard âs hands and feet have been placed in linen bags , embroidered with roses by children at leicester âs richard iii primary school . with the king is a wooden rosary , emblazoned with an enamelled white rose . the skeleton is covered by a raw linen cloth , embroidered with york roses , by elizabeth noakes , of the richard iii society .
the cortege officially departs fen lane farm . close to bosworth , this is where the battle was actually fought on august 22 , 1485 . here richard lost his crown and his life , when his army of 8,000 men was beaten by the lancastrians , led by henry . archaeologists found more than 20 medieval cannon balls on the site .
the cortege will be joined by two knightly figures on horseback in 15th century armour . they include dr tobias capwell , curator of arms and armour at the wallace collection .
richard âs body arrives at st james at dadlington for prayers . here many of the dead of bosworth are buried . henry paid for a chancery in the church .
following the cortege is the 19th earl of derby , descendant of earl of derby , richard âs lord high constable of england . he swung the battle by changing sides to support henry , with his 3,000 men . richard miscalculated earl of derby âs loyalty â surprising since earl of derby was married to henry âs mother . â earl of derby had by far the largest army on the field , â said earl of derby . â but he was in a very difficult position . the pillow talk was all about helping henry . richard took earl of derby âs eldest son hostage and threatened to kill him . but earl of derby said , â sire , i have other sons . â luckily , richard never got the chance to behead him . â
after the battle , earl of derby retrieved richard âs crown from a hedge and crowned henry on the battlefield . henry rewarded him by making him earl of derby , calling him â right dearly beloved father â .
lord earl of derby is one of the ten â bosworth peers â , whose ancestors fought at the battle , who will follow the coffin later today .
the cortege stops at st james â church , sutton cheney , where richard heard his last mass before battle . while his army camped the night before the battle on ambien hill , above fenland field , the king is said to have spent his last night on earth at sutton cheney manor , which no longer exists .
among the vips will be dominic , of channel 4 âs documentary richard : the new evidence . by an enormous coincidence , dominic also suffers from scoliosis , the curvature of the spine that led @entity222 to call richard â a poisonous , bunch - backed toad â .
dominic learned to ride and fight in a specially made suit of armour and proved richard could have been the great warrior of repute and that his scoliosis was hardly apparent when clothed .
richard arrives at the heritage centre where the coffin will be transferred to a wheeled bier . covered with richard âs royal standard , escorted by the two knightly riders , it will be drawn to the top of ambien hill for a service of commemoration .
as well as invited vips , more than 2,000 people have bought tickets for the event . battlefield re-enactment society members will have held a dawn vigil in medieval dress . there will be exhibitions of medieval warfare , falconry , cooking and other aspects of medieval life . there will be a minute âs silence , then a 21 - gun salute from eight medieval cannons . â it âs about reconciliation for the dead of both sides , â said the heritage centre âs richard knox . â and to allow richard to return from the battlefield with the dignity and honour that he was denied in 1485 . â
the battlefield beacon will be lit â and it will burn until richard is buried .
the coffin is transferred back to his hearse . the knightly outriders salute their king , as the motorised procession sets off for leicester . the procession follows the route richard took in 1485 , through bosworth , including crossing into leicester over bow bridge â over which richard led his troops to battle . legend says his spur struck the bridge , and an old crone prophesied his head would hit the same stone .
on his return , richard was slung naked over a horse , his hands tied together . legend says that his broken skull did hit the same stone on the bridge . trauma to his skeleton âs pelvic bone showed that someone stabbed him in the bottom .
richard âs procession arrives back in leicester , over bow bridge , across which he led his troops 530 years ago . the coffin will be transported into the medieval st nicholas church , where prayers will be said .
the coffin will then be transferred to a gun carriage drawn by four black horses and driven by a driver in traditional dress .
accompanying them will be jenny , of undertakers adkinsons . â we âre not having plumes or drapes , â says jenny . â it âs going to be simple . people said , â it âs not going to look like the krays , is it ? â â richard âs cortege will then make its way to leicester cathedral .
the remains of england âs last king will arrive at leicester cathedral . his cortege , flanked by the two knights in armour , will be escorted into the cathedral by the â bosworth peers â .
the white rose of york peers are the 18th of norfolk , back from a family skiing holiday for the occasion ; the 6th baron grey of codnor ; the duke of rutland ; the 19th viscount hereford ; and the hon james stourton , representing his brother , the 27th baron mowbray .
the lancastrian red rose peers are the earl of derby ; the 6th baron raglan ; 29th baron herbert ; 11th earl de la warr ; and representatives of the 18th earl of devon and 8th baroness bray . â we âve got red rose and white rose , for lancaster and york , because this service is about reconciliation , â said the dean , the very reverend david monteith .
the coffin will be borne by members of the armed forces , including two senior ncos from the 1st regiment prince of wales , 1st battalion regiment of fusiliers , and royal warrant officer first class from the scots guards .
originally the bosworth peers were going to carry the coffin â â but it âs lead - lined , so we thought it was too heavy , â said a cathedral spokesman . the sermon will be given by cardinal vincent nichols , archbishop of westminster , as richard was a catholic .
more than 14,000 people from all over the world applied for the ticket ballot for the service . the 600 - strong congregation is split between invited guests and the ballot winners . those attending will include wendy daldig , richard âs australian niece 17 times removed . her dna , along with michael ibsen âs , was used to identify the king .
richard âs remains in his coffin will lie in repose in the cathedral from today until thursday so that members of the public may pay their respects .
on thursday at 11am , england âs last king will be reburied in a service conducted by the archbishop of canterbury .
the queen will be represented by the countess of wessex . the duchess of gloucester and duchess of gloucester will also be present , as will the â bosworth peers â , the original ten now swollen by other plantagenet courtier families , including the duke of st albans and lord scrope . many others whose ancestors fought at bosworth have been invited too after they were tracked down by leicester university âs professor kevin schurer . it is hoped that actor benedict cumberbatch , who is richard âs nephew 17 times removed and who will be playing the king in the bbc âs forthcoming series of the hollow crown , will be at the service .
richard will then be laid in a specially dug crypt in the centre of the cathedral , behind the altar . overnight , his tomb , designed by the architects van heinigen and harward , will be constructed .
the tomb is made of slick modern swaledale fossil stone block , deeply incised with a simple cross slashed into the stone . on top of a slab of black polished granite , carved with richard âs boar badge , his coat of arms , is his motto â loyaulte me lie â â loyalty binds me . white roses of york have been set into the floor tiles around the tomb .
