the young couple have spent the last four months doing up the terraced property and it is now worth Â£ 60,000
they bought the property together as part of stoke-on-trent city council 's home ownership scheme
the council invested Â£ 30,000 in the two bedroom mid-terrace property that they will pay back over next 10 years
miss dennis , 21 , said they would never have been able to afford their own home without the council scheme
