david cameron agreed to have a camera attached to his body for a video
it allowed us to see what it was like to walk as prime minister at number 10
film seen him licking mayonnaise off spoon and making sardines on toast
when he opened the fridge we copped a sight of a fair few bottles of vino
he was interviewed in home by susanna reid for itv yesterday morning
