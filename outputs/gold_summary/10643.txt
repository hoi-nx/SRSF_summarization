astronomers in new york have revised the size estimate for our galaxy
they now say it is 150,000 light - years wide , not 100,000 light - years
this is based on re-examining a ring of stars called the monoceros ring
previously this was thought to belong to a nearby dwarf galaxy
now astronomers are fairly certain it is part of the milky way
