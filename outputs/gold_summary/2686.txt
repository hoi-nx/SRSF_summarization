scientists created precursors to rna , proteins and lipids in basic reactions
their tests used hydrogen cyanide , hydrogen sulphide and ultraviolet light
these chemicals would have been plentiful on the earth 4 billion years ago
hydrogen cyanide would have been created by meteorite debris reacting with the nitrogen in the earth 's atmosphere during repeated space impacts
hydrogen sulphide gas was probably thrown out by erupting volcanoes
the research was conducted by chemists at the medical research council 's laboratory of molecular biology in cambridge
