nate zeman was photographing a red fox searching for claims in alaska
a large brown bear emerged from a forest and made a beeline for the fox
the two appeared to be locked in a stand - off but played a game of chase
neither animal was at full speed and fox ran in circles to evade the bear
after a short time fox went back to its search and 500lb bear slunk off
