a court document released tuesday reveals that jurors and the prosecution in the jodi arias case wanted one juror removed from the proceedings
that juror , the lone holdout in sentencing arias to death , admitted to seeing the lifetime movie about the case
shortly after the jury reached an impasse , the names of all the jurors were somehow leaked and revealed online
an internal investigation has been launched to determine just how this might have happened
the holdout juror is now also being investigated for possibly reading information about the case online during the trial
