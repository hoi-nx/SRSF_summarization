scientists at oxford university analysed isotopes in ancient human teeth
the teeth were excavated in the rainforests of sabaragamuwa in sri lanka
researchers found the teeth belonged to humans who ate a rainforest diet
this means humans lived in rainforests 12,000 years earlier than thought
rainforests were largely thought to be human free until 8,000 years ago
