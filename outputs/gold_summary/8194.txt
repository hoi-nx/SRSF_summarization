judy thompson wrote a letter ' mother to mother ' to cosby three weeks ago but has yet to hear back
she wrote that her daughter jennifer , now 44 , had her innocence ' shattered ' by cosby 's ' sick behavior ' in the late 1980s
jennifer claims cosby pressured her into going to his room with him when she was 17 and after she performed a sex act on him , he gave her $ 700
dozens of women have now claimed that cosby sexually assaulted them but he has denied the allegations
