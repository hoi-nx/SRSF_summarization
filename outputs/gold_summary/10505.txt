florida french teacher maria valdes would allegedly say ' ah no ! the taliban is here ' when wardani walked into class
administrative complaint claimed she also called on him in class by asking ' okay taliban , what is the answer ? '
valdes received a five - day suspension and must undergo diversity training
wardani 's father youssef believes the teacher should have been suspended for at least a year - if not fired
district administrators said the degree of punishment that could be leveled against valdes was limited because of a teachers union agreement
