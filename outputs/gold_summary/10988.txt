latest research dismisses theories that yeti is an unknown species of bear
scientists had claimed dna from ' yeti ' hair found in the himalaya matched the genetic sequence from a fossil polar bear that died 40,000 years ago
they claimed that the hair may belong to an undiscovered species of bear
the new research concludes the hair may belong to a common brown bear
but scientists are baffled how hunters confused the fur with hair of a yeti
