farkhunda , 27 , was savagely murdered by a rampaging mob last thursday
it was initially claimed she had burned a copy of the koran , inciting fury
but witnesses have now said she was actually killed for criticising a cleric
farkhunda said mullah was encouraging women to waste money on worthless charms and amulets at a local shrine
during the argument she was accused of burning islam 's religious texts
but investigators say there is no evidence she has ever burned the koran
18 people have been detained and 13 police suspended over the incident
