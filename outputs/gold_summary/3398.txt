goodman bought $ 78 worth of edibles and marijuana with his cousin on saturday and the two went back to their condo in keystone to get high
when the effects of the edibles did n't immediately kick in after taking two , goodman ate two more and a thc cookie - five times the recommended dosage
a few hours later , the college grad became withdrawn and started mumbling incoherently
apparently unaware of his serious condition , his cousin went outside to use the hot tub and that 's when goodman shot himself in the head
goodman shot himself with his personal gun he brought on the vacation
goodman 's family blame the tragedy on the edibles , since he had never appeared depressed or suicidal before taking the drugs
