ritchie 's words have undermined england coach lancaster
if this had happened to me , i would be in ritchie âs office demanding an explanation
this year is all about preparing for the world cup
england put 55 points past france and should be lauded for that display
coming in with no international coaching experience , lancaster has done a very good job
ritchie will regret what he said as england are in a very good position
