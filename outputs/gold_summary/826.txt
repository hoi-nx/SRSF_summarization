the whole pantry is a health and recipe app created by gibson
ms gibson started it when she was diagnosed with brain cancer
the app was advertised as donating profits to charities
but fairfax revealed none of the money has been donated
subscribers were ' misled ' and shocked the app was ' for - profit '
