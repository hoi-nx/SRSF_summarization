spanish neuroscientists gave volunteers samples of red wine to drink while they scanned their brains in an fmri machine
one sample was low alcohol while the other was more potent
they found that weaker wine better stimulated areas of the brain that are sensitive to taste intensity , including the insula and cerebellum
experts say the weaker wine may have tasted better because the volunteers paid more attention to the flavours than the stronger tipple
