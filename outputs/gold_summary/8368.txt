gop legislative leaders said they are working on adding language to the religious - objections law to make it clear it 's non-discriminatory
' what we had hoped for with the bill was a message of inclusion , inclusion of all religious beliefs , ' gop house speaker brian bosma said
gop governor pence says he 'd veto any bill that ' legalized discrimination ' - but that 's not what indiana 's law does
the religious freedom measure ' contains no reference to sexual orientation . ' it simply ' mirrors ' federal law , pence said
