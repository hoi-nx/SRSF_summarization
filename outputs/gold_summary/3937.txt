after a debate that has lasted three decades , the us presbyterian church has voted to define marriage to include gay and lesbian couples
its constitution will read that marriage is ' a unique commitment between two people , traditionally a man and a woman , ' not a man and woman
the new language , which was approved by the church 's general assembly last year , had to be ratified by more than half its regional bodies
many have left the fair of recent as it takes a more liberal stance on religious and social issues
the church still counts close to 2million members
