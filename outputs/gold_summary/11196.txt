at least seven rhesus macaques at the tulane national primate research center have been exposed to the potentially deadly bacteria
they were exposed even though the bacterium was being studied in a secure lab in another part of the 500 - acre research complex
initial tests indicate that it has not spread to surrounding areas - which include a school and homes - but further tests are required
the potentially deadly bacterium , burkholderia pseudomallei , is not found in the u.s. and can be contracted through contact with contaminated areas
