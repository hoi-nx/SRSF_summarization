beavers have been living and breeding on river otter , devon for five years
they are the first wild beavers to breed in natural england for 800 years
the family of nine went completely unnoticed until a year ago
ministers called for the rodents to be rounded up and put in a zoo
natural england said they could stay wild but only with careful monitoring
and now the creatures have passed health checks including blood tests that screened them for the echinococcus multilocularis parasite
