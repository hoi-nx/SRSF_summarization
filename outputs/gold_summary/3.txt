lt col reginald bond , from marlborough , wilts , made watercolours and caricatures at pow camp in magdeburg , germany
he drew his enemy looking ridiculous - grossly fat ones marching across the yard , with huge moustaches , and one as half man , half dog
as an officer , he did n't have to do manual labour , so had free time
he was captured at le cateau , france in 1914 ; taken to the camp in 1915
