scientists at manchester university studied brains of the apylsia sea slug
they created maps that let them look at neuron networks across the brain
sea slug brains share some of the complex structures of higher organisms
they found neurons formed groups that were laid out like tiles in the brain
findings suggest the brain is organised in less complex way than believed
researchers say it could help them unpick how the human brain works
