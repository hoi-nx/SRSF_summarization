water diviner star crowe pens a strangely literary tribute to a white fedora
crowe watched a man kick the hat from his accommodation in madrid and was entranced by the moment
' he kicked it . not stomps , wide , sweeping and confident kicks that sometimes set the hat hovering and drifting , others to roll and bounce '
the hat was left behind by its previous owner
crowe later collected the hat but decided he would not wear it as he is ' superstitious '
' come summer , on a sweltering day , perhaps it will become some hatless persons lucky hat ' ( sic )
