16 - year - old kyle from tasmania achieved the amazing feat
the broad - bill swordfish weighed more than three times heavier than kyle
he caught it using only 24kg fishing line off tasmania âs east coast
kyle was onboard his friend leo miler âs 7m boat choonachasa
' the worst moment was when it got closer to the boat , ' says kyle
