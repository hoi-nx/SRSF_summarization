killer whales are one of a handful of animals that undergo the menopause
short - finned pilot whales and killer whales are the only wild species whose females are known to lose the ability to reproduce as they age , like humans
killer whales go through the menopause at an average age of 35 years old
post-reproductive females tend to lead groups when hunting for salmon
they are more likely to lead during lean times when salmon are hard to find
scientists at the university of exeter say the older females are imparting their knowledge and experience for the benefit of the rest of their family
it may help to explain why the menopause evolved in older human women
