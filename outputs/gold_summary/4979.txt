european space agency has begun attempting to contact the lost probe
philae has been missing since november when it landed on comet 67p
scientists believe the lander bounced into a ditch in the shade of a cliff
but they say it may already be awake but not yet able to send messages
the probe needs 19 watts of power from its solar panels to communicate
as the comet gets closer to the sun the lander may receive more sunlight
scientists have sent commands to philae for it to begin warming itself up
they will attempt to contact the lander with rosetta over the next 8 days
