chelsea knocked out of champions league after away goals defeat by psg
chelsea surrounding the referee : it 's a calculated , orchestrated reaction , and they 've been doing it for a while it 's the quickest you 'll ever see john terry run !
it was like psg had been hypnotised into thinking they had 11 men
chelsea did n't go out to win the match
premier league the best ? it 's still interesting , it 's about finding consistency
chelsea look to have the wrong mentality , capital one cup win may have taken the edge of them . it should n't be handed out so early in the season
both david luiz and danny welbeck were right to celebrate . they were shown the door , so why not ?
manchester united would be near the top of the league under sir alex ferguson . is louis van gaal 's man management failing ?
' babies ' is a good way to sum chelsea up ... but pressurising the referee certainly works
did arsenal underestimate monaco , and jose mourinho the parisians ?
