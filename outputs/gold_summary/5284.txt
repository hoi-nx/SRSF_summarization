jordyn was diagnosed with stage one cancer at five years old
she underwent five months of chemotherapy and had her kidney removed
the six year old and her three - year - old sister spent entire days with a pair of pants or tights on their heads , pretending it was their long hair
a social media campaign is now gaining traction as people show their support for jordyn and other children with cancer
celebrities like jessica rowe and manu feidel are putting tights on their head with # tighthairdo and # jordynisbeautiful
money raised goes toward puppet shows , held at schools to help children learn how to be considerate of classmates returning after cancer
