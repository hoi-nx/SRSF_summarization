former u.s. embassy in tehran is a chilling museum complete with skeletal statue of liberty and ghostly waxworks
embassy garnered worldwide attention in november 1979 when revolutionary students took dozens of staff hostage
story inspired the film argo , starring ben affleck , and the building looks almost identical to portrayal in the movie
every year , iran commemorates anniversary of the 1979 iranian revolution with its ten days of dawn celebrations
on the final day , mass rallies and anti-western protests take place and the country 's president addresses his people
photographer brook mitchell , 36 , travelled to iran and captured pictures of ' celebrations ' and the macabre museum
