nasa goddard scientists in maryland studied past water on mars
they found that 3.7 billion years ago it had more than the arctic ocean
most of this would have been in the northern hemisphere of the planet
since then , 87 % has been lost to space and the rest is in ice at the poles
but the scientists now know mars was wet for more than 1.5 billion years
this is ' longer than the period of time needed for life to develop on earth '
