ryan , 10 , a boy from muskogee , oklahoma , with baptist parents claims he has been reincarnated and was an actor and agent in a past life
he claimed he was martin , who was in the mae west film ' night after night ' and performed on broadway , after seeing him in a movie still
ryan began seeing dr. tucker soon after , a highly respected child psychiatrist who works with children who remember past lives
even dr. tucker was amazed by ryan 's story , and found that 55 of his details match perfectly with martin 's life
what 's more , martin is such an obscure actor that there were no articles of pieces about him at all , and it took a film archivist to even learn his name
ryan also knew the year martin was born , even though it was listed incorrectly on his public death certificate
