engineers say spacecraft travelling that fast would hit photons of light
this would cause interstellar aliens to leave light signatures in their wake
but travelling so fast means there will be significant drag from photons
a collision with a single dust grain would release energy equal to 5291lbs ( 2,400kg ) of exploding tnt
