gigantic device , known as bertha , stopped working in december 2013 after digging just 1,000ft of a highway tunnel
it left crews scrambling to determine the best way to fix the drill - which weighs around 2,000 tons
bertha was able to use its own power to break through 20ft of concrete and make its way to a pit opening
it will now be lifted out of the pit as the damage to the front section is fixed
