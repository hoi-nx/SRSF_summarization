in an email to the san francisco chronicle , the group threatens that they will ' cause harm ' if huskins or boyfriend quinn face criminal charges
say police have until noon on tuesday to apologize , and also use the email to outline how and why they kidnapped huskins
group of three people claim they drilled a hole in her window and used squirt guns that they made to look like guns to take huskins
claim they monitored quinn so he would not go to police , which is why he did not call authorities for 12 hours
the kidnappers also compare themselves to the cast of the film ocean 's 11 and say taking huskins was just a dry run for bigger kidnappings
