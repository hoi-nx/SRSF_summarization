pippa was seen as a breath of fresh air when she first appeared
became famous after nearly upstaging her sister during royal wedding
was handed columns in vanity fair , waitrose kitchen and the spectator
but was dumped by her publisher after her party book failed to do well
talks between her and us broadcaster nbc have apparently broken down
pippa 's attempt at presenting has been described as ' not convincing '
still has two columns and is patron of the british heart foundation
friends say talks broke down because pippa wanted to remain in the uk
