eight eagle talons were found at a site in croatia inhabited by neanderthals
they had cut marks that suggest they had been strung together with sinew
the claws , cut from the feet of a white tailed eagle , had also been polished
anthropologists say it is the oldest example of jewellery to be discovered
they say it suggests neanderthals had used them for a symbolic purpose
the claws predate the arrival of modern humans in europe by 80,000 years
this contradicts traditional views of neanderthals as primitive and stupid
scientists say they were in fact intelligent and had sophisticated culture
