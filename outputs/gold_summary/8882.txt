clayton is due to die in missouri at 6pm tuesday but his lawyers are asking the u.s. supreme court to halt the execution
the appeal comes after the missouri supreme court refused their request
in 1972 , 24 years before he shot dead a police officer , clayton suffered a sawmill accident that caused a shard of wood to go into his head
doctors were forced to remove 20 per cent of his frontal lobe
his lawyers say he does not understand his death sentence
but a doctor from missouri department of mental health previously concluded that he did understand the punishment
