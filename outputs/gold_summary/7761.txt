a 330ml can of coke life still has 22g of sugar and 89 calories
a can of regular coca cola has 35g of sugar and 139 calories

damon gameau spent two months eating so - called ' healthy ' foods for a hugely popular documentary called ' that sugar film '
he has weighed into the debate , criticising the sugar - laden beverage for marketing itself as a product for health - conscious consumers
' coke life should not be considered a healthy option , ' nutritionist says
it has its very own ' super mix ' of both sugar and natural sweetener stevia
' people should be aware that a sugar sweetened beverage is still an excessive calorie product with no nutritional benefits , ' expert says
