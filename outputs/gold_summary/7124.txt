bronze age shrines were found on tsaghkahovit plain in central armenia
researchers said these shrines contained evidence of divination rituals
including osteomancy and lithomancy - divination using bones and stones
knuckles from sheep and cows were used as dice to predict the future
while stamps on pieces of dough were used for divination 3,000 years ago
shrines were used for a century until the area was destroyed by conflict
divination bones were abandoned suggesting rulers predicted their demise
pottery in the shrine also had traces similar to stimulant ephedra
