dominique pattrick and husband brett were on holiday in goa , india
advised to store valuables in a secure locker close to hotel 's reception
four days into their trip Â£ 2,000 was stolen from locked safety deposit box
safe room at three star hotel had no cctv due to guest privacy concerns
a rogue member of staff using a duplicate key is thought to be behind theft
hotel then charged the couple Â£ 13 for use of the safe during their stay
couple can only claim Â£ 250 back due to a clause on insurance policy
say it ruined their holiday and caused lots of ' stress ' and ' upset ' for them
