concept technology was created by austin - based chaotic moon studios
it syncs with fitness trackers , such as the jawbone , to monitor heart rate
app tracks length of activity to determine how much energy is being used
algorithm then converts this energy into ' cpu time on a bitcoin mining rig '
during a demo the designers earned five cents for four minutes activity
and the more energy a user expends , the more digital currency they mine
