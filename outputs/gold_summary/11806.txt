avedon : family affairs is now open at the national museum of american jewish history in philadelphia
avedon , from new york , made his name shooting fashion models for magazines like harper 's bazaar and vogue
but ' family affairs ' stems mainly from his work covering the 1976 presidential election for rolling stone magazine
the exhibit is based on one held last year at the israel museum in jerusalem
