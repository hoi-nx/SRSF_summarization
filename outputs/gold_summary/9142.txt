remains of the two - metre ( 6.5ft ) prehistoric creature unearthed in morocco
it lived 480 million years ago and belonged to the family of anomalocaridids
these were early ancestors of modern crustaceans , insects and spiders
like modern - day whales , it filtered seawater to trap tiny particles of food
fossils suggest it caught food using spine - covered ' limbs ' on its head
and experts claim it is the oldest giant filter - feeder ever discovered
