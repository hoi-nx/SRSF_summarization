often - compared to the pixar movie ' up ' , home - owner macefield , 84 , was offered $ 1 million to vacate her house
she refused , staying in the home she had spent almost 60 years in , forcing developers to build around her
ms macefield became a reluctant folk hero and passed away in 2008 at the home in seattle as she had wished
she left the house to one of the construction crew at the neighboring project who had looked after her
he sold the house to developers who were unable to make their plans work and the property was foreclosed
it is now up for auction and the new owner will likely knock it down with a wrecking ball due to its dilapidated state
