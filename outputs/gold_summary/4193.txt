tate burley was born with miller dieker lissencephaly and died at 8 weeks
the syndrome , a rare defect of the brain , meant he could n't cry or eat properly and would not have lived past five - years - old
tate 's family had hoped to fundraise to pay for his care and brain research
there is no cure for the condition and babies rarely live out their childhood
