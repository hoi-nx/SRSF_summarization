engineers studied how sharp - ribbed salamanders move using x-ray videos
they released video showing the robot moving in a remarkably lifelike way
the robotic salamander is able to walk and swim just like the real creature
called pleurobot , it has 27 joints capable of moving independently
it could be used to help study how extinct creatures like dinosaurs moved
the robot could also be used to access difficult terrain in disaster zones
