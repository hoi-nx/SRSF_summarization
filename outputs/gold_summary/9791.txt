the myford mobile app is free for ford drivers on ios and android
it lets drivers remotely access their vehicles from their smartphone
they can set the cabin temperature before they leave their house
and they remotely locate their vehicle in a car park , for example
it additionally shows how far a driver can travel on the fuel they have
this is based on driving style and over time the app learns a driver âs habits
it currently works with a selection of ford âs electric and hybrid cars but a petrol and diesel version is being developed
