scientists at cambridge university are testing ancient weapons for poisons
they believe paleolithic hunters used plant toxins up to 30,000 years ago
this would have made stone tipped spears and arrows more lethal to prey
early tests on 4,000 - year - old arrows from egypt have shown signs of toxin
the team now hope to test the tips of older weapons for signs of poison
