solar eclipses happen when the sun , moon and earth are perfectly aligned so that when the moon passes in front of the sun it casts a shadow on the earth
on march 20 this year the moon 's shadow falls across parts of north africa , europe and the middle east
the moon is slowly moving away from the earth so there will come a time when the moon will appear to be too small to cover the sun
