a family of 14 walked out of a remote community declaring they had been living in a ' false system '
many of the children were born in the gloriavale christian community in haupiri , on new zealand 's west coast
but the family moved 200 miles away to live with a ' normal ' family as they begin reintegrating into society
the adults have forsaken their nun - like headdresses and white bibs to put on everyday clothes
the children have removed their hooded hats and blue uniforms
the community , founded in 1969 and which now has 500 members , is headed by neville cooper
it has been revealed that he was convicted of sexual abuse in 1994 and spent 11 months in jail
