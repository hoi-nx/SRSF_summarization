researchers from the university of the witwatersrand developed a new technique to analyse the shape of bones in feet
they have used it to show the structural differences between the feet of humans and apes in different colours , which may explain the way we walk
they say the method could one day reveal when our skeleton evolved to make us walk differently from our closest living relatives
