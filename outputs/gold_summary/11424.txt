' previous reports of a crash are inaccurate - there was no crash , ' secret service director joe clancy told a senate committee thursday
he admitted the secret service destroys surveillance tapes every 72 hours
the agency is doing everything in its power to ' recreate ' footage from the night in question he said
clancy was not informed of the incident until five days after it happened , which is why he was unable to preserve videos from additional angles
' that 's just a stunning revelation that 72 hours after they make a tape they destroy it ? that does n't make any sense to us , ' rep. jason chaffetz said
allegedly drunk agents interrupted a suspicious package investigation ; chaffettz says they came feet from hitting the suspected bomb
