boeing granted patent for device to shields vehicles against shockwaves
the device uses sensors to detect an explosion and anticipate blastwave
an ' arc generator ' uses lasers , microwaves or electric current to ionise the air in front of the shockwave so that it deflects and reflects the energy
the arc of ionised gas - or plasma - would also absorb shockwave energy
boeing says it can protect tanks , buildings , ships , aircraft and submarines
