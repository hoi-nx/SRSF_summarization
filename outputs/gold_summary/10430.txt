daniel gerber was ' horrified ' when a solar farm was built on his doorstop
massive development is just 45 metres from the boundary of his property
the Â£ 10.5m farm covers 22.1 hectares and would cost Â£ 1.5m to remove
he claims he was not told about the planning application by the council
took case to court and said english heritage should have been consulted
judge has upheld claim and ordered council to reconsider application
wiltshire council could face a hefty bill if they are sued by the solar giants
