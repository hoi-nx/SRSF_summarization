rosetta mission manager martin told mailonline he is confident of making contact with philae on comet 67p soon
the probe has been silent since it ran out of power in november
esa scientists in germany recently failed to make contact
but mr martin said they have a ' 50:50 ' chance of making contact on 13 april
however , they want to find it before the comet leaves the sun in august
after this , the probe will eventually run out of power - this time forever
