the italian village of capracotta was hit with 100 inches of snow in a day
locals were forced to dig their way out of homes and climb from windows
the massive blizzard broke a 1921 record set in silver lake , colorado
incredible photos show much of the village had to be dug out of the snow
however , the town is not actually located among the chilly italian alps
located east of rome , it is at a high altitude and exposed to the northeast
