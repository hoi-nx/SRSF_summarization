game of cuts produced by sigoma ( special interest group of municipal authorities )
it cleverly spoofs evil king joffrey and honourable lord stark
depicts fictional kingdom where funding cuts mean some regions can not fund vital services while other areas moan about not having luxuries
neill , conservative party vice-chairman , called film ' a complete waste of money ' and a ' complete fiction '
neill added : ' it 's missing the key plot - there 's a black hole in the kingdom 's coffers , thanks to the bad old days of king gordon '
