on wednesday , the army charged him with desertion and misbehavior in the face of the enemy and he could get life behind bars if convicted
he then released a statement describing his years in captivity - the first time he has spoken out about his imprisonment
he recalled how he managed to escape on multiple occasions but was always caught and brutally beaten by a rifle and hose
he said he was kept in almost complete darkness , given little to eat and tied to objects - leading to pain and causing his muscles to waste away
