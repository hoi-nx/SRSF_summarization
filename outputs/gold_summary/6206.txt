cody clawson was 13 when he got lost in yellowstone national park
he walked for hours alone in rain and snow and took shelter in a cave
heard planes flying by , used his belt to reflect sunlight to get attention
harrison ford was in a chopper , spotted the teen and landed nearby
now 26 , he recalls thinking ' han solo just rescued me , how cool is that ? '
ford ' expertly ' crash - landed his vintage spitfire plane in a los angeles golf course after the engine failed on thursday afternoon
