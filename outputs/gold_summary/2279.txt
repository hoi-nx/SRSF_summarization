gp dr chris steele advises people to check the colour of their urine
check the colour mid-stream , rather than when the pee has hit the bowl
clear urine means a person is hydrated - or has had too much coffee
darker urine could be a sign of jaundice caused by liver disease
red pee may be due to food dye , or a sign of an infection like cystitis
dark red pee could signal blood , signalling a tumour or kidney stones
