last week she lost the ' bravery bracelet ' which marks her milestones
devastated brisbane mum melissa took to facebook to find the bangle
instead she was inundated with offers of help and donations for a new one
strangers raised over $ 1100 to go towards a new one
but pandora mt ommaney donated the replacement bracelet to maddy
now her parents have more money to go towards her wheelchair
