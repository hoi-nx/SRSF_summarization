chelsea will find it extremely difficult to replace their captain terry
frank lampard , didier drogba , petr cech , claude makelele all replaced
but chelsea have never found a replacement for terry
people underestimate how hard it is to stay at a top club for so long
jose mourinho knows the value of terry and wo n't let him leave
