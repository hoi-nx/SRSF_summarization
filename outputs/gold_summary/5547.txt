strap comes off truck and smashes through windscreen of passing car
ratchet strap smashed through the windscreen and landed on the dashboard of a nissan navara in the other lane
the car lost control veering off the road as the trailer attached to it crashed into the grassy embankment on the m1 motorway in brisbane
the driver finally came to a complete stop after spinning around 180 degrees and facing the wrong way on the motorway
amazingly the driver was not seriously injured in the accident
