texas senator has been busy launching white house bid for 2016
but anybody thinking tedcruz.com was his campaign site due for surprise
site instead blares out ' immigration reform now ! ' and praises obama
tea party darling 's actual campaign site is tedcruz.org
tedcruzforamerica.com and tedcruz.ca are also making fun of him
