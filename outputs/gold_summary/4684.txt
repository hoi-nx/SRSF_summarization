fire started last night at a farm just off the a130 between wickford and rayleigh , and was still burning this morning
the tyres which are on fire were packed tightly together making it hard to extinguish the core of the blaze
the a1245 is closed in both directions while all trains between wickford and southend have been cancelled
public health england advises residents not to go outside if they see smoke and to keep doors and windows closed
