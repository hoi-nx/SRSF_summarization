diego costa opened the scoring for chelsea in the 11th minute
the lead did n't last as nemanja matic brought down mane in the box
dusan tadic levelled from the spot , and the score remained 1 - 1
mane had the game of his life , while eden hazard was also excellent
chelsea 's defensive pairing of john tery and gary cahill were poor
