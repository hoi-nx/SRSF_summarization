apple has confirmed all models of its watch will ship with 8gb of storage
and at least 2gb of this will be available for storing music and photos
this is the equivalent to just 240 songs and 100 photos
but it does mean the watch can be used independently for certain tasks
the remaining storage will be used for apps and the ios software
to put this into perspective , apple 's iphone 5c launched with 8gb in 2013
and 2gb is the same storage the firm offers on its ipod shuffle
rival smartwatches typically only have 4gb of storage built - in
