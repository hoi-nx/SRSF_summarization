hundreds of mummies preserved and buried by ancient chinchorro people have been found in the arid sand of the atacama desert in northern chile
in the past ten years black wet patches have appeared on some mummies
scientists found bacteria on preserved skin is breaking the mummies down
rising humidity levels in the region have ' supercharged ' the skin bacteria
they are then causing the preserved skin to break down into black slime
scientists now hope to protect the mummies from suffering further damage
