rapper nelly performed in kurdistan on friday at a benefit concert to benefit troops fighting isis and those impacted by the recent conflict in the area
the concert was organized by the rwanga foundation , a non-profit that was created to help people living in kurdistan and iraq
some have taken to social media to say it would have been better if the money used to pay nelly to perform was just given to the troops
