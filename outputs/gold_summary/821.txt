study finds that syria suffered the worst drought on record before the war
researchers say rainfall in the region fell by 10 % between 2006 and 2010
agricultural production in syria fell by a third while the population soared
this led to an influx of people into cities causing rising poverty and unrest
this eventually led to the uprising that led to civil war breaking out in 2011
scientists say drought was likely worsened by man - made global warming
the research was conducted by scientists at columbia university in ny
