phuoc , three , will have homecoming delayed while she recovers from stomach flu
she along with twin , binh , suffer from condition causing their livers to fail ; but adoptive father michael wagner gave transplant to phuoc last month
he had to make impossible decision after it was found he was a match for both - but could only donate a portion of his liver to one girl
mr phuoc and his wife johanne decided on phuoc , because she needed transplant sooner than her sister
family is still looking for a donor for binh ; hospital has received 400 submissions from potential donors
