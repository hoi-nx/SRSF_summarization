university of cambridge astronomers have found new nine dwarf galaxies in orbit around the milky way
they are the first to be discovered orbiting the milky way in a decade since dozens were found in 2005 and 2006
there are nine in total , ranging in distance from 95,000 to 1.2 million light - years
each is a billion times dimmer and a million times less massive than the milky way , and contain much fewer stars
but they are thought to be 99 % dark matter - which could help confirm theories of its presence in the cosmos
