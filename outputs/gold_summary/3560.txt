study was conducted by researchers at university of wisconsin-milwaukee
they measured the male and female plumage colour of 977 bird species
the researchers found some species show differences between the sexes while others have evolved so both sexes have the same plumage colours
the findings challenge charles darwin 's theory of sexual selection in birds
