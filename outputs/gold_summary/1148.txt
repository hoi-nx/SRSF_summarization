the icc has cut the 2019 world cup to be held in england to 10 teams
players unions from the top test playing nations call move short - sighted

rather than less teams , they say the cup 's format should be revisited
a 10 - team cup almost certainly means the likes of ireland wo n't be there
fica represents players ' unions from most test - playing nations , not india
