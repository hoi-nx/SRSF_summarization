defense attorneys for tsarnaev petitioned to bring the entire boat where he was captured to court so jury could see damage from firefight
prosecutors said it was n't realistic to bring the entire vessel to court , and that pictures of the boat would suffice
however , they do want panels from inside the boat brought to court which they say contain 's tsarnaev 's confession note
it reads : ' we muslims are one body . you kill one of us , you hurt us all '
the judge did not rule on either motions on monday - two days before the start of the trial
the trial is expected to last three to four months
