isis leader was attending nursery school in al-qaim on iraqi - syria border
he was meeting with senior aides and dozens of men pledging allegiance
elite iraqi intelligence unit ' falcons cell ' ordered iraqi air force to strike
but defence ministry did n't act after falcons did n't reveal target 's identity
office of prime minister then became involved - but not for another hour
but by then baghdadi had left meeting and iraqi jets hit moving convoy
did n't know which vehicle contained baghdadi , who escaped with injuries
