clayton was executed by lethal injection at 9.13pm on tuesday for the 1996 murder of deputy sheriff christopher castetter
last meal was fried chicken , mashed potatoes , corn , green beans and cola
an hour earlier , the u.s. supreme court had denied an appeal by his lawyers who claimed their client had diminished mental capacity
in 1972 , 24 years before he shot dead a police officer , clayton suffered a sawmill accident that speared a shard of wood into his head
doctors were forced to remove 20 per cent of his frontal lobe , around eight per cent of his total brain mass
his lawyers argued that clayton did n't understand his death sentence
a doctor from missouri department of mental health had previously concluded that he did understand the punishment
