florida beachgoers were cooling down at jacksonville beach on monday
but they were sent fleeing from the ocean in terror after spotting sharks
creatures , believed to be 6ft - long bull sharks , were just feet from shore
minutes after sightings , some people returned to water to take pictures
since 1882 , there have been 717 shark attacks in florida and 11 deaths
in 2005 , jamie daigle was killed by a bull shark off florida 's gulf coast
