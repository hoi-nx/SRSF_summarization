biologists at lincoln park zoo in chicago offered chimps carrots or grapes
the apes exchanged ' tokens ' made of pvc tubes for the food they wanted
the chimps preferred grapes to carrots and would walk further to get them
the apes would even go in search of grapes even if carrots were close by
scientists say it shows animals will search out favourite foods like humans
