archaeologists discovered the bones of an elderly woman in a lead coffin
coffin was within a stone sarcophagus just feet from richard iii 's grave
they were found under a car park that was the site of grey friars church
the lead coffin was inlaid with a crucifix and buried close to the high altar
analysis suggests the woman had enjoyed a diet high in sea fish and meat
she probably died around 1250 - 200 years before richard iii died in battle
she was probably a wealthy benefactor of the friary when it was first built
experts say she may have been emma holt from nevill holt , leicestershire
praying for emma holt 's soul was said to cut time in purgatory by 30 days
