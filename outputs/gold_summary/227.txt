little first got the idea for his ' preservation ' series when he photographed a ' bear - ish ' man eating honey
he thought the photo cliche , but was captivated with the way honey looked dripping off the man 's hands
he found models of all shapes and sizes , including a one - and - a - half year old child , an 85 - year - old woman , and a dog
little used 1,000lb of honey every week , which was then reused on the next model , while shooting the series
one model said she found the substance cold and ' weird feeling ' but then said she felt ' protected in a way '
