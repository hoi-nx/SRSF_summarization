sean delaney was travelling in mercedes with his friend in november 2006
driver lost control and crashed car , leaving delaney with disabling injuries
when rescued delaney was found with ball of cannabis to sell on him
delaney , who now needs care , later tried to sue the car 's uninsured driver
insurers refused due to clause excluding vehicles involved in crime
but senior judges ruled exclusion clause is in breach of eu motor laws
as a result government must pay costs and compensation for the breach
sum is likely to run into millions for long term care of 41 - year - old delaney
