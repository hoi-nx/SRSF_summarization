clancy was quizzed by congress after two allegedly drunk agents crashed through white house barricades during ' suspicious package ' crisis
he admitted some agents dealt with stress by ' using alcohol ' and that he had not known about incident for days
said he had seen cctv footage of the incident - although it has not been made public
one congressman called his answers ' hogwash ' and another told him to get a grip on troubled agency which he is supposed to get working again
clancy was asking for cash to build $ 8 million replica of the white house in maryland so agents can be trained better
