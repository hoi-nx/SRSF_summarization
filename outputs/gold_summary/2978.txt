ravens running back bernard pierce was pulled over in towson , maryland , early wednesday and charged with driving under the influence
he failed a field sobriety test and was taken in and released from the station after being cooperative with officers
this just weeks after his ravens teammate victor hampton was also arrested for a dui , and cut from the team the next day
tackle cody was also arrested this year and indicted on 15 counts of animal cruelty and drug charges by a grand jury
cody 's charges stem from an incident in which his dog was eaten by his pet alligator , and he too was cut from the team
the ravens also settled out of court this year with former star ray rice after he sued the team for cutting him over an abuse charge last year
