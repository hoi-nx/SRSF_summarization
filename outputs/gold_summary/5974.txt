hong yen chang , who died in 1926 , was a talented lawyer who graduated with top marks from colombia
he fought all his life to practise law , but was barred in california due to legislation banning ' a person of mongolian nativity ' from the profession
now the california supreme court has granted him a posthumous license , saying ' even if we can not undo history , we can acknowledge it '
