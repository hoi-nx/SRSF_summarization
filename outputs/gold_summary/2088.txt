salim , 19 , decided to enter a miss england contest with her sister
went to local auditions in birmingham and was told she could compete
but she was barred from competition because she has a daughter
competition small print says mothers and married women can not enter
miss salim said rules imply young mothers can not be good role models
organisers defended rules and said they exist to protect the ' family unit '
