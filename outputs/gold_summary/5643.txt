the new york youth symphony was set to premiere tarm 's orchestral work on sunday at carnegie hall
the orchestra 's management removed it , saying that such an explosive musical reference required a longer conversation
tarm , a 21 - year - old estonian american , intended for the work to deplore war including recent bloodshed in ukraine
the symphony said tarm only informed the management last week that his piece included 45 seconds of ' horst-wessel-lied '
the song was one of the nazis ' main anthems and is banned in modern germany and austria
