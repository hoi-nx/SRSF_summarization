claire dean , 43 , was bitten while gardening in september last year
she began suffering crippling pain and was hospitalised and quit her job
one day she woke up and her face was completely numb and paralysed
tests revealed she had lyme disease , a bacterial infection spread by ticks
the ticks that pass on the condition are now found all over the uk
