marty stroud has admitted he was to blame for wrongly putting ford behind bars in 1983 for the shooting death of his former employer
ford , now 65 , was freed a year ago after evidence emerged showing he was not at the scene of the murder
he has been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and has 4 - 8 months to live
the state have refused to pay him compensation because they argue he can not prove he is ' factually innocent '
shroud slammed ' appalling ' decision in a letter apologizing to ford
he said if he had taken more time to ask the proper questions , he might have uncovered the evidence that ultimately led to ford 's release
