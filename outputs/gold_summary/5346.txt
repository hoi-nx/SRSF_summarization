palaeontologists studied flesh left behind on big cat kills in modern africa
the scientists found that the meat left on carcasses could have provided early humans like homo erectus with enough calories for an entire day
large bone crunching animals like hyenas were not common at that time
this suggests early hominins could have scavenged meat from carcasses
researchers say it could have been a key step towards becoming hunters
