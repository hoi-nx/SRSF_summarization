bianca fazey had a one - night stand with a man in perth on april 23 , 2014
the 25 - year - old discovered she was pregnant and tried to find the father
in a desperate last ditch attempt , bianca posted an ad on gumtree
she only knew his name was jeremy and lived in the suburb of morley
described as ' 5,7ish ' , aged in his 20s , with brown hair and brown eyes
she had no luck from the ad and received some disturbing responses
since having her boy two months ago who almost died , she 's looking for him again now that logan is a fighting fit and healthy baby
bianca has now been labelled as a bad mum who told her story for money
