the million - dollar , five bedroom mansion has been successfully transplanted 14 miles from fargo to horace in north dakota
moving the 4,500 - square - foot , 218 - tonne home required four moving companies , a 23 - axel truck , a slew of permits
new owner scott adelman bought the property for just $ 70,000 because the land it was built on was being turned into a flood diversion
he intends to list the property at around $ 700,000 once it has been installed at its new location
