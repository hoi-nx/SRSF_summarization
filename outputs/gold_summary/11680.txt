endangered female kittens were born at zoo miami in florida just three weeks ago , the facility said on monday
they are being held in enclosure with mother to ' avoid any external stress and allow them to all properly bond '
they already sport the clouded leopard 's characteristic large , dark and cloud - like spots on a light background
birth is a victory in the fight to preserve vulnerable species , which is not closely related to the african leopard
