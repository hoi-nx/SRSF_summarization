scientists at yale university developed a new way of diagnosing malaria
they look for a waste product produced by the parasite in bone marrow
crystals of this protein form inside ancient bones of infected individuals
this allowed researchers to diagnose children that died 1,500 years ago
they say it could be used to trace the spread of malaria in human history
