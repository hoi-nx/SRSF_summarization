three police officers testified about the harrowing gun battle in watertown , massachusetts during tsarnaev 's trial on monday
before their testimony , jurors visited the bullet - riddled vessel where he was found hiding after the shootout
they were lifted inside the boat to see the notes he scrawled inside denouncing the u.s. for its wars in muslim countries
tsarnaev , now 21 , is on trial for the bombings that killed three and injured more than 260 , but his attorneys say he was recruited by his brother
if convicted , the same jury will decide if he should get the death penalty
