kris commons wants rangers to get promoted to the scottish premiership
rangers are third , which would be enough to earn a play - off place
the struggling ibrox club have not won in their last five league however
should stuart mccall 's side slip to fourth they would miss out play - offs
commons says the old firm derbies are the best games to play in
