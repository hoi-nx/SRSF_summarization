the home on sydney 's northern beaches is on the market for the first time since it was built in 1963
not only is the home entirely untouched from that time , but the owners still have the original brochures
the property offers high ceilings , timber floors , and spaciously defined living and dining areas
it was first built by lj hooker as a showcase home inside a housing estate named ' hooker rex '
the owner kenneth hall , who lived there until he was 99 , did n't renovate because ' he did n't like change '
