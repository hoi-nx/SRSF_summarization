rachel abbott and her husband bought 15th century monastery in 2000
all that was left of the monastery was chapel ( minus the roof ) and oratory
near the hilltop town of treia , in italy , it cost the couple only Â£ 150,000
but a two - year restoration project set them back a further Â£ 1 million
building survived until 1960s , enabling architects to recreate original style
but behind the facade , it 's a modern eight - bedroom home with seven en suites and a swimming pool
