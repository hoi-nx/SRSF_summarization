former christian pastor peter abetz has described a school anti-bullying campaign as a ' gay lifestyle promotion campaign '
he told daily mail australia he was concerned the program would elevate lgbti children to ' celebrity ' status
mr peter abetz stressed ' no one ' should be bullying anyone but that lgbti kids should not be singled out
' peter abetz is reinforcing exactly the same myths , prejudices that the safe schools program is designed to challenge '
