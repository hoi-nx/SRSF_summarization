in an instagram photo posted to his account , former meyer can be seen playing with an infant as a gun sits next to them
when someone pointed this out on his post , he joked ' that 's just how we roll , haha '
meyer , one of the youngest medal of honor recipients in american history , has a large number of posts showing him with guns on social media
one shows a sign he was gifted by friends that reads ' i do n't call 911 ' with two pistols on either side
in kentucky , where meyer is from , no permit is needed to buy a handgun and the weapons can be carried anywhere as long as they are n't concealed
the same is true in alaska , where meyer 's new fiance bristol palin lives with her son tripp
