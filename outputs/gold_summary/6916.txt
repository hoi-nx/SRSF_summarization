treasurer joe hockey says the role of superannuation needs to be reconsidered due to the aging population
he has proposed that first home buyers use these savings to buy a property
but those who are opposed to the idea say this will only increase housing costs
the proposal comes after the release of the abbott government 's intergenerational report
it gave a snapshot of the next 40 years , showing australians can expect to live into their mid- 90s in 2055
