loretta perminas took her family to visit her mother 's grave in nottingham
she had been there the week before to lay flowers on her late mother 's plot
but when they arrived the grave had been covered in a large pile of rubble
there was no space to lay flowers and ornament had been cast aside
gedling borough council said it was normal when digging new plots
apologised for distress and said was usually done as quickly as possible
