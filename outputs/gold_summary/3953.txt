a jewish theatre group was denied access to a sydney venue
' hillel ' wanted to perform a series about holocaust survivors
however the red rattler theatre in marrickville refused their request
refusal said theatre does ' not host groups that support the occupation of palestine '
theatre later apologised for the refusal and it had contacted hillel for further discussions
