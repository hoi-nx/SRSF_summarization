wildlife photographer sergey ivanov spent days photographing bears hunting in kronotsy reserve , russia
one tiny bear was trying with all its strength to subdue a huge salmon that was almost equal to it in size
amusingly , the bear 's sibling was also seen looking on in awe as the cub wrestled its meal into submission
