margaret turned 102 on january 31 this year and celebrated by completing more than 102 squats for charity
her physio john abd-mariam came up with the idea last year and margaret initially said ' you have to be joking '
she only began exercising after breaking her pelvis at the age of 93
margaret 's friend pauline sciberras has now started doing squats too
the pair love to throw the ball to each other as well as singing , balance activities , weights , and a little bit of cardio
