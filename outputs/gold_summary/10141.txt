cosby 's performance in baltimore was filled with protesters and at least one heckler in the venue
during his show a man stood up and screamed ; ' 38 women spoke up and called you a rapist . 38 women ! '
fans of cosby told the man to ' shut up ! ' while cosby urged everyone to be quiet while ushers looked for the man to escort him out
' we are here to enjoy my gift . we are not here to argue . let those people speak . we will find them and ask them to leave , ' said cosby
meanwhile , venues have stopped serving beverages during the shows for fear someone may throw a drink on cosby
this happened on the same day two more women came forward to say they were drugged and raped by cosby
