this is according to intercept which claims to have seen top secret files
it says spies had created a version of xcode - an app development tool
this would have allowed them access to programs on apple 's app store
intercept does not know if they succeeded breaking apple 's encryption
in september , apple improved encryption methods for data on iphones
this was partly a response to u.s. government spying on internet users
it is unknown whether this is ongoing and cia has not provided comment
