the unidentified passenger had convictions for murder and offenses related to explosives , said homeland security 's inspector general 's office
despite this , the traveler was issued a ticket allowing them to take the precheck lane
a tsa agent recognized the felon and told their supervisor - but the supervisor allowed the passenger to go through anyway
precheck means passengers can keep on their jackets , do not need to remove shoes and do not need to take liquids out of their luggage
the watchdog , which began investigating in october after a whistleblower came forward , did not say where the june 2014 incident took place
tsa said it takes its responsibility to protect the public ' very seriously '
