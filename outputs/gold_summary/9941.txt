study has found a brazilian community with ' pre-industrial ' sleeping habits
they prefer to rise at 6.30am and go to sleep , on average , at 21.20pm
this is despite having access to the same electricity as urban neighbours
nearby urban residents prefer to rise 07.15am and go to bed at 22.20pm
experts said this is because the rural group predominantly work outdoors
they therefore have similar ' natural ' cycles as our pre-industrial ancestors
the community was discovered in the small town of baependi
researchers now plan to study this group to learn more about how a move away from the natural rhythm could be damaging our health
