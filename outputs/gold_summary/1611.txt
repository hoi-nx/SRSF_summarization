last migrants have moved out of an illegal camp in calais sports hall after more than a year living in squalor
around 2,000 men , women and child migrants slept rough on the site hoping to eventually reach britain
the hall now resembles rubbish dump with mattresses , tents and boxes left behind and will cost thousands to clean
the migrants were ordered to leave illegal camp by police - but most have just moved half a mile away to new camp
