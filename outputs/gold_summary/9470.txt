o'keefe from perth , australia , travelled to thailand for boob job
she booked the $ 7,500 trip as a reward to herself for losing 35kg
ms o'keefe felt like she had a ' pancake chest ' after losing so much weight
after waking up in hospital her first thought was she had been ' butchered '
when she returned to australia the scarring on her chest became infected
she was forced to have partial double mastectomy and implants removed
' i 'm never going to live a normal life , ' she tearfully told daily mail australia
