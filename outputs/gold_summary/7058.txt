scientists predict gravity can sometimes leak into an extra dimension
if this happens , it will create tiny black holes that can be found by lhc
lhc has failed to find any , but study claims it has gravity model wrong
theory says it should be looking for black holes at higher energy levels
the lhc is due to be turned back on next week with double the energy
