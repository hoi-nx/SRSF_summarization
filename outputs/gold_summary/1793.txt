marsden runs business that does ' trauma and crime scene cleaning '
he cleans everything from hoarder houses to scenes of unattended deaths
mr marsden shares disgusting conditions he works under almost every day
in photos , houses are littered with piles of rubbish as well as food scraps
he rates how dirty a house is from one to 10 , with one being the cleanest
a rating of 10 means there is so much filth you can not see the floor
it also means there are animal faeces and bug infestations everywhere
mr marsden said it would take three people two weeks to clean a 10 home
