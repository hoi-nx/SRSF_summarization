researchers in switzerland and the uk mapped dark matter in clusters
they discovered that dark matter ' particles ' pass through themselves
this suggests dark matter may not actually be composed of particles
it could instead be like a ' fluid ' , or something else entirely
' we are challenging many models of dark matter , ' lead author dr harvey told mailonline
