the study was commissioned ahead of british science week
researchers asked 1,000 people about their tea - drinking habits
they found english breakfast made without sugar is the most popular tea
only 16 % of people let the water brew for the recommended time of between two and five minutes
and 47 % remove the bag but leave their tea to cool for five minutes
it follows reports from the british standard institute that said tea should be steeped for six minutes and the milk should be added first
