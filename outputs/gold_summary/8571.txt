pastor feebrey discovered he had terminal liver disease in 2010
he had developed a close friendship with bali nine kingpin chan
when chan learnt of his condition , he immediately offered his own liver
' he was sort of like , if they want to kill me , then you can have my liver '
he received another donation but said he would never forget the gesture
mr feebrey said it would be tragic if chan and sukumaran were executed
the pair 's appeal for clemency will recommence thursday march 20
