drunk mode was built by indiana - based developers from launch llc
before a night out , users select which contacts they want to block
they then choose the timeframe from between three and 12 hours
if an attempt is made to contact the blocked number a ' drunk quiz ' appears
this reveals time left on the clock and asks the user to solve an equation
users can additionally track their ' drinking buddies ' on a map
