he supported this argument by saying , ' a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight - and when they come out , they âre gay '
he also stated that gay marriage should be decided on a state level , this on the same day alabama 's supreme court struck down a federal ruling
carson has long been outspoken when it comes to his opinion on gay marriage , which he compared to bestiality and pedophilia in 2013
the backlash following these statements was so strong he was forced to withdraw as the commencement speaker at his alma mater johns hopkins
carson launched an exploratory committee to run for president this week , becoming the first high - profile republican candidate to likely enter the race
