albert clemens sr âs home first became a target in march 2014 , and the attacks have yet to stop , confounding the police in euclid , ohio
the house is pelted with eggs several times a week , occasionally more than once a day with raids lasting about 10 minutes
stakeouts , surveillance cameras , fingerprinting , crime lab studies of eggs and asking local businesses about missing produce have yielded nothing
the eggs have been traced to a nearby amish farm but there were no further leads from there
winter offered some respite as egg attacks became less frequent , but when warmer weather comes they are expected to start again
clemens is standing firm and will not leave his house : ' i would live and die in this house â but it 's been kind of a nightmare â
