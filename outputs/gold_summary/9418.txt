giffords spoke on wednesday calling for expanded criminal background checks on all commercial firearms sales
the nra tweeted a link on thursday to a story which argued that background checks do n't reduce gun violence and mocked giffords
she was shot in the head by a crazed gunman in 2011 by jared loughner , who had passed a background check
up until now the nra has refrained from attacking giffords over her gun safety attempts since she almost died
rep. kathleen rice , who is among the co-sponsors of the bill , called the nra 's response as pathetic
