gupta , 25 , is charged with second - degree murder after waugh , 23 , was found stabbed to death in gupta 's apartment in virginia
gupta initially confessed to the 2013 crime saying he did it because waugh was cheating with his girlfriend
but gupta 's attorneys have claimed he only made the confession as he was protecting his now ex-girlfriend taylor gould , who had in fact killed waugh
taylor gould says she was too drunk the night of the murder to remember
