el greco 's ' portrait of a gentleman ' seized by gestapo from vienna in 1944
belonged to jewish businessman julius priester , who fled country in 1938
one of 50 works taken from the family collection by nazis during the war
later revealed the painting had been sold to a new york art dealer in 1952
but the dealer denied all knowledge - and was only rediscovered last year
the el greco has now been returned to the family in its original frame
