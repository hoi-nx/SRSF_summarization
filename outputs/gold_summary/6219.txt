chelsea beat tottenham 2 - 0 to win the capital one cup on sunday
goals from john terry and kyle walker ( og ) were enough for the blues
diego costa was heavily influential in his side 's wembley win
he clashed with eric dier , nabil bentaleb and kyle walker in the first half
the 26 - year - old had the last laugh though as chelsea won the first competitive piece of silverware available this season
