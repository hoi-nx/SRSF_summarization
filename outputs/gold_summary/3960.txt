large male hoff crabs live highest on the mineral spires of antarctica
at the base of the mineral spires , smaller males mingle with females
males take advantage of conditions to grow bacteria on their hairy chests
they then scrap off bacteria using comb - like mouthparts and eat them
but females ca n't stay there as the warm mineral - rich fluids seeping from the seafloor can be toxic to their young
