mrs obama towered over emperor akihito and stumbled as she tried to bow , shake his hand and curtsey at once
she also grabbed japan 's first lady in a hug - and - handshake combination while she was mid-bow
the awkward trip is being described as a ' makeup call ' after mrs obama failed to accompany the president to japan last year
tensions are high after death threats to the u.s. ambassador to japan
mrs obama wore a green printed dress from kenzo âs fall 2014 collection , followed by a striking flower - print suit
