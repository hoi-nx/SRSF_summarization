spanish astronomers have revealed a new theory for a ' y ' shape on venus
they say it is formed by winds pushing a ' wave ' of clouds on the planet
these winds move faster at higher altitudes , creating the odd shape
winds on venus can circle the planet in four to five earth days
but the planet takes 243 earth days to rotate , amplifying the y shape
