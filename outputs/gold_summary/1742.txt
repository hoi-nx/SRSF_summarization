dyson inventor sir dyson has invested $ 15 million in sakti3
firm 's solid - state battery stores more power than standard lithium - ion
solid - state batteries ( ssbs ) are typically smaller than li - ion batteries
ssbs replace liquid electrolyte in current li - ion with a metal coating
this makes them more robust , safer and can double the energy density
batteries will feature in dyson 's range of cordless vacuum cleaners
technology could also be used in smartphones to double battery life
