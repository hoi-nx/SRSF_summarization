blackstone said monday it is buying the 110 - story building
formerly known as the willis tower , the building is the tenth tallest in the world
it was renamed willis tower in 2009 after willis north america , an insurance brokerage that is a tenant in the tower , bought naming rights
purchase adds 3.8million square feet of space to new york - based blackstone 's huge investment portfolio
