fighter jet f-35b 's internal weapons bay is too small for a sdb ii ( sdb ii ) load
though it 's mandated that an f-35b hold eight sdb iis in the bay , only four can reportedly fit
a f - 35 program spokesman has said changes are being made so the fighter jet can be released on schedule
the sdb ii can employ a number of techniques - including imaging infrared , laser , and radar homing - to hit targets
the f - 35 program will cost an estimated $ 590billion over the next decade
f-35b is slated to be used by the british royal navy on the hms queen elizabeth aircraft carrier
