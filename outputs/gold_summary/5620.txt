boddy sold 55 horse carcasses without keeping record of the sales
abattoir boss from yorkshire claimed 37 were sold to italian restaurants
but food standards agency investigators could not back up his claims
he was found guilty of failing to produce proper paperwork for carcasses
there is no proof to suggest boddy tried to pass off horsemeat as beef
it is impossible to know where meat ended up because rules were broken
he and a colleague are the first involved in 2013 scandal to be sentenced
