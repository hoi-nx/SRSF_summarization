researchers from the university of exeter simulated the effects of street lighting on artificial grassland plots containing insects
they exposed them to two types of light spewed out by streetlamps
found amber light stopped a wild relative of peas flowering
plant is a key source of food for aphids and their numbers declined
other studies have shown that bats are less active around artificial lighting and that blackbirds reach sexual maturity faster
