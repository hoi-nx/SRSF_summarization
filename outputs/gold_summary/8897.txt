we tested the sport model and the gold edition apple watch
while in images they look chunky , on the wrist they feel much lighter
the watch 's crown , button and touchscreen can be confusing at first
but the touchscreen is accurate , easy to use and astonishingly bright
the watch 's main selling point seems to be its time - saving potential
