swarbrick showed a red card to mcauley after just 89 seconds of the match at the etihad stadium
but last man craig dawson should have been sent off for the original foul as bony broke through
mcauley had made a secondary challenge on bony as he entered the penalty area
up against 10 men for 88 minutes , city won easily thanks to bony , fernando and silva
ivorian striker bony scored his first goal for the club with a neat spin and finish on 25 minutes
fernando doubled the advantage five minutes before the break after west brom failed to clear a corner
silva made sure in the second - half , touching in a stevan jovetic shot from close range
city are now three points behind chelsea at the top of the premier league though have played two games more
