a hilarious property sign has been spotted in victoria with the image shared on social media
a poorly - worded real estate sign has been corrected in red pen
an anonymous grammar fanatic has used a permanent marker to make changes to the barely legible copy
the sign was awarded a dismal grade of d + and the real estate agents were implored to take more care with proofreading
the fussy vandal did applaud the agents for their presentation efforts
