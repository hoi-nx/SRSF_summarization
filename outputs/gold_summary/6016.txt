micro-pig eats , sleeps and drinks at owner 's pub in west norwood , london
but she soon started finishing off the dregs from customers ' pint glasses
landlords only realised when she started butting into the customers ' legs
the pig also recently broke into the bar and ate big bag of dry - roasted nuts
vicky taylor-ross , who runs pub with husband ian , said : ' she 's just like a dog , only craftier '
