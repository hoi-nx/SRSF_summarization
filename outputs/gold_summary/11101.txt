a ' sexist ' billboard advertising a kitchen along with the words , ' your wife wants me , ' compelled siena college students to protest last week
both male and female students held signs with phrases that said things like , ' men can make their own sandwiches '
teakwood builders said the sign was , ' meant to appeal to women who have a sense of humor ' and ' a sense of history ' and was just a joke
