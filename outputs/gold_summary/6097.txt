a priest made controversial comments at a primary school on friday
the comments related to the death of melbourne woman jill meagher
he said if her faith had been stronger she may not have been killed
she should have been ' home in bed ' instead of ' walking the street ' , he said
a church official has been forced to apologise for the heinous comments
' we do not share the sentiment of the homily this morning and we certainly apologise for the hurt that this homily may have caused today '
