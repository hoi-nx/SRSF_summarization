yes , messi is a genius . every time i see him play live , it is a privilege
and yes , he was mesmerising against manchester city at the nou camp
what saddens me about the relentless championing of messi , though , is that the idea there has never been anyone to match him has become such an aggressive orthodoxy
it is as though messi has become a god and the idea that he might have a rival is sacrilege
as a football fan , i worship messi , too , but i do nât think he âs the best there âs ever been . it 's too early for that
