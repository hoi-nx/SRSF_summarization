two bottled beers were recovered from a shipwreck in 2010
schooner was found off the coast of the ãland islands , finland
initial taste tests said beers were â vinegary , goaty and tasted of sour milk â
this was caused by bacteria that had grown in the bottles over the years
but chemical analysis of the samples revealed specific flavours
these include â green leaf â flavours , sweet apple and rose compounds
this makes them similar to modern lagers and ales rather than stouts
