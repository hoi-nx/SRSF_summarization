a mandatory , 15.5 per cent ' social contribution ' was introduced on both capital gains and rental income
this meant that britons were paying into two social security systems , and effectively being taxed twice
the european court of justice has ruled that this violated eu law , meaning that thousands of britons are in line for substantial payouts
