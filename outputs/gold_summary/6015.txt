shadow chancellor ed balls says he is ' absolutely looking ' at non doms
non-domiciled foreigners live in uk but avoid tax on overseas income
116,000 non-doms who only pay taxes on money brought into the country
they pay Â£ 30,000 a year if they had been resident for 7 of the last 10 years
this rises to Â£ 90,000 for those who have lived here for 17 of past 20 years
