nasa astronomers in california have found a planet in a multi-star system
30 ari b has four stars in its system - two sets of binary stars
all four stars would be visible from the planet , even in daylight
but its highly unlikely that the planet or any moons it has could host life
discovery suggests that 4 % of sun - like stars are in quadruple systems
