dolce have come under fire for a 2007 ad that depicts the gang rape of a woman who is being restrained as a group of men look on
publicist kelly cutrone posted the ad on twitter , noting ; ' i guess simulating gang bangs are fine - but ivf and same sex marriage are not '
the ad was ultimately pulled soon after it ran back in 2007 , though the duo referred to people who were offended as ' a bit backward '
this just days after designers dolce and dolce were attacked when they called ivf babies ' synthetic '
parents of ivf babies , inclduing elton john and ricky martin , came out against the design duo
dolce said that the comment was taken out of context , noting that all families are ' legitimate '
