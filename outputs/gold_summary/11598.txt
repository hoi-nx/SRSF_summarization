lab mix , hero , had spent weeks eluding rescuers in a dallas , texas , park
but on tuesday night , dog greeted them with loud and persistent barking
every time they moved closer to him , hero inched backward and barked
rescuers followed dog to burnt - out tree , located by a creek in woodland
incredibly , they discovered ten sick , newborn puppies and weak mother
11 rescued animals are now in a foster home ; have been joined by hero
dogrrr-rescue , rehab , reform said it ' still can not believe ' dog 's actions
