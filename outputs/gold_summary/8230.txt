nigeria military says it has destroyed the jihadi 's headquarters in gwoza
north - east nigeria city is a boko haram stronghold and de facto capital
it is also where the terrorists were thought to have been hiding nearly 300 schoolgirls who were abducted in nearby chibok almost a year ago
critics have been quick to question the announcement 's timing , however
it comes just one day before nigeria 's president goodluck jonathan - who has been criticised for not defeating boko haram - stands for reelection
