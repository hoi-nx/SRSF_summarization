simpson 's donkey at gallipoli was not the only animal hero that helped australian troops during the conflit
a whole range of animals were used on the battlefields and made a significant contribution
horses and donkeys carried wounded soldiers or equipment , while cats played a crucial rat - catcher role
pigeons carried vital messages from the frontlines to commanders when lines were cut and runners were n't viable
innovative soldiers would collect glow worms and put them in jars to use them as lights on the field
even kangaroos shipped from home became companions for soldiers recuperating from their wounds
