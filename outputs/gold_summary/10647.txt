research was carried out by a team from michigan state university
they used genetic algorithms to model a large population of robot brains
these were asked to perform tasks , such as finding the exit to a maze
those that performed the task best had simulated ' offspring ' and multiplied
in so doing they could learn to perform tasks better and better
it simulates charles darwin 's theory of natural selection
