krispy kreme has partnered with the wilmington blue rocks to design a hot dog topped with bacon and raspberry jam inside of a glazed donut bun
the finger licking concoction will be available at the stadium next month and the baseball team is asking fans to give the treat a name
so far a few of the suggestions on twitter have been the ' kremey weenie ' or ' rocky 's sweet meats , ' by tweeter spencer graves
if the hot dog is a hot seller that krispy kreme may start selling it in their stores nationwide in the hopes of attracting more customers
