british tourists were taking part in a sunset cruise along the zambezi river
they spotted a number of crocodiles feeding on the banks of the river
but they were horrified to see that the reptiles were eating body of a man
group alerted officials but remains had vanished by the time they arrived
it is thought body may have been a poacher shot by rangers days earlier
