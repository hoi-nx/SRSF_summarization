the whole pantry is a health and recipe app created by gibson
ms gibson started it when she was diagnosed with brain cancer
the app was advertised as donating profits to charities
but fairfax revealed none of the money has been donated
now is has also been claimed her cancer had not spread
ms gibson said she was ' humiliated ' and had been ' misdiagnosed '
