a fishing guide has been slammed over his alleged behaviour
manager beale was accused of hurling abuse , defecating off the boat and hitting a catfish with a baseball bat
but beale has hit back , saying these allegations are ' false and distorted '
he said he never defecated off the boat and the claims were ' pure lies '
beale added catfish are a ' pest ' so he ' assists to minimise the population '
' customer service is our business and i 'm saddened to read these claims '
