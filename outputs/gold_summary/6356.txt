huge volcanic eruption has been blamed for the demise of neanderthals
scientists at university of california berkeley modeled the eruption impact
they found the eruption in italy cooled europe 's climate by 2 - 4 degrees c
however , researchers say there was less cooling where neanderthals lived
this suggests the eruption did not play a role in the demise of the species
competition with modern humans was most likely candidate , say scientists
