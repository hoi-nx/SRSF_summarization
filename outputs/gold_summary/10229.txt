it calls itself â part gameshow , part action role - playing game â

they must solve puzzles and battle monsters to win rewards
but these rewards are then given to an audience watching the game online
audience members choose how these rewards are used by contestants
and when a contestant dies in the game they can never play it again
instead , their place is taken by a member of the online audience
