fujitsu has developed an iris authentication system
it unlocks a smartphone screen by scanning your eyes
and it can be used to log into facebook , email or other sites
technology recognises iris pattern by shining infrared light onto the eyes
it takes an image of the iris pattern with the infrared camera which is then cross-referenced each time the user looks at their phone
