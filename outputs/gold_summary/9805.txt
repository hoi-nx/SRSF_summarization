scientists at university of tã¼bingen , germany , grew bacteria on magnetite
one species of bacteria harvested electrons from the mineral and another dumped electrons back on iron in the mineral at night
the amount of energy stored is too low to be used as a new power source
but other species may create stronger charges for natural batteries
