artwork first appeared on side of pub in hounslow , west london , in 2007
showed a girl in pigtails with the word ' smile ' in brightly coloured letters
over the weekend , it was defaced and now only her eyes remain visible
locals are furious , saying it had been the ' only decent thing ' in the area
