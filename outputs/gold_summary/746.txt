liverpool drew 0 - 0 against blackburn in their fa cup quarter - final tie at anfield on sunday
there were four decent penalty appeals during the game
referee marriner got every one of them correct
the two handballs in the first half were accidental and kilgallon played the ball despite adam lallana going down under the challenge
kilgallon made contact with sturridge in the box , but marriner was also right to wave play on as the former knew he was n't going to get the ball
