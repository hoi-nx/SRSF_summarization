sam mullet sr and 15 others convicted three years ago of ' beard - cutting '
they restrained and chopped off hair and beards of amish rivals in 2011
but last year , hate crimes convictions were overturned following appeal
on monday , seven men were resentenced and had prison terms reduced
mullet 's 15 - year sentence was lowered to only 10 years and nine months
eight other defendants , including six women , have already served terms
hair and beards have great spiritual significance within the amish faith
