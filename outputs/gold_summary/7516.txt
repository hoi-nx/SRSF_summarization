it 's time to judge what brook is made of when he makes his comeback from being stabbed
i want to make summer fight with juan manuel marquez , brandon rios or keith thurman if brook beats jo jo dan on march 28
but june 13 at wembley works if amir khan wants to talk
then we want the winner of floyd mayweather and manny pacquiao
talks have started over carl frampton vs scott quigg
i will make luke campbell vs tommy coyle in hull in mid-july
