charla nash was disfigured in a 2009 attack by a rampaging chimpanzee
she was mauled by her employer 's 200 - pound pet in stamford , connecticut
the u.s. military paid for a full face transplant for the 61 - year - old in 2011
it is funding follow - up treatment costing hundreds of thousands of dollars
they hope lessons learned can aid disfigured soldiers returning from war
nash will be weaned off anti-rejection drugs taken since the transplant
the treatment is to take place at boston 's brigham and women 's hospital
