a unique mercedes sls 300 had been transported from germany to be shown off at the sussex track on saturday
but disaster struck as it ploughed into the back of a 1959 lister-jaguar as it slowed to enter the circuit 's pit lane
fans were left stunned as the cars smashed into each other before coming to a halt , badly damaged , on the track
neither driver was badly injured , although it is feared the repair bill for the two cars will be well in excess of Â£ 100,000
