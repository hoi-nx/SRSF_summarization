a team of scientists travelled to svalbard to observe the solar eclipse using an array of instruments
they studied the sun 's corona , plasma around the sun that can only be seen during a total eclipse
they hope to work out why the corona is 300 times hotter than the surface , something that remains a mystery
with the experiments successful , they are now looking at their data , which includes measurements of radiation
