the sentence for diana durand , 48 , was unexpected because prosecutors had not recommended anything more than probation
she directed more than $ 10,000 in campaign contributions to two candidates , including grimm , through straw donors whom she reimbursed
punishment could foreshadow a prison term for grimm , who pleaded guilty in december to an unrelated tax felony evasion charge
he is scheduled for sentencing by a separate judge in june
