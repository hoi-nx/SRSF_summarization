william ' flynn was granted parole by a three - person board in new hampshire on thursday - his 41st birthday
he is being held in a prison in maine so took part in the hearing by phone
he will not be freed before june 4 but will then be reunited with his wife kelly , whom he married from behind bars in 2006
flynn was seduced by teacher pamela smart , then 22 , and shot dead her husband gregg smart , 24 , in 1990
at pamela smart 's trial , flynn said she had threatened to break up with him if he did n't kill her husband , but she denies knowing about the murder
smart is serving life in prison without the possibility of parole
the case inspired the 1995 movie ' to die for ' starring nicole kidman and joaquin phoenix
