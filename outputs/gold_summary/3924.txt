franklin had lights put up in november after he had a stroke
father - of - ten from dunstable kept them up for his autistic son bradley
irate neighbour sent him poison - pen letter calling his family ' pikeys '
note said : ' i do n't want to keep driving past this eyesore . i know you live in a council house but there 's no need to make it look like one '
mr franklin say he will put even more lights up to raise money for charity
he said : ' we 're going to make sure the house is covered and really give them something to whine about '
