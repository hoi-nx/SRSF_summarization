mike basich bought a 4,000 square - foot house when he was professional and earned around $ 170,000 a year
but he shunned the lifestyle for the sierra nevada mountains and has built his very own tiny home from scratch
it is set on a 40 - acre ' private resort ' in california , surrounded by mountainous terrain perfect for snowboarding
the house does n't have a toilet or electricity - but he has a hot tub and his very own chairlift
