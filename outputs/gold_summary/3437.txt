a member of penn state 's kappa delta rho fraternity has defended the posting of disturbing images of unconscious female students
describing the posts in a private facebook group as ' satirical ' and the incident as ' minor ' , he likened them to snapchats
he accused the media of trying to ruin people 's reputations and that sharing the pictures was acceptable in a ' private group of 144 people '
the defense came as screenshots of comments under one of the photos came to light including demeaning language and : ' i banged her lol '
police say that possible charges include invasion of privacy and harassment
