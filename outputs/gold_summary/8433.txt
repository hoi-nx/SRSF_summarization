glaser , a vice principal at comanche springs elementary school in fort worth , texas was placed on leave because she had vaginal bleeding
the school claimed her bleeding was due to ' severe stress ' while glaser 's doctor explained it was because an iud was lodged in her uterine wall
once parents got wind of this news , many rallied behind glaser , and seemed to place most of the blame on the principal , maurer
a former teacher has accused maurer of ' bullying tactics ' and said working with her was like ' working with a person in the seventh grade '
maurer soon filed a police report against an employee on leave claiming she and her husband were harassing her
parents brought this situation up at a meeting monday , along with staff drinking on campus and the use of disparaging nicknames for students
