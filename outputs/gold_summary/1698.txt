north carolina jury decided unanimously that joseph mitchell , 50 , is not guilty of murder and attempted murder
mitchell strangled to death his 4 - year - old son , blake , and tried to kill his two older siblings while wearing a mask in september 2010
expert witness said mitchell had a sleep disorder and was unconscious at the time of his attacks
prosecutors argued mitchell 's financial troubles drove him to kill
jurors later said their hands were tied under the law because they were not allowed by the judge to convict mitchell of manslaughter
