new orleans city authorities are organizing huge auction of vacant homes
mixture of tumbledown shacks , empty lots - and at least one apartment
buyers have to contribute $ 650 deposit and $ 3,000 in transaction fees
but there is no minimum price at the auction itself
all homes have been unclaimed for at least 5 years and have huge tax bills
city will wipe debts for new buyers - and use sale price to swell coffers
