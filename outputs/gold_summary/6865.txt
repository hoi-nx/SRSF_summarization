gibney , the director of the scientology documentary going clear , blasted cruise after a screening of the film on monday
gibney called cruise ' irresponsible ' over his refusal to comment on the many claims made against him and scientology over the years
the film speaks to former members of the church , one of whom claims that cruise asked the church to tap nicole kidman 's phone during their marriage
there are also claims that cruise used workers who were paid less than a dollar and hour by the church to maintain his motorcycles and plane
' the accusations made in the film are entirely false and alleged without ever asking the church of scientology , ' said the church of scientology is a statement
hbo meanwhile had a reported 160 lawyers watch and vet the documentary , which airs at 8pm this sunday
