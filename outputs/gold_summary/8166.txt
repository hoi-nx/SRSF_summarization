halifax has completed a successful trial of the tech using the nymi band
it reads the wearer 's cardiac rhythm , which is said to be as unique as a person 's fingerprint , to authenticate who they are
nymi measures the amount of electrical power generated by a human heart
this is called a cardiac rhythm and is tracked on electrocardiogram ( ecg )
ecg differs from person to person and depends on size of their heart
and because it only works with a registered person 's cardiac rhythm it ca n't be hacked if the bracelet is stolen
makers bionym said it is more secure than iris and fingerprint scanners
