a consumer update revised by the fda on tuesday said that ultrasounds should be performed for medical reasons only and by licensed staff
while there is no proof that ultrasounds are harmful to the baby , it heats the baby 's tissues slightly and can also cause small bubbles in tissue
ultrasounds help doctors determine the health , size , and age of the child and can detect birth defects and should n't be used for emotional reasons
