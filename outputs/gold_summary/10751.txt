research led by durham university studied a lunar volcanic eruption
the team found that the eruption was much bigger than was thought
it erupted 3.5 billion years ago and covered a scotland - sized area in debris
this was thanks to the low gravity of the moon
the same ' mapping ' technique will be used for olympus mons on mars
