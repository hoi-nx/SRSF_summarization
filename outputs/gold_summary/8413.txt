former liberal party prime minister fraser died ' peacefully ' aged 84 on friday morning
in a statement , his office said : ' we appreciate that this will be a shock to all who knew and loved him '
mr fraser , one of the giants of australia politics , had been suffering a ' brief illness ' when he passed away
he was appointed caretaker prime minister in 1975 following the dismissal of whitlam
under his leadership , the coalition had blocked the passage of supply in the senate
whitlam famously dubbed him ' kerr 's cur ' but the pair became friends later in life
his 1975 election win was the largest in australia political history
as prime minister , he established sbs , opposed apartheid and championed a multicultural australia
after office , he distanced himself from the liberal party and advocated for the rights of asylum seekers
