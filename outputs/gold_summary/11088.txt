arca driver kimmel was uninjured by a car crash at mobile international speedway on saturday
he flew over a concrete retaining wall , flipped into a parking lot and struck at least one parked car
kimmel , 26 , posted on his facebook page that he was ' doing good ' following the bizarre crash early in the mobile 200
because there are no outside walls around the slightly banked track , there was nothing to stop kimmel 's car as it drove off the half - mile track
