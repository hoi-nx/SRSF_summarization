england go into next week 's game with france with a fighting chance of winning the six nations
but it is nip and tuck and their inability to score more against the auld enemy could come back to haunt them
there was plenty of creativity , with ben youngs and george ford both in good form
england trailed 10 - 13 at half - time but looked a different beast for most of the second half and regained control of the match to win 25 - 13
