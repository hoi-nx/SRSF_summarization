giordano was shopping with her 5 - year - old daughter maddie at martha 's miniatures in denison , texas on saturday
the mother and daughter were shopping for an easter outfit when ' tomboy ' maddie gravitated towards a suit instead of a frilly dress
mrs giordano says a shop clerk gave her and her daughter a disgusted look and said she should not let her child cross-dress
the store later posted a statement on facebook ( which was later deleted ) saying the incident was an act of ' child abuse '
