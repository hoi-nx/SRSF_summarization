koskinen revealed the startling statistic during a speech at the national press club
he says budget cuts have forced the irs to pare back its staff numbers , leaving tax return filers largely on their own
agency has already cried poor this year , complaining that it lacks the manpower to conduct as many audits as in past years
but the irs paid out $ 5.8 billion in fake tax refunds to identity thieves in 2013 , the most recent year for which numbers are available
americans have a hate - hate relationship with the agency : ' the irs code is longer than the bible , ' koskinen admitted , ' with none of the good news '
