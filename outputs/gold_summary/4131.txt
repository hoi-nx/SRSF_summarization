cedar hill police originally created video for department awards banquet
features sgt. larry wise behind wheel of a squad car instead of a lincoln
unlike mcconaughey , he does n't contemplate life 's existential questions
instead wonders why he 's ' still on duty ' and if the goo on his fingers came from a previous suspect he just searched
has been viewed more than half a million times after department posted it on facebook
