researchers at the university of manitoba , canada , have shown that peacocks make infrasound noises - below 20 hertz - using their tails
females were more alert when they heard the sound and males shrieked
male peacocks may use infrasound to maintain their territory
they could also use the noise to attract a mate across scrubby woodland
