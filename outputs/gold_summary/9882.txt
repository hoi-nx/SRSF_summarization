winning is everything to mourinho - whether it is the barclays premier league , the champions league or a charity match
chelsea went beyond what is acceptable against psg but , unfortunately , it is not the first time we have seen them do it . i doubt it will be the last , either
in a few years from now , we could be acknowledging mourinho as the most successful manager of all time
but will he be loved ? chelsea fans undoubtedly adore him . porto and inter supporters will too . yet beyond that ? it is debatable
