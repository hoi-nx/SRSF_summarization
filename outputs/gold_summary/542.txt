researchers at the polytechnic university of turin are using dna extracted from herring sperm cells to develop new types of flame retardant materials
they found dna forms a protective coating when heated that resists fire
the dna breaks down into a foam that chars into a ceramic - like material
scientists believe it could create environmentally - friendly flame retardants
these could be used to protect fabrics , furniture and plastics from fire
