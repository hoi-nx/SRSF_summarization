tavolaro has been selling the dark chocolate cakes in his bakery
they are shaped like human figures with big eyes and over-sized bodies
but an anti-racism group has called for them to be pulled from the shelves
council of french black associations say that they ' ridicule ' africans
but mr tavolaro is refusing to stop selling them saying he is not racist
