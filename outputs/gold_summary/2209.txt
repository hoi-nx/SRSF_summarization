five people total develop listeriosis in kansas after eating products from the production line at the blue bell creamery in brenham , texas
listeria bacteria were found in samples of blue bell chocolate chip country cookies , great divide bars , sour pop green apple bars , cotton candy bars , scoops , vanilla stick slices , almond bars and no sugar added moo bars
that contamination has been traced to a machine that extrudes the ice cream into forms and onto cookies , which remains off line
