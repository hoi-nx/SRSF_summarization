the discovery was made by dr pol and at purdue university
packing peanuts are the small foam pieces used in packaging
dr pol 's team baked the peanuts at 600 Â° c ( 1,100 â° f ) to create carbon blocks
these blocks were flattened to make microsheets and nanoparticles
such sheets and particles can then be added as anodes in lithium batteries
