i took my son to wembley to support chelsea in the capital one cup final
chelsea 's support on the day was multicultural and welcoming
my only concern were the rude words that my 10 - year - old son could hear
but news of more alleged racism by fans on a train was disappointing
i enjoyed the day as a black father and a chelsea fan watching his team win
