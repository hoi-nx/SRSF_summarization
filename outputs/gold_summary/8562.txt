statue given to gloucester council by marx 's birthplace of trier , germany
trier made 500 of the statues which were placed across the city
one donated to gloucester to symbolise marx 's journey across europe
but council said it ' would n't be appropriate ' to display the gift anywhere
instead the statue has been given a home in a gloucester back garden
