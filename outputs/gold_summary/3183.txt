wawrzynski patented his ' little dipper ' condiment package in 1997
he claims heinz developed its dip & squeeze ketchup packets after a 2008 meeting in which he showed them his designs
heinz claims the dip & squeeze grew out of an earlier idea called the ' dunk ' n squirt ' that it shelved in 2006 because it could n't make it cheaply enough
a court in pittsburgh will decide this week if heinz was influenced by wawrzynski 's concept and could lead to him seeking compensation
