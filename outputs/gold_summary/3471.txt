the ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus has announced they are phasing out their elephant acts , and will eliminate them in 2018
the decision was largely based on the fact that many cities have anti-circus and anti-elephant ordinances in addition to public outcry
the company 's three shows visit 115 cities each year , and vice president alana feld said it 's expensive to fight legislation in each jurisdiction
13 animals will continue to tour with the circus before retiring to the company 's 200 - acre center for elephant conservation in florida
there will be a new structure built to house the retiring elephants , and the company hopes to open the conservation to the public eventually
the circus will still continue to use other animals , including mongolian camels , which they just added to their live shows this year
