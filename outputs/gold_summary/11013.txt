durst , 72 , a billionaire , was questioned but not charged in the mysterious death of his first wife kathleen mccormack in 1982
the 71 - year - old was then questioned in 2000 after the death of his longtime friend and elderly neighbor berman
police suspect durst was author of anonymous note sent alerting them to a berman 's body
now berman 's stepson showed a documentary producer a 1999 letter from durst to berman that he said he just discovered
the handwriting appears to be similar to the note sent to police and again beverly hills is misspelled on both notes
