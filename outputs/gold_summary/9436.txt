former cancer sufferer dawid van vuuren , 87 , made threat to cut out sons
daniel , 60 , and marius , 55 , did not listen to him when he told them to quit
they contested the will of their father from pretoria , south africa , claiming it was only meant as a warning and was not his genuine wish
but the high court ruled it was mr van vuuren 's true will to disinherit them
