sky bet branded a ' rip - off ' after failing to honour odds at a chelsea match
firm âs mobile phone app offered odds of 25 - 1 for a psg win in extra time
but when settling the bets , they paid out at just 9 - 2 to fury of customers
sky bet has since claimed that the better odds were offered by ' mistake '
