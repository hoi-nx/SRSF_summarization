the stuhleners were handed the wrong baby in a maternity ward mix - up
samantha stuhlener had just given birth to baby levi at st vincent 's private hospital in melbourne
the wrong baby was brought to them from the settling room by a nurse
they spent 45 minutes with the couple 's baby before the nurse realised
the error comes despite both babies wearing the correct id wristbands
they are traumatised and claim to have had trouble bonding with levi
the hospital 's apology resulted in another embarrassing mix - up
the stuhleners received a letter which was addressed to the other couple involved - the parents of the other child
