a knock - off version of monteith 's crushed cider has snuck onto shelves
' monteeths ' is an almost identical replica made by ' cheeky sydney - siders '
many customers have taken to social media to query the odd label
people have queried if the label is a typo , joking ' has someone gotten into the cider before work ? '
the original company point out : ' while it âs perfectly safe to consume , the sketchy beverage is made with apple juice concentrate '
