sam , the nephew of john travolta , is discussing why he left scientology in 2007 in a new interview , and what life has been like since
sam says he decided to leave the church after he tried to take his own life , at which point members began mouthing to him , ' you are dead '
he also claims members ' planted drugs on him ' and spread the rumor that he was ' psychotic ' and a ' pedophile '
sam asked his uncle for help , but he claims even he could do nothing to stop the attacks
he does say that sam provides him with a monthly allowance and has never pressured his family members to join the church
sam also claims he was forced to work 60 - hour weeks as a file clerk for the church and was only paid $ 36
