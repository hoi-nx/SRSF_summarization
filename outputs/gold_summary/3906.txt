prisoners at eastern state penitentiary were kept in solitary confinement which some say induced mental illness
the guards are believed to have tortured the inmates and covered their heads with hoods when outside the cells
shut down in 1971 and reopened in 1996 as a museum and halloween attraction but ghostly sightings continue
visitors have reported anguished cries coming from the cells and a shadowy figure who watches over the prison
