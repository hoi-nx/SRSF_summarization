a puggle found on a walking track at anna bay in the hunter region of new south wales was taken to taronga zoo
it was only around 30 days old so it needed to be cared for by zoo staff on a daily basis
the puggle sucked up milk out of the palm of a wildlife hospital supervisor âs hand at the zoo
an esky was used as its new home so it could be kept at the right body temperature all the time
