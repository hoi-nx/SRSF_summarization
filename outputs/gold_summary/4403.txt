swirl tap was designed by art student simin qiu at the royal college of art
he is currently testing a prototype tap and hopes it will go on sale next year
two spinning turbines in the tap head send the water into a hollow vortex
this uses 15 per cent less water than traditional taps , the designer claims
the hollow jet is also more gentle to use on the hands than traditional taps
