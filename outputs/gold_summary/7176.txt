researchers at the massachusetts institute of technology and michigan state university have proposed a new theory for the lack of stars
based on the amount of stellar fuel there should be 10 times as many
but the reason is because temperatures stop them forming
in some clusters of galaxies temperatures are too high for stars to form
and black holes regulate the temperatures so they never get too cool
