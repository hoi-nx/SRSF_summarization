the old town hall in sheffield was once a grand and imposing law court , but it has lain dormant for 20 years
200 - year - old building has been left to crumble and rot , but its public gallery , benches and dock are still intact
grade ii listed building 's glory has faded and campaigners are now calling for the court to be restored
