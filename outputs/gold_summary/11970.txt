beth and kris russet , who moved from australia in 2009 , took 18 months to build cyclone - proof home in vanuatu
the couple moved into the family home with their two children , and beth 's mother , in november last year
just four months later , their brand new home was ripped apart when cyclone pam hit vanuatu on march 13
the family spent five terrifying hours in their car not knowing if they would survive the horrendous ordeal
not only did they all live to tell the miraculous story but so did their two german shepherds and their pet cat
beth said the determined spirit of the vanuatu people after such an epic disaster was nothing short of phenomenal
but the rebuilding of the island was going to be a long process and she urged people to keep donating to the cause
