scadlock died on march 11 after becoming ill from e. coli
scadlock began serving her 18 - month mission in august of 2014 and no one ever expected her seemingly bright future to take such a dire turn
a go fund me page was set up by scadlock 's parents to help them and the rest of their family travel to see their daughter when she was sick
sadly they were too late but the $ 13,700 raised will go towards her funeral expenses
