saturday night live made a parody of a toyota camry commercial in which a young girl is driven to the airport by her father to head off to the army
in the snl version the young girl , played by host dakota johnson , hops on a truck with members of isis and an islamic state flag on the side
she tells her father , ' dad , it 's just isis , ' as she walks away , and then as she drives off a man yells ' death to america ! '
many on social media were outraged , calling the show ' depraved , ' while others found it ' hilarious '
this comes the same week that three british girls and four canadians , all teenagers , are believed to have run off to join isis
