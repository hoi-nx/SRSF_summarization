fruitport township officers jason pavlige and james hodges responded to a call about a couple who had not secured their baby a proper seat
they found the 10 - month - old girl sitting on her mother 's lap
but they learned that the couple could not afford a car seat for the girl so decided against issuing them a ticket
they pooled their money and bought them a car seat from walmart
the good deed came to light when a walmart employee called the police station to report their kindness
