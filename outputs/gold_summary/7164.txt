supernova could be seen because its light took different paths
this allowed astronomers to take four images of the ancient star
a massive galaxy cluster warped the light as it travelled to earth
einstein predicted this would happen in his theory which explains how objects bend space - time to create what we experience as gravity
images could help explain dark matter behaviour in nearby cluster
light from the supernova is expected to reappear the next few years
