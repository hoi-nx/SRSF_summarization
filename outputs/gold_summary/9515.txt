nicola nichols , 25 , suffered from a mild case of flu seven years ago
afterwards she started vomiting 50 times a day and could n't eat or drink
she was diagnosed with gastroparesis ; paralysis of the stomach muscles
her intestines failed and she now has to be fed through a tube to her blood
she gave birth to two healthy children despite not being able to eat for two
the feeding meant her hair fell out but she says she is ' luckier than most '
