gartside , 40 , had waited 4 years for a donor kidney and pancreas
eventually got a call to say there was one available and rushed to hospital
there , doctors informed him the donor had died from a drug overdose
hiv test results would take 2 weeks , while transplant had to be immediate
mr gartside decided to take the gamble and accept the infected organs
has since been told the donor did not have hiv
