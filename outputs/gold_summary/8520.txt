three couples , three children and two single friends bought a spacious home in hartford , connecticut last year and share expenses
a neighbor complained to the city , which found the arrangement violated a zoning code that no more than two unrelated people can live in a home
the group , who say they believe they promote great values such as cooperation and living within their means , appealed but lost
they now face having to go to court or going their separate ways
