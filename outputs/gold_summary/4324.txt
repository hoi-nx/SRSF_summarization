in the incredible scene , filmed for a discovery channel special , the sea creatures are seen rolling on their backs with their eyes closed in an apparent state of bliss
as the dolphins drift off into their own world , the weary pufferfish seizes the chance to deflate and slip away into the deep blue
the footage , from dolphins : spy in the pod , was taken by wildlife filmmaker john downer
