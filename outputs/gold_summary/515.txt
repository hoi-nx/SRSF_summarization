dr christoffer petersson from chalmers university of technology in sweden has proposed a new model for particle physics
he says the higgs boson can disintegrate into dark matter
the team at the lhc in cern will be testing his theory
if the properties are there , it is a clear indication that the model fits
' just the fact that they are willing to test my model at cern is great , ' he said
the lhc is to be turned on at full power in may after a wait of two years
