taylor , 36 , pleaded guilty to a felony child abuse charge monday
taylor was arrested in 2014 after leaving her two young boys in her car for about 45 minutes while she interviewed for a job
she attracted sympathy around the nation after her tear - stained mug shot went viral on the internet
the mother received more than $ 114,000 in online donations
an agreement last summer allowed taylor to avoid charges as long as she set up a $ 60,000 trust fund for her children with the donated money
she broke that agreement by missing a deadline for putting money in the trusts , even after the amount of her payments was lowered to $ 40,000
