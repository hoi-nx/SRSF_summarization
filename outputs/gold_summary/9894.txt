experts at the ivi fertility clinic believe a new test could transform ivf
test pinpoints the point in a woman 's cycle when there is the best chance an embryo will successfully implant and she will become pregnant
in the uk more than 60,000 ivf cycles are performed each year
but just 24 % are successful leading to emotional and financial stress
pilot study of 17 women , who suffered up to six failed rounds of ivf each , saw nine become pregnant and have babies after the test was performed
trial of 2,500 women in 10 countries is now taking place , scientists said
