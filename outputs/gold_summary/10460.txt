nurse natasha thomson showed up six minutes after the baby was born
despite her receiving five phone calls in one hour from the mother
it was a home birth and the mother was in ' excruciating pain '
she gave birth to her baby ' on her hands and knees in the bathroom '
thomson used the mother 's kitchen scissors to cut the umbilical cord
after examining ms b 's perineum she said there was a ' tiny tear '
she told ms b to be ' ladylike ' , and to keep her legs together
but tribunal documents say ms b had to be later admitted to hospital
