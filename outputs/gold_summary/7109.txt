motorcyclist mathew sant was travelling along canberra avenue
after stopping in a row of traffic he was suddenly rear - ended
but instead of losing his temper he just gives the driver a thumbs up
to make it clearer there are no hard feelings he shakes the driver 's hand
the initial crash caused a three - car pile up with other motors
