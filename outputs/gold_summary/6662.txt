pastor nick of the living word sanctuary has bought tyson 's former home of almost half what the boxing champion got when he sold it in 1999
the church plans to turn the opulent property into a house of worship and will fill in tyson 's boxing glove - shaped swimming pool and replace it with an area for sanctuary
' the skylights , arches , and windows in the pool area , it literally looks like a church , ' said pastor nick
property was once the scene of many a wild party , but pastor nick says tyson is welcome to come and join the congregation for worship any time he likes
