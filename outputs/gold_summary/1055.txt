curry , 39 , cried in court on monday as she was sentenced to four years and two months in prison for repeatedly sleeping with a sex offender
she claimed that jang-li delgado galban , a 25 - year - old gang member housed in the jail 's maximum - security unit , had seduced her
on 13 occasions curry had unlocked his cell and the pair had then met in a supply closet where they had sexual relations
judge charles bailey was less than convinced by curry 's tears and sentenced her to double the time that had been recommended
