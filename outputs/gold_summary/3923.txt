children conceived using infertility treatments were more likely to develop autism than children conceived naturally , columbia university study found
these treatments include ivf , artificial insemination and surrogacy

higher risk could be explained by complications of ivf , like multiple births
there was no extra risk if a woman did not have a multiple birth
