warrick broke his neck while training with the queensland reds
at only 20 years old suddenly his life was in tatters and his career over
he had no feeling in his right hand and wore a neck brace for six months
bodybuilding first gave him the incentive to train intensively again
he moved into powerlifting and in 2005 set an australian record
but it was in strongman competitions that he really made his mark
he is the only australian to make the final of the world âs strongest man
his sister lauren appeared in i 'm a celebrity get me out of here
she works out daily at warrick 's gold coast gym to stay in shape
