the whitehouse at gleneagles was billed as ' scotland 's most expensive new home ' and advertised at Â£ 8million
the five - bedroom luxury home was set to feature a swimming pool , orangery and soundproofed cinema
but work on 13,000sq ft mansion was never completed as a buyer was not found and it was repossessed by a bank
now the incomplete mansion has been sold for a knockdown price of just Â£ 861,888 to a local businessman
package includes free membership to the gleneagles resort for two years including golf and use of luxury facilities
