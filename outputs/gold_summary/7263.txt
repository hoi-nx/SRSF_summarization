depraved terrorists use social media to share photos of gun - toting children
chilling images are titled ' the little terrorist ' and ' generation kilafah '
they show young boys and girls with guns dressed in combat clothing
others show sleeping newborn babies with rifles propped against the bed
photographs are a sickening attempt for the twisted men and women living under the rule of isis to outdo one another on social media
