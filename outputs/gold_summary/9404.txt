scientists in new mexico have a new theory for origin on earth 's iron
previously it was unclear how iron was scattered throughout the mantle
but research suggests the vapourisation point of iron is lower than thought
this means it would have turned into vapour when rocks hit early earth
it would have drifted up in plumes and then rained down on the surface
