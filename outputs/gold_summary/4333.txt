extraordinary picture shows male leading female and cubs through sikhote-alin biosphere reserve in east russia
large adult male tigers usually have several mates within their territory and leave females to raise their cubs alone
males are usually highly aggressive and can pose a threat to small cubs - killing those belonging to rival males
amur tigers , also known as siberian tigers , are critically endangered with less than 500 thought to be left in the wild
the new picture suggests that male tigers may play a far greater role in rearing cubs than was previously believed
