stickers bearing the message ' maximum of 5 colored customers / colored boh staff accepted ' appeared overnight between tuesday and wednesday
the stickers were affixed to at least 6 businesses in the hip austin neighborhood as thousands partied and swapped tech trends at sxsw
business owners ca n't agree on what the stickers mean -- is it racist or a message about gentrification ? -- but all say they 're inappropriate
austin mayor steve adler declared the messages ' an appalling and offensive display of ignorance in our city '
