as a boat packed with hundreds of migrants capsized in mediterranean waters , many were trapped inside behind locked doors
that 's the account one survivor of the deadly shipwreck gave to investigators , according to a statement released sunday by prosecutors in catania , italian
the bangladesh migrant 's description provides new details about what may have happened aboard the ship , which sent out a distress call in the dark of night saturday after a couple of days at sea
as rescuers approached , authorities say migrants on the boat moved to one side , hoping to be saved
their movement caused the large , multilevel boat to capsize about 110 kilometers ( almost 70 miles ) north of libya , sending the desperate crowd plunging into the sea , their chance of survival slim
the migrant , who spoke to investigators after being airlifted to a hospital in catania , is among dozens who authorities say were saved from the sinking vessel
he told investigators there were 950 people on board -- a number prosecutors have n't verified
maltese authorities , who are working with italian rescuers , earlier said around 50 of 700 people on the boat had been saved
many on lower levels of the boat were trapped inside because smugglers had locked the doors , the migrant said , according to prosecutors
the italian coast guard is collecting statements from other survivors , prosecutors said
it was the latest in a series of dangerous voyages for hundreds of men , women and children who boarded the boat in libya , hoping to make it safely to europe
passengers on the boat were from a number of nations , including algeria , egypt , somalia , niger , senegal , mali , zambia , bangladesh and ghana , prosecutors said
while the shipwreck was an accident , maltese 's prime minister slammed the human traffickers who he accused of risking people 's lives by putting them on rickety ships in unpredictable waters
" gangs of criminals are putting people on a boat , sometimes even at gunpoint , " prime minister muscat said
" they 're putting them on the road to death , really , and nothing else
united nations high commissioner for refugees antonio guterres said that the incident could be worse than an incident last week in which 400 refugees and migrants died in the mediterranean
" our troops , together with the italian navy , are literally looking through the bodies to try to find someone who 's still alive , " muscat said of the latest incident at sea
the italian coast guard , which is leading the rescue operation , reported that at least 24 bodies had been recovered so far at the shipwreck site
security for libya 's borders is essential to " take out these criminal gangs -- these terrorists , " muscat said
" de filippi called on european states to immediately launch large - scale search - and - rescue operations with proactive patrolling as close as possible to libya shores
many of the migrants who board ships to cross the mediterranean are from sub-saharan africa , and travel for weeks just to get to the ships
already this year , more than 900 migrants are believed to have died while crossing the mediterranean -- far more than during the same period in 2014 , the international organization for migration said friday
in one four - day period alone , more than 8,000 migrants were rescued , according to the italian coast guard
