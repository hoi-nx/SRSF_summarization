a term used by president obama and baltimore mayor rawlings-blake to characterize rioters has given new life to a debate over the word " thug
" " of course it 's not the right word , to call our children ' thugs , ' " baltimore councilman carl stokes told cnn 's " outfront
no , we do n't have to call them thugs
" " just call them n --- -- s. just call them n --- -- s , " he said
" no , we do n't have to call them by names such as that
the president and the mayor are wrong , he said
you do n't call six police officers who kill a man without probable cause ' thugs , ' but children who are frustrated and do n't have an outlet , you call them ' thugs
' ' thugs ' is the 21st century word for the n - word
" the recent unrest in baltimore was sparked by the arrest and death of freddie gray , who suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in custody
what we know , do n't know about freddie gray 's death mayor rawlings-blake responded wednesday
" i wanted to clarify my comments on ' thugs , ' " she wrote wednesday on twitter
" when you speak out of frustration and anger , one can say things in a way that you do n't mean
and my comments then did n't convey that
" kweisi mfume , baltimore native and former president of the naacp , said , " it 's important we not shift the focus into something that has absolutely nothing to do with poverty , despair , hunger , homelessness and a sense of not belonging
" " whether we call them a thug , a law breaker , a juvenile delinquent , it really does n't matter
and that 's what men have been doing , going around , talking to these young men where they , are in their face , and letting them know , you ca n't control this community
" shird , another baltimore native and author of " lessons of redemption , " said " thug " is " not like the n - word in my mind
" shird , a former drug dealer , also said he does not see the word as an accurate description of the young people who rioted and looted in baltimore on monday
and so , in my mind i do n't see a 16 - or 17 - year - old as a thug
" opinion : calling people ' thugs ' solves nothing nfl player richard sherman has previously called the term " the accepted way of calling somebody the n - word nowadays
" on monday , mayor rawlings-blake said , " there is a difference between what we saw over the past week with the peaceful protests , those who wish to seek justice , those who wish to be heard , and want answers , and the difference between those protests and the thugs who only want to incite violence and destroy our city
