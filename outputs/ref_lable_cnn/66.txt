istanbul , turkey sitting on a sunny bench in istanbul 's gezi park , gurgen dismisses the controversy surrounding the 100th anniversary friday of the massacre of armenian under the ottoman empire with a wave of her hand
gurgen , a 55 - year - old cleaner , says her family has had close friendships with armenian going back generations
ninety - one percent of turks do not believe that the events of 1915 -- when , according to armenian , 1.5 million ethnic armenian were systematically killed in the final years of the ottoman empire -- were genocide , according to a recent poll
it 's a sentiment shared by the turkish government , which denies that a genocide took place , maintaining that hundreds of thousands of turkish muslims and armenian christians died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of turkey also disputes armenian 's count of the numbers killed , putting it at 300,000
it 's a heavily disputed position -- the killings are widely viewed by scholars as genocide and the armenian government and diaspora are lobbying for wider recognition in the international community
armenian prime minister hovik abrahamyan said friday in statement that turkey 's ottoman empire rulers had planned and carried out a " monstrous crime " in the years of world war i and called on more countries to recognize and condemn the genocide
many armenian living in turkey still feel treated as second - class citizens
" a century after her armenian ancestors escaped death in eastern turkey , van says she is frustrated that turkey is unwilling to accept what happened
in turkey , the word armenian is still used as a curse
whenever you want to hurt somebody , you say , ' you are like an armenian
" i do not believe that this is going to happen , " she says of the territorial claims made by many armenian
i went to my ancestors ' land , and i saw those armenian lands full of kurdish people , who have five to 16 children per family , and i saw that it 's not eastern anatolia
" a growing number of scholars and world leaders believe that what happened should be called genocide
" two weeks ago the pope referred to mass killings as " the first genocide of the 20th century " -- a move that infuriated turkish president erdogan , who called the claim " nonsense " and recalled his ambassador to the vatican
last year , the turkish government expressed condolences to armenian , and accepted that hundreds of thousands of their ancestors died as they were marched out of cities and towns in central and eastern anatolia in the waning years of the ottoman empire
but the government called it a " necessary deportation " during the messy and violent period of transition leading up to world war i -- when many armenian radicals were threatening to side with russia
turkey says that there was never a deliberate , ethnically - driven effort to exterminate the armenian population
kasim dismisses the drive for the " genocide " label as little more than a propaganda campaign being waged by the armenian diaspora
" since 2003 , turkish schools have been forbidden from using the term genocide
calling the events of 1915 a genocide would undermine the very narratives the turks hold most dear , says punsmann , a senior analyst at ankara policy center who has studied turkish - armenian relations for a decade
" but there are other issues , including fears that an official recognition of genocide could unleash a flood of lawsuits against the turkish government
in 2006 , descendants of exiled armenian filed suit in a u.s. court against two germany banks for restitution of assets , based on evidence that ottoman empire ministries required that seized armenian assets be turned over to the government and transferred to banks in germany
her case is winding its way through the turkish court system , but her lawyer , ali elbeyoglu , says the genocide debate has no effect : " we have deeds , so we are following the law and politics do n't matter
" others say that the genocide is distracting the country from more pressing issues between turkey and armenian , like the closed border between the two hostile neighbors
and he says it is n't in armenian 's best interest to push hard for a recognition of genocide that he does n't believe will ever come
" they keep referring to this as an ' armenian incident ' in quotations and ca n't call it genocide , " she says , boarding the metro to her classes at aydin university
