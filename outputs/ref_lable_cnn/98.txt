garissa , kenyan kenyan police have arrested five suspects in connection with thursday 's attack at garissa university college , interior minister joseph nkaissery said friday , according to cnn affiliate ntv
thursday 's attack by al-shabaab militants killed 147 people , including 142 students , three security officers and two university security personnel
the attack left 104 people injured , including 19 who are in critical condition , joseph nkaissery said
during search and recovery efforts on friday , cnn witnessed one male who was not a student hiding under a bed
that male was taken into custody and was being treated as a suspect , sources close to the search told cnn
a female student was found under a pile of bodies , another female student was hiding in a wardrobe and a male student was hiding in the bathroom , the sources confirmed to cnn
after gunmen shot fellow students , she smeared their blood onto her body to make it seem she 'd been shot , too , she told cnn on friday at a makeshift center for evacuated students
" al-shabaab 's long , bloody legacy with kenyan early thursday , an explosion and gunfire cut through the morning quiet on the campus about 90 miles ( 145 kilometers ) from kenyan 's border with somalia , tearing many students in dormitories out of their sleep
" never heard anything like this , " journalist okari from cnn affiliate ntv tweeted as he watched smoke rising over a student hostel
al-shabaab gunmen had first stormed a christian prayer service , where they killed some and took others hostage
kenyan security forces moved in and killed four gunmen
somalia terror group al-shabaab , an al qaeda affiliate , claimed responsibility for the attack
kenyan police are circulating " wanted dead or alive " posters featuring eight terror suspects who are wanted in separate attacks in kenyan , the interior ministry said
the dangerously porous border between somalia and kenyan has made it easy for al-shabaab militants to cross over and carry out attacks
in a december attack at a quarry , al-shabaab militants separated muslims from others and executed the non-muslims , killing at least 36 people
last month , the u.s. embassy warned of possible attacks " throughout kenyan in the near - term " after the reported death of a key al-shabaab leader , adan garaar , who was suspected in the september 2013 westgate attack in nairobi
at least 67 people died then
