this is his sixth tour in iraqi , and he 's back doing a job that he 's been tasked with before : training iraqi soldiers
but the u.s. military is n't the only contingent of western forces in the region -- dozens of foreigners , including u.s. , have volunteered to take the fight to isis
and increasingly , u.s. military training efforts are being supplemented by outside agencies , who are working with kurdish government troops and even militia in iraqi and syrian
while it is difficult to say how many foreign volunteers are fighting isis , a spokesman for a kurdish militia fighting against them in syrian -- known as the ypg -- told the new york times their forces include more than 100 u.s. citizens
but some organizations have set up recruitment drives online , featuring applications for foreign fighters complete with checklists of what to bring and advice on bringing body armor across international borders
" but foreign fighters are n't universally welcomed by those opposing isis
the peshmerga , the military wing of the krg ( krg ) that has been one of the most effective counterbalances to isis ' expansion , has said they do n't want or need foreign fighters , according to bradbury
" the information i 've been getting back is that there 's very little use for ( western fighters ) on the front lines , especially on the krg side -- they have significant numbers of personnel -- it 's a source of kurdish pride for them to rise up in scenarios like this
while individual fighters are not always accepted , volunteers working as military trainers are sharing their expertise to support those on the front lines of the fight against isis forces
" he was prompted to establish the group after seeing " fairly significant gaps " in the support provided by the coalition forces for the kurdish , iraqi regular and militia ranged against isis
the u.s. military is " confident " that its support of the forces battling isis on the ground is sufficient
" with coalition members keen to distance themselves from calls for western boots on the ground -- and little political appetite from overseas for risking western troops in what many see as a sectarian conflict , bradbury contends that the best - case scenario is exactly the kind of logistical support that organizations like 1st naef are providing
isis is keen to play up religious and sectarian divisions in order to create the perception that they are the sunni protectors of a persecuted underclass , sending non-arab troops into the battlefield -- even in a support role -- could play into that divisive rhetoric
providing noncombat backing , such as medical , weaponry , logistical and training assistance would appear , he thinks , to be the best way of supporting those kurdish and arab troops on the front
