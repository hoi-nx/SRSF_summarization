the boy who asked a church to help him find a forever parent finally has one
desperate for a home in 2013 , davion only dressed up in a suit and borrowed a bible from the boys home where he lived
then he headed to a st. petersburg , florida , church to make a plea for his own adoption
now 16 years old , he had lived his entire life in foster care , bouncing from one home to another
thousands of calls came into his agency , and a minster 's family in ohio asked him to come live with them
forever was n't forever in that case
going rented a larger house , and only moved into the home after his new mom passed the home study
his official adoption date is april 22
