change is coming to ferguson
in the next few weeks the doj ( doj ) will begin to negotiate in earnest with the city to restructure the police department , which the department has charged with engaging in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination
it should not be forgotten that the doj review of the ferguson police department was precipitated by months of protests and activism following the killing of brown by a ferguson police officer and by revelations about the town 's dysfunctional government and court system by local civil rights law groups
now , after a half year of unrest , and with citizens on tuesday electing two new black city council members , change is beginning to come to ferguson
the evidence of ugly and explicit racial discrimination was devastating
but just a few weeks before the release of the report , the ferguson police chief declared there were " no racial issues " in his department
ferguson 's ugly , racist emails released the recommendations in the report , ranging from new training and supervision of police officers , addressing racially discriminatory conduct to structural revisions in the court system , will , if implemented , remake the law enforcement system in the town
town manager john shaw , ferguson 's most powerful official and , until the doj 's blistering report , the one who inexplicably managed to elude public scrutiny , resigned weeks ago and has been replaced by the city 's deputy manager
three sitting city council members chose not to run for office again and , on tuesday , citizens elected two black candidates to the city council , changing its racial composition : five of six members and the mayor were white
now the council will be 50 % black
ferguson 's hapless police chief jackson also finally resigned after holding on through a months - long display of astonishing incompetence
and so we can be certain that along with the new makeup of the city council , there will be a new police chief in ferguson
but does that mean that fundamental change will come to ferguson ? not necessarily
ferguson 's governing structure , with a strong city manager and a weak council and mayor , mirrors that of thousands of other suburbs in the america
but working class suburbs like ferguson with a majority black population in which the needs of the population in the areas of education and economic opportunity more closely hews to the needs of urban residents , may need a more robust form of governance
in any case , a system in which the elected officials have minimal power , but non-elected leaders , like the town manager and the chief of police , have inordinate power , is a recipe for the kind of unaccountable , non-representative government that controlled ferguson 's residents
it 's not that ferguson is so different than towns across america
and ferguson 's example should provoke self - examination in working class suburbs across the country , where the power and effectiveness of weak elected local government is inadequate to meet the needs of the population
