washington president obama says he is " absolutely committed to making sure " israeli maintains a military advantage over iran
his comments to the new york times , published on sunday , come amid criticism from israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu of the deal that the u.s. and five other world powers struck with iran
obama said he understands and respects benjamin netanyahu 's stance that israeli is particularly vulnerable and does n't " have the luxury of testing these propositions " in the deal
that , he said , should be " sufficient to take advantage of this once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to see whether or not we can at least take the nuclear issue off the table , " he said
