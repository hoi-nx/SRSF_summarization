back in 1989 , khomeini famously said he was " drinking poison " when he accepted a ceasefire to end the eight - year - old war with iraq
the war had helped define khomeini 's regime , the islamic republic , which he had founded a year before saddam hussein invaded iran
he dragged out the war for eight years , despite saddam hussein 's willingness to accept a ceasefire , and thus stabilized the foundations of the islamic republic
since then , " drinking a chalice of poison " has became part of iran political lexicon , and many analysts have asked whether ayatollah khamenei , khomeini 's successor , would raise the chalice and surrender to demands by the west to end iran 's nuclear program
like the war , iran 's defiance to halt its controversial nuclear program has defined khamenei 's era
iran claims that its program is peaceful , but khamenei 's refusal to end uranium enrichment activities -- a process that can lead to making nuclear fuel as well as nuclear bombs -- has landed the country under crippling sanctions
if iran can finalize a deal by june with the u.s. and its p5 +1 partners , international investors , including u.s. , would be able to invest in iran for the first time in decades
iran can develop its gas and oil fields , and the economy can leap forward
desperate for a deal , whoever i called over the past week inside iran was glued to their television sets , and tens of thousands poured out on the streets to celebrate the agreement late thursday night
iran 's economy shrank after sanctions were intensified in 2012 and the value of the rial , the iran currency , plunged to one - third of the u.s. dollar
" iran politicians are divided between moderates -- led by president rouhani , who wants to develop the economy -- and hardliners , who view the deal as a threat to the regime 's ideology
khamenei can claim that iran is the winner in the country 's decade - long confrontation with the west -- a legacy that he wants to leave behind
