she said the doctor asked her whether erika was using any birth control
according to karen langhart , when she told him erika was using the nuvaring , " he said well there 's a link between nuvaring and pulmonary embolisms , " karen langhart said
rick langhart said doctors removed the nuvaring immediately
hospital records cited the nuvaring as a risk factor for erika 's multiple pulmonary embolisms
records confirm what erika 's parents told cnn : that a blood clot started in an artery / vein in her right thigh and traveled to her lungs , causing " massive " pulmonary embolisms and " multiple episodes of cardiac arrest " on the way to the hospital and overnight
within weeks of starting the nuvaring , henry said she collapsed during training , unable to breathe
he told her he thought she had blood clots in her lungs
" i said , you know i started taking this birth control , is it related to this ? " henry said
" and he was like , yeah , i definitely think that you have blood clots and it 's from the birth control
" according to her hospital discharge papers , the henry was using " was probably the risk factor " for her pulmonary embolisms
her doctors told her it 's too risky to use hormonal birth control again
even though nuvaring has about the same risk for blood clots as newer birth control pills , henry said she wishes she had known that the incidence of life - threatening blood clots is double with nuvaring compared to older birth control pills
" there are other options out there for birth control that have risks , but not doubling the risks , " henry told cnn
" the nuvaring is one of the most popular birth control products on the market
at least 10.5 million women use hormonal birth control pills
the nuvaring was approved by the fda in 2001 and became available to women in the americans in 2002
according to merck , the nuvaring is sold in more than 50 countries , and 44 million prescriptions have been filled for women in the americans alone
the nuvaring dispenses what 's called a third - generation progestin , or synthetic hormone
" it stays in for three weeks , so no bother of taking a daily birth control pill
the ring was branded in a television commercial as " a different way to do birth control " and " oh ! it 's easy to use
the langharts had no idea the nuvaring birth control their daughter had been using for four years had already been linked to other women 's deaths , according to unconfirmed claims of problems reported to the fda
merck acknowledges a very small risk of blood clots but stands by its product , saying , " there is substantial evidence to support the safety and efficacy of nuvaring
" while studies have shown that the number of severe adverse events is extremely low -- fewer than 11 cases per 10,000 women who use it for a year -- the families who have lost loved ones point out that the incidence of life - threatening blood clots is double with nuvaring than with older birth control pills
since the mid- 1990s there have been multiple studies suggesting that while third - generation progestins are generally safe , they are approximately twice as likely to cause blood clots than older , second - generation birth control pills
instead , it gave this statement : " while there is a very small risk of a blood clot when using nuvaring or any combined hormonal contraceptive , this risk is much less than the risk of blood clots during pregnancy and the immediate post-partum period
" among 10,000 women , between five and 20 women run the risk of developing a serious blood clot during pregnancy ; the risk increases to between 40 and 65 women during the 12 - week postpartum period
among 10,000 women in a year using combination hormonal contraceptives -- that includes birth control pills , the ring and the patch -- the risk of developing serious blood clots ranges between three and 12 women
two studies conducted in 2011 and 2012 reveal the risk of developing a serious blood clot among nuvaring users is 11.4 and 8.3 per 10,000 women in a year , respectively
the nuvaring 's label was updated in 2013 by the fda with information about both studies
according to claims filed in federal and state courts , the lawsuits allege organon , the original manufacturer of the nuvaring , " failed to adequately warn consumers about a heightened risk of blood clots associated with the use of nuvaring , even though the manufacturer was aware that nuvaring posed greater risks than other hormonal contraceptives
" instead , to honor erika 's memory , they decided to create a nonprofit to inform women of the dangers they believe are related to the nuvaring and the comparative risks of all forms of hormonal contraceptives
