if one is to believe lawyers for hernandez , the former new england patriots star had no conceivable reason to kill a man who was his friend , his future brother - in - law and a reliable purveyor of the marijuana he chain - smoked
the jury in the high - profile trial resumed deliberations wednesday after deliberating about an hour - and - a - half on tuesday
the way defense lawyer sultan laid it out for the massachusetts jury in closing arguments earlier tuesday , why would a young man with a $ 40 million contract kill semi-pro player odin lloyd less than a mile from his own home ? why would hernandez leave a marijuana blunt he shared with the victim at the murder scene ? did those who sultan described as inept and biased police officers and prosecutors simply become fixated with the former tight end with a promising future in the national football league ? " if there was evidence of any reason aaron would have had to murder odin loyd , do n't you think you would have heard about it in nine weeks ? " sultan asked the jury
" the prosecution , however , portrayed hernandez as cold , calculating and insecure -- a man who believed others should be grateful for his attention , one capable of murder for merely disrespecting him in the presence of others
prosecutor mccauley asked jurors : what was hernandez talking about a day after odin lloyd 's bullet - riddled body was found at a massachusetts industrial park in june 2013 ? " ' my endorsements are gone , ' " hernandez said , according to mccauley said
on monday , hernandez 's defense gave its side of the story in less than a day
" sultan tried to implicate hernandez 's co-defendants , wallace and ortiz , who have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately
they 're accused of killing odin lloyd
mccauley reminded the jury of testimony about hernandez and his two friends sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying , drinking smoothies , and hernandez at times leaving his then 8 - month - old child with the two men
the motive for the killing has never been clearly spelled out , but prosecutors said odin lloyd might have done or said something that did n't sit well with hernandez
hernandez 's fiancee , jenkins , testified that hernandez told her to dispose of a box from the couple 's home that she said reeked of marijuana
another piece of the state 's case was grainy footage from hernandez 's home security system that prosecutors said showed him holding a .45 - caliber handgun -- the same kind of gun police said was used to kill odin lloyd
hernandez could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after odin lloyd was shot to death in the industrial park , which is about a mile from hernandez 's home
the video is time - stamped minutes after nearby workers described hearing noise they said sounded like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say odin lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car hernandez was driving
hernandez 's lawyers showed a different part of the video time - stamped a few seconds earlier with hernandez holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand
evidence collected in odin lloyd 's death investigation led to two more murder charges against hernandez in a separate case in boston
