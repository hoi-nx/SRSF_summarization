hillary clinton is finally announcing her candidacy for the 2016 presidential election
for democratic , there is ample reason to be excited about clinton 's run for the presidency
she brings to the table extensive political and policy experience , a combination of skills that is often lacking
she has been through some of the roughest partisan wars and emerged stronger than ever before
americans have many positive memories of clinton name , given the booming economy of the late 1990s during clinton 's presidency
if hillary clinton puts together an effective campaign , she could be unbeatable in the democratic primaries as well as in the general election
clinton does n't want to end up like vice president gore in 2000
gore had trouble connecting with voters , and he seemed to remake his image constantly
clinton must avoid following gore 's path
she needs to do more than rest on the perception that her candidacy is inevitable and on her record of experience
voters thirst for signs of greatness when they pick their presidents , even if they are savvy enough to understand that the reality of a polarized washington will probably limit her ability to achieve bold change
clinton also will have to contend with doubts about her authenticity
clinton was attacked as " slick willie " by members of both parties for the perception that he would say anything to win and hillary clinton has faced similar criticism
during the next few months , clinton will also have to connect with her party 's base
the ongoing speculation about sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts has suggested that the most active part of the democratic is not that enthused with clinton 's candidacy
she will also need to make clear that she has heard voters on being too hawkish about going to war and give clear indications about how she would handle a nuclear agreement with iran
clinton will also have to contend with the gender bias that still exists in the electorate at large
finally , and this relates to the last challenge , clinton will have to contend with her husband
as she learned in 2008 , clinton is not always easy to control
hillary clinton has the potential to be a hugely successful presidential candidate
