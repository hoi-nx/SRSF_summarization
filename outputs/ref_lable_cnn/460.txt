pope pope risked turkey anger on sunday by using the word " genocide " to refer to the mass killings of armenians a century ago under the ottoman empire
" in the past century , our human family has lived through three massive and unprecedented tragedies , " the pope said at a mass at st. peter 's basilica to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the armenian massacres
the nation recalled its ambassador to the vatican for " consultations " just hours after pope ' comments , the turkish foreign ministry said
earlier , turkey summoned the ambassador from the vatican for a meeting , turkey state broadcaster trt reported
turkey 's former ambassador to the vatican , gursoy , told cnn in a telephone interview that while it is the first time turkey has summoned its ambassador home from the vatican , " this does not mean that our diplomatic ties with the vatican are over
" " since this is a situation that we do not approve of , as a first reaction , ( the ambassador ) is summoned to get consultation , " gursoy said , adding that the pope 's use of the word " genocide " was " a one - sided evaluation
" in a tweet sunday on his official account , turkey 's foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu called the pope 's use of the word " unacceptable " and " out of touch with both historical facts and legal basis
" armenian groups and many scholars say that turkey planned and carried out genocide , starting in 1915 , when more than a million ethnic armenians were massacred in the final years of the ottoman empire
turkey officially denies that a genocide took place , saying hundreds of thousands of armenian christians and turkey muslims died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of world war i. the armenian government and influential armenian diaspora groups have urged countries around the world to formally label the 1915 events as genocide
