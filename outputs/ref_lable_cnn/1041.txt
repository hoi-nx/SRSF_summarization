the victory of a 72 - year - old former general , buhari , in the nigeria elections represents a moment of maturity in west african politics
buhari , who some 30 years ago was nigeria 's harsh military leader , could of course prove to be a disaster ; so many self - described reformers have been
swath but the peaceful transition of power from president jonathan to president buhari is the first of its kind in history
and the fact that the winner ran on an anti-corruption platform suggests that ordinary nigeria have finally had enough of the venality of their elites
for too long , nigeria 's poor have been victims of their country 's enormous wealth
i visited nigeria in january and found a country under siege
it 's a place where poor children rise at dawn to sift through the trash cans for food and black magic is practiced by the side of the road at dusk
yet thanks to nigeria 's oil , there is also tremendous wealth in abuja
for a while , that system brought some stability to the government of jonathan
the problem of corruption went hand - in - glove with the rise of terrorism
nigeria is not a natural , comfortable nation state ; it 's composed of many ethnicities and two major competing religions
the south is dominated by christians like jonathan , the north by muslim like buhari
" westerners might assume that boko haram 's major target is the christian south but , in fact , its war is as much against nonfundamentalist muslim as it is non-muslims , and its attacks have generally been focused on islamic population centers
failure to deal with this has not entirely been due to boko haram 's strategic ingenuity
and the jonathan government might have benefited from the boko haram terrorist emergency continuing in muslim centers , for the muslim were far more likely to vote for buhari
now he has won the presidency promising to tackle those intertwined problems of boko haram and corruption
but they can not deny that he has won this historic victory because he has touched a chord with a people exhausted by years of misrule
