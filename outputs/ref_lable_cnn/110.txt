the mcdonald 's announcement that the company is going to raise wages for 90,000 of its employees is a significant victory for fast - food cooks and cashiers and those of us who support them
by standing up together , fast - food workers are making it less acceptable for profitable companies like mcdonald 's to pay wages so low that its workers are boxed into poverty
but this action , which would raise starting wages at 1,500 mcdonald - owned restaurants to at least $ 1 an hour more than the minimum wage set by local law , falls short in three important ways first , it leaves out the vast majority of mcdonald 's workers
the announcement only affects 10 % of the mcdonald 's restaurants in the american , ignoring the employees who work at franchised mcdonald 's restaurants
mcdonald 's claims that it has no responsibility for those franchises , but its workers , and the national labor relations board , disagree
one dollar above the minimum wage is n't enough to make paying for groceries , rent and transportation much easier , especially coming from a company that makes nearly $ 5 billion a year in profits
thirdly , the raise does nothing to help workers have a voice in determining their workplace conditions
mcdonald 's and other companies need to stop trying to prevent their workers from speaking out together in a union
we are wining this fight , and the mcdonald 's announcement is proof that the momentum is on our side
when all mcdonald 's workers have more money in their pockets , they will inject money back into their neighborhoods , boosting the entire economy
today , thousands of mcdonald 's workers live below the federal poverty line
we 're going to keep organizing and keep fighting until the workers at mcdonald , and every other fast - food restaurant , get what makes sense for their families and our communities : a $ 15 per hour wage and a path to form a union without interference or retaliation
