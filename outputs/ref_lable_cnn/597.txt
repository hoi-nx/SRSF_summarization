tuesday is equal pay day , the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women 's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for " lost " wages as a result of the so - called wage gap
in the wake of hillary clinton 's presidential announcement , the " holiday " has special meaning
here 's the thing : that 77 - cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated
it 's a comparison of averages -- comparing full - time working women with full - time working men -- that does n't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one 's salary such as education , profession , title , time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day , to name a few
when we do control for these variables , a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4 - 6 cents , some of which may be the result of gender discrimination , but also is likely a function of women 's choices and different behavior , such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply ca n't control
opinion : why hillary clinton should take a pay cut still , conservatives -- and by extension republicans -- ought to be paying attention to equal pay day
the facts about the gender wage gap but women voters are valuable , and equal pay day ought to be a reminder that democrats are n't ready to surrender
map : where the gender pay gap is the widest the independent women 's forum conducted a randomized , controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap , and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the paycheck fairness act -- a legislative " solution " to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for democrats
it 's tempting on days such as equal pay day for republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by wednesday
