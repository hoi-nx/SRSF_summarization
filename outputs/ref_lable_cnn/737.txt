monty python in a movie ? what a silly idea
but the timing was right for the gang of british comedians ( along with their token united states , gilliam ) , who were looking to hit the big screen after four seasons of " monty python 's flying circus , " their groundbreaking british tv series
" monty python and the holy grail , " which premiered 40 years ago thursday , was the result
the movie , a spoof of the arthurian legend , did not start auspiciously
the budget was small -- about $ 400,000 , half of it supplied by rock stars , including genesis and pink floyd
on the first day of filming in scotland -- the first shot , in fact -- the camera broke
on the day of its first united states screening in new york , a thousand people were in line by 8 a.m. thanks to the popularity of " monty python " on united states tv , the movie was a box - office hit , making $ 5 million -- more than 10 times its budget
more importantly , it soon became a comedy classic
" monty python member idle turned the film into the tony - winning broadway play " spamalot

is there a best one ? where should you start ? let 's break them down : from its dramatic opening credits featuring fake - sweden subtitles to the adventures of sir launcelot ( " the boldest and most expensive of the knights " ) , weighted - bird computations and sudden animator heart attacks , " holy grail " is probably the loosest and most monty python of the monty python oeuvre
as a movie with a plot and character and all that movie nonsense , it falls short -- but as a repository for some of monty python 's best gags , it remains perhaps the best ( and certainly most quotable ) of the bunch
probably monty python 's most consistent movie , " life of brian " is the story of a guy born down the road from jesus who finds himself hailed as a messiah and ends up crucified
the film was picketed in cities across the united states , deplored by some religious leaders and banned in ireland and norway
( sweden promoted it with the line , " the film so funny that it was banned in norway
" meaning of life , " constructed as a series of sketches , is the most uneven of the three narrative monty python films
after the stunning opening sequence , gilliam 's " the crimson permanent assurance " -- about the revenge of some pirate - like accountants -- the film struggles to find its footing
it also has the sweetest of all monty python songs : idle 's " the galaxy song , " which is even more uplifting than " brian 's " " always look on the bright side of life
