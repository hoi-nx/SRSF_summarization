soon , america will be too fat to fight
in about five years , so many young america will be grossly overweight that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers
obesity , he told me , " is becoming a national security issue
" i was so taken aback by batschelet 's statement that i felt the need to press him
come on ! obesity ? a national security crisis ? the general did n't blink
" of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country , only 72,000 qualified
before you accuse me of sensationalizing , it 's that 10 % figure that worries general batschelet the most
" the obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction , " he said
" it 's a sad testament to who we are as a society right now
" the problem is so worrisome for the u.s army that recruiters have become fitness coaches , like the trainers on the nbc show , " the biggest loser
" except the u.s army never considered the type of growth it 's now contending with
the general , along with so many others in this country , is struggling with why so many america , despite all the warnings , continue to eat too much and exercise too little
but it 's got to be true : we just do n't care
" the acceptance of obesity is prevalent , " according to claire putnam , an obstetrician and gynecologist who believes obesity is a national crisis right now
it 's seems normal , " she said
just look at the numbers : more than one - third of america adults are obese
seventeen percent of all children and adolescents in the america are obese
that 's triple the rate from just a generation ago
if 70 % of us are overweight in this country , why are there so many willing to fat - shame people who are not remotely obese ? maybe it 's easier to criticize others for carrying extra weight than to admit we have a weight problem ourselves
dr. putnam points to one of kaiser permanante 's medical questionnaires
there is actually a box on the form that allows the patient to " opt out of talking about obesity
" cnn 's chief medical correspondent , dr. sanjay gupta , agrees with putnam
" perceptions of weight are a big part of the problem , " he said to me
so much so it 's becoming a national security problem
