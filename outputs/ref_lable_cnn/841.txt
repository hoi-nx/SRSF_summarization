with his youthful energy and latino roots , it 's tempting to see marco rubio as the new blood that the gop needs in order to compete against hillary clinton in 2016
yet marco rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues : immigration reform and cuba relations
back in 2013 , marco rubio was a member of the senate " gang of 8 " that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform , including a path to citizenship for the nation 's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants
his retreat on immigration means that marco rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive gop presidential candidates
no wonder the research firm latino decisions reports that , " we find no evidence that marco rubio 's candidacy will draw significant latino support for his candidacy or for his party more generally
" so , if marco rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow latino , he is mistaken
" but when it comes to cuba policy , marco rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past
by clinging to the notion that isolating cuba is better than engaging with the communist country , marco rubio has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership
immigration and cuba policy aside , marco rubio 's political philosophy will be a tough sell to latino
however , the obamacare has led to a 12.3 % drop in the latino uninsured rate , making latinos the demographic with the largest gain in insurance , thanks to the law
) marco rubio favors smaller government , while latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less
and though marco rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans , the new york times has noted that latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue
but his work on the failed immigration bill notwithstanding , marco rubio has a significant lack of accomplishments to show for his five years in the senate
unfortunately , a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for marco rubio , and not for latino voters .
