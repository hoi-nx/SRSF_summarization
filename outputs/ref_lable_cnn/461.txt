the idea of sustainable development is that raw capitalism is far too powerful for its own good
global capitalism is a juggernaut , with the world economy now doubling in size every generation
yet on a finite earth , with a billion new people being added every 15 years , that juggernaut is now laying siege to the physical bases of life and the social support systems that make life pleasant and decent
the reality is that raw capitalism is the economics of greed
unleash greed , the theory goes , and type - a personalities around the world will spend inordinate energy to organize businesses , invent new products , and thereby raise well - being
and in some sense , there 's a lot to say for this theory
after all , the world economy has expanded at least 100-fold since modern industrial capitalism first found its footing in britain around 1800 , and for most of the world , living standards have risen markedly along the way
instead , untrammeled greed also leads to massive fraud , mega-tax evasion , pervasive bribery , modern slavery , rising inequalities , and environmental destruction
the environment is a nuisance and a hindrance to greed
and greed rules the moral order at the top of raw capitalism
unleash greed as the supreme economic good , and it is greed that we get as the ultimate moral arbiter
sustainable development is a doctrine that says : let us once again place the economy on a true moral foundation and we 'll keep greed within bounds , ensuring the economic growth is combined with social fairness and environmental sustainability
yes , there can and should be economic growth , especially for today 's developing countries
this balanced approach is much harder to achieve than the raw capitalism that places the economy above society and the physical earth
last year was the earth 's hottest year on record , and another year of mega-storms , droughts , floods , and heat waves
it turns out that with goodwill , cooperation , greed kept in check , and technological savvy , we can build a modern global economy that is productive , inclusive , and environmentally sustainable all at the same time
and , more generally , although the american political system still feeds untrammeled greed by enabling super-rich campaign donors and lobbyists to buy the political class , the american people and much of the rest of the world are coming to recognize the urgency of sustainable development
