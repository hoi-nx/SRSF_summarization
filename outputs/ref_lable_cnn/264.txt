tikrit , iraqi mass graves believed to hold iraqi soldiers have been discovered in newly liberated tikrit
isis claimed to have executed that many soldiers captured in june outside camp speicher , a fortified iraqi base near tikrit
a total of 47 bodies have been exhumed from two of the 11 mass graves discovered in tikrit , an iraqi government official said tuesday
hundreds are believed to have been executed by isis in june 2014 grieving iraqi , apparently not related to the soldiers , gathered to pray over the bodies
when the first three bodies were found , 10 iraqi soldiers saluted the dead by firing seven shots into the air
damon said there may be eight mass graves inside the presidential palace complex , which contains the residences of former iraqi president saddam hussein , and two other sites outside the city
iraqi soldiers and shiite militias retook tikrit a few days ago after a fierce battle
the solider said isis captured the troops outside camp speicher and marched them to the presidential palace complex , telling them they would be safe until a prisoner swap was arranged
once inside the compound , the soldiers were separated into smaller groups , executed and buried in mass graves , the survivor told damon
as isis swept through northern iraqi in june , some military units were ordered to camp speicher
human rights watch described the " speicher massacre " -- as it has been dubbed in iraqi -- as the " largest reported incident " where " isis captured more than 1,000 soldiers fleeing camp speicher ... then summarily executed at least 800 of them
" based on satellite imagery and witness testimony , human rights watch last year was able to identity a number of mass grave sites inside tikrit and the presidential palace complex
