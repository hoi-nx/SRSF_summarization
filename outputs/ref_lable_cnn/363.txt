it 's a good thing -- a lucky thing -- that a bystander had the courage and presence of mind to record the shocking video that shows a white police officer , slager , gunning down and killing an apparently unarmed black man named walter scott after a traffic stop in north charleston , south carolina
and the resulting national wave of revulsion and indignation -- along with the prompt arrest of slager on murder charges -- is a welcome and appropriate response
it 's not supposed to be a mystery : more than 20 years ago , congress approved a law , the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 , signed by president bill clinton , that requires the federal justice department to collect data on deaths caused by police
the law has never truly been implemented , leaving us with patchy information about particular episodes rather than a comprehensive sense of how race and policing play out in america
what if there was no video ? what if there was no witness -- or hero , as i call him -- to come forward ? " said l. chris stewart , an attorney for walter scott 's family
in early police statements -- issued before the video came to light -- slager reportedly said that walter scott attacked him , that he fired only after a scuffle and that cops made medical efforts to revive walter scott
the video makes hash of those claims , and likely contributed to slager 's swift arrest and pending murder charges
collecting information from the nation 's thousands of jurisdictions -- the myriad villages , counties and cities -- is a tough , expensive assignment
the job is even harder because many police departments , reluctant to air their dirty laundry , fail to distinguish between justified and unjustified killings on the reasonable grounds that it 's up to the courts to rule on whether an officer has committed brutality -- something that 's often established only after years of court proceedings
some of the data gap has been filled by media organizations -- and what they have discovered only underscores the need for muscular , mandatory enforcement of the data - gathering law
in no case was an officer convicted or even fired because of an on - duty shooting
in south carolina last month , the state newspaper published an examination of 209 instances in which officers shot at suspects , and found that only a handful of officers were charged , and none found guilty
" in south carolina , it remains exceedingly rare for an officer to be found at fault criminally for shooting at someone , " the columbia newspaper concluded
as the las vegas review-journal editorialized in 2011 : " how many lives might be saved if taxpayers everywhere were better informed about police shootings ? how can they know about a potential local problem without information ? ... police already track everything from domestic violence to child abuse to murder , and police routinely lobby state and federal lawmakers to put new crimes into statute
" that common - sense observation is being echoed by the barack obama administration -- specifically , the president 's task force on 21st century policing , created in december in response to widespread protests following the police killings of unarmed black men including michael brown and eric garner
it 's long past time we got to the truth of how many more killings like walter scott 's are happening without a video to set the record straight .
