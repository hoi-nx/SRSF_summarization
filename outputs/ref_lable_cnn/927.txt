a small group plays with rocks , replacements for the toys they left behind when they fled , while others clamber through a jagged tear in the wire fence surrounding the refugee camp
the shariya refugee camp opened around six months ago , made up of some 4,000 tents and counting
thousands of yazidis now call this corner of iraqi iraqi home , about 18 miles ( 30 kilometers ) from one of the front lines with isis , where one can hear the occasional reverberation in the distance of what we are told are airstrikes
the vast majority of the camp 's occupants are from the town of sinjar , which is near the border with syrian kurdistan , and fled the isis assault there back in august
isis took thousands of yazidis captive
mahmoud was out running errands when isis fighters arrived , taking his wife , ahlam , their three children -- the youngest of which was just a month old -- and his elderly parents
" they took our phones , jewelry , money , " ahlam recalls
ahlam and her family chose to herd goats
in the home , ahlam found a cell phone left behind by its former occupants and called her husband
" ahlam 's husband , who up until that moment had lost the will to live , thinking his family was dead , says he cried out of happiness despite his pain
ahlam would call when she could , briefly , after midnight , hiding under her bedcovers
the village itself was a massive prison , its entrances guarded by isis fighters
ahlam tells us that about a week before we met , isis fighters came by and took away her in - laws and the other elderly people living in the house
ahlam cradled the baby , as her two other children , ages 3 and 4 years old , clutched at her clothes
" when the sun started to come up , i thought that 's it , we are going to get caught , " ahlam says
" luckily , ahlam never had to answer that impossible question
mahmoud , gently caressing his daughter 's palm , says he could hardly believe that the woman whose stunning eyes and gentle words he had fallen in love with , and their three children , were by his side again
a few days after mahmoud and ahlam were reunited , isis released 217 captives
among them were 60 children , a handful of men and women , and the rest were elderly -- including mahmoud 's parents
" but ahlam 's parents are still with isis
dakhil , a yazidis member of iraq 's parliament , speculates that the yazidis isis released are individuals they were struggling to care for
she will be addressing the united nations -- pleading for more international support for iraq and more airstrikes to help defeat isis -- and she will address the plight of the yazidis
" ahlam says she was spared because she was breastfeeding and she had young children , which , we 're told , makes her impure and therefore unable to be used as a sex slave
for ahlam , what she went through was not the hardest part of her ordeal
it 's the moment when the isis fighters began taking away the girls and young women
