a photo of a baby boy being pulled from the rubble of the nepal earthquake has become the defining image of a disaster that has devastated the country
on saturday , sonit was at home in muldhoka , bhaktapur , east of the capital kathmandu , when the 7.8 - magnitude quake sent tremors through nepal and neighboring countries , according to kathmandu today
on sunday morning , the soldiers returned and at 10 a.m they lifted sonit clear of the fallen rocks , beams , bricks and dust that had trapped him for 22 hours
sonit 's face was exposed during the whole ordeal , though a hooded top and shawl protected his head and body during the cold night spent under rubble
