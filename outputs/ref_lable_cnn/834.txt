helinski hit it big thanks to the social security , and a big - hearted cop and a case worker determined to untangle major bureaucracy
the shelter where the case worker works set helinski up with a bunk and a locker
but getting him into the system was hard , because helinski 's id and social security cards had been stolen
a hassle all by itself , except that helinski was foreign born -- in poland , as an american citizen
" we first had to figure out that we needed a consular record of foreign birth or something like that , " said tampa police officer mcdonald , who pitched in to help helinski
with those papers squared away , he and inman got helinski a driver 's license and a social security card
then , helinski remembered that he used to have an account with a certain landmark bank
the account was still there , and the social security had n't forgotten about him
