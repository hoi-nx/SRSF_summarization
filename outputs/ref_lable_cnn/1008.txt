as crazy as this sounds , to put an entire head on a new body , a human body , italian physician dr. canavero says we are approaching heaven ( an acronym for head anastomosis venture ; anastomosis is surgically connecting two parts )
canavero says he has part of the funding secured , although he says he ca n't yet disclose where the money is coming from as a condition of the funding
the 30 - year - old russian man suffers from a rare genetic disorder called werdnig-hoffman disease
canavero says the man volunteered
the two men have talked via skype but they have yet to meet in person and canavero has not reviewed spiridonov 's medical records
canavero says he has a stack of emails and letters from people who want this procedure
but he insists the first patients will be people who are suffering from a muscle wasting disease
canavero ca n't just do this in his own frankenstein lab. he needs a major academic medical center to host this endeavor and he has his eyes set on the united states
he 's counting on getting the green light he needs for the first human whole head transplant to take place in 2017
nick rebel , executive director of aanos , says the group is not endorsing canavero , it is simply giving him a platform to hear what he has to say
if canavero does n't get the support he needs in the united states , he 'll look to china and his timeline will slide by a year
once these pieces are in place , canavero says he 'll put together a staff of 150 nurses and doctors
" i say two years is the time needed for the team to reach perfect synchronization , " canavero speculates
canavero points to dr. white , who transplanted the head of one monkey to the body of another at case western reserve university school of medicine in 1970
the monkey died after eight days , because the body rejected the new head
before ithe monkey died , it could not move because the spinal cord of the head and body were not connected
the paper in which canavero outlined his procedure references a different 1971 experiment white conducted with six monkey heads , none of which survived more than 24 hours
but canavero says advances in science and medicine since then eliminate the problems white faced
dr. batjer , chairman of neurological surgery at ut southwestern and president - elect of the american association for neurological surgeons , says white 's research is not validation for a human head transplant
" [ it 's ] a 45 - year - old reference in a primate and there is no evidence that the spinal cord was anastomosed functionally , " he says
he cites white 's monkeys and even the success of german researchers who helped paralyzed rats walk , giving no pause to the fact that such research is more likely to go nowhere than to make it to human clinical trials
caplan also points out that if canavero can do this , he should first be helping paralyzed patients by fixing their spinal cords , before transplanting whole bodies
" in his paper , canavero says identity issues could be a problem as the head gets used to its new body
as far as immunosuppression , canavero points to today 's transplant successes as evidence this is not a problem
he says it does n't make sense that you 'd poison a new body with immunosuppressant medications to make a head transplant work
