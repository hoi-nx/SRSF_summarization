the united states is failing its partners
if you want to understand one of the reasons that terrorism has been allowed to spread , it is that the majority of our partners do not have credible and capable special operations forces to respond to and defeat the current threat -- and we 're not doing nearly enough to address the problem
the trouble is that little of our foreign military financing -- including the recent counterterrorism partnership funds -- goes toward this vital facet in our efforts to counter extremism
the 2015 national security strategy speaks to the importance of united states - led partnerships , while the 2014 quadrennial defense review noted that we " will rebalance our counterterrorism efforts toward greater emphasis on building partnership capacity
" despite this apparent recognition , the united states is not where it needs to be and instead finds itself constantly responding to crises instead of heading them off because of the failure to prioritize long - term investment in special operations units in key partner nations
sadly , kenya is not the exception -- and it is by no means the only country missing out on vital united states assistance
in 2015 , united states taxpayers are providing $ 5.65 billion in foreign military finance , the majority of which is going to israel and egypt
simply put , the united states is spreading foreign military assistance too thin , while also failing to make necessary long - term commitments
it takes years to build special operations forces with credible capabilities
but although it is a worthwhile investment in terms of resources and energy , united states security assistance is not supporting enduring programs that build credible special operations partners
this program , as well as the recent united states mission to support our filipino partners against abu sayyaf , demonstrates the power of a persistent presence by u.s. special forces when coupled with long - term funding and true interagency cooperation
true , the section 1206 global train and equip program fulfills some needs , but money from the program only provides limited support -- it is an annual appropriation for " new and emerging " counterterrorist operations or to support military and stability operations in which the united states armed forces are a participant
another program that builds special operations capacity , the joint combined exchange and training program , is also insufficient because it is ad hoc and meant to train united states forces first and foremost , not our partners
by investing everywhere , we are investing nowhere , which is why we need to make choices about where the united states and its allies will see maximum benefit
