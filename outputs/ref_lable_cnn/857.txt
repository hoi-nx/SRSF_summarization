this concept of " how we digest images of war through mainstream media outlets , " was what drove photographer simon brann thorpe to begin his project " toy soldiers
" this idea to create a fresh perspective drove him into the desert of western sahara , a long - disputed region of northwestern africa
simon brann thorpe uses the area 's harsh landscape as a powerful backdrop for soldiers posed as green plastic figurines -- similar to the popular toys that many children play with
simon brann thorpe said his project enables " the creation of a visual metaphor from which a viewer develops their own emotional , physical and political response to war and conflict , when faced with the realization that the images do not contain toy soldiers but real soldiers
" simon brann thorpe 's background was not in photojournalism , but in landscape photography , which lends to his powerful placement of the soldiers in the desert -- not to mention that all the locations chosen are historic locations of battles between moroccan and the polisario front
" the conflict in western sahara receives virtually zero coverage despite 2015 being the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of war there , " simon brann thorpe said
the autumn months did not offer much reprieve from the long hours in the sweltering desert sun. simon brann thorpe would work with the troops ' commander to position the men , then climb atop sandy mountains with his wide - angle lens and capture these striking images
