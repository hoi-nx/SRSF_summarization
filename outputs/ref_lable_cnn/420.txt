los angeles former rap mogul knight was ordered thursday to stand trial for murder and other charges stemming from a deadly hit - and - run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic " straight outta compton " earlier this year
in addition to that ruling , judge ronald coen also lowered knight 's bail to $ 10 million from $ 25 million , a figure that defense lawyers called excessive
the judge also dismissed one of the two counts of hit - and - run against knight
in all , knight will stand trial on one count of murder , one count of attempted murder and one count of hit - and - run , the judge ruled after holding a two - day preliminary hearing this week that ended thursday
knight , 49 , faces up to life in prison if convicted
knight suffers diabetes and blot clots , and the case has clearly strained him : he collapsed in court last month after learning of the $ 25 million bail and he was taken to the hospital for treatment
knight was in court thursday
" the judge dismissed the other hit - and - run count because california law says no more than one charge of hit - and - run should be brought against a defendant when the same weapon , in this case the vehicle knight was driving , is used against several people
at the time , knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case
the hit - and - run was captured on videotape and allegedly shows knight inside a red truck
in closing arguments prior to the judge 's ruling , knight 's attorney fletcher argued that knight was the victim
" los angeles county deputy district attorney barnes argued , however , told the judge that knight was engaged in " mutual combat situation " where he used his car as deadly weapon
if knight " ever had the right of self - defense , the moment he backed - up and mr. sloan was ran - over , he lost the right of self - defense , " barnes said
the incident is the latest run - in with the law for knight , who founded the wildly successful death row records in 1991 and signed artists such as snoop ( now known as snoop ) and shakur
in august , knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity - filled sunset strip party hosted by singer chris brown on the eve of the mtv video music awards .
