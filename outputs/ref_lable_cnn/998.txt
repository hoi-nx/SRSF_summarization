in case you needed a reminder that president obama is n't running for office again , he just alienated not only republicans , who have largely resented him from day one , but the progressive base of democratic voters
obama has argued with the progressive potentate elizabeth warren , calling her " wrong " on trade policy
the massachusetts senator is the same potentate to whom hillary clinton has been religiously prostrating
warren has publicly criticized so - called " fast track " trade authority that would allow the white house to negotiate massive , multination trade deals with little congressional oversight
the authority would pave the way for trade pacts such as the tpp , which is modeled on the nafta , and has killed 700,000 americans jobs and drove wages down in the americans while simultaneously decimating mexican agriculture and small businesses
aspects of the tpp deal would provide incentives for off - shoring jobs to low - wage countries , imposing limits on government regulations around food safety and the environment , and create mechanisms for multinational corporations to challenge any domestic laws they simply do n't like
at a town hall with msnbc 's chris matthews on tuesday , president obama said , " i love elizabeth warren
" obama added , " when you hear folks make a lot of suggestions about how bad this trade deal is , when you dig into the facts , they are wrong
meanwhile , hillary clinton is trying to walk a fine line somewhere in the middle
yet it becomes harder to paint clinton as the " original elizabeth warren " each time she equivocates on trade policy and the tpp
while it 's not surprising that republicans are siding with big business and against working americans in supporting the tpp , it 's befuddling that president obama supports it
senate majority leader harry reid minced no words in revealing his position about trade " fast track " authority : " i 'm not only no , i 'm hell no. " if hillary clinton wants to prove she 's a real populist , now 's her chance to be even more clear .
