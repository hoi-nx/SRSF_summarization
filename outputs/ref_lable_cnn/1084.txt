actress linda thompson , bruce jenner 's second wife , says she can " breathe a little easier " knowing her ex-husband has found the strength to publicly declare he is transgender
linda thompson , who had two sons with jenner during their five - year marriage , was one of many relatives to cheer jenner for publicly sharing what she had known for decades
" he can finally realize his need to be who he authentically is , who he was born to be
" linda thompson wrote that she would not have married jenner if she had known about his " gender issue " when they first met
but she 's glad she did n't know because she would have missed the chance to share a life with him , including their two sons
" looking back , i 'm so grateful to god , the universe , and bruce jenner that i did n't know , and that bruce jenner played the role in my life that he did , " she said in the column
the two met in 1979 at a celebrity tennis tournament at the playboy mansion , while jenner was in the process of separating from his first wife
" the bruce jenner i knew back then was unstudied , affable , and seemingly very comfortable in his own skin
" linda thompson said jenner told her in 1985 that , despite it all , " he identified as a woman " and hoped to move forward with the process of becoming a woman
" confused and desperate , linda thompson suggested therapy to help her understand what he was going through and " determine if it was something we could overcome or ' fix
linda thompson says jenner did not remain a presence in their lives after he married kris kardashian , mother of kim , khloe , khourtney and rob kardashian
linda thompson said she forgives jenner for those years
