as u.s. mark the 150th anniversary of lincoln 's death this week , let us remember that he not only belongs to the ages , but also belongs , in a special way , to land of lincoln
lincoln 's two greatest legacies -- indivisible union and irreversible emancipation -- grew organically from his midwestern roots
" lincoln supplemented his midwestern geography lesson with a distinctly midwestern claim about constitutional history : " union is older than any of the states ; and in fact , it created them as u.s.
" lincoln did not need to make this controversial claim to prove his case , and elsewhere he stressed the decisive legal point that the constitution 's text clearly prohibits unilateral secession
but lincoln 's additional assertion that the union created the states , not vice versa , provoked strong disagreement in other parts of the country
but if lee was , first and always , a virginia , lincoln was an u.s.
these places had begun as federal territory -- the common inheritance of all u.s. -- and it was the federal government that had indeed brought these new states to life
it was a wise set of federal policies -- proper land surveys and a commitment to public education -- that had drawn the lincolns and countless other kentuckians to leave the kentuckian for a brighter future in the midwestern
retracing lincoln 's assassination 150 years later that brighter future also involved freedom from slavery
the words of the 13th amendment -- the only constitutional amendment that lincoln would live to sign -- promised to end slavery everywhere in u.s. and did so by borrowing verbatim from article 6 of the northwest ordinance
many other midwesterners in lincoln 's era embraced slavery and secession
hugo black , the court justice who did the most to make lincoln 's constitutional vision a reality over the next century , was born and raised in alabama
john wilkes booth , the dastard who ended lincoln 's life 150 years ago this week , was an embittered extremist from a slave state
so was lincoln 's nemesis on the court , chief justice taney
remembering lincoln 's murder in our era , given the fact that republican appointees have held a majority of the court for the last 40 years , the court has been rather moderate
and the leader of her adopted political party -- who also happens to be president -- is a lanky and brainy lawyer from land of lincoln who knows how to give a good speech , and who swept to power in 2008 by recreating lincoln 's geographic coalition , winning every state within a four - hour drive of chicago
