the u.s. has gained much from its position as a space - faring nation
indeed , u.s. access to space has provided incredible benefit to u.s. national security , defense and the economic well - being of the nation
unfortunately , as global threats increase and the need for assured space access accelerates , the u.s. is faced with a troubling reality -- we are far too reliant on russia technology to meet our national security obligations
assured access to space is an area where the u.s. should not be reliant on nonsecure foreign supply chains , which are subject to disruption , threats , unfavorable contracts and undue leverage against the interests of the u.s. the ukraine crisis should have served as a wake - up call , highlighting the danger of dependence on russia to launch national security satellites into space
simply put , it is bad policy to rely on others for critical national security requirements , and worse policy when this reliance supports countries taking action in direct contradiction to u.s. national security interests
dmitry rogozin , a russia deputy prime minister in charge of defense and space industries , has called u.s. taxpayer outlays for the russia engine " free money " that goes directly back into russia 's missile modernization programs
there are steps that the u.s. can take now to ensure our access to space and secure our comparative advantage in space -- and in the world
however , a combination of existing capabilities and dynamic development of new capabilities by the private sector can serve as a foundation for eliminating any capability gap in the u.s. space program
having both options will put u.s. on the path to fielding its indigenous space capabilities for the next generation , while strengthening a space industrial base weakened since the end of the cold war
this would be good for national security , good for u.s. innovation and the industrial base -- and good for our country 's future .
