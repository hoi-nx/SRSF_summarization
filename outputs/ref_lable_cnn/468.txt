this week , a higher court scrutinized a lesser - known trademark -- when the band the slants sought to protect its name
the slants are five asian - american musicians from portland , oregon , who pay homage to the ' 80s on stage -- and homage to their heritage in an ironic way
" we want to take on stereotypes that people have about us , like the slanted eyes , and own them , " simon shiao tam , the band 's front - man , said
to the slants , " slant " is n't an insult , it is empowering
unfortunately , a bureaucrat at the u.s. patent and trademark office decided that " slant " was disparaging to asians , and denied them a trademark registration under the despised ( by me , anyhow ) section 2 ( a ) of the trademark act
this is the section that lets the government deny trademark protection to a mark that is " immoral , " " scandalous " or " disparaging
in the the slants ' case , these are asian guys who say " it does n't bother us , so why should it bother you ? " and it is n't as if any asian groups got involved
they made similar arguments that resonated : if they wanted to call themselves " dykes on bikes , " then what place does the government have in judging that decision ? in another decision , the trademark office initially denied a registration for buddha beachwear on the grounds that buddhists would find it disparaging
" so why are n't the slants given the same privileges as dykes on bikes or buddha beachwear ? it is largely a sign of the times
for starters , by trying to protect asians from racism , the court issued a disturbingly racist decision based on the fact that these were , in fact , asians who intended their band name to invoke their ethnicity
even worse , this decision gets the first amendment wrong
well , the court does give us a sort - of dissent styled as " additional views
the dissent in this case recognizes the fact that trademarks are commercial speech , which is protected by the first amendment
" since section 2 ( a ) discriminates against first amendment protected expression on the basis of its content , the court has called for 2 ( a ) to be , finally , deemed unconstitutional
" but , i wo n't be allowed to register that trademark -- although the five asian guys from the slants could
