two cnn heroes are among the earthquake survivors in kathmandu , nepal
anuradha koirala , who rescues victims of sex trafficking , has a rehabilitation center in kathmandu that is home to 425 young women and girls
while her primary facility seems structurally unharmed , all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks , followed by a second earthquake on may 12
it is very , very hard , " said anuradha koirala , the founder of the nonprofit maiti nepal and the 2010 cnn heroes
anuradha koirala 's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food
still , she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster
" these girls are most vulnerable , because now people will target them , " anuradha koirala said
" about five miles away , the wall of anuradha koirala 's hiv / aids hospice has crumbled
" they 're not injured , but they are terrified , " anuradha koirala said
" anuradha koirala 's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district , and all of them have been damaged
" it 's really very sad for me and for my children , " anuradha koirala said
" another cnn heroes , pushpa basnet , and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence
but mentally , we are , " said pushpa basnet , whose early childhood development center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated
pushpa basnet says the building 's walls are all cracked , and the staff is afraid it might fall down
" it 's really cold in the middle of the night ; there are lots of fox in the field , " pushpa basnet said
" they also do n't have much water or food , pushpa basnet says
" pushpa basnet 's " butterfly home " -- the permanent residence she was building for the children -- also suffered extensive damage in the quake
pushpa basnet had hoped to complete construction in the next six months , with the opening ceremony set for october
pushpa basnet purchased the land for the home with prize money she received as the 2012 cnn heroes
" still , pushpa basnet is quick to point out that so many other survivors have nothing and are desperately in need of aid
to that end , several cnn heroes have been assisting in relief efforts in nepal
