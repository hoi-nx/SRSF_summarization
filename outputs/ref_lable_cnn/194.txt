lausanne , switzerland there are plenty of details left to iron out , but negotiators took a significant step thursday toward a landmark deal aimed at keeping iran 's nuclear program peaceful
iran would reduce its stockpile of low - enriched uranium by 98 % and significantly scale back its number of installed centrifuges , according to the plan
" this framework would cut off every pathway that iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon
" the deal would include strict verification measures to make sure iran complies , he said
" key points of the deal the world powers involved in the talks with iran were the u.s. , russia , china , france , the united kingdom and germany
it was tough , very intense at times , sometimes emotional and confrontational
" on thursday , iran state television broadcast barack obama 's speech live , something many iran described as unprecedented
kerry stressed that if a final deal is reached with iran , the removal of any sanctions against tehran will come in phases
... we have serious differences with the u.s. , " foreign minister zarif said after the deal 's framework was announced , noting that " mutual mistrust " had been a serious problem in the talks
the preliminary agreement will not put an end to iran 's enrichment activities , zarif said
but he said iran will abide by the agreement , which would limit enrichment activities to one location , he said
21 questions on iran nuclear talks but work on the deal is n't finished
in the u.s. , the barack obama administration could face an uphill battle selling the deal to a skeptical congress , which has threatened to impose new sanctions on iran
" barack obama maintains the deal would shut down iran 's path to getting a nuclear bomb
" such a deal would not block iran 's path to the bomb
" netanyahu has been lobbying against an agreement since the talks began , warning u.s. lawmakers in a congressional address last month that iran ca n't be trusted
" this framework gives international legitimacy to iran 's nuclear program that aims only to produce nuclear bombs
" if , in fact , prime minister netanyahu is looking for the most effective way to ensure that iran does n't get a nuclear weapon , this is the best option , " barack obama said
over the past nine years , the push and pull over iran 's nuclear program produced a bewildering array of proposals
meanwhile , as talks dragged on , the u.s. , the european union and others imposed sanctions on iran , provoking resentment among tehran 's leaders , who called the sanctions a crime against humanity
the challenge all along was twofold : to assure the international community that iran could not develop nuclear weapons ( which it denied in any event that it was doing ) ; and to accommodate the country 's assertion of its right -- as a signer of the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons -- to enrich nuclear fuel for civilian purposes
the 2013 election of hassan rouhani , a political moderate , to iran 's presidency infused the talks with new hope , though questions lingered over whether he could persuade the country 's hard - liners to accept an agreement
in a march 9 letter signed by 47 republican u.s. senators , iran 's leaders were warned that any deal not approved by the senate could immediately be revoked by president barack obama 's successor in 2017
and iran 's leaders also dismissed the letter
