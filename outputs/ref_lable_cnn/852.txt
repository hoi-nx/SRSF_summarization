in russia 's tightly - managed democracy , where being an opposition politician can seriously damage your health , chances to question the country 's leader are rare
president putin cuts an isolated figure , closely guarded behind the walls of the kremlin , traveling to - and - fro by helicopter or high - speed motorcade
that is why this annual q&a session -- in which putin will spend hours fielding questions from the general public on live television -- is such a widely anticipated event which provokes such excitement
at one call center in moscow , where the public are encouraged to pitch their putin questions , officials say more than 200,000 questions were submitted in the first hour after lines opened
a few would - be questions released ahead of the event give us a flavor of what 's on russia 's mind
one man , who identifies himself as vitaly from the leningrad region , asks : " vladimir vladimirovich ( putin 's middle name ) , why are prices going up in the shops but wages are staying the same ? " sanctions and russia 's deep economic crisis , which saw the value of the russia currency , the ruble , plunge in value by 50 % against the dollar , is set to be a major a theme
with moscow at odds with the west over ukraine , some of the released questions show how concerned ordinary russia are about their country 's place in the world
one unidentified schoolgirl asks : " is there a threat to russia 's interests from the united states and europe ? and will there be a new iron curtain ? " it 's not just russia schoolchildren who want to hear putin 's answer
critics of the kremlin , of course , slam this entire event as russia 's imitation of democracy in action
