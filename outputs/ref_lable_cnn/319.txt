tokyo a bizarre and alarming discovery is raising concerns in japanese about the potential for terrorism involving drones
a drone carrying traces of a radioactive material was found on the rooftop of japanese 's equivalent to the white house on wednesday , police and government officials said
the discovery came on the same day a japanese court approved a government plan to restart two reactors at the sendai nuclear power plant in kagoshima prefecture , more than four years after the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster
prime minister abe 's push to restart the reactors is unpopular among many japanese , who view nuclear energy as too dangerous
police say the drone was equipped with a small camera , smoke flares and a plastic bottle containing small traces of a radioactive material believed to be cesium , a common byproduct of nuclear reactors
cesium was also discovered in areas around the failed fukushima daiichi nuclear plant after its 2011 meltdown
" japanese law restricts drone flights around airports to prevent problems with aircraft , but there are no flight restrictions for most of tokyo , including the prime minister 's residence and local and federal government buildings
