but over the last decade , with fit golfers like tiger , adam scott , and now jordan spieth all winning the masters , the training perspective on golf is shifting
there 's a particular emphasis on the functional movement required to execute the perfect swing , which is why yoga is increasingly appealing to golfers
during the masters , jordan spieth demonstrated optimal movement in two key areas that enhance swing power and fluid control while decreasing the risk of back and knee injuries : mid-back mobility and internal hip rotation
equally important , he did it while maintaining a stable low back and integrated core strength as the foundation for expressing his swing mobility
related : yoga for triathletes remember tiger 's low - back problem earlier this year ? tiger blamed a lack of glute ( primary buttock muscle ) firing for locking up his back , but attempting to rotate from his low back instead of moving functionally from his mid back or hips likely exacerbated the issue
when golfers have mobility limitations in their mid back or hips , they compensate with their low back and knees , which not only hampers play but often leads to pain and injury
want the mobility to swing like jordan spieth and avoid the back and knee issues that commonly plague golfers ? try these three yoga - based moves i use with my pga clients to address the key areas of the swing
trains internal hip rotation ; stabilizes and lengthens lower back muscles ; stretches upper back and shoulders ; encourages ankle mobility start in a neutral all - fours position with your hips over your knees and your shoulders above your wrists
engage your deep core muscles to stabilize your low back
promotes proper mid-back extension ; strengthens shoulder girdle , opens front of shoulders and chest ; lengthens low back lie prone ( belly down ) on your forearms with your elbows under your shoulders
exhale as you press down through your forearms as though you are trying to slide your belly through your arms to create length in your low back
promotes thoracic spine rotation and shoulder girdle function ; stabilizes low back ; activates glutes ( primary muscles of the buttocks ) ; encourages ankle mobility , strengthens adductors ( groins ) , core and legs stand with your feet together ; your big toes should touch but allow space between your heels to avoid externally rotating your hips
inhale as you hold the position , ensuring that your low back does n't arch , and your glutes and core are activated for support
keep your hips and low back stable
adding these yoga - based moves to your workouts will help you develop the mobility for an optimal swing
