gray did not get timely medical care after he was arrested and was not buckled into a seat belt while being transported in a police van , baltimore police said friday
police commissioner batts told reporters there are no excuses for the fact that gray was not buckled in as he was transported to a police station
five days after gray 's death and amid ongoing protests , police officials acknowledged mistakes were made during and after his arrest
gray , who was stopped april 12 after a foot pursuit through several housing complexes , should have received medical attention at the scene of his arrest , said deputy police commissioner davis
batts told reporters in an afternoon news conference : " we know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times
" investigators are trying to learn more about gray 's condition at each of the three stops the van made on its way to a police station
at the first stop , gray was placed in leg irons
the driver stopped a second time " to deal with mr. gray and the facts of that interaction are under investigation , " davis said
an attorney for the gray family said it was positive news , but there is a more important issue
" " what it does not get at is , it does not get at the core of this case and that is why did mr. gray need medical attention in the first place ? ... that 's the question that still has not been answered
" the developments came two days after a police union attorney spoke of the possibility that the injuries occurred during a " rough ride , " a frequently claimed practice in which police vehicles are deliberately driven in a way that injures suspects
gray died sunday , one week after baltimore police arrested him
batts said he had been given preliminary results of an autopsy on gray
the medical examiner 's full autopsy may take another 30 to 45 days , batts said , because toxicology tests still need to be examined and spinal experts may be brought in to assess gray 's injury
" batts addressed calls for his resignation after gray 's death by saying he would not step down
police first encountered gray as they patrolled an area known for crime and drug activity
gray was arrested after police found what they said was a switchblade on him
an attorney for gray 's family has said the knife was a pocket knife of legal size
one video of gray 's arrest shows officers dragging him to a police van , his legs dangling limply behind him
" gray 's family attorneys and protesters said police did n't have any probable cause to chase him but did so only because he was " running while black
" andrew o'connell , an attorney for the gray family , said " police have a lot of questions that need to be answered
the gray family has not yet seen the preliminary autopsy report , attorney william murphy said
downs said the family has commissioned an independent autopsy
while police say five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators , the department has not released details of what the officers said or how gray might have suffered the fatal injury
