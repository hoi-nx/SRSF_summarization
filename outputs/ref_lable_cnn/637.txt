lakhvi was charged in pakistan in 2009 , accused of masterminding the november 2008 terror attacks that left more than 160 people dead in mumbai , india 's most populous city
but an anti-terrorism court granted lakhvi bail last year , a decision the pakistan government said it would challenge
india , pakistan 's neighbor and rival , condemned lakhvi 's bail release on friday
the country contacted pakistan 's foreign secretary to underline " that this has reinforced the perception that pakistan has a dual policy on dealing with terrorists , and those who have carried out attacks or are posing a threat to india are being dealt with differently , " said syed akbaruddin , a spokesman for india 's ministry of external affairs
