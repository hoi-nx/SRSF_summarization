boston when the bomb went off , woolfenden thought he was still standing
that was because , as he lay on the ground , he was still holding the handles of his son 's stroller
he pulled back the stroller 's cover and saw that his son , leo , 3 , was conscious but bleeding from the left side of his head
woolfenden checked leo for other injuries and thought , " let 's get out of here
the boot was next to his left stump , he testified before a federal jury thursday , the third day in which survivors and family members of those killed in the boston marathon bombing shared their stories -- often gruesome and heartbreaking -- in the sentencing phase for dzhokhar tsarnaev
the prosecution rested thursday afternoon after attempting to convince jurors that dzhokhar tsarnaev was cold - hearted and remorseless
the defense , led by famed death penalty opponent judy clarke , is expected to try to soften that portrayal by calling witnesses to explain dzhokhar tsarnaev 's difficult upbringing
clarke will begin those efforts monday
a group of dzhokhar tsarnaev 's relatives arrived at boston 's logan international airport on thursday , cnn affiliate whdh reported , but it 's not clear if they plan to testify
woolfenden , a biomedical researcher for the novartis institutes , recalled using his belt as a tourniquet on his leg and trying to comfort leo
he has treated and operated on hundreds of troops injured by improvised explosive devices , he testified , and what he saw in boston that day was n't much different from the carnage he witnessed in war zones
she finally got to a hospital , and after three attempts to save her foot , which was missing its entire heel , a doctor told her she had a decision : she could keep her leg and risk a life of excruciating pain or have it amputated below the knee
another marathon attendee rendered an amputee by the dzhokhar tsarnaev brothers ' attack , fucarile , recounted the two bombs going off
" a nurse was sitting on his chest , and someone said , " oh , s * * * , he 's on fire ! " he tried to undo his belt and got a third - degree burn because the buckle was so hot
a firefighter would later tell fucarile that he handed his own right leg to the firefighter
and though his left leg survived , it was severely burned , his calf muscle was blown off and his heel was shattered , he said
he hopes to save the left leg , he testified , but it 's likely that it will have to be amputated above the knee
one of the most dramatic points in thursday 's testimony involved the death of young martin
the prosecution showed close - up video of the 8 - year - old , who was only 3Â½ feet from one of the bombs , according to the fbi 's re-creation of the crime scene
his parents , bill and denise , are opposed to dzhokhar tsarnaev receiving the death penalty and did not participate in the penalty phase , though bill richard did testify during the guilt phase
it 's highly unlikely the boy died instantly , king said
" woolfenden , the biomedical researcher , recalled seeing martin and his mother shortly after the good samaritan took woolfenden 's son , leo , to safety
" i saw martin 's face , and i could see a boy that looked like he was fatally injured , " he said , martin 's hair was singed , his eyes had rolled back into his head and his mouth was agape
