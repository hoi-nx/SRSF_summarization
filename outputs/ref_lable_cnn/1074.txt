rome a destination for the destitute , sicily is the " promised land " for thousands of migrants and refugees making the desperate journey from north africa to european 's mediterranean coast
more than 10,000 people have arrived from libya since last weekend alone , according to the italy coast guard
stories of death at sea and unimaginable suffering are nothing new in the waters between north africa and italy ; boat people have been arriving on italy 's islands for more than a decade
in 2008 , the - then italy prime minister silvio berlusconi and gadhafi signed an historic friendship agreement in which italy promised to invest $ 5 billion in libya infrastructure and gadhafi promised to close what he described as a " spigot " of migrants
because italy sent most of those migrants who did not qualify for political asylum back to tunisia , the flow eventually tapered off
but after gadhafi was overthrown , the flow of migrants from libya exploded again : the iom ( iom ) in rome told cnn that more than 140,000 migrants arrived from the north africa coast in 2011
in october 2013 , after a tragic boat accident off the coast of lampedusa in which 349 people -- including an infant still attached to its mother by the umbilical cord -- died , trapped like sardines in their smugglers ' boat as it sank , italy decided it had to act
in november of 2013 , the italian navy launched a â¬ 9m - a - month search - and - rescue program called mare nostrum , in which italy naval ships patrolled the seas to rescue migrants
in just one year , the program rescued more than 160,000 migrants , according to the italian navy
due to budget constraints and criticism from the european union that the program itself was encouraging migrants to head across the mediterranean , the mission ended in october 2014
by the end of the year , more than 174,000 people had been rescued in italy ; an estimated 3,072 people died making the journey , according to the iom
in november last year , the european union 's border control , frontex , started its own mission -- triton -- with a budget of less than a third that of mare nostrum
