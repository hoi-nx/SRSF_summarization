it 's time for liberals to look local
with washington gridlocked over almost everything and congressional republicans standing firm against any further expansion of domestic policy , the odds of democratic congress passing another new deal or great society are minimal
states such as vermont , oregon , and washington as well as new jersey have taken the lead in adopting eco-friendly policies
while democratic congress has resisted president barack obama 's call to raise the federal minimum wage to $ 10.10 from $ 7.25 , 21 states and the washington went ahead and enacted minimum wage increases of their own
at the annual conference for new america in washington last week , the focus was on innovation
as the atlantic 's james fallows explained to the audience , when one moves beneath the gridlock of washington and down to the towns and communities of new america , it is quickly possible to see the " functionality of politics " -- where partisanship does not trump the need to solve problems
this has given liberals an opening
in detroit , a company called detroit dirt is taking food scraps from local eating establishments and transforming them into compost for gardens to nurture communities and lower the environmental footprint of the city , pashon murray said at the new america conference
jonathan mintz , the founding president and ceo of cities for financial empowerment fund , explained how his organization assists local governments to develop global partnerships that help lower - and middle - income united states gain greater access to banking services
since the new deal in the 1930s , which followed the total collapse of the patchwork of local and state social welfare programs overwhelmed by the weight of the great depression , doing things at the national level has been seen as the only way to go
only by making programs national could policymakers ensure that state and local government officials ( particularly southern democrats who had little taste for giving benefits to african - americans ) could not distribute benefits only to certain portions of the population
in this view , it was believed that only washington policymakers could bring together the best and brightest minds to make sure that programs were designed and administered well
only through centralized programs , could policymakers ensure that residents of one state did n't receive more meager benefits than in other places
" local policymakers and experts developed these programs for many years before they were ever brought to the national stage
outside washington 's more conservative environment , political conditions in many parts of the united states are producing important opportunities for liberalism to flourish
this vibrant period of local policymaking will help to prepare the groundwork for the next moment -- like the early 1930s or mid- 1960s or during the financial crisis of 2008 - 2010 -- when the doors for legislating will open in washington .
