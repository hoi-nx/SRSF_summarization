the red cross on saturday called for an immediate 24 - hour ceasefire in battle - torn yemeni , saying many more people recently wounded in airstrikes and ground fighting will die if not tended to soon
the call came just before the u.n. security council met late saturday morning to discuss the situation in the arabian peninsula nation , where shiite rebels are pitted against external arab air forces and fighters loyal to yemeni 's displaced sunni president
the situation is difficult , " said marie-claire feghali , a spokeswoman for the icrc who is in the capital , sanaa
" meanwhile , residents of sanaa , witnessed the fiercest saudi arabia strikes since the air assault started last week
military facilities , including two bases , within the city limits have been targeted , three senior security officials in sanaa said
at the u.n. security council , russia submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes that a nine - country regional coalition , led by saudi arabia , has been conducting against the rebels in yemeni for more than a week
the houthis put hadi under house arrest when they overtook sanaa in january
hadi fled aden in late march , ultimately for saudi arabia , when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city
the conflict prompted saudi arabia , a predominately sunni nation and yemeni 's northern neighbor , and other arab nations to hit the rebels in yemeni with airstrikes
a saudi arabia source told cnn that special forces supplied weapons and communication equipment to yemeni fighters in aden loyal to hadi
saudi arabia special forces help oppose houthis rebels in yemeni , source says the united nations said thursday that at least 519 people have been killed in yemeni in the past two weeks
complicating matters in yemeni is that al qaeda -- not the houthis or hadi - loyal forces -- holds sway in the country 's east
al qaeda is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization
also late this week , photos circulating on social media purported to show senior al qaeda leader batarfi -- whom yemeni defense officials said militants busted out of jail on thursday -- posing in a presidential residence in southern yemeni
