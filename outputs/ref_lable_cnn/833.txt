it took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that former nfl star aaron hernandez killed semi-pro player odin lloyd
on monday , aaron hernandez 's defense gave its side of the story , wrapping up its witnesses in less than a day
aaron hernandez , 25 , is on trial for the shooting death of odin lloyd , whose body was found in a massachusetts industrial park in june 2013
here are some key points jurors will have to consider after each side makes closing arguments on tuesday : as news spread that aaron hernandez was under investigation in june 2013 , new england patriots owner kraft called in the tight end for a meeting two days after odin lloyd 's death
" there 's only one potential problem with that claim : the time odin lloyd was killed had n't been made public yet by the time aaron hernandez met with kraft
so how could aaron hernandez have known when odin lloyd was killed ? " what a great , great witness for the prosecution , " cnn legal analyst mel robbins said
" basically what happened is aaron hernandez lied to his boss
" when questioned by a defense attorney , kraft said that he 'd never had any problems with aaron hernandez and that the player was always respectful to him
aaron hernandez 's fiancee , jenkins , revealed for the first time last week that aaron hernandez told her to dispose of a box from the couple 's home that she said reeked of marijuana
much testimony has focused on the shoes aaron hernandez wore the night odin lloyd was shot
prosecutors used grainy footage from aaron hernandez 's home security system to suggest he was holding a .45 - caliber handgun -- the same kind of gun police said was used to kill odin lloyd
aaron hernandez could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after odin lloyd was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from aaron hernandez 's home
the video is time - stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say odin lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car aaron hernandez was driving
aaron hernandez 's lawyers then showed a different part of the video time - stamped a few seconds earlier with aaron hernandez holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand , suggesting it may be an ipad
sultan then displayed a soft - pellet gun similar in shape to a glock , suggesting it could also be the object aaron hernandez is holding
aaron hernandez has pleaded not guilty in odin lloyd 's death
so what might make a young man who had signed a $ 40 million contract risk everything ? prosecutors have said odin lloyd might have done or said something that did n't sit well with aaron hernandez
evidence collected in odin lloyd 's death investigation led to two more murder charges against aaron hernandez in a separate case in boston
prosecutors have said in pretrial hearings that aaron hernandez may have been mad at himself for possibly showing odin lloyd the spot where that double murder happened
during trial , prosecutors suggest a text written by aaron hernandez the day before the murder saying he was " buggin " for showing odin lloyd " the spot " may have played a role in plotting to kill odin lloyd
the judge has banned any mention of the double murder in odin lloyd 's trial , ruling it is prejudicial
but when the odin lloyd trial ends , that murder trial awaits him
