the indonesia government has ordered preparations for the execution of 10 inmates on death row , including philippines maid veloso and australian andrew chan and myuran sukumaran
jakarta has advised consular officials to travel to indonesia 's " execution island " -- nusa kambangan -- where the ten are being held , though a spokesman for the attorney general , spontana , told cnn friday this is not the required 72 - hour notice given to death row convicts before the actual execution
" the 10 inmates , from australian , french , ghanaian , the philippines , brazil , nigeria and indonesia , had their petitions for clemency denied by president widodo in late 2014
the executions , which will be carried out by firing squad , were planned for earlier this year but were postponed after several inmates filed separate legal challenges
on tuesday , the supreme court rejected reviews filed by french national serge atlaoui and ghanaian martin anderson
abidin is also a drug convict and the only indonesia citizen in the group
andrew chan and myuran sukumaran , members of the so - called " bali nine " convicted for their role in a failed 2005 heroin smuggling plot , tried to challenge the president 's decision earlier this month but lost an appeal for the state administrative court to hear their case
the attorney general 's office has said they would respect all ongoing court proceedings but insisted the inmates have exhausted all their legal options
australian has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair and has unsuccessfully proposed a prisoner swap with indonesia as a way of avoiding their deaths
opinion : why executions wo n't win indonesia 's drug war according to her lawyers , veloso unknowingly carried drugs into indonesia and that she was set up by members of a drug syndicate
her entire family has traveled to indonesia to fulfill her last wish
