nairobi , kenyans they were sons and daughters , brothers and sisters , friends and fellow citizens
and on tuesday night , kenyans remembered them as innocent victims of a terrorist attack that stunned a nation and left communities heartbroken
the gathering started with quiet chatter among a crowd of hundreds before mourners went silent and moved toward one end of nairobi 's uhuru park
the attack at a university in garissa on thursday killed 147 people , mostly students
" i ca n't even look at pictures of the people killed without crying , " said mary wambui , 32 , who lives in nakuru , hundreds of miles from garissa
" using the hashtag # 147notjustanumber , kenyans used social media to talk about the lives of the victims
" today 's meeting will be a calling to say , ' we need to remember the 147 ; they are not just a number
kenyans authorities have not released a list of the names of the victims
" in 2010 , i was in a grenade attack in downtown nairobi and every time there 's a terrorist attack , it hits too close to home , " murungi said
" it was the deadliest attack in the nation since al qaeda killed more than 200 people at the u.s. embassy in nairobi in 1998
in the garissa attack , the terrorists separated christians from muslims , making some recite verses from the quran
" those images will haunt us forever , " said martin otieno , 29 , who lives in nairobi
" kenyans launched airstrikes monday targeting al-shabaab 's training camps in somalia , according to a military source , adding that the strikes were not retribution for last week 's massacre at the university
" the latest attack of al-shabaab bases by the kenyans military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011
it is not a retaliation to the garissa attack
kenyans authorities had intelligence beforehand that a university in garissa could be attacked , yet the country 's rapid response team was stuck in nairobi for hours after the massacre awaiting transport , a police source said monday
it 's unclear why the elite team was stuck in the kenyans capital about 230 miles ( 370 kilometers ) west of the attack
kenyans politicians and nairobi - based journalists arrived on the scene before the team did
" with the benefit of hindsight , you can always say things could have been done better , " said manoah esipisu , a spokesman for kenyans president uhuru kenyatta
however , he added , kenyans authorities " got the job done " and saved lives
" we have a military garrison in garissa , and the work began immediately after the attack was reported and continued for a number of hours until we were able to rescue 663 students of the 800 students that had been taken hostage by these terrorists
" kenyans 's interior ministry named mohamed mohamud as the organizer of the attack
the ministry offered a reward of 20 million kenyans shillings , or about $ 215,000 , for information on his whereabouts
he is in charge of external operations against kenyans , according to a government document , and commands the militia along the border
another terrorist involved in the attacks is abdirahim abdullahi , a kenyans - somalia and the son of a government chief in mandera , authorities said
in 2013 , militants attacked nairobi 's upscale westgate mall , leaving 67 people dead
