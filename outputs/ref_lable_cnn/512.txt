we set baltimore on fire this time
we let the violence stand for everything that 's wrong with the things we already did n't like
by now you may be asking , " who 's we ? " you may be saying with some irritation , " do n't lump me in with them
i use " we " a lot when i talk about our country 's achievements
we cut reconstruction short and made a mockery of equal citizenship
we are the authors of every page of baltimore 's story
do n't tell me it 's not your responsibility or mine
about how slavery and its legacy are artifacts of a time past
and we all have to face that before we can fix anything in baltimore or beyond
but there 's another dimension of the story of " we " that matters as well
it 's about progressives and conservatives and their competing stories of how we got here
every time protests and violence break out in response to police brutality , the same depressing pattern breaks out
the event becomes simply a rorschach test for left and right , and each side sees in the rioting confirmation of its prior views
for the left , it 's about the deep structural root causes of the alienation and violence
liberals gravitate on social media to commentaries or reactions that reinforce this frame , like the surprisingly astute comments from the baltimore orioles executive who spelled out why a long history of racial injustice and economic disenfranchisement made rioting nearly inevitable
conservatives gravitate to their own frames , about a lack of personal responsibility or role models among poor urban blacks , about the failures of great society and democratic programs , and about how it all comes back to a president ( who happens to be black ) who has divided us by focusing so much on race
but it can not possibly be that only those with whom i disagree are responsible for what is happening in baltimore
whatever our political perspective , we need to open our eyes to what is actually happening in baltimore and other cities in the united states in the second decade of the 21st century
it 's time to push each other out of our ideological and identity comfort zones and build unlikely coalitions to create more opportunity
it 's time to act like we are all in charge
