it is not hard to imagine the conversations inside the hillary clinton camp prelaunch : how do we take the best known woman in the world and make her seem like less of a big shot ? how can the people in iowa and new hampshire get to know the " real hillary clinton , " the midwestern methodist ? ( as a friend told me , she 's someone who " likes to sing ' god bless america ' on new year 's eve
" ) and how to open the minds of people about someone everyone already has an opinion about ? same questions , no doubt , that the staff asked in 2008 when she ran against the newbie barack obama , and same questions they asked when , as first lady , she ran for the senate in new york
' ) dining aside , it 's hard -- almost impossible -- to soft - launch a campaign with a superstar politician
all the gauzy ads and the small classrooms and the coffee shops ca n't mask the houdini - like effort hillary clinton is making to escape the inescapable reality -- that even her " scooby-doo " van is followed by throngs of press
not to mention famous , accomplished and controversial
in watching it all unfold , it 's hard to underestimate the task at hand
it 's also hard to figure out whether it 's actually going to work
hillary clinton â and her experienced campaign team â are disciplined and relentlessly on message
that 's usually a good thing when you 're running a presidential campaign
) maybe it 's that the old lessons of message discipline do n't work in the informal environment the campaign is trying to create â at least not with this candidate
we like to call it authenticity , but it 's probably not
it 's a honed skill that combines connection and gravitas , both of which the voters demand in a president
it 's a balance that does n't come easily to hillary clinton
or , in hillary clinton 's case , at least trying to make history .
