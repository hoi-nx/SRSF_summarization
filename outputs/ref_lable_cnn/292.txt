the marriage apocalypse may be coming
talk to any millennial and you can envision an america virtually marriage - free , with everyone happily single
recently , i talked about marriage with a group of journalism students from my alma mater , kent state
they came to me for career advice , which i gave them , but i also picked their brains about politics , religion and marriage
their views on marriage intrigued me the most
' cause , guess what ? they do n't care what your generation thinks -- they 'll get married if and when they want
" i did n't go to college for four years to be a mom , " 21 - year old candace monacelli told me
so jokingly , i responded , " wow , some people would say , with that attitude , you are undermining the moral foundation of this country ! " jackie did n't blink
and i do n't think you need a wedding ring to prove that you love someone
i see a lot of people get married too soon or stay together and are unhappy because they are afraid to be alone
" before you berate jackie for prioritizing her love of travel over marriage , consider where she 's coming from
in the america , almost 42 million adults have been married more than once
especially in light of a fascinating pew research report on marriage
when asked if society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children , 50 % of respondents were ok with that
studies show marriage is correlated with economic well - being , though it is not clear whether the causality arrow goes from marriage toward economic benefit or in the other direction
a study sponsored by the conservative american enterprise institute says : " from an obvious standpoint , households with two adults are likelier to have two incomes , improving well - being
" on the other hand , the study points out , people who have money may be " more desirable marriage prospects
the millennials i talked with prefer their partners to be debt - free and riding high
they also do n't want to burden a husband or wife with their own debt
" that was n't something my parents bore
and it 's really hard to plan a wedding , or even think about something like that when you owe so much money , you do n't have a job , and you do n't have a home
but , when i was in my twenties , waiting to marry the right man and forgoing children put me decidedly and uncomfortably in the minority
the numbers are similarly high for sweden and denmark
while many couples marry after having the first or second child , it 's clear marriage in parts of scandinavia is dying
" the article also points out that " norway ranked first and sweden second in the united nations ' quality - of - life survey for 2004 , which rates per capita income , education levels , health care and life expectancy in measuring a nation 's well - being
" in an effort to understand the joys of " sambo , " the term for living together in scandinavia , my producer reached out to mikael anteskog adler , a 35 - year - old man from stockholm , sweden
fifty - year - old anne lehes , from gothenburg , sweden , told my producer , " i believe that one reason for many sweden staying single is because this is a secular country , so people think they will become fulfilled by their partner , and inevitably they get disappointed and then they do n't think the whole thing is worth it
" maybe christina hugosson of uppsala , sweden , sums it up best : " the notion that marriage is something that you 're pressured into seems horrible to me
would a society without marriage be just as well off as one filled with " i dos " ? i do n't know
