just as mimeograph machines and photocopiers were in their day , online activity -- blogs , youtube channels , even social media platforms like facebook and twitter -- have fully emerged as the alternative to traditional mainstream media
it is not just the low cost of posting online that attracts dissidence , though that in itself is liberating
it is the lack of access to traditional print and broadcast media in authoritarian countries that is really the driving force leading disaffected voices to post online
going online has become the path of least resistance if you want to make yourself heard
but it still brings resistance , some of it legal , some of it deadly
it is part of lee kuan yew 's legacy that the government 's use of the courts to bring libel and defamation cases , usually carrying heavy financial penalties , is the preferred method of silencing discomfiting online voices
but it is not just singapore where internet activity comes under fire : on monday in malaysia , with much less of the international attention heaped on amos yee , five editors and executives from the malaysian insider were arrested over the site 's march 25 report claiming that a senior council of royal rulers and state governors , known as the conference of rulers , had rejected a proposal to amend federal law to allow for the introduction of hudud , or punishments meted out under islamic law
in deeply muslim malaysia , questions of islamic faith are a third - rail issue , as is revealing government decisions before they are announced
by far the biggest jailer of journalists in the world is china , where a majority of the 44 people behind bars at the end of 2014 were bloggers , most of them uighur or tibetan activists who straddle the line between journalism and activism
add one more in late december , nguyen dinh ngoc , a prominent blogger who was arrested for " law - violating " after police searched his home in southern ho chi minh city on december 27 , and two more in january , nguyen quang lap and hong le tho , arrested on anti-state charges of " abusing democratic freedoms " and you can see the pattern
because the print and broadcast media are so totally government controlled , mainstream journalists seldom go to jail any more in vietnam
jailing journalists is one thing , but watching them being killed and doing little or nothing about it is another
since 1992 , 11 % of journalists killed have died for their work online
the bottom line : online journalists , operating outside the restraints of mainstream media , have become the most vulnerable targets for governments and independent actors
where there is the restrictive rule of law , journalists are vulnerable to the anger of officialdom
where the rule of law is weak , they are vulnerable to the attacks of killers who seldom , if ever , answer to the rule of law .
