the golden state could soon refer to the hue of california 's lawns
gov. brown on wednesday imposed mandatory water restrictions for the first time on residents , businesses and farms , ordering cities and towns in the drought - ravaged state to reduce usage by 25 %
" the 25 % cut in usage amounts to roughly 1.5 million acre - feet of water ( an acre foot of water equals about 325,000 gallons ) over the next nine months , state officials said
" this historic drought demands unprecedented action , " brown said , standing on a patch of dry , brown grass in the sierra nevada mountains that is usually blanketed by up to 5 feet of snow
the exclusion prompted some criticism , as agriculture uses about 80 % of california 's developed water supply
but climate writer eric holthaus of slate wrote that " wasteful agriculture is literally sucking california dry
" the action comes as the sierra nevada snowpack , which california rely on heavily during the summer for their water needs , is near a record low
david stivers , an executive vice president of the pebble beach company , said his company is studying the restrictions to see what effect it will have on business
" people up here are also very conscious about water usage and the expense of water in this area , " he said
pepperdine university in malibu , known for its beautiful campus , said it would be challenging to meet the restrictions given the water - saving practices already in effect
the school already uses recycled and reclaimed water for campus irrigation and now it has turned off all fountains on campus , according to rhiannon bailard , director of the university 's center for sustainability
the university was also encouraging students to further reduce water usage
in addition , brown 's executive order will : impose significant cuts in water use on campuses , golf courses , cemeteries and other large landscapes
replace 50 million square feet of lawns throughout the state with " drought - tolerant landscaping
as of late september , 30 % of the lower 48 faced at least a moderate drought , particularly in the southwest states neighboring california and in texas , the drought monitor says
but none of those states is facing the extremes of california , where the drought has been a slowly building natural disaster since 2012
in fact , brown last year declared a state emergency , saying his constituents are facing " perhaps the worst drought that california has ever seen since records ( began ) about 100 years ago
" opinion : the end of the la lawn on september 16 , brown signed " historic legislation " that created " a framework for sustainable , local groundwater management for the first time in california history , " the governor 's office said
as part of the changes , brown said additional measures will crack down on water inefficiency as california enters the fourth year of a worsening water crisis
