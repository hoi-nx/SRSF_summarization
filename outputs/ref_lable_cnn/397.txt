the complete skeleton of a camel thought to to have been used by ottoman troops besieging vienna in the 17th century has been found beneath a cellar in austrian
the remains were uncovered by archaeologists from the university of veterinary medicine vienna ( vetmeduni ) , exploring the construction site for a shopping center in the city of tulln in 2006 - 2007
" in their research , published in the journal " plos one , " the archaeologists said ottoman troops had besieged the area around tulln in 1683 as they tried to reach vienna , but that tulln itself had never been conquered
despite their city not falling , tulln inhabitants and the ottoman were in contact , with historic documents referring to the invading army 's peaceful surrender of two prisoners of war , the researchers said
" its appearance might be linked to an exchange of local people with the troops or the ottoman army simply left it behind
" while other camel bones have been found in european , the researchers said this was unique
" it is the first complete camel skeleton found in european and european territories under the control of the ottoman , apart from the complete skeleton of a dromedary recovered from the sediments of the theodosius harbor on the european part of istanbul
the austrian ' unfamiliarity with such a beast may have led to the skeleton 's preservation
as opposed to the ottoman troops -- who would likely have eaten the camel 's flesh -- the residents of tulln apparently buried the camel whole
flooding and plagues affected tulln in the 17th century and many buildings were demolished , they said
