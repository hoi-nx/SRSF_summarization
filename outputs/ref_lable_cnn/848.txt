washington israel prime minister netanyahu criticized the deal six world powers struck to thwart iran 's nuclear ambitions , saying he sees better options than " this bad deal or war
" " i think there 's a third alternative , and that is standing firm , ratcheting up the pressure until you get a better deal , " netanyahu told cnn 's jim acosta sunday on " state of the union
" his comments come as democratic and republican spar over the framework announced last week to lift western sanctions on iran in exchange for the country dropping from 19,000 to 5,060 active centrifuges , limiting its highly enriched uranium , and increasing inspections
but republican contenders for the party 's 2016 presidential nomination lambasted it , saying it gave iran too much flexibility
one senate democrat said netanyahu needs to " contain himself
" netanyahu 's most recent argument against the iran nuclear deal was similar to the one he 'd made in a march trip to washington , when he addressed a joint session of congress -- fueling a republican push to have the deal sent to congress before it 's implemented
" netanyahu said iran is a country of " congenital cheating " and that it ca n't be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal , which lasts 10 years with some provisions extending well beyond that
" i think that we can have a legitimate difference of opinion on this , because i think iran has shown to be completely distrustful , " netanyahu said
" the top - ranking democrat on the senate intelligence committee said negotiators working on the deal -- from iran and the u.s. , as well as russia , china , britain , france and germany -- are " on the cusp of something that can be workable
" energy secretary ernest moniz defended the deal in an appearance on cbs ' " face the nation " on sunday , saying it would extend from two months to one year the " breakout " time period -- the length of time it would take iran to build a nuclear bomb
sen. graham , r - south carolina , said on " face the nation " that the best option for the u.s. is to keep current sanctions in place for two more years and then have a " new crack at it with a new president that does n't have the baggage of obama
" and he said the alternatives to obama on both sides -- with the exception of sen. rand paul of kentucky , who 's called for a less active u.s. role overseas -- would likely strike a better deal
