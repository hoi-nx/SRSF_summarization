but as a young mother in rural guatemala with three children and barely a third grade education , she thought there was no way out
what began as psychological torment , name - calling and humiliation turned into beatings so severe cifuentes feared for her life
one day , two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her
but the abuse did n't stop there
cifuentes ' case is dramatic , but in guatemala , where nearly 10 out of every 100,000 women are killed , it 's hardly unusual
a 2012 small arms survey says gender - based violence is at epidemic levels in guatemala and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide
according to the united nations , two women are killed there every day
there are many reasons why , beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the country 's 36 - year - old civil war
during the conflict , atrocities were committed against women , who were used as a weapon of war
some 200,000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decades - long conflict , most of them from indigenous mayan populations
nearly 20 years later , according to the security sector reform resource centre , levels of violent crime are higher in guatemala than they were during the war
but despite the high homicide rate , the united nations estimates 98 % of cases never make it to court
women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep - rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny
perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in guatemala is the country 's deeply rooted patriarchal society
according to marã­a machicado terã¡n , the representative of united nations women in guatemala , " 80 % of men believe that women need permission to leave the house , and 70 % of women surveyed agreed
" this prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence
the political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize
" although the situation for girls and women in guatemala is alarming , there are signs the culture of discrimination may be slowly changing
cifuentes is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art. since 2008 , she and four other abuse survivors known as la poderosas , or " the powerful , " have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories
the show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly , but it also offers suggestions for change
the taboo topic of gender - based violence is also being acknowledged and recognized in a popular program targeting one of guatemala 's most vulnerable groups , indigenous mayan girls
in 2004 , with help from the united nations and other organizations , the population council launched a community - based club known as abriendo oportunidades , or " opening opportunities "
the guatemala government is also moving in the right direction to address the problem of violence against women
if approved , it would make reducing levels of gender - based violence a u.s. foreign policy priority
pehaps the most immediate and effective help is coming from international nongovernmental organizations , which are on the front lines of the fight against gender - based discrimination in guatemala
while there is tempered optimism and hope for change , the problem of gender - based violence in guatemala is one that needs international attention and immediate action
cifuentes is finding strength through the theater and the support of other abuse survivors , which has allowed her to move forward
but millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures
