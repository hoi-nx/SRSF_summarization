eternally blooming in kolkata , india , along the hooghly river is malik ghat , a wholesale flower market that attracts more than 2,000 sellers each day
photographer ken hermann visited the market for his project " flower man , " which is a series of portraits that casts light upon the people behind the petals
when ken hermann was in kolkata working on another assignment , he went to the market as a tourist
after that first encounter with malik ghat , his captivation with the market did not diminish and he became intent on returning
but at that time , i did n't really have the time to do the project , " ken hermann said
" ken hermann was able to spend about 10 days at the market , and did not allow any challenges to hinder the completion of " flower man
" i had a really clear idea before i went ( to the market ) about what i wanted to do , " ken hermann said
" but none of the female flower sellers wished to be a part of ken hermann 's project , so he focused only on those who were interested in and comfortable with having their portrait taken
" although the composition of the majority of ken hermann 's portraits encompasses the flower sellers in front of a neutral background , other portraits forgo this characteristic and consequently bring a sense of movement and fluidity to " flower man
one of the reasons ken hermann did not create the flower sellers ' portraits directly inside the market is because of the hectic atmosphere
ken hermann compares malik ghat to the environments of financial trading and fish markets
" it 's impossible to shoot at the market , especially if you want a clean and quiet background , because there 's so much going on , " ken hermann said
similar to the commitment needed to effectively and successfully operate within the financial and food industries , ken hermann emphasized that the competitive atmosphere of the market and work ethic of the flower sellers was a major factor in whether a seller would agree to have their portrait made
" all the other sellers -- they are so busy , so just convincing them to go near the river to get their portrait done and spend maybe 15 minutes of their time was a challenge , " ken hermann said
" ken hermann said that another important reason some flower sellers decided not to be photographed was because flowers are highly valued in india and serve as a prominent feature during many events and moments in people 's lives , including everything from religious rituals and festivals to weddings and parties
" some of the flowers , ( the sellers ) did n't allow us to take pictures of because they 're flowers used for offering in the temple , " ken hermann said
" if you want to take pictures in india , people tend to just stand up and look proud and strong , " ken hermann said
" they use these flowers in temples and all over india , so that 's one of the more common flowers at the market , " ken hermann said
you should see when they walk through the flower market , it 's almost like ( the flowers are ) all alive
" ken hermann plans to return to malik ghat and looks forward not only to the opportunity to photograph different kinds of flowers -- as the range varies based on the seasons -- but also to the chance to present the flower sellers featured in " flower man " with their portraits
