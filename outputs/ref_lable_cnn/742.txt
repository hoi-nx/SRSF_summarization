a stray pooch in washington state university has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car , apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive
that 's according to washington state university , where the dog -- a friendly white - and - black bully breed mix now named theia -- has been receiving care at the veterinary teaching hospital
" she 's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life
" theia is only one year old but the dog 's brush with death did not leave her unscathed
the veterinary hospital 's good samaritan fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog 's treatment , but sara mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog 's care
" she is dedicated to making sure theia gets the medical attention she needs , sara mellado adds , and wants to " make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again ! " any additional funds raised will be " paid forward " to help other animals
