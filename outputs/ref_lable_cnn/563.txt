the last time muhammadu buhari came to power in nigeria , it was by force
for the first time in nigeria 's history , the opposition defeated the ruling party in democratic elections
muhammadu buhari , 72 , won nigeria 's presidential election , defeating incumbent jonathan by about two million votes
nigeria is significant because it is the biggest economy and most populous country in africa ; it is also one of africa 's largest oil producers and is a major supplier of crude oil to the united states
this is n't muhammadu buhari 's first time leading nigeria -- but it 's his first time in nearly 30 years
the reformed dictator is a sunni muslim from nigeria 's poorer north , while jonathan comes from a christian and animist south that is rich with oil
muhammadu buhari 's win comes after a long history of military rule , coups and botched attempts at democracy in the country
many nigeria told cnn that they saw president jonathan as an ineffectual leader who was indecisive in dealing with the terror group boko haram -- and weak on corruption
nigeria wanted a strong leader who could keep them safe from boko haram 's murderous raids -- and muhammadu buhari also campaigned as a born - again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime the last time around
he stressed that nigeria 's security needs to be the next government 's focus
the elections were largely predicted to be violent and everyone , nigeria included , expected the worst
