caught up in a rip current while snorkeling at finn 's beach in bali , walsh was holding on to some rocks when she spotted something special
engraved with the words , " darling joe , happy 70th birthday 2009
jenny , " the antique ring lodged in the rocks clearly meant something to both joe and jenny
but there were no other clues ( besides the fact that the words were written in english ) as to where the couple might live
when she returned home to palm beach , australian , walsh was determined to reunite the ring with its owner
found this gold ring snorkeling at finns beach in bali today
nine months earlier , langley had been snorkeling in the same spot in bali when he lost the ring , which his wife , jenny , had purchased an antique store and had engraved for his birthday
