easter is a cornerstone event in the christian faith , but it 's surrounded by interesting quirks
but , like christmas with its tree , ornaments and santa claus , easter has picked up its peripheral trappings -- the bunny and colorful eggs
unlike christmas , it does n't fall on the same day every year but shifts around in spring depending upon cosmic events
and that blood moon we just had -- is it pure coincidence that it fell around easter ? ( no. ) here 's a journey from the vatican to the holy land , around the moon and the earth 's tilting axis , to germany and the united states to try to explain the complex holiday called easter
let 's move on to old jerusalem , the birthplace of easter
it 's not quite easter yet in the holy land for orthodox christians
they 'll be celebrating a week from now , because they determine easter 's date by a different calendar than western christians -- the julian calendar
which brings us to the question of how astronomy is used to determine the date of easter sunday
a blood moon appeared in the sky early saturday , right between good friday and easter sunday and during passover
just a coincidence ? not completely , because the dates for both passover -- the jewish holiday celebrating the deliverance from slavery in egypt -- and easter are determined by moon phases , according to timeanddate.com
easter 's timing is related to passover , because jesus was crucified around then , according to the bible
many jewish holidays , including passover , fall on full moon , which is also a prerequisite for a lunar eclipse , the event that turns the moon a blood red color
since the timing of moon phases does n't jibe with earth 's orbit -- which is how we determine the length of a year now -- passover 's exact date moves around -- and so does easter 's
when christian bishops first convened at the council of nicaea in the year 325 , they made a rule to determine the date of easter , so as to fairly reliably pin it to passover : it would fall on the first sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox
but ... if the full moon fell on sunday , easter would be pushed down a week
when the west moved from the julian calendar to the gregorian calendar , orthodox christians stayed put , resulting in -- usually -- two separate dates for easter
in 1997 , the world council of churches pushed for a unified method of determining a date based on astronomical occurrences
but some odd easter trappings that popped up after the middle ages very much have -- the eggs and the bunny
the bunny is an egg - laying pagan that worships the moon
by the time easter rolled around , they were practically swimming in them
parents may have invented the bunny as a playful explanation for children on where the easter eggs came from
if you 're coloring eggs this year , here 's an interesting tip. instead of stinking up your place with the smell of vinegar , use kool-aid , youtube science geek thompson suggests
happy easter ! happy passover !
