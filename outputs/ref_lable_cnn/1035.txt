london it was n't messrs clooney , pitt and their nine accomplices who sailed down an elevator shaft and cracked open dozens of safety deposit boxes at a london vault during the easter weekend
but last weekend 's raid in the heart of the city 's jewelry district feels like it has been taken from a movie like " ocean 11 " given its daring and planning
such robberies are rare : the gang did n't follow the current criminal trend of manipulating digits in cyber space but instead went back to basics and committed their burglary in a way not seen in london for more than 40 years
in september 1971 , the staff of a bank in baker street , central london , arrived at work to find that thieves had dug a 40 - yard tunnel from a shop they had rented , hauled in a thermic lance and explosives and opened the strong room
the gang got away with a haul worth around Â£ 30 million ( the incident later formed the basis of the movie " the bank job
" ) but how are such heists organized ? roy ramm , a former commander of specialist operations at london 's scotland yard for 27 years , explains
many neighborhood criminals commit burglaries to feed drugs habits and acquire long strings of convictions that mean they are always on the police radar
more specialist criminals -- those , for example , who target museums or country houses -- will be very specific and steal only what they know they can quickly convert to untraceable cash
many of those who commit the bigger crimes or run major criminal enterprises combine high iqs with a kind of raw street intelligence
one of their skills is the ability to recognize a criminal opportunity when it presents itself , possibly from a source of inside information
probably the biggest difference between any heist you 'll see in a movie and its real - life equivalent is the motive
the brinks mat robbery in 1983 -- a case which i was involved in at the time -- saw a criminal gang escape with gold bullion worth more than Â£ 28 million ( around Â£ 88 million -- or $ 130million -- adjusting for inflation ) from a warehouse at london 's heathrow airport
the knightsbridge safety deposit robbery of 1987 saw a gang make off with tens of millions of pounds in cash and valuables from an upscale london neighbourhood ( the true amount will never be known )
both were made possible by inside information : it 's an angle that london detectives investigating last weekend 's heist will be looking at very closely
the planning behind the hatton garden raid will have been meticulous
possibly a specialist can be brought in by another team member -- but they have to be able to trust each other and trust comes from understanding , so gangs in the uk tend to come from the same social and ethnic group , maybe even limited to one relatively small geographic area
london detectives investigating the hatton garden heist will be looking very closely at the possibility of inside involvement
they will look at every aspect of how the target business operates , then try to think like criminals to identify the weaknesses in physical and operational security that the gang may have been informed about or else spotted and then exploited
in the police 's criminal intelligence branch , the movements of known criminals will be analyzed and the networks of sources -- informers -- will be tasked to report what they hear
they do n't admire the criminals but they have less contempt for a gang that builds a sophisticated plan and causes no personal harm to anyone than say for a violent robber
