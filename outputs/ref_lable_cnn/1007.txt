it 's fireball cinnamon whisky , and lately it 's been as hot as its name
" fireball cinnamon whisky is number one , definitely
fireball , which did n't exist in its current form a decade ago , is the fastest - growing big brand of liquor in america
retail sales more than doubled last year , and fireball cinnamon whisky has come seemingly out of nowhere to become the sixth-most popular liquor brand in the america as measured by retail sales -- ahead of such venerable labels as jim beam , jose cuervo and grey goose
and these figures do n't include sales in bars , where fireball has dethroned jagermeister as america 's party shot of choice
or social media feeds , which fill with photos of fireball - flavored revelry and # fireballfriday hashtags
" fireball cinnamon whisky is an incredible phenomenon
the growth of it has just been astounding , " said bryson , managing editor of whisky advocate and author of several books on whiskey and other spirits
" to the uninitiated , fireball cinnamon whisky is basically made from canadian whisky , aged in used bourbon barrels , flavored with sweetener and spicy cinnamon
( the " whisky " spelling generally refers to scotches or canadian varieties , while " whiskey " refers to irish or america styles
" i 've known people who ca n't do shots , but they can do fireball cinnamon whisky
" fireball is especially popular among young drinkers and women , many of whom say they like that it does n't singe their throat and leaves a dentyne - like aftertaste
sales were modest until about five years ago , when sazerac hired a " national brand ambassador , " pomes , to spread the word about fireball cinnamon whisky through event planning and bartender outreach
soon , fireball cinnamon whisky started gaining traction
along the way , sazerac has cultivated a party - hearty social ethos around fireball cinnamon whisky , encouraging pics of shots with hashtags such as # whiskywednesday
the brand has more than 85,000 followers on twitter and another 43,000 on instagram -- more than twice the social reach of jagermeister -- although on twitter , it still trails jack daniel 's whiskey and patron tequila
the fireball nation is devoted -- and this is the best kind of marketing , " said amy preske , public relations and events manager for sazerac , who declined to offer any further explanation for the brand 's booming popularity
" so is fireball a future cornerstone of every well - stocked bar or just a fad ? it may be too soon to say
retail sales remain strong , according to iri , although fireball cinnamon whisky 's skyrocketing growth has slowed in recent months
fireball also endured a public - relations mess last fall when several european countries briefly recalled the liquor over concerns about one of its ingredients : propylene glycol , a chemical used in a variety of food products , e-cigarettes and antifreeze
sazerac responded that propylene glycol exists in fireball " in very small quantities " -- less than 1/8th of the amount allowed by the fda ( pdf ) -- and reassured customers that fireball cinnamon whisky is " absolutely safe to drink
" then there 's the question of whether fireball cinnamon whisky will become a victim of its own success
with fireball cinnamon whisky , you do n't need a chaser , " said kelvin davis , a bartender at the nook in atlanta
