much of the world has been stunned by the huge increase of migrant deaths in the mediterranean this year , increasing the number of deaths at sea by a factor of 30 compared to the same time last year
the flows of migrants across the mediterranean are unlikely to stop -- italian authorities estimate that up to 200,000 migrants in libya are waiting to cross , following 170,000 refugees and migrants who arrived in italian last year
the latest sinking has triggered some action in the european union , which has unveiled a new ten - point action plan
but some european union critics called for much tougher action to deter asylum seekers from making the risky journey
in a column published in the uk 's sun newspaper just hours before the sinking , katie hopkins declared : " it 's time to get australia
" since then , australia 's prime minister , abbott , has also suggested that europe adopt a tougher approach , saying , " the only way you can stop the deaths is to stop the people smuggling trade
the only way you can stop the deaths is in fact to stop the boats ... that 's why it is so urgent that the countries of europe adopt very strong policies that will end the people smuggling trade across the mediterranean
" so what would it mean if the european union did " get australia " in its approach to asylum seekers ? and could australia 's current policy be used as a global solution , or at least one for asylum seekers trying to cross the mediterranean ? there were dramatic changes in australia 's immigration policy in 2013 , in the final months of the labor government , led by rudd , which have been followed up and taken further by the current liberal national coalition government , led by abbott
all people who seek to enter australia by sea , under the asylum legacy act , are no longer entitled to enter or stay in australia while their refugee claims are processed
that shift in policy under successive labor and now the liberal national governments in australia has been chiefly designed as a deterrent : or , to use abbott 's slogan , to " stop the boats "
if your sole criteria for success is the number of boats arriving in australia each year , then " no advantage " ( meaning no asylum in australia ) and " stop the boats " ( including the turning back of boats in international waters ) has worked
in 2013 , the australia government reported that 300 boats with approximately 20,000 people on board arrived ; in 2014 , there were 0
so we do not know how many boats tried to enter australia waters with asylum seekers
it also appears that no asylum seekers drowned in australia waters during the 2013 - 2014 period
abbott explained the tactic of secrecy and turn - back in the following statement : " we are in a fierce contest with these people smugglers
" if we accept that these responses have worked , the question for australia 's government is whether it is sustainable , and whether it alleviating the flow of asylum seekers in the larger asia-pacific region
the drowning of asylum seekers who sought passage via people smugglers appear to have increased , in particular , in the bay of bengal
on cost alone , it is hard to see australia 's approach to asylum seekers working or being affordable in europe
the australia government 's ability to " stop the boats " -- or at least keep asylum seekers offshore -- depends on a number of factors , including tolerance from indonesia , significant spending devoted to asylum deterrence and weathering international condemnation for violating the human rights of asylum seekers
the operation to stop and return the boats , called " operation sovereign borders " has been politically tumultuous for australia 's relationship with indonesia
returning boats to international waters potentially violates australia 's obligation to international maritime law ; push - backs to indonesia waters violates indonesia 's sovereignty and has placed people at great risk
as the situation in europe illustrates , just because people are not making it to your shoreline to seek asylum does not mean people stop attempting asylum
in the short term , the " stop the boats " approach appears to be working for the australia government
this is a message that both the european union and australia should heed
