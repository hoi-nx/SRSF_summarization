whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no - name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge - drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use
heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health
the u.s. centers for disease control defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men
binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month
the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found

nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men

in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers
despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found
