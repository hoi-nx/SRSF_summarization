this time the stage was set in north charleston , south carolina , a city of about 100,000 people
walter scott was stopped by officer slager for a broken taillight , and within minutes walter scott was dead
we watched in horror as we saw slager shoot walter scott in the back multiple times
then we saw slager pick up something from one location and place it near walter scott 's lifeless body
north charleston police chief eddie driggers told reporters , " i have watched the video , and i was sickened by what i saw
" apparently so was slager 's attorney , who announced after the video was made public that he was no longer representing the officer
after the video became public , the officials in north charleston deftly handled the situation
there is no plausible evidence that slager feared for his life when walter scott is seen running away
in ferguson , the video we have in the death of michael brown is of press conferences with police chief tom jackson , who refused to release the police officer 's name , but did release a video that appeared to show michael brown stealing cigars
north charleston 's police force is about 80 % white , with a population of 47 % black and 37 % white in the city
both north charleston and ferguson have police forces that are not representative of the population they serve , yet because of a video north charleston 's police force got in front of the story
i have heard many commentators say the north charleston shooting does n't have anything to do with race
i wonder how many whites in north charleston with broken taillights get pulled over ? being pulled over for driving while black is a well - known phenomenon , which i discuss in my " critical race theory " casebook
it is that perhaps the north charleston officials are better than those in ferguson when it comes to racially charged situations -- especially given the instructive fallout from michael brown 's shooting
