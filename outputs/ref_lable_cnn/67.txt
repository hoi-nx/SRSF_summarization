nasa says its messenger space probe crashed into mercury on thursday after running out of fuel , ending a nearly 11 - year journey that provided valuable data and thousands of photos
mission controllers at the apl ( apl ) in laurel , maryland , confirmed the probe slammed into the surface of mercury , as anticipated , at 3:26 p.m. edt , nasa told cnn in an email
nasa earlier said the probe was expected to hit the surface at 8,750 miles per hour and to create an impact crater 52 feet ( 16 meters ) in diameter
one of the mission 's big findings : it sent back data indicating that ice in mercury 's shadowed polar regions , if spread over an area the size of washington , would be more than two miles thick , nasa said
and while the space probe wo n't be sending back anymore images , you can see mercury with your own eyes
