washington santorum says he 'd hoped indiana gov. mike pence would veto the " fix " to his state 's religious freedom law rather than limiting its scope
santorum , the former gop senator from pennsylvania , who is likely to mount another presidential campaign in 2016 , said on cbs ' " face the nation " on sunday that mike pence 's decision to sign a follow - up bill -- which made clear the law could n't be used to refuse services based on sexual orientation -- led to a " limited view " of religious freedom
" it does n't really open the debate up on some of the more current issues , " santorum said -- a reference to gay rights issues
the indiana uproar drew nearly all of the gop 's 2016 contenders into the debate , with candidates like jeb bush , marco rubio and ted cruz rushing to mike pence 's defense
' " gay rights groups , meanwhile , have used the outrage over indiana 's law -- as well as a similar one that arkansas gov. asa hutchinson signed into law -- and debate in at least 14 other states over similar measures this year to renew their calls for state laws that bar discrimination based on sexual orientation
" cardinal dolan , the archbishop of the catholic archdiocese in new york , said on nbc 's " meet the press " on sunday that the debate over religious freedom calls for a " delicate balance
" it 's easier to ignore religious freedom than it is , today , the more popular issues , " dolan said
" in a way , i appreciate the fact that we have political leaders like gov. mike pence that are saying , ' whoa , wait a minute
