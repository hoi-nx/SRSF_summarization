and not this year -- at least not if you 're a member of the jury that convicted dzhokhar tsarnaev in the bombings
that 's what federal judge o'toole told jurors tuesday , stressing the importance of avoiding anything that could be prejudicial in the trial 's sentencing phase
that begins april 21 , a day after this year 's edition of the landmark race
the first phase of dzhokhar tsarnaev 's trial began march 4 , after which federal prosecutors called 92 witnesses , and the defense just four
timeline of the bombings , manhunt and aftermath dzhokhar tsarnaev 's lawyers never disputed that their client was at the scene of the bombings and part of the days - long mayhem that followed
rather , they convicted dzhokhar tsarnaev on all 30 counts he faced -- including using weapons of mass destruction , bombing a place of public use , conspiracy and aiding and abetting
talking to the jury on tuesday , o'toole predicted that the sentencing phase will last four weeks before cautioning that forecasting a specific timetable is less reliable than guessing the weather
