for the 1960s , the end arrived with -- depending on your ideals and your tribe -- either the rolling stones ' altamont fiasco in december 1969 , the kent state shootings in may 1970 or richard nixon 's 1972 re-election
for " mad men , " the " end of an era , " as its slogan has it , begins sunday
over the past eight years , the show about a 1960s advertising agency and its collision with changing times has become part of the national fabric , if never a huge ratings hit
stores have created fashion lines inspired by the show ; there have been " mad men " cocktails and " mad men " museum exhibits and even " mad men " presidential references
in march , a " mad men " bench was unveiled in front of new york 's time & life building , where the fictional firm of mad men & partners has its headquarters
the end of a tv series brings with it some risk
" the sopranos , " " mad men " creator weiner 's former employer , divided fans with its famous cut - to - black finale
on the other hand , " mad men 's " former amc stablemate , " breaking bad , " was saluted for an almost perfect landing
what 's going to happen ? here are some educated guesses
with the ' 60s screaming towards their conclusion , " mad men " probably wo n't jump ahead much
" mad men " is generally a show about disintegration , reflective of the ' 60s themselves
the old orders are falling apart : white - shoe wasp firms like mad men giving way to the ethnic pace - setters such as doyle dane bernbach ; grimy new york replaced by sunny los angeles ; the " good war " generation butting heads with the " make love , not war " cohort ; vacuum tubes and ledger books being displaced by a sleek , solid - state ibm world
last season saw plenty of intraoffice turmoil , thanks to the ill - fitting merger between mad men and former rival cutler gleason and chaough
though the agency survived , it 's now without mad men ( robert morse ) and under the ownership of ( real - life ) madison avenue titan mccann erickson
that 's not a recipe for long - term survival , and expect a number of longtime characters -- ken cosgrove ( aaron staton ) , harry crane ( rich sommer ) and perhaps even joan harris ( christina hendricks ) -- to look for an exit
she left mad men once ; indeed , she would n't have returned if her new agency had n't merged with her old one
anything 's possible , but given all that the character has been through -- divorces , affairs , office politics , morose late - night rides with glen bishop -- it 's a bit on the nose , is n't it ? instead , try this : it 's april 1 , 1970
