abu dhabi , united arab emirates lost luggage after a long flight is a common , frustrating occurrence of modern air travel
united states jennifer stewart says she was devastated to learn that etihad airways lost her most important baggage following a recent trip from abu dhabi to new york : her 2 - year - old pet cat , felix
stewart said that she and her husband , joseph naaman , booked felix on their etihad airways flight from the united arab emirates to new york 's john f. kennedy international airport on april 1
shortly after the plane arrived in new york that evening , felix went missing somewhere on the grounds of john f. kennedy international airport , according to etihad airways
felix was able to get loose , stewart said she believes , because the cat 's plastic carrier was badly damaged at some point either during the flight or the transfer from the airplane to the pickup area
stewart said a cargo manager called the couple to an office after they landed at john f. kennedy international airport last week and notified them that their cat 's carrier had been crushed
nearly one week later , felix remains missing
" for them to take a cat and ship him like he was cargo , not a live animal , makes me sick , " stewart said
" the airline shipped more than 200 pets last year
the couple said they spent $ 1,200 to ship felix on the 14 - hour flight
" you pay all of this money , but for what ? people assume you pay extra to have your pets taken care of , but they 're treated no differently than a free piece of checked luggage , " stewart said
officials at john f. kennedy international airport have offered to assist etihad airways as the airline investigates what happened , the port authority said
