a delaware father is in stable condition and improving as his two boys remain in critical condition after they became sick -- perhaps from pesticide exposure , federal officials say -- during a trip to the u.s. virgin islands
esmond , his teenage sons and the teens ' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in st. john , where they were renting a villa at the sirenusa resort
the family has confidence in their medical professionals and is hopeful for a full recovery , according to a statement released monday from the family 's attorney , maron
the u.s. epa said friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in st. john may have caused the illnesses , which were reported to the epa on march 20
elias rodriguez , an epa spokesman , said the agency 's preliminary test results " do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying
" exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects , including central nervous system and respiratory system damage , according to the epa
the use of the pesticide is restricted in the u.s. because of its acute toxicity
for example , the pesticide is injected into the soil of some u.s. strawberry fields , said enck , an epa regional administrator
" we trust that the strawberry producers are making sure that there 's not excess pesticide residue on strawberries , " enck said
" this is a pesticide that 's been around for a long time , and ironically because of its impact and damage to the ozone layer , it 's being phased out because of the air impacts of this fumigant , " enck added
in 2011 , warehouse workers in california fell ill after exposed to grapes imported from chile fumigated with methyl bromide , the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention said
the epa said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on march 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated
sea glass vacations , which acts as a rental agent for several units at sirenusa , said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests , but that the family 's unit was not treated
