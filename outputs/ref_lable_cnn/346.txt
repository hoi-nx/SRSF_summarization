think it 's hard to redeem your miles for an airline award ticket ? it depends on which airline rewards program you 've chosen , which route you 're flying and when you book your ticket , according to a new consumer reports study of 70 million passenger trips over the past two years
the top performer was southwest airlines , which offered the most award tickets , 11.9 million , and the highest percentage of award tickets -- 11.5 % of 103.1 million total passenger seats
" the high number of award tickets is directly related to southwest airlines 's unique combination of ' every seat is an award seat , ' no blackout dates , points that do n't expire , and a route map that reaches more than 90 different destinations in the american and beyond , making us the largest domestic carrier in the american , " southwest airlines spokesperson thais conway hanson told cnn
" at the bottom of the list was jetblue , which offered the lowest percentage of award seats and the fewest number of award tickets of the five biggest american airlines : 892,000 one - way passenger tickets , or 4.5 % of its total 19.7 million american seats
( jetblue only operates in 10 of the top 25 markets included in the study
) many jetblue customers fly the airline only once or twice per year , making it hard to accumulate miles , an airline spokesman told the magazine
on average , nearly 10 % of passengers on the five airlines analyzed by consumer reports flew on domestic award tickets , but some of them were n't getting the best value for their miles
southwest airlines had the highest customer satisfaction score ( 86 ) , followed by jetblue ( 85 ) , delta ( 70 ) , american ( 66 ) and united ( 63 )
