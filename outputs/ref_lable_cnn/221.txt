because the leader of the free world refuses to look with clear eyes at the chief security challenges of the 21st century : the fruits of radical islam
the results of the obama white house 's innovative efforts to make the world a better place can be accounted for in the ever - growing numbers of victims of radical islam in the middle east , north africa and south asia
given the frightfully slow pace america 's commander - in - chief is currently allowing our military and intelligence community to take action against both isis and its progenitor , al qaeda , the picture of what 's in store is clear : the body count will continue to grow in the places where these groups can generate buy - in for their agendas
but the fact is they are not -- their agendas , which constitute the foremost threats to the global security environment today , are manifestations of radical islam
of course , it 's hardly a surprise president obama refuses to acknowledge all this in plain terms -- the president and his national security advisers have too often proven naÃ¯ve , with a dangerous habit of viewing the world not as it is , but as they hope it could be
that document contained the assertion that , " since the beginning of 2011 , the transformative change sweeping north africa and the middle east -- along with the death of bin laden -- has further changed the nature of the terrorist threat , par - ticularly as the relevance of al qaeda and its ideology has been further diminished
soon after clapper acknowledged al qaeda was not a band on the run , as president obama had described the terrorist enterprise , a report by terrorism expert jones of the rand corporation highlighted yet another inconvenient truth for the white house : as restraints on freedom of expression of radical religious views vanished in places like libya , tunisia and egypt during the arab spring , those states became fertile recruitment grounds for terrorist groups -- including al qaeda and groups aligned with it
most recently , absent from the national security strategy produced by the obama white house in february 2015 is any real meaningful discussion concerning threats posed by al qaeda
yes , bin laden was killed on president obama 's watch
aqap is helmed by the second - highest - ranking official in al qaeda writ large , and the obama administration views it as the most dangerous component of al qaeda 's global network
so it is interesting that , in the months before the yemen government was overthrown by iran - backed rebels , president obama described the united states - yemen counterterrorism partnership as a shining example of success in the fight against al qaeda -- interesting because the president did not do more to help that " partner " government remain in power
at the same time , the routine failures of president obama and his advisers to understand the security environment , and to appropriately tailor america 's national security posture in a manner demanded by it , foretells more disasters lie ahead
indeed , president obama 's refusal to simply call a problem like radical islam by its name strongly suggests he is unwilling to make the difficult decisions that must be made today if we are to stand a chance of defeating radical islamist groups
history has shown the dangers that millions can be placed in if our leaders do n't face down a looming threat by calling it what it is and putting our full weight behind efforts to vanquish it
president obama has the resources at his disposal to do just that
indeed , president obama should also pay closer attention to what representatives from arab states are saying behind closed doors
