fifty years ago in frankfurt , german prosecutors tried 22 former ss soldiers at auschwitz in what remains the most famous holocaust trial staged in german
' then the entire world would exhale , as would all the survivors of those killed at auschwitz , and the air would be cleared
demjanjuk , whose conviction by a munich court in 2011 established the precedent that has now made possible the trial of oskar grã¶ning , remained defiantly silent during his 18 - month trial , never so much as breathing a word of acknowledgment or remorse
over the years , some defendants have acknowledged knowing of the exterminations , but have insisted that they played no role
and even when a trial ended in a conviction , what was missing was any sense of moral reckoning , an acknowledgment on the part of the accused of the perversity of genocide
on april 21 , on the opening day of his trial in lã¼neburg , where he stands accused of complicity in the murder of 300,000 jews during his service at auschwitz , the 93 - year - old oskar grã¶ning faced the court and acknowledged , " it is beyond question that i am morally complicit
this moral guilt i acknowledge here , before the victims , with regret and humility
" if nothing else comes from the trial , that statement alone justifies the undertaking
" at auschwitz , oskar grã¶ning was responsible for inspecting the luggage of deportees to the camp -- most of whom were gassed within hours of their arrival -- for banknotes that would be carefully counted and sent to berlin
in performing this task , oskar grã¶ning insists that he never engaged in cruel , murderous or sadistic acts -- a claim that we can probably accept as true
this does not mean that oskar grã¶ning deserves the same measure of punishment as an ss sadist
the significance of oskar grã¶ning 's trial can be measured in one final way
with that in mind , oskar grã¶ning 's trial reminds us of other mass atrocities that still await their moment of moral and legal reckoning .
