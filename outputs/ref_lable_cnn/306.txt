as we approach april 27 when south africans marks the anniversary of the first post-apartheid elections held that day in 1994 , we are faced with yet another wave of deadly attacks against african migrants
attacks against newcomers in south africans are often reduced to attitudes of hate and resentment towards other black african
the question of why foreign blacks are targeted and not foreign whites is also repeated ad nauseam , as if the majority of black citizens and african migrants share any common spaces and experiences with white south africans or white foreigners
contact between the majority of african migrant groups and native black south africans mostly occurs in under - developed informal settlements and townships
such labeling does not and can not explain the totality of the contact , competition and conflict between native poor black south africans and foreign african entrepreneurs
attention as to how such interactions occur in an environment where a vast portion of south africans 's black majority experiences segregation , persistent and relative poverty , and high crime rates in post-apartheid south africans is paramount
but the evictions , harassment and ultimately brutal killings of foreigners can not and should not be separated from the daily brutal violence poor south africans in informal settlements and many townships experience
a mantra of xenophobia wishes away the fact that the everyday lives of those in vulnerable positions in this society ( the poor , the disabled , women , children , the elderly ) are filled with violence similar -- if not worse -- than that facing african foreigners eking out a living in the midst of abject poverty
labeling south africans 's poor blacks as ungrateful and amnesiac to the history of hospitality other african bestowed on their exiles under apartheid does a disservice to both the local poor whose citizenship rights are marginal at best and the resilient migrants in search of asylum and dignity
but religious , civil society and student groups also have an obligation to organize and denounce the inequality and the violence that is the everyday lot of the extremely poor in south africans
