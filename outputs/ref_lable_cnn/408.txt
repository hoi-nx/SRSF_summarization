video shows reserve deputy robert bates announcing he is going to deploy his taser after an undercover weapons sting on april 2 , but then shooting harris in the back with a handgun
in a written statement , tulsa district attorney stephen a. kunzweiler said robert bates is charged with second - degree manslaughter involving culpable negligence
it 's a felony charge that could land the volunteer deputy in prison for up to four years if he 's found guilty
wood , an attorney who represents robert bates , said the shooting was an " excusable homicide
" " we believe the video itself proves that it was an accident of misfortune that occurred while deputy bates was fulfilling his duties as a reserve deputy , " wood said
" investigators ' efforts to defend robert bates and the other deputies involved in the arrest have sparked a mounting chorus of criticism online
harris ' family is demanding an independent investigation of what they call unjustified brutality
they 're also questioning why the 73 - year - old robert bates -- the ceo of an insurance company who volunteers as a certified reserve deputy -- was on the scene in such a sensitive and high - risk sting operation
daniel smolen , an attorney representing the harris family , said robert bates paid big money to play a cop in his spare time
wood said his client -- who had donated cars and video equipment to the sheriff 's office -- had undergone all the required training and had participated in more than 100 operations with the task force he was working with the day he shot harris
but he 'd never been the main deputy in charge of arresting a suspect , wood said , but was thrust into the situation because harris ran from officers during the arrest
" robert bates , who worked as a police officer for a year in the 1960s , had been a reserve deputy since 2008 , with 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience , according to the sheriff 's office
tulsa county sheriff 's maj. clark denied accusations that robert bates had paid to play a cop , describing him as one of many volunteers in the community who have contributed to the agency
" no matter how you cut it up , deputy robert bates met all the criteria on the council on law enforcement education and training to be in the role that he was in , " clark said
after the shooting , robert bates told investigators that he was " in a state of shock and disbelief " after realizing he 'd fired his gun
he also said he believed there was a " strong possibility " that harris had a gun
wood said monday that robert bates is upset over the shooting
" authorities say robert bates thought he pulled out his taser but " inadvertently " fired his gun
though harris was later determined to be unarmed , sgt. jim clark of the tulsa police department , who has been brought in to review the case , excused the behavior of robert bates and an officer who is heard cursing at harris in the video
" he was nonviolent , he was peaceful , he was loving , he was caring , and he was my brother that i 'll never see again ' til i see him in heaven , " harris told reporters , accusing the sheriff 's office of trying to persuade him not to hire an attorney and quickly make the case " go away
... this is simply evil , " andre harris told reporters monday
