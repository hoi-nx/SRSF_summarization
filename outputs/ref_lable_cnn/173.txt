the fbi has confirmed that one of its most wanted terrorists , the malaysian bomb maker known as marwan , was killed in an otherwise disastrous raid in the philippine in january
marwan , whose real name is zulkifli bin hir , was believed by the fbi to a member of southeast asian terror group jemaah islamiyah 's central command
the fbi said in february that a dna sample -- understood to be from a severed finger -- taken from a man killed in a raid in the southern philippine showed a link with a known relative of marwan
but the fbi now says tests have confirmed that the dead man was the wanted islamic extremist
" after a thorough review of forensic data and information obtained from our philippine law enforcement partners , the fbi has assessed that terrorism subject , zulkifli abdhir ... is deceased and has been removed from the fbi 's list of most wanted terrorists , " bowdich , assistant director in charge of the fbi 's los angeles field office , told cnn in a statement
the fbi had been offering a $ 5 million reward for information leading to marwan 's capture in the wake of his 2007 indictment on terror charges in a california court
it accused him of being a supplier of ieds to terrorist organizations , and having conducted bomb making training for terror groups , including the philippine - based abu sayyaf
marwan had previously been falsely reported dead after a raid by philippine security forces in 2012
but in january it launched a surprise raid in pursuit of marwan at mamapasono , in the southern province of maguindanao
