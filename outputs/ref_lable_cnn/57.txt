a longtime friend of joni mitchell has filed a legal petition seeking to be named the singer - songwriter 's conservator
joni mitchell , who was inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 1997 , was taken to ucla medical center a month ago after being found unconscious in her home
leslie morris is described as joni mitchell 's friend of more than 44 years in the legal documents
in her april 28 petition , leslie morris says joni mitchell is unconscious : " at this time she ( joni mitchell ) remains unconscious and unable to make any responses , and is therefore unable to provide for any of her personal needs
" but on joni mitchell 's website , a statement posted the same day that says it was approved by leslie morris says joni mitchell is alert
the document obtained by a certain media outlet simply gives her longtime friend leslie morris the authority -- in the absence of 24 - hour doctor care -- to make care decisions for joni mitchell once she leaves the hospital
