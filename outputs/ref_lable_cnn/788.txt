video may have killed the radio star , but in norwegians it 's digital that 's killing fm radio
that does n't mean that norwegians will be left with radio silence ; they 'll merely have to tune in digitally
on fm , norwegians can only find five stations
on the digital audio broadcasting network , there are four times that number
