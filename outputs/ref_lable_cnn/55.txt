kiev , ukraine the question haunting kiev is this : who might be murdering allies of ukraine 's ousted president yanukovych ? the idea that this might be happening is not entirely new
but it muscled its way to the fore again this week with two high - profile shooting deaths in the ukraine capital -- one of a former member of parliament with ties to yanukovych , the other of a ukraine journalist known for his pro-russian views
oleg kalashnikov , 52 , was a member of the party of regions , the former ruling party in ukraine , and was close to yanukovych
the killings renewed speculation , sparked by earlier unusual deaths , about a conspiracy to kill people close to yanukovych
and three days later , on march 12 , peklushenko , another former member of parliament , was found in his house in zaporizhzhya , in southeastern ukraine , dead of a gunshot wound
" ukraine is deeply divided , and it has been for years
about a third of the population speaks russian as opposed to ukraine
and with russian 's subsequent annexation of crimea and its support for russian - speaking separatists in eastern ukraine , the internecine animosity made the ugly transformation into war
with a government toppled and armed conflict in the east , ukraine have reason to want each other dead
but the view of who might be responsible for the series of deaths differs starkly , according to which side of the country 's divide one is on
the opposition bloc , the country 's major opposition party , has no doubt the deaths have been politically motivated -- " bloody terror against opposition politicians and journalists , " the bloc 's media office called them
ukraine president poroshenko , who came to office after yanukovych was ousted , has demanded an investigation of the killings of oleg kalashnikov and buzyna , his media office said
" it should not be excluded that the killings of oleg kalashnikov and olez buzyna were planned and organized from moscow and are a part of a plan to destabilize ukraine and further support anti-ukrainian mood in russian society , " geraschenko said .
