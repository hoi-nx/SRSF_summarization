the officer charged with murder in the shooting death of an unarmed black man in south carolina has been fired as anger continues to build around his case
a video shows officer michael slager , who is white , firing eight shots at 50 - year - old scott as scott has his back to him and is running away
scott , who was unarmed , was struck five times
" i have watched the video , and i was sickened by what i saw , " north charleston police chief driggers told reporters wednesday
summey told reporters that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras " so every officer on the street " in the city will have one
that is in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered , he said
they were led by a man wearing a " black lives matter " t - shirt who shouted , " this is what democracy looks like ! " scott 's shooting stirred memories of the brown case in ferguson , missouri , where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer
but not everyone agreed that scott 's case is like brown 's or that race was a factor
" we ca n't get into the brain of another individual , so we ca n't state that , " scott family attorney chris stewart said
" an autopsy of scott showed that he " sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body , " and his death was the result of a homicide , the charleston county coroner 's office said
asked whether cpr was performed on scott after michael slager shot him , driggers said : " in the end of it ( the video ) , what i saw was ( what i ) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life - saving ( procedure ) , but i 'm not sure what took place there
" michael slager pulled scott over on saturday morning for a broken taillight , authorities have said
any words exchanged between scott and michael slager are not audible on the released tape
it 's also unclear what happened before scott started to run away , or why he ran
the officer initially said that he used a taser stun gun on anthony scott and that scott tried to take his weapon
" shots fired and the subject is down , " michael slager said , according to police reports
later in the video , when the officer approaches scott 's body , he drops a dark object next to the man
it 's unknown whether scott took the officer 's taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body
when scott 's brother anthony saw the video , he was convinced the officer had lied , he told cnn
" i think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot , no one would have thought that , " scott said
the video shows scott attempting to run away
when asked how he felt about the fact that michael slager has been charged with murder , santana said that " no one can feel happy
" " he has his family and mr. scott also has his family
" mr. scott did n't deserve this
" if convicted of murder , michael slager could face life in prison or the death penalty
who is officer michael slager ? " people are upset , people are pointing out how wrong the officer was for gunning down mr. scott , " south carolina state rep. bamberg said as he stood alongside anthony scott on wednesday
he and scott stressed they do n't want that to happen
a cnn examination of michael slager 's police job application indicates he has been an employee of the north charleston police department for about five years and five months
instead of wearing his police uniform , michael slager now wears a jail uniform
