miami world heavyweight boxing champion klitschko has an important title defense coming up , but his thoughts continue to be dominated by the ongoing fight for democracy in ukraine
speaking to cnn from his miami training base ahead of the april 25 showdown with american challenger bryant jennings in new york , klitschko said the crisis in his homeland has left him shocked and upset
" my country is unfortunately suffering in the war with russian -- not that ukraine tried to give any aggression to any other nation , in this particular case russian , unfortunately it 's the other way around , " klitschko told cnn
" i never thought that our brother folk is going to have war with us , so that ukraine and russian are going to be divided with blood , " he added
the aggression , in the military presence of ( russian ) soldiers and military equipment in my country , ukraine , is upsetting
" klitschko is the reigning ibf , wba , wbo and ibo champion and has , alongside older brother vitali , dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century
vitali , who retired from boxing in 2013 , is a prominent figure in ukraine politics
the following month , russian troops entered ukraine 's crimea peninsula before russian president vladimir putin completed the annexation of crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving ukraine in a referendum
" people are dying in ukraine every single day , " klitschko said
" but with the backing of the international community , klitschko is confident ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a soviet - era style dictatorship
" ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under western democracy
" klitschko , whose comments were made as part of a wide - ranging interview for cnn 's human to hero series , is routinely kept abreast of developments in ukraine by brother vitali but also returns home whenever he can
" but after leaving almost all his boxing opponents battered and bruised -- the ukraine is seeking an impressive 18th consecutive title defense against bryant jennings -- klitschko is keen to carry on fighting his own and his country 's corner in the opposite way outside the ring
