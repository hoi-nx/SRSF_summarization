ten years ago , a prosecutor in centre county , pennsylvania , took a day off work and vanished
since then , the case of gricar has become one of the most intriguing and talked about missing persons stories in the country
months later his county - issued laptop and hard drive were found -- separately -- on the banks of the river , too damaged to read
the best lead they got was the sighting of a woman who has not been identified , and information that he had searched online for ways to destroy a hard drive
from the start , investigators have considered three possibilities : gricar committed suicide , fell victim to foul play or deliberately walked away
the prevailing theories have been suicide or walk - away , especially since 2009 , when a search of his google history on his home computer found that someone had been searching " how to fry a hard drive " and " water damage to a notebook computer
" gricar , a private and quiet man , was spotted with a woman who was not his girlfriend the day he went missing , and cigarette ash was found near his car , even though he was not a smoker
matthews said that namus has compared gricar 's dna to unidentified bodies nine times since the database became available in 2009 , but so far , none has been a match
there 's something wrong if he 's googled how to fry a hard drive
" matt rickard , the former investigator who had been in charge of the investigation for several years , thinks that hard drive is the key to cracking the case
" in all honesty , somebody destroyed the hard drive and there was a reason
we have very few solid leads and the biggest one could be contained on that hard drive
" in 2011 , when former penn state defensive coordinator sandusky was arrested and charged with sexually abusing boys , it was revealed that it was gricar who decided not to charge sandusky when the first victim came forward in 1998
gricar cited a lack of evidence
the intrigue already simmering in gricar 's case exploded
sleuths desperately tried to find a link between the two cases , but investigators said there was no evidence that gricar 's disappearance had anything to do with sandusky 's crimes
but some have stuck to the homicide theory , suggesting that gricar was an enemy of mob - like gangs in central pennsylvania who were upset at his drug and corruption prosecutions
wecht , a forensic pathologist , said he considered writing a book about gricar , his ties to the sandusky case , and whether it led to suicide
" buehner , a former district attorney in montour county , pennsylvania , who was gricar 's friend , has never accepted a suicide or walk - away theory
buehner has doubts that , 10 years later , state police can recover from what he considers a bungled start to the case
" one of the things i 'd asked them to do from the first couple weeks is now impossible to do -- to do a hotel - motel canvas looking for the mystery woman seen with gricar and then match the names with photo ids which police have access to
" buehner said those records are now gone and his faith in finding gricar is dwindling
" so it was strange to many in pennsylvania that for years a case with such a high profile would be handled by the tiny bellefonte police department , where one investigator was assigned to juggle gricar 's case along with several more
in 2014 , the state police took over , but that was nine years after gricar went missing and two years after he had been declared legally dead
today , some of gricar 's friends believe the case is damaged beyond repair
