the night before her daughter 's first triathlon , kate parker could tell the child was nervous
still , as they laid out everything she 'd need the next day , parker , a photographer , could tell she was afraid
" why do n't we get a picture ? " parker asked ella , now 9
she looked , parker said , like " a little badass
" " you 're going to be totally fine , " parker showed her
looking back , " i wanted her to remember that she was scared and she went through with it , sort of as a memento of her conquering a fear , " said parker , who lives near atlanta
" the photo is one of parker 's favorites from her series , " strong is the new pretty
" it covers the last two years , but evolved from parker 's early days behind a camera , when she shot daily images of her girls to expand her knowledge of lighting and composition
i did n't want girls to think they had to look like that , " said parker , whose daughters are now 6 and 9
' i wanted them to keep that as long as they could , " parker said
as parents , parker and her husband encourage their girls to play outside , make new friends and try new things without worrying about grass - stained knees and knots in their hair , parker said
" they 're just being themselves , and i 'm just recording it , " parker said
responses to the images are mostly positive , parker said , but there 's the occasional complaint that she 's showing just one type of girl
it 's true , parker said : they 're the ones she 's raising , the only ones whose adventures she can document 24/7
parker 's own kids still surprise her
