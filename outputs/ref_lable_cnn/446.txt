what they do n't know is that they are being recorded on a hidden camera
the miami-dade police department set up the camera as part of an ongoing police investigation into luggage thefts by the very airport workers who are supposed to get bags safely onto planes
" it 's a problem we all face , " said police lt. estis
" we will continue to be proactive until we can see that the claims of pilfering through luggage will actually decrease
a cnn analysis of passenger property loss claims filed with the tsa from 2010 to 2014 shows 30,621 claims of missing valuables , mostly packed in checked luggage
jfk in new york topped the list of airports with the most claims of thefts from luggage , followed by los angeles international airport , orlando international and miami , according to the data
the problem has been so serious at jfk that in 2013 , el al airlines set up a hidden camera in a baggage hold
then , in december , seven more jfk baggage handlers were charged with stealing valuables from checked luggage
in miami , which aggressively goes after luggage thieves , police have arrested 31 baggage handlers and ramp workers since 2012 , including six so far this year
police set up a hidden camera inside the belly of a plane last year and caught baggage handlers rifling through luggage and stealing various items
another hidden camera caught a baggage handler rummaging through bags in a secure luggage room inside the airport while a security guard looked the other way
among the valuables found were computers , watches , jewelry and cameras and designer bags
even the tsa has had problem employees
it employs about 50,000 officers today , and last year screened more than 443 million checked bags and nearly 1.7 billion carry - ons
outsiders have been caught on surveillance cameras stealing luggage from carousels
