a 24 - year - old man is in custody after he called for an ambulance , only to have french authorities come and discover weapons , ammunition and evidence of his plans to target churches -- an attack that someone in syria requested , a top prosecutor said wednesday
the man was identified later as sid ahmed ghlam , french interior minister cazeneuve told television broadcaster tf1
paris prosecutor molins said sid ahmed ghlam asked for medical help at his home in paris ' 13th district sunday morning , claiming he had accidentally injured himself when he mishandled a weapon
but authorities found more than a man with a gunshot wound in his thigh
molins said sid ahmed ghlam was someone suspected of killing a 32 - year - old woman hours earlier and who then intended to launch a larger - scale terror attack in the near future
" ( he ) let them believe that he was the victim , " french president hollande said wednesday
" earlier sid ahmed ghlam was identified as a computer science student originally from algeria
but that did n't mean french authorities did n't know about sid ahmed ghlam
the minister said the man planned to head to syria , a country embroiled in a bloody , years - long civil war that has attracted foreigners wishing to join extremist militant groups like isis
but , molins said , computer searches revealed that the man had been communicating with someone in syria who " asked him to target a church
" what church ? authorities did n't disclose that detail on wednesday , though molins did say " this target was confirmed by ( the suspect 's satellite navigation system ) and handwritten documents in his car
nonetheless , molins said that ballistics , dna , satellite navigation and other evidence connected him to the death of aurelie chatelain , who molins called the region 's first victim of terrorism since january
that 's when the massacre at charlie hebdo 's offices and the siege of a kosher market in paris took place , prompting french authorities to beef up security measures
" french , like other countries , is facing a terror threat that is unprecedented in its nature and magnitude , " valls said
