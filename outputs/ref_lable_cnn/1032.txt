twenty years ago , on april 19 , 1995 , timothy mcveigh detonated a massive truck bomb in front of the murrah federal building in oklahoma city
reports connected timothy mcveigh and his accomplice terry nichols to anti-government ideology movements , such as the militia movement , as well as to white supremacist causes
in contrast , the report spent only a paragraph describing the threat from right - wing extremists
after oklahoma city , everything changed
increased scrutiny of right - wing extremists resulted in a flurry of arrests for everything from terrorist plots to hate crimes
though it had paid a high price to do so , it seemed that the americans had recognized the dangers that right - wing extremists posed
however , just six years after the oklahoma city bombing , an event occurred that pushed to the background those lessons so dearly won
the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks -- attacks of a scale and ferocity that dwarfed even that of the oklahoma city bombing -- commanded the full attention of the nation
unfortunately , rather than expanding national attention to encompass the dangers of both radical islam and right - wing extremism , the 9/11 attacks simply shifted attention away from the extreme right
moreover , the surge of right - wing extremism that marked the 1990s had seemingly ebbed
thus it is no real surprise that concern over right - wing violence faded into the background
the significance of the oklahoma city bombing , in terms of its service as a warning about right - wing violence , became greatly lessened
but right - wing extremism did not disappear after september 11
from 1995 through 2000 , according to statistics from the anti-defamation league 's center on extremism , right - wing extremists were responsible for at least 47 different terrorist acts , conspiracies or plots
however , during the past six years , from 2009 through 2014 , right - wing extremists in the americans were involved in at least 42 actual or attempted terrorist acts
in other words , right - wing violence today is actually at or very close to levels during the days of the oklahoma city bombing
the anger and hate that generated the oklahoma city bombing in 1995 is still around in 2015 â and still dangerous
that would be the most positive way to pay homage to the victims of april 19 , 1995 .
