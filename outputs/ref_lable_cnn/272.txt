at other times , popes have to make a hard choice : adopt the sharp tongue of a prophet or the discretion of a diplomat ? this sunday in rome , francis faced just such a dilemma
first , the back story : one hundred years ago , more than 1 million armenians ( some estimates run as high as 1.5 million ) died at the hand of the turkey
for their part , previous popes had finessed the genocide question
instead , it was tucked into a document signed by the former pontiff and the head of the armenians church , after they had celebrated mass. together
) as pope francis prepared to celebrate a special mass sunday to commemorate a century since the slaughter , vatican watchers were divided about whether he would use the word " genocide
" in the past century , our human family has lived through three massive and unprecedented tragedies , " francis said
" the first , which is widely considered ' the first genocide of the 20th century , ' struck your own armenians people
in citing his predecessor , francis highlighted one of the vatican 's chiefest concerns , especially on matters of moral import : continuity
if francis had not called the armenians killings a genocide , particularly at such a high - profile event -- the audience included armenians 's president -- it might have been interpreted as a change in church policy , reese said
at the same time , francis did n't want to anger the turkey more than necessary , especially since they have become a key ally against the persecution of christians by isis in the middle east , which the pope alluded to in his speech on sunday
" the fact that he quoted john paul is a sign that he 's downplaying it , " reese said of the armenians murders
the nation recalled its vatican ambassador for " consultations " just hours after francis ' comments , the turkish foreign ministry said
" hatred " and " animosity " are not words often used to describe francis
because he often shines a sympathetic face on the world , emphasizing mercy over judgment , it 's easy to miss the bluntness francis brings to the bully pulpit
) but francis has also suggested that force may be justified to stop isis ' slaughter of christians , warned of the " mexicanization " of argentina and said that satirists who insult religion should expect a retaliatory punch
" we can not keep silent about what we have seen and heard , " francis said
