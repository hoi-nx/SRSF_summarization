aden , yemen the streets were empty but not quiet
people line up for bread , they line up for cooking fuel , and the electricity only works a few hours a day
and from late afternoon onward , most people stay indoors
how we got to yemen : 30 dangerous hours in a boat saudi began airstrikes on houthi rebels in yemen three weeks ago thursday
but aden remains a city not fully in the hands either of houthi rebels or forces loyal to the ousted government of president hadi
the houthi forced hadi from power in january , though hadi still claims to be yemen 's legitimate leader and is working with the saudi and other allies to return to yemen
those allied with hadi have accused the iranian government of supporting the houthi in their uprising in yemen
saudi officials said they have killed more than 500 houthi rebels
but the reality is that a good portion of the armaments the saudi send in on guided parachutes fall instead into houthi hands
but given how far along they are into the operation , the expectation would have been -- especially given the aerial cover the saudi are providing for loyalist forces on the ground -- that the houthi forces would have been pushed further back
why is saudi bombing yemen ? the government loyalists have gained territory ; that is why we were able to dock
given that control of the city is still divided , there is a feeling that not enough of what the saudi set out to do has been accomplished
