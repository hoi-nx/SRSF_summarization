london a poles prince has challenged populist britain politician nigel farage to a duel in london 's hyde park over his immigration policy
nigel farage , the leader of the britain ukip ( ukip ) , complains that britain 's membership of the european union means it is powerless to stop a flow of foreign immigrants , many from impoverished eastern europe , into his " small island " nation
in a video posted on youtube , prince zylinski said he was fed up with discrimination against poles living in britain
so what i 'd like to do , mr. nigel farage , is to challenge you to a duel , " he said
" are you up for it mr. nigel farage ? " nigel farage -- who is on the campaign trail ahead of britain 's general elections on may 7 -- said he did not intend to cross swords with the prince
" i would have thought that a poles prince with a long poles lineage would rather agree with me that it 's a complete tragedy for poles that it 's lost so many of its brightest and best young people
" ukip wants britain to leave the european union
another ukip politician appeared to back his party leader 's chances in a duel , tweeting an image of a medieval knight sliced in two , with the comment : " this is what nigel farage would do to him
" but there was no word on whether nigel farage would even accept the prince 's less life - threatening back - up challenge
" alternatively , if you do n't agree or if your sword is a little bit rusty , mr. nigel farage , we can meet for a different kind of duel -- a duel with words in a tv studio in the run - up to the elections , " zylinski suggested
" zylinski posted a separate video on youtube entitled " 7 reasons why the britain should love the poles , " in which he pointed to a times newspaper headline from march reading : " we need more migrants ... they are the best workers in britain
" zylinski pointed to poles contributions to britain including those made by poles raf pilots during the battle of britain , what he said was a " wonderful work ethic " and easy integration into the community
