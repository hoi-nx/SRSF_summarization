boston after weeks of dramatic testimony , jurors are set to begin deliberations tuesday in the trial of tsarnaev , who faces life in prison or the death penalty for working with his brother to explode bombs at the 2013 boston marathon
the defense and prosecution made closing arguments in the case on monday
" the defendant brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets , " assistant u.s. attorney chakravarty said
" the defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him
he wanted to awake the mujahideen , the holy warriors , so he chose patriots day , marathon monday , " a time for families to gather and watch the marathon
bomb survivors and victims ' family members wiped away tears and comforted each other in court
tsarnaev fidgeted at the defense table as he has done throughout the trial
bill richard , father of 8 - year - old bomb victim richard , craned his neck to watch tsarnaev as the prosecutor spoke
tsarnaev " chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on boston , " chakravarty said
" he chose a day when there would be civilians on the sidewalks and he targeted those civilians : men , women and children
" the lawyer waited a beat
" he wanted to terrorize this country
he wanted to punish united states for what it was doing to his people
" the prosecutor showed a picture of tsarnaev and his brother tamerlan in the marathon crowd
they were the mujahideen and they were bringing their battle to boston
" tsarnaev , 21 years old , stands accused of 30 counts , including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism
if tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts , the trial will proceed to a second phase , the so - called penalty phase
that part of the trial will include evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors , and the jury will be asked to weigh elements that make this crime especially heinous against details from tsarnaev 's background and mental health history that would weigh in his favor
" he was there , " defense attorney judy clarke conceded as the trial opened , but the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare tsarnaev 's life
this time jurors see tsarnaev standing by a tree behind the family of little richard
" these children were n't innocent to him , " the prosecutor said
" but luck had nothing to do with the boston bombings , the prosecutor said
' " the defense has maintained that tsarnaev , who was 19 and flunking out of college at the university of massachusetts , dartmouth , fell under the sway of his older , more radicalized brother
" it was tamerlan , " defense attorney clarke repeated during her closing argument monday
during the 15 - minute rebuttal period , prosecutor weinreb told jurors not to be distracted by the defense 's " attempt to point the finger at somebody else
" " there should be no doubt in your mind that the defendant and his brother are equally guilty , " he said
" weinreb pointed out that after the bombing tsarnaev went to the grocery store
to shred the bodies of women and children with a homemade type of bomb , you have to be different from other people , " the prosecutor said
twelve seconds later , tsarnaev allegedly detonated a second , similar bomb outside the forum restaurant , slightly more than a block away
tsarnaev struck tamerlan , who was wounded , when he charged police in the car
" tamerlan wanted suicide by cop , " the prosecutor said monday
" tsarnaev ditched the stolen car and sought shelter in a dry - docked boat parked in a trailer in a backyard in watertown
