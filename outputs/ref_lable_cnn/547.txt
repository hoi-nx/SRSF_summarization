the justice department has named a new defendant in the war on drugs , and the charges are serious indeed
who is this menace to society ? fedex
wait , can companies even be charged with crimes ? where would a fedex be incarcerated ? is there a corporate shawshank prison ? how does one fit a company for a prison jumpsuit ? it turns out a corporation can indeed be prosecuted like a person
corporations do n't have all the same inconvenient constitutional rights as citizens accused of crimes
even if corporations can be held criminally liable , should a courier service like fedex be held liable for " possessing " what bad guys may send through the service ? the answer , according to fedex , is not just " no , " but a " no " so conclusive that this case should never see a courtroom
when it comes to drugs , the law recognizes two kinds of possession : actual and constructive
that is the idea behind the " common carrier " exception to possession , and a large part of fedex 's compelling legal argument
the public policy reasons behind " common carrier " exemptions make sense ; the industry simply could n't function if every driver , courier and handler who touches a valid shipment of oxycontin had to obtain a prescription for opiates to be legally allowed to deliver it to your front door
in court papers , fedex 's lawyers offer the example of an airline whose sole activity was flying controlled substances from jamaica to miami
on the other hand , fedex argues that it is indeed a common carrier , performing the normal duties of a common carrier , because ( a ) it is engaged in the business of transportation of property and ( b ) it offers its services to the public generally
obviously , the justice department disagrees , which is why it has brought this criminal prosecution
according to the indictment , from at least as early as 2004 , the drug enforcement administration , the food and drug administration , and members of congress put fedex on notice that illegal internet pharmacies were using its shipping services to distribute controlled substances and prescription drugs in violation of the controlled substances act , the food , drug , and cosmetic act , and numerous state laws
the indictment alleges that as early as 2004 , fedex knew that it was delivering drugs to dealers and addicts
fedex 's couriers in kentucky , tennessee , and virginia expressed safety concerns that were circulated to fedex senior management
the justice department is making the argument that even though fedex carries and delivers whatever is handed to it by the public , fedex knew or should have known in specific instances that it was involving itself in suspicious drug activity
it raises a larger question , though : why do we prosecute inanimate objects that we ca n't even incarcerate ? the answer is the same reason that the drug dealers deal drugs , and drug smugglers smuggle them : money
the government in these cases gets to impose its will and policy upon large corporations -- in this case , it would be to force fedex to help law enforcement in policing shady pharmaceutical transportation
do n't get me wrong : i 'm all about prosecuting the black market , especially if that means prosecuting the guys who send us those spam emails to our work accounts with " v1agra " in the subject line , for our co-workers to see while we go to the bathroom
i 'm just not sure that fedex has anything to do with the kingpins of the " fr33 cyalis " email campaign
the justice department 's underlying intentions are noble enough -- this is an attack on the supply line of the illegal drug market by attacking the actual supply chain
fedex has a strong argument for dismissal in this case , but even if not , it wo n't be swapping its logo orange for prison orange anytime soon .
