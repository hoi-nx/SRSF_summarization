for the fifth year in a row in 2014 , ambush attacks on police officers were the no. 1 cause of felonious deaths of law enforcement officers in the line of duty
nevertheless , google continues to market a smartphone application that lets lawbreakers pinpoint the location of police officers in the field
google 's popular real - time traffic app , waze , uses gps navigation and crowdsourcing to alert users to traffic jams , automobile accidents , stalled cars , and through its " traffic cop " feature , the presence of law enforcement
most people undoubtedly use waze 's police - finding feature to avoid traffic tickets , but the app poses an enormous risk to deputies and police officers
in the days before he assassinated new york police officers rafael ramos and wenjian liu at point blank range while they sat in their patrol car last december , ismaaiyl brinsley is known to have used the waze application to monitor the movements of police officers
while google ( which acquired waze in 2013 for a reported $ 1.1 billion ) claims the app " is all about contributing to the ' common good ' out there on the road , " the risks far outweigh the potential benefits
in the case of waze , we are confronted with a tool that can be lethal to police officers and deputies , whose roles in society are to protect our citizens and enforce the laws that keep our communities safe
google , whose stated mission is " to organize the world 's information and make it universally accessible and useful , " is now marketing an app with the potential to obstruct law enforcement and put the lives of police officers and deputies at risk
is the highest , best use of google 's geo - mapping and crowdsourcing capabilities to help drunk drivers avoid checkpoints and give speeders assistance in evading speed limits ? it 's not just the speeders and drunk drivers who have access to the locations of police officers through google 's technology
if google 's real objective is the " common good out there on the road , " it will work with us to ensure the safety of both motorists and police officers
