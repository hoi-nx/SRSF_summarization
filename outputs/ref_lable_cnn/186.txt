" twenty - nine elephants currently live here , and 13 more will join the group by 2018 , after ringling bros. decided this year to stop using elephants in its traveling circus
" this was a decision that our family had discussed for quite some time , " said feld , chairman and ceo of feld entertainment , the company that owns ringling bros. and barnum & bailey
the ultimate decision to phase out the elephants , feld said , is the result of the different laws regulating the use of the animals in each of the 115 cities the circus visits every year
" the circus business has been a part of the feld family since 1967 , when irvin purchased ringling bros. and barnum & bailey
" it 's a family affair for our family but also for all the elephants
" when the center opened 20 years ago , it housed fewer than 10 elephants
" it was a place for elephants to retire , " feld said
today , the center houses elephants of all ages
" we have lots of different elephants , meaning males and females , youth elephants , older elephants , so it is a great place to study behavior , " he said

" we have the largest and only sustainable herd of asia elephants in the western hemisphere , " feld said

williams and her husband , jim , spend their time taking care of the animals ' daily needs
" each elephant costs over $ 65,000 a year , per year , over all the years of their life , " feld said
