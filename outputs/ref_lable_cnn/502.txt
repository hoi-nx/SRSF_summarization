isis on wednesday released more than 200 yazidis , a minority group whose members were killed , captured and displaced when the sunni islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern iraq last summer , officials said
most of those released were women and children ; the rest were ill or elderly , said omar , a commander in the peshmerga force that defends northern iraq 's semi-autonomous kurdish region
the freed yazidis were received by peshmerga , who sent them to the kurdish regional capital , irbil , said osman , an official with iraq 's kurdistan regional government
isis previously released scores of other yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group 's towns last year
the sunni islamist militant group steamrolled into iraq 's north last summer , forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- yazidis among them -- from their homes
yazidis are of kurdish descent , and their religion is considered a pre-islamic sect that draws from christianity , judaism and zoroastrianism
isis slaughtered yazidis by the hundreds , yian dakhil , the only lawmaker representing the yazidis in iraq 's parliament , told cnn last year
the u.s. state department estimates that 500,000 yazidis live in northern iraq , accounting for less than 1 % of the country 's population
