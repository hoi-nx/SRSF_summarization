jacob lawrence 's groundbreaking work , " the migration of the negro , " is a series of 60 small paintings with text depicting the lives of millions of pre-world war ii blacks as they moved from the oppressive south to the promise of a better life in the north
one frame in particular , no. 22 , shows three black men dressed in their sunday best , handcuffed , heads bowed standing in front of a window adorned with prison bars
the caption reads : " another of the social causes of the migrants ' leaving was that at times they did not feel safe , or it was not the best thing to be found on the streets late at night
they were arrested on the slightest provocation
" jacob lawrence painted this picture around 1940

meanwhile , louisiana state police want people to believe victor white iii shot himself in the chest while handcuffed sitting in the back of a police car
the video could shed some light on what really happened ... which may explain why we have yet to see it
and some look at baltimore and the protests happening all around the country and wonder where all of this rage is coming from ? this mistrust did n't come from somewhere
why else would someone believe sagging pants and hoodies are to blame for mass incarcerations ? that president obama is the reason why some blacks are frustrated with police and not the dynamic beautifully captured by jacob lawrence 75 years ago
before baltimore became the setting of a critically acclaimed tv show
there is n't a new reason why freddie gray 's death triggered outrage
