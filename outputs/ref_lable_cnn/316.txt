most climbers who try do n't succeed in summiting the 29,035 - foot - high everest , the world 's tallest peak
that 's why an experienced climbing group from the indian army plans to trek up the 8,850 - meter mountain to pick up at least 4,000 kilograms ( more than 8,000 pounds ) of waste from the high - altitude camps , according to india today
the upcoming trip marks the 50th anniversary of the first indian team to scale everest
" sadly , everest is now ... called the world 's highest junkyard , " maj. jamval , the team leader , told india today
" we will target the mountaineering waste from camp 1 ( 19,695 feet ) to the summit , " said jamval , who has scaled everest twice
the indian expedition is n't the first attempt to clean up the trash left by generations of hikers
