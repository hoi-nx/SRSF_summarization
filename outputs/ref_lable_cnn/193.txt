over the last year more than 25,000 people , a population about the size of key west , florida , have fought ebola infections
and even for those who did not experience ebola personally , the " most severe public health emergency seen in modern times " showed the world its vulnerability to disease
while the intensity of the largest ebola epidemic in history has died down , and the initial dire predictions that there would be over a million infections by january never came true , dozens are still newly infected each week
the latest world health organization report confirmed a total of 30 new confirmed cases of ebola were reported in the week of april 5
but in guinea , of the 19 confirmed deaths from april 5 , seven were only identified as ebola post-mortem and there were reports of 21 unsafe burials
