as thousands of south africans took to the streets of the city of durban to rally against violence and xenophobia , an online community has joined the protests
during the protest march thursday , twitter followers voiced their support through hashtag campaigns
south african police services said more than 10,000 people attended the march , including civil rights groups and nongovernmental organizations
but many are asking , some via twitter , is it enough to fight # xenophobia ? attacks this week in durban alone have killed two immigrants and three south africans , including a 14 - year - old boy , authorities said
flack , who lives in cape town , has brought allegations of hate speech and human rights violations against zulu , who he said referred to foreigners as " lice " and has said " they should pack their bags and go
" " people listen to him , " flack said
the zulu people in south africans take him very seriously , they do n't question what he says
" flack said he was motivated to make the allegations after seeing multiple complaints about xenophobic violence on social media and thinking they were n't enough
" i want to reach people who see that they can lay a charge and it wo n't cost them anything , but i will have done something to change the country and push it into a better state of being
" now , the human rights commission must decide whether to investigate flack 's allegations against the zulu king , who denies fueling any violence
flack hopes others will also make complaints
flack added that zulus are n't the only people in south africans who share in the xenophobic sentiment
" people are frustrated and unemployed , and people in south africans pay foreign nationals a lot less , " he said of the tension between nationals and immigrants
" imtiaz sooliman , founder and chairman of the gift of givers foundation in durban , does n't think most south africans are against foreigners
