while the fight against isis in syria and iraq holds the world 's gaze , a simultaneous transformation is getting less attention : the deterioration of al qaeda
in an audio message released sunday , al qaeda confirmed that two of its leaders , known as farooq and mansur , were killed in cia drone strikes in january in north waziristan , near the afghanistan - pakistani border
he was a pakistani who acted as the group 's liaison to the pakistani taliban and was the deputy commander of al qaeda 's south asia branch
the creation of the terror group 's south asia branch was seen by some terrorism analysts as an attempt to steal some of the limelight from isis , which is embroiled in a public dispute with al qaeda for leadership of the global jihad movement
the deaths of the two men continue the decimation of al qaeda 's bench of leaders
florida - raised adnan shukrijumah , 39 , who was in charge of al qaeda 's operations to attack the west , was killed in december in a pakistani military operation
indeed , al qaeda has virtually no capacity to carry out attacks in the west
the last successful al qaeda attack in the west was the london transportation system bombings a decade ago
meanwhile , isis continues to attract western recruits and also inspire " homegrown " terrorists in the west , but the core al qaeda organization that killed almost 3,000 men , women and children on 9/11 is on life support
