i 've visited nepal at least half a dozen times over the last decade , and of the more than 100 countries that save the children serves , it is undoubtedly one of my favorites
but nepal has also made some of the most remarkable progress on maternal and child health in the last few years
so you can imagine the indescribable sadness i experienced waking up this morning and seeing the news reports that nepal had been hit by its worst earthquake since 1934 , when more than 10,000 people were killed
while casualty accounts following the magnitude - 7.8 quake saturday are still difficult to confirm -- hardly surprising considering that communication lines have been severely disrupted -- estimates we are hearing from the ground are already placing the number lost in the thousands , with the official toll now at around 1,500 expected to keep growing as the hours and days pass
the fact that the epicenter of this quake was so close to the capital of kathmandu , where the majority of nepal 's citizens reside , makes the situation even more dire
it is still quite cold at night in nepal , so getting these people into shelters quickly will be of the utmost importance
compounding this very serious problem will be the difficulty in ensuring that those affected have access to clean water in the coming days ; nepal already had one of the lowest standards of sanitation in the world before the quake
only the oldest nepal will remember the last major earthquake , so the psychological toll for the majority of the country will be a significant and ongoing concerning for us as we and other agencies launch our response
