easley , south carolina the cracker or the bite of ice cream -- brynn duncan still is n't sure which one sent her into anaphylactic shock that day
the paramedics who arrived to take brynn duncan to greenville memorial hospital , or " hotel greenville " as she likes to call it , knew her well
" new day , new crisis , " brynn duncan quips as she tells the story , as if it 's about her first day of college or a shopping trip gone wrong
less than a week after her trip to the hospital , brynn duncan , 21 , is back at home in easley , south carolina
melissa , a paralegal by day , dons a mask and surgical gloves before disinfecting the area around the tube that 's connected to brynn duncan 's jugular vein

" brynn duncan was seemingly a normal kid -- until she was n't
yes , she got sick often as a child , melissa muses out loud -- but what kid does n't ? brynn duncan was also incredibly energetic , always the center of attention
that was the same year doctors diagnosed brynn duncan with ibs , or irritable bowel syndrome
" high maintenance ! " brynn duncan fills in with a laugh
it was n't until shortly before her 16th birthday in 2010 that brynn duncan had her first serious allergic reaction
brynn duncan saw specialist after specialist
after doing hours of research , melissa , barry and brynn duncan came up with their own diagnosis : mast cell disease
scientists do n't know yet what causes mast cell disease
until recently , the only mast cell disease doctors had identified was mastocytosis , which is characterized by " abnormal proliferation and activation " of the body 's mast cells -- meaning there are way too many and they act in strange ways
but in the last few years doctors such as afrin have started to recognize that there are many different layers to mast cell disease
for instance , brynn duncan has mast cell activation syndrome , meaning her mast cells act strangely , but they 're not growing in number
" it 's like i 'm living in a 24/7 allergic reaction , " brynn duncan explains simply
fruit , vegetables , milk , soy , nuts , smoke , perfume , the sun -- you name it , brynn duncan is allergic to it
on bad days , even using her feeding tube causes her extreme pain
not everyone with mast cell activation syndrome has it as bad as brynn duncan does
they can affect every system in the body , afrin says , so the disease is capable of causing all the symptoms brynn duncan experiences
you have to ask yourself , he says : " is this poor patient so uniquely unlucky to have acquired so many different , independent problems ? or is it more likely that there is just one thing going on ? " of course , having a diagnosis did n't make living with mast cell disease any easier
in 2012 , brynn duncan was admitted to the hospital 30 times
