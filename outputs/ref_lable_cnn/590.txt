the graffiti , written in a france chalk quarry and dating back almost 100 years , is plain and stark
they were world war i soldiers , four of almost 2,000 , whose writings have recently been found underneath battlefields near naours , france , about 120 miles north of paris
photographer gusky , who has been chronicling details of the site , describes the inscriptions -- and the underground city in which they were found -- as " breathtaking
" gusky , a national geographic photographer , has chronicled the area in a portfolio he calls " the hidden world of world war i
" the revelations of the underground city , which extends for miles in some directions , have come to light recently only because of a series of events , gusky said
the underground city actually dates back centuries but was sealed up in the 18th century
during world war i , soldiers would take refuge in the carved - out rooms and pathways
the land was privately owned for many years and generally off - limits to outsiders , said gusky , but it changed hands in 2013
for one thing , it 's dark , so observers generally have n't realized what 's in there until they 've gone exploring
they 're so elaborate in some places , there are maps carved into stone so the soldiers would n't get lost , " he said
for gusky , the graffiti provides a human connection with men who lived a century ago
