hawaii is poised to become the first state in the nation to prohibit the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products to anybody under age 21
the state 's legislature on friday passed a bill raising the minimum legal age -- currently 18 -- to buy tobacco or e-cigarettes
the bill will now go before gov. david ige , whose signature would make it law in hawaii as of january 1 , 2016
dozens of cities and towns , including new york , have already raised the minimum legal age for tobacco purchases to 21
if the minimum legal age for tobacco use was raised to 21 , the prevalence of smokers among today 's teens would decline by 12 % when they become adults , the report said
a 2014 survey of hawaii voters found that 71 % favored raising the legal age to 21 .
