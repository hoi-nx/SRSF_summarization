every year , denver teacher schwartz passes out post-it notes to her third grade students and asks them to complete the sentence , " i wish my teacher knew ... " many of the students she teaches at doull elementary just wish they had something in common with her , that she knew soccer or video games
" the assignment sprang from the kinds of conversations teachers have all the time , schwartz said : " what do our students need ? how can we best serve them ? " schwartz always gives her students the option to write their names on their notes or remain anonymous ; of sharing them only with her , or with the entire class
it surprises her how often students stand up and want to read their wishes out loud , like the shy student who shared , " i wish my teacher knew i 'm nervous all the time
" " they feel respected , they feel safe enough to share some of these more sensitive ones , " said schwartz , who has been teaching for three years
" kids can share what they feel comfortable with
" recently , schwartz began to post some students ' responses on twitter using the hashtag # iwishmyteacherknew
one student just wants more attention from the teacher
sometimes , they have a little fun : " i wish my teacher knew how to do a backflip
schwartz said she 's learned not to assume what her students wish
as her idea spread , many twitter users asked how they can help to support her students
