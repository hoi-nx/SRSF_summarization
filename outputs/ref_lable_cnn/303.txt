that inspired me to found food policy action and become politically active in a range of food issues , from hunger to factory farms
one of the biggest catalysts has been " meatrix , " a 2003 animation parody based on " the matrix " and produced by the grace , which crystallized the public health risks and environmental harms of factory farming
much more than a comical redux , it 's an important benchmark in the evolution of the sustainable food movement and compels us to look back at how far we 've come over the last decade -- and how far we still have to go
a decade ago , concepts like " sustainable farming , " " animal welfare " and " organic food " were considered fringe
while some consumers were beginning to take interest in where their meat and produce came from , public knowledge of sustainable food was limited
meanwhile , factory farms continued to reap large profits while producing subpar meat , polluting air and water resources , and damaging the public 's health
however , the quality of our food has been sacrificed at this supposed altar of necessity , as industrial farms reap enormous profits that they direct toward lobbying rather than improving the quality of food they produce
and it has paid off for them : factory farms often avoid penalties for the damage they cause to the environment and public health ; and they receive ridiculous subsidies from the america government that totaled $ 58.7 million in 2012 , according to the environmental working group
the original " meatrix " cartoon used pop culture references and family - friendly cartoons to educate consumers about the dangers of factory farming , compel them to make better food choices and spark a wave of online advocacy for better government oversight of big agriculture and meat companies
we need to ask members of congress to promote sustainable farming , not factory farms
as more consumers are educated , they have the power to take action and call on elected officials to support sustainable farmers , not factory farms
together , we can create a sustainable food system in america that is better for our environment and our health .
