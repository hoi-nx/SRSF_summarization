i was 27 at the time , and , like most young people i had stopped going to church
there is something about pope that 's reawakened my faith
and it 's not because he opened the floodgates to allow sin in the eyes of the church
recently i had the pleasure of meeting one of the pope 's newly appointed cardinals
his name is cardinal gerald lacroix
the 57 - year - old presides at the basilica cathedral of notre dame in quebec
one of my first questions : what is it about pope ? " every person is a mystery you know
... but what 's evident is this man is living with such freedom , such inner freedom
he 's in tune with the lord , " gerald lacroix told me
" those close to him say he 's up close to 4 in the morning to prepare his daily mass , which is at 7 in the morning on the weekdays
so that 's almost three hours of prayer , preparation and silence before the lord and the word of god
" perhaps that 's how the pope stays humble
all of this is appealing , but it 's more than that
in my mind , it 's his tone
when pope pope said , " if a person is gay and he searches for the lord and has good will , who am i to judge ? " the comment took me aback
homosexuality has long been a taboo subject for the vatican , yet pope pope uttered those welcoming words
gerald lacroix likened the pope 's approach to christ
if the pope does not judge , then who will tell us who is a sinner and who is not ? " i hear that sometimes , too , " gerald lacroix told me
" i think pope is conservative in the right way
you have to be conservative enough to come back to what is the foundation : that 's the gospel
you can not reproach pope of not living the gospel , or not preaching the truth of the gospel
i finally understood why pope reawakened my faith
but as gerald lacroix told me , christ walked with sinners until the very end
the cardinal 's last words to me : " i 'm trying to do my best on ( the ) local level -- to have an open ear to what the church and world are experiencing
i want people to see me , and the church , as an open heart to grow together
