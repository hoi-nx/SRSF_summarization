dongguan , china for a decade , the new south china mall -- the biggest shopping mall in the world -- has been an embarrassment for its owners and china
soon , it was classified by industry analysts as a " dead mall " and it became an unflattering symbol of china 's runaway speculation on real estate projects
the mall spans five million square feet of shopping area , making it the largest in the world in terms of leasable space -- more than twice the size of mall of america , the biggest shopping center in the united states
it was a walk through a ghost mall
visitors could be seen browsing for luxury sunglasses and designer jeans , dining at the korean , italian or china restaurants or enjoying the new entertainment facilities
" despite the signs of life , much of the mall is still vacant
ms shu , head of new south china mall 's marketing unit , told cnn that there are plans for a re-launch ceremony this spring , when all construction work will be completed and most shop and restaurant areas are leased to tenants
dutch retail chain spar , which has expanded its supermarket to two floors , explained on its website that it had re-launched last year during the mall 's " upgrading and retrofitting program
when i spoke to her , huang haiyan , a young china woman , was just two days away from opening a little cafÃ© called " miss & h " in one of the passage ways being renovated
" you must come , my coffee is the best in china ! " the area around the previously run - down arc de triomphe is now a tranquil roofed boulevard with small coffee shops where youngsters play cards and mothers sip lattes
today , it no longer feels like a walk through a ghost mall
economist jackson says the shift in focus towards restaurants and businesses that target china 's middle , rather than , upper class , is a smart move on behalf of the developers
" many large malls ( and residential construction ) in china ...
" what is needed to succeed is retail space that caters to ( the much larger ) bulk of middle - class china
" and , he says , other developments that were once labeled " ghost cities " have gone on to thrive
the town is also facing difficulties as manufacturing moves elsewhere in china or to southeast asia where wages are lower
china is also haunted by serious problems in its real - estate market , with over investment and large vacancy rates
what 's more , the mall 's latest re-launch is not its first
in 2007 , the mall changed name from " new south china mall " to " new south china mall , living city " and a revitalization plan was drawn up by current owners the founders group , a conglomerate set up by peking university , and its subsidiary pku founder
but the revamp failed and the mall remained empty
