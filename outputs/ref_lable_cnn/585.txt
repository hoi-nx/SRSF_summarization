beijing a day after the china government released five young feminists on bail , their families and supporters expressed mixed emotions on the unexpected development
wei tingting , wang man , zheng churan , li tingting and wu rongrong were freed from the haidian detention center on the outskirts of beijing late monday
" i 'm still speechless and do n't know how to react , " tweeted li tingting 's girlfriend suan xiaola to the couple 's friends upon hearing the news
" no tears , no ecstasy ... just wondering what we 're going to do next
" " i ca n't hide my happiness for the women but being released on bail is not the end of their ordeal , " echoed li tingting 's lawyer yan xin on china social media
" police had recommended last week that prosecutors press charges of " assembling a crowd to disturb public order , " which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison
the women are still considered suspects in an ongoing criminal investigation and may face charges in the future , wu rongrong 's lawyer liang told cnn
they will be under surveillance for a year with their movements and activities restricted , and police can summon them for questioning at any time , liang added
" under china 's household registration system , only li tingting is considered a beijing resident
" of course people will feel more afraid , " said wei tingting 's lawyer wang qiushi
