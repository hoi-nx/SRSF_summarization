sanaa , yemen as soon as the buses parked , the people scrambled onto the airport tarmac
only carry - on luggage was allowed on this air india plane
the passengers were mostly indian nationals , plus yemen and people from other countries who had been working in yemen 's capital , sanaa
they climbed the steps to the airliner and were greeted by the air india crew , all wearing pressed uniforms , the flight attendants fully made up
but some passengers were already fast asleep , exhausted by the push to get out of yemen , site of some of the most chaotic fighting in the mideast
this scene has been repeated in recent days as countries work to get their citizens out of sanaa during a small window when saudis planes are not bombing the city in an attempt to drive out the houthis , a shiite group that has taken over the capital
air india is especially active because so many indian nationals work in other nations
over the last few days , indian has evacuated some 2,500 people from yemen , said gen. vijay kumar singh , the indian deputy foreign minister who 's overseeing the evacuation
people are leaving behind much more than luggage
he loved living in yemen
" the houthis rebels control sanaa , including the airport
but the saudis are bombing the city and thus control air access in a way , so getting people out requires coordination
the saudis air force gave air india a four - hour window to go to and from sanaa and a specific travel route for a safe landing
at the airport , the landing strips and airport terminal were untouched by saudis bombs , but buildings on the outskirts of the airport and planes along the airstrip had been blown to bits
they did n't pay for the flight , though they had to purchase exit visas from the houthis
" now i can only pray for yemen and those we left behind , " thakur said .
