the nfl draft begins on april 30 , and while the tampa bay buccaneers are on the clock with the no. 1 overall pick , the clock is still ticking for another team -- the new england patriots -- as they await the results of the " deflategate " investigation , which has already lasted more than three months
in january , the nfl launched an investigation into the new england patriots to determine why 11 of the 12 game balls they provided for the afc championship game were underinflated
the league hired attorney ted wells -- who also investigated the miami dolphins bullying scandal -- to run the investigation
jeff pash , the nfl 's executive vice president and chief counsel , is assisting ted wells in the effort
but three months later , it 's still not clear when the investigation will be completed and when the findings will be announced
" we have not put a time frame on ted wells , " nfl commissioner goodell said march 25
" on monday , cnn reached out to ted wells and the nfl for an update on the investigation but has not heard back
on january 18 , the new england patriots beat the colts 45 - 7 to advance to the super bowl
they scored 28 of their points in the second half -- after game officials had pumped the balls back up to their regulation pressure -- so it 's unlikely that the ball pressure made much difference in the outcome of the game
in february , colts general manager grigson said at the nfl combine in indianapolis that prior to the afc championship game , his team notified the league of its concerns about the footballs
" we went into the game , we had some issues , but we are going to do what we can and that 's to participate with the league and the investigation and wait until the ted wells report comes out , " grigson said february 19
nfl rules state the referee " shall be the sole judge as to whether all balls offered for play comply with these specifications
the day after the afc championship game , new england patriots quarterback tom brady called the accusation of using deflated footballs " ridiculous
" quite the opposite , we feel like we follow the rules of the game to the letter in our preparations , in our procedures
" after arriving in arizona for super bowl xlix , new england patriots owner kraft said he expects the nfl to apologize if the investigation does not uncover any wrongdoing
" if the ted wells investigation is not able to definitely determine that our organization tampered with the air pressure in the footballs , i would expect and hope the league would apologize to our entire team and in particular coach belichick and tom brady for what they have had to endure this past week
in march , two other teams were punished by the nfl for different rules violations
according to the league , there was no evidence in the nfl 's review that browns ownership or any other team executives had knowledge of the prohibited conduct
the falcons acknowledged the use of prerecorded crowd noise , which is also a violation of nfl rules , during home games in the 2013 and into the 2014 season
as to what happens to the new england patriots , and when , it 's still anyone 's guess
