is americans a nation divided ? and has ohio found a better way to bridge those divisions ? it 's hard not to be concerned with these questions given the constant drumbeat of news about the issues that tear us apart as a nation : immigration , community and police relations , poverty , education and dozens of other crucial matters facing americans
in ohio , we have been able to drive meaningful change on many thorny issues that have held our state back in the past -- social services , criminal justice , economic competiveness , infrastructure -- and i 've enjoyed sharing our state 's winning formula with others in my travels
over the intervening years , ohio had lost its way and was hurting
i felt called to help after knowing that members of 350,000 ohio families had lost their jobs and were looking to get back on their feet
ohio is much stronger today
for example , we have gone from 89 cents in our rainy day fund and an $ 8 billion shortfall to now having one of the nation 's strongest state budgets and a nearly $ 2 billion surplus
we 've gone from losing 350,000 private - sector jobs to creating about 340,000 new ones
we 're seeing wages grow faster than the national average and ohio 's unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in more than a decade
getting ohio back on track was n't easy
and we need to make ohio 's success contagious
the leadership style that helped us turn around ohio is needed in washington , where americans 's $ 18 trillion debt ticks higher each day and our congressional leaders would struggle even to pass a resolution saluting mother 's day if it required their action
in ohio we 've implemented this winning strategy
