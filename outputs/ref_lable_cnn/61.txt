after two days of deliberation , jurors found tsarnaev guilty on all counts in the boston marathon bombing
what might be , however , is the answer to how we prevent this kind of violence from happening again
today , nearly 1 out of 4 people in the world are muslims
by 2050 , pew reports , that will be some 1 out of 3
by 2070 ? well , i 'll quote the all - caps headline reprinted by the drudge report : " muslims to outnumber christians ! " many american read such numbers and worry : will this mean more dzhokhar tsarnaevs ? but that 's only if you believe islam causes extremism , which many have argued
on the other hand , there are people who claim islam has nothing to do with terrorism
sure , the islamic faith forbids murder , but there 's a small but significant minority of muslims murdering people in terrible ways , and in islam 's name
understanding what leads young muslims like tsarnaev down a dangerous path requires we understand radicalization
to understand why , we have to take a stab at understanding what radicalizes muslims contrary to common belief , muslims are n't unusually predisposed to violence
islam , which has taken on an ugly life of its own , began at the intersection of politics , religion and religious identity
islam is about what you believe , but it 's also about being part of a community
and what happens when you are a member of a community and you see it under attack ? some muslims who have turned to violence have done so with good intentions ( the road to hell , after all )
consider : the tragedy of modern islam is in its endless sequence of tragedies
before my time , the brutal soviet invasion of afghanistan horrified many muslims
there was of course russia 's brutal war on the chechen people â tsarnaev shares his name with a recent chechen patriot -- and israeli 's ongoing occupation of the palestinian territories
there was serbia 's war on kosovo , another war in chechnya , the invasion of iraq , oppression in myanmar , civil strife in syria , the colonization of east turkestan , massacres of muslims in the central african republic , wars on a besieged gaza and west bank still under israeli rule
we need to show young muslims that extremism is doing the opposite of what it claimed to
a more engaged american muslims community , they explained , could use its resources to help people suffering all around the world
thanks to social media , a medium that the world 's burgeoning young muslims population is increasingly comfortable with , more muslims can and will see this , too
does islam need a reformation ? what in islam causes violence ? we would do a lot better if we accepted that muslims the world over have real grievances â dictatorships , corruption , foreign intervention , religious illiteracy , lack of economic opportunity -- and radicals exploit these
to fight extremism , we need to pose this question to young muslims : " do you want to help your brothers and sisters in faith ? " because those who claim to be defending us are making things so much worse
