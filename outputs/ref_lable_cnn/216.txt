the outlines of a nuclear deal with iran are in place
indeed , the reality is that president obama is giving up enormous leverage in his nuclear deal with iran -- and i worry we will lose it for good
but just as america and european sanctions were forcing iran to the nuclear crossroads , president obama has given tehran an easy exit
negotiated between iran and the america , russia , china , britain , france and germany , the framework concedes that iran can maintain " a mutually defined enrichment program , " operate thousands of centrifuges , and continue its research and development of nuclear technologies
meanwhile , the strictest restrictions on iran 's enrichment will expire in only 10 years , despite the president receiving a letter from 367 members of congress -- both democrats and republicans -- in which we insisted that " verifiable constraints on iran 's nuclear program must last for decades
the best predictor of its future behavior is its past behavior -- between 2004 and 2009 , the iran government built a huge centrifuge facility named fordo under a mountain deep in the iran desert
but we can not rely on such luck in the future , particularly when iran still has n't come clean about its history of secret weapons development and is still dodging basic questions from the iaea
let 's not forget the other things iran has been doing while its diplomats have been bargaining with the america and its partners
while iran was showing its friendly new face to the world , it has simultaneously been helping syrian dictator bashar al assad kill his own people , training and funding the terrorist group hezbollah , which aims to annihilate israel , and supporting the houthis , who started a civil war and overthrew the government in yemen -- one of america 's more reliable counterterrorism partners in the region
the framework we have before us keeps iran 's nuclear door well and truly open .
