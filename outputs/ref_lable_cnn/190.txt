these are fearful times on the highest mountain in the world
the devastating earthquake that hit nepal on saturday set off avalanches that left large numbers of climbers dead , missing , injured or trapped on everest
" we were sitting here in base camp , feeling the situation was getting better , " said climber pederson
" but those avalanches did n't appear to be on the same scale as those that came roaring down on the camp saturday
the base camp on the nepal side of everest is in a vulnerable spot , sitting in a valley surrounded by high himalayan peaks
and they came down -- they were large , they were massive avalanches , " said reiter , an american mountaineer at the base camp
people tried to flee as the onrushing wall of snow , ice and rocks took out large sections of the camp
" so many people were hit from behind , blown off the mountain , blown into rocks , hit by debris , tents were flying off
that included at least 17 people killed , dozens injured and many others missing , he said
they are one part of the enormous human toll in nepal and beyond from the catastrophic quake
the many unhurt people at the camp scrambled to help the injured , digging them out of the snow and turning dining tents into makeshift field hospitals
climbers worked in shifts through the night , nursing the injured as they waited for the weather conditions to improve to allow helicopters in
" a lot of them are in pretty tough shape , " reiter said of the injured
" pederson said that most of the injured people at the base camp had been airlifted out by sunday afternoon
but concerns were growing for the groups of climbers stuck farther up the 29,035 - foot ( 8,848 - meter ) mountain in camps 1 and 2
the avalanche was reported to have trapped them above the icefall area , an already treacherous part of the mountain that separates the base camp from camp 1
" they 'll have to put a new route in from base camp up through that icefall , " said jim whittaker , the first american to reach the summit of everest
alex gavan , a mountaineer at the base camp , said sunday on twitter that ropes and other gear were being helicoptered to the people trapped above the icefall
" practically , it 's impossible to get them off with helicopters , " pederson said
" there are so many people up there
" amid the struggle to save the living , details started to emerge about some of the dead
among them was dan fredinburg , an american executive at google who had been posting updates about his adventures in nepal on instagram and twitter
" eve girawong , a medic from new jersey who worked on the mountain , was also killed , according to her family and employer
" people at the base camp described a grim , chaotic situation after the avalanches saturday
reiter reported 17 ; nima namgyal , a doctor with an expedition at the base camp told cnn that he had seen 14 bodies so far
but an unknown number of people are still missing , buried beneath the snow and ice
the american climber has scaled all of the " seven summits , " the highest mountain on each of the seven continents , except everest
