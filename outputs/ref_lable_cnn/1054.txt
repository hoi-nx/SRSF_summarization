west of baghdad , iraqi essawi shouted on the phone as he described his situation
from his point of view , isis militants might be just hours away from taking the key iraqi city of ramadi
fierce fighting has engulfed ramadi , which lies only about 70 miles ( 113 kilometers ) west of baghdad and is the capital of anbar province , iraqi 's sunni heartland
essawi , the deputy head of the anbar provincial council , told cnn from inside the city wednesday that it 's unclear how much longer government troops can hold their front lines against the isis offensive
security was " collapsing rapidly in the city , " and he begged the iraqi government for reinforcements and the u.s. - led coalition against isis for air support
" this is what we warned baghdad of what 's going to happen , " essawi told cnn by phone , referring to the iraqi government at the capital
" where is baghdad ? where is al-abadi ? " his plea for help comes the day after iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi met with u.s. president barack obama in washington to seek more support for the fight against isis
according to the anbar official , at least 10 iraqi security forces were killed and more than 100 others were wounded in the fighting against isis on wednesday
the extremist group 's offensive in ramadi shows its resilience despite months of u.s. - led airstrikes and its recent defeat by iraqi forces in the northern city of tikrit
that leaves only areas to the west of ramadi in the hands of government forces , but those positions are under threat , essawi warned
those families said iraqi security and military forces withdrew from albu ghanem after a battle with isis , which took over the area quickly
the u.s. military has carried out multiple airstrikes against isis targets near ramadi in recent weeks
" the coalition has been supporting the fight in ramadi with airstrikes , and there have been seven airstrikes in ramadi since monday , " col. ed thomas , spokesman for joint chiefs chairman col. martin dempsey , said on wednesday
another u.s. military official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , told cnn that the fall of ramadi is " not imminent
" sizable parts of the city are under isis control or influence , but the area has been a target of a months - long offensive , that official said
