residents of central sanaa , the yemen capital , have learned the hard way that key strategic bombing targets are located in their neighborhoods : detonating ordnance has been shattering their windows and doors
and fighting has killed hundreds of people in less than two weeks
the saudi arabia - led coalition smashed parts of yemen 's defense ministry central command in the capital over the weekend , senior yemen officials said
under the rain of coalition bombs , the houthi , who are shiites in a majority sunni country , still control sanaa
but the airstrikes have hurt them and destroyed a lot of infrastructure
the electricity has gone out on 16 million yemen living in houthi - held areas , the yemen officials said
many fear they will lose access to clean water as well
yemen 's deposed president hadi heaped scorn on top of the airstrikes
he fired his former army chief of staff , khairan , on sunday
the firing had no practical effect , since khairan had switched sides weeks ago and is the houthi rebels ' acting defense minister
since the bombing campaign and intense fighting began just over a week ago , some 600 people are estimated to have been killed
the icrc has cried out for a humanitarian ceasefire to let aid in
" medical supplies need to be here yesterday , " said icrc spokeswoman feghali from sanaa
following the icrc 's call , on saturday the u.n. security council discussed the humanitarian situation at russia 's behest
yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since houthi rebels -- who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority sunni country -- forced hadi from power
the houthi put hadi under house arrest when they overtook sanaa in january
