the psychology of it is simple to understand : happy endings matter
even an unpleasant experience can lead to happy memories in hindsight if it ends well
let 's just say that when it comes to taxes for the average americans , " stuff " happens ( keeping the colonoscopy metaphor running ) , paycheck to tax - reduced paycheck
but recent statistics suggest that 8 out of 10 americans taxpayers get a refund when they file their taxes , and the average amount is close to $ 3000
what 's not to like ? the fact of the matter is there is plenty not to like when it comes to the americans tax system
the once dreaded tax day has become a happy spending spree for most americans
this state of short - term bliss follows from some deep trends in our tax laws
in brief , the americans income tax system is increasingly a wage tax , with limited taxes on capital ( what the rich have ) and limited deductions for most of us
for example , 3 out of 4 americans using a standard deduction get no break for their charitable contributions
filling out 1040s was part of what made the income tax so odious for the masses for such a long time -- who does n't remember our parents fretting over shoeboxes of receipts sometime in april , the cruelest month ? now as tax day approaches , we are flooded with advertisements about americans getting its billions back , without even having to pay to prepare the forms
service providers kindly offer to help out the masses of befuddled americans
of course , there are still those annoying matters of the deep unfairness of the tax laws , biased against modern families and wage earners , and in favor of the rich living off capital
