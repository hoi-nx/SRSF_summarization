when isis overran their villages near mosul in august 2014 , a small group of assyrians , a middle eastern minority with a history reaching back more than 4,000 years , picked up weapons and formed their own militia : dwekh nawsha -- " the sacrificers
" assyrians belong to the rapidly dwindling christian population of iraq -- recent estimates from capni , the largest christian relief organization in northern iraq put the number as low as 300,000 compared with 1.5 million 20 years ago -- and many among them see the fight with isis as a final battle for survival against the islamists
" ' ah , assyrians -- i 've read about them in the bible , ' is what many people say , " says marcus naissan , a 25 - year - old electrical technician and member of dwekh nawsha
" the exodus of christian from iraq started prior to isis -- and the civil war in the mid- 2000s took an especially heavy toll
and so far , the kurds have been taking heavy losses to defend christian and yezidi minorities against isis
here they relax , patrol the empty streets of the village and try to hinder isis suicide commandos from entering the near city of dohuk where unhcr says almost 100,000 refugees -- many of them christian -- have found a temporary place to stay
but baito , manager of the digital media presence of the group , shows me his direct messages on facebook -- dozens of ex-soldiers , diaspora assyrians or christian activists from all over the world contact him and offer monetary support or their own presence on the frontline
" right now , isis is focused on other fronts -- the yellow fields of the niniveh plains are quite safe for the mostly young fighters
