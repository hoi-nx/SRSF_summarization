chanting " no justice ! no peace ! " protesters rallied in baltimore late tuesday , the same day police released the names of the officers involved in the arrest of gray
gray died of a spinal injury sunday , exactly one week after he was taken into custody
among the crowd were members of gray 's family , including his mother
" make some noise for gray , " one man shouted into a megaphone
" we have the power and , of course , today shows we have the numbers
" mr. gray 's family deserves justice , and our community deserves an opportunity to heal , to get better , and to make sure that something like this does n't happen again , " she said
of the six officers , three were on bikes and initially approached gray , another made eye contact with gray , another officer joined in the arrest after it was initiated and one drove the police van , kowalczyk said
the autopsy has n't yielded many answers in gray 's death -- in fact , it 's prompted more questions -- but baltimore 's mayor pledged tuesday to find out how the 25 - year - old died after being arrested a week prior
" she 's angry , she said , and among the questions she wants answered are : why did police stop gray in the first place ? and why did arresting officers make what she called the mistake of not immediately requesting medical attention when gray asked for it ? i " he was dragged a bit , but then you see him using his legs to get into the van , so he was able - bodied when he was in the van , and we know that when he was finally taken out of the van , he was unresponsive , " she said
challenged on the " able - bodied " remark -- video shows gray 's legs hanging listlessly as officers carry him by his shoulders -- rawlings-blake said the medical examiner would make the final determination , but " we know he was fine getting into the van
the justice department has been watching developments in the gray case and is officially looking into whether a prosecutable civil rights violation occurred , a spokesperson said tuesday
in october , the justice department announced a collaborative reform initiative with the bpd to " include an assessment of policies , training and operations as they relate to use of force and interactions with citizens
" police brutality not on rise ; coverage is " when law enforcement misconduct is uncovered , the u.s. justice department has a variety of tools available to respond
responses to misconduct in law enforcement organizations fall along a continuum of intervention , with the specific response calibrated to address the particular circumstances of any given situation , " ronald davis , director of the justice department 's office of community oriented policing services , said in a statement at the time
the justice department began the data - gathering stage of the lengthy process in january and held its first public town hall last week at coppin state university
this is a state of emergency right now , " jones told justice department officials , according to cnn affiliate wbal
the mayor had asked the justice department to take a look at the police department , the baltimore sun reported , saying that her request came on the heels of the newspaper 's report that the city had paid almost $ 6 million in judgments and settlements in 102 police misconduct civil suits since 2011
according to documents obtained monday , the april 12 incident began when gray ran from police
while the court documents allege that one of the arresting officers , garrett miller , took gray into custody after finding a switchblade in his pocket , the gray family attorney called the allegation a " sideshow
" gray was carrying a " pocket knife of legal size , " attorney murphy said
police never saw the knife and chased gray only after he took off running , the attorney said
court documents said gray " fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence
" " the officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of ( gray 's ) front right pants pocket
" the mayor has questioned whether police should have pursued gray in the first place
gray was in perfect health until police chased and tackled him , murphy said
less than an hour later , he was on his way to a trauma clinic with a spinal injury , where he fell into a coma
the family has not seen the autopsy report yet , murphy said , and relatives are still waiting to take possession of gray 's body
police , according to their own timeline , spotted gray , gave chase , caught him , cuffed him and requested a paddy wagon in fewer than four minutes
the transport van left with gray about 11 minutes after that , police said , and another 30 minutes passed before " units request paramedics to the western district to transport the suspect to an area hospital
