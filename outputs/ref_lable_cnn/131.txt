the tulsa county reserve deputy who fatally shot a man instead of using his taser turned himself in to authorities tuesday at the tulsa county jail
video shows reserve deputy bates announcing he is going to deploy his taser after an undercover weapons sting on april 2 but then shooting eric in the back with a handgun
bates was charged with second - degree manslaughter monday
he surrendered tuesday morning , accompanied by his attorney , clark brewster , and immediately posted bail of $ 25,000
as he exited the jailhouse , bates paused in front of television cameras for a moment but did not speak
authorities say bates thought he pulled out his taser but " inadvertently " fired his gun
scott wood , another bates ' attorney , has said the shooting was an " excusable homicide
" investigators ' efforts to defend bates and the other deputies involved in the arrest have sparked a mounting chorus of criticism online
they 're also questioning why the 73 - year - old bates -- the ceo of an insurance company who volunteers as a certified reserve deputy -- was on the scene in such a sensitive and high - risk sting operation
smolen , an attorney representing the eric family , said bates paid big money to play a cop in his spare time
bates , who was a police officer for a year in the 1960s , had been a reserve deputy since 2008 , with 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience , according to the sheriff 's office
