german police overnight thwarted a terrorist plot by a radicalized couple , a plan they suspect involved bombing a bicycle race near frankfurt , a german terrorism researcher briefed by investigators told cnn on thursday
german prosecutors and police said that a man and a woman had been arrested in the frankfurt - area town of oberursel on suspicion of planning a boston - style attack , but the authorities did not explicitly reveal the target
the suspected target , according to flade , the terrorism researcher , was a race planned for friday
the race loops around eshborn and frankfurt on may day each year , attracting large crowds of spectators along the cycle route
earlier thursday , hemmes , a spokesman for the police of west hesse , told cnn that the house and car of two individuals in oberursel , in the forested hills west of frankfurt , had been searched
" we suspect that there was a salafist background , " said peter beuth , the interior minister for hesse , referring to ultra-fundamentalist interpretations of islam
" police investigations at this stage indicate that we have thwarted an islamist attack
" flade , a journalist at die welt and terrorism researcher who first broke the story of the police raids , told cnn that a german couple of turkey descent -- halil and senay d. -- were under arrest
he said the couple had ties to radical islamist circles in the frankfurt area
last week german police observed halil d. moving in and out of a small forest near where he was living
flade said that according to german police documents , german police first became aware of the couple at the end of march when they went to a garden center near frankfurt to purchase hydrogen peroxide
furthermore , after police thwarted a bomb plot by german extremists trained in the tribal areas of pakistan to kill u.s. servicemen in german in september 2007 with hydrogen peroxide - based bombs -- the so - called " sauerland " plot -- german law had required such stores to report to police significant purchases of hydrogen peroxide
according to flade , after the tipoff , german investigators began trying to figure out who the couple were
according to flade , german police established that the couple had recently traveled to spain , where they met with members of sharia4spain , a radical pro-jihadist group linked to al muhajiroun in the uk
there has only been one fatal terrorist attack in german since 9/11 -- the shooting death of two u.s. airmen outside frankfurt airport by a lone - wolf radicalized islamist in march 2011
