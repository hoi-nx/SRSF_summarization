thousands of syria and palestinian refugees trapped in the yarmouk refugee camp have suffered what can only be described as untold indignities
but while the story is in itself tragic , it is the individual lives at the heart of the camp that make the imperative for humanitarian action so compelling
i encountered two such individuals on my mission to damascus -- jihad and mohammad -- tiny , vulnerable infants who were taken from yarmouk in recent days , a place that was described last week by the united nations secretary-general ban ki - moon as " the deepest circle of hell
like the wider syria conflict , yarmouk has a human face ; the faces of young mohammad and young jihad
i want to introduce you to them in the hope that you , too , will understand why i am firmly convinced that turning away is not an option -- and why the international community must act in a concerted manner to respond to the many tragedies in syria
jihad ya'qoub , the youngest palestinian refugee to flee yarmouk , was born on march 30
mohammad was born in yarmouk on january 25 of this year
she hopes that if and when life returns to normal , she will be able to live once more with her husband and son in the family home in yarmouk
i will continue to press the case for humanitarian access to other children like them inside yarmouk , other civilians who need help where they are
pressure must be exerted on armed actors in yarmouk to this end
