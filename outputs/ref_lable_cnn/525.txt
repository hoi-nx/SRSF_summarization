garissa , kenyans days after a horrific al-shabaab attack on its soil , kenyans launched airstrikes targeting the terror group in somali , according to a military source , who insisted the strikes were not retribution for last week 's massacre at garissa university college that killed nearly 150 people
" the latest attack of al-shabaab bases by the kenyans military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011
it is customary for kenyans military sources not to give their names to media
two of the airstrikes hit al-shabaab training camps , according to a resident of the southwest somali town of bardera , almost 200 kilometers ( 125 miles ) from the kenyans border , and a local journalist who asked not to be named out of fear for his safety
the kenyans military began its bombing raids sunday afternoon , targeting the al-shabaab stronghold of godon dhawe , somali resident ibrahim mohammed said
godon dhawe is between bardera and the somali - kenyans border
al-shabaab , an al qaeda - linked militant group based in somali , has claimed responsibility for the university attack
also monday , a police source said kenyans authorities had intelligence beforehand that a university in garissa could be attacked , yet the country 's rapid response team was stuck in nairobi for hours after the massacre began , arranging for transport
it 's not clear exactly why the elite team was stuck in the kenyans capital , roughly 370 kilometers ( 230 miles ) west of the attack , but the police source in garissa told cnn that kenyans politicians and nairobi - based journalists arrived on the scene before the team did
manoah esipisu , a spokesman for kenyans 's president and deputy president , defended the response time , telling cnn there is always criticism regarding whether " you reacted as fast as you have or should n't have
" " with the benefit of hindsight you can always say things could have been done better , " he said , adding that kenyans authorities saved a lot of students and " got the job done
" foreign minister amina mohamed echoed those remarks in a monday interview with cnn , saying the response was sufficient and denying reports that it was the elite rapid response team alone that brought an end to the situation
she repeated esipisu 's assertion that dubbing the response slow is a reaction that comes only with the luxury of hindsight
" the kenyans government says mohamed mohamud is the mastermind of thursday 's terrorist attack on garissa university college
the country 's interior ministry singled out mohamud , a senior leader of al-shabaab , on twitter
mohamud is in charge of external operations against kenyans , the document says , and he is the regional commander within al-shabaab in charge of the middle juba region
" his position as one of al-shabaab 's top field commanders in southern somali has brought him into direct conflict with kenyans troops deployed as part of african union forces in the country
" this is a man who has a lot of grudges against the kenyans , " said hansen , an associate professor at oslo 's norwegian university of life sciences and author of " al-shabaab in somali : the history and ideology of a militant islamist group
it 's in kenyans 's north eastern province near somali
" inside garissa university college dorm 's scene of slaughter over the weekend , al-shabaab promised to bring about " another bloodbath " in kenyans
in 2013 , militants attacked nairobi 's upscale westgate mall
mohamud has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years , including december 's attack on a quarry in a kenyans village near the somali border , which killed at least 36 people
mohamud is kenyans and has three wives and three siblings , including two with links to al-shabaab , the document says
he 's from a clan , the ogaden , that has a heavy presence in kenyans and somali , hansen said
