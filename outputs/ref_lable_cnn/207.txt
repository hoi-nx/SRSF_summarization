others include luanda , dar es salaam and accra , which is predicted to nearly double its millionaire count from 800 in 2012 to 1,500 in 2020
these centers of affluence are spread from johannesburg in the south , through lagos in the west and nairobi in the east , to cairo in the north
this emerging class of africa 's new millionaires has been pushing the demand for luxury products across the continent , with sales of high - end products growing by a third between 2008 and 2013
however , they are no longer concentrated in southern africa , traditionally the wealthiest part of the continent
" africa is one of the fastest growing regions in terms of middle class , " says roberts , head of luxury at euromonitor , a market research provider
she warns that in spite of potential , the future of luxury in africa is dependent on reforms taking place : " it will rely on infrastructure and the operating environment such as security and how trading is done , " she says
when it comes to what they choose to splash their cash on , africa 's rich like to stick to well - known global labels that carry an automatic badge of status
she adds that this could be down to the fact that typical a luxury consumer in africa is much younger than those in mature markets such as europe , who tend to be in their 50s and 60s
" africa has all the foundations that are needed to create a real vibrant luxury industry , " says swaady martin leke , ivorian entrepreneur and founder of the johannesburg - based luxury tea brand yswara
" now is the time and you need to start positioning yourself , because africa is getting richer , that 's for sure , " she adds
