if you cared deeply about something , would you protest ? make a sign ? join a demonstration ? how long could you keep going for , in the face of indifference and inaction ? when more than 200 nigeria girls were kidnapped from their school a year ago by boko haram militants , millions of people around the world joined a social media campaign to plead for their safe return
charles alasholuyi was one of those people -- from celebrities to world leaders -- voicing their anger via # bringbackourgirls , one of the top twitter hashtags of 2014 , used in more than four million tweets
but as weeks turned into months , there was still no sign of the missing girls
the marketing professional and father - of - three has taken time nearly every single day since the girls went missing to hold up a sign featuring the # bringbackourgirls hashtag , have his colleague take his photo with it , and post it on cnn ireport
charles alasholuyi , a believer in the saying that " an injury done to one , is an injury done to all , " says he does this to help give the families of the girls a voice
# bringbackourgirls one year on : ' we should all feel shame ' charles alasholuyi adds messages on the signs like " over 200 stolen dreams , " " save the girls now " and " our government has a responsibility to protect us all
" over the past year , he has also worked with organizations who are holding the nigeria government accountable , demanding they do more to find the girls
malala 's letter to the abducted schoolgirls charles alasholuyi has also appealed to his government -- and other nations -- to fight the violence imposed by boko haram which has carried out multiple attacks and abductions since the kidnapping of the chibok girls
" why not cry out loud now for the whole world to come to our aid and make sure that the boko haram insurgency and their senseless abductions are nipped in the bud
charles alasholuyi says he believes in miracles and hopes his passion , commitment and determination to help the chibok girls through his daily photos will one day bring them home safely
