des moines , iowa o'malley told reporters in iowa on friday that inevitability -- a term bandied about regarding democrats presidential frontrunner hillary clinton -- is not unbreakable
o'malley had previously dropped the inevitability comment in a television interview last month
the former governor , who capped off his two - day trip to the first - in - the - nation caucus state with a speech to the polk county democrats in des moines , said that although clinton is an " eminently qualified candidate , " the democrats is full of " good leaders
in a march cnn / orc poll of national democrats , only 1 % picked o'malley
while he would n't say much about clinton , when asked about her candidacy , o'malley said , " if leaders believe that they have the experience and the framework to move our country forward , they should run
" o'malley , like other democrats , appears to refrain from directly attacking clinton
he has , however , openly teased a presidential run
