al-labani had hoped to bring his pregnant wife and 2 - year - daughter back to the u.s. from war - torn yemen
family members have identified him as a victim killed in mortar strike last week in the southern yemen city of aden
he is believed to be the first u.s. citizen killed in the current violence in yemen
early tuesday evening , the 45 - year - old al-labani was on his way back from mosque prayers when he was hit in the back by shrapnel from a mortar shell , his family said
violence quickly escalated in yemen soon afer al-labani arrived in february
" when he got ( to aden ) , after a few weeks he noticed things were starting to get bad and then the ( u.s. ) embassy closed , " his cousin alazzani told cnn
two days before al-labani was killed , he told his family the last option was to try to cross the border into oman and fly to egypt , but he never made it
" yemen has been rocked by violence and political turmoil for months
houthis rebels -- minority shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority sunni country -- forced yemen president hadi from power in january , placing him under house arrest and taking over sanaa , the country 's capital
now the violence is intensifying as saudi arabia and other arab nations target the rebels in yemen with airstrikes
yemen - u.s. are trapped in the conflict , but have n't gotten enough help from the u.s. government , the council on american-islamic relations told cnn sunday
billoo , a spokeswoman for the advocacy group , said it 's helping al-labani 's family and the families of other yemen - u.s.
responding to the criticism , the state department told cnn that there are no current plans to evacuate private u.s. citizens from yemen
" yemen - u.s. advocates think more could be done
