her feet were sore from wearing 4.5 - inch heels
still , they walked to boylston street to watch the runners
" we were so in love and happy together , " she told a federal jury wednesday
it was the second day the boston jury heard a procession of heartbreaking loss -- the survivors and families of those killed when twin bombs planted by the pair of brothers named dzhokhar tsarnaev exploded near the finish line
the jury must decide whether bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev , 21 , should live or die for what he has done
haslet-davis and adam , who had just returned from a tour in afghanistan with the air force , were steps away from the explosion near the forum
she recalled the force of the blast that killed three people and injured over 200 that april day in 2013
she knew right away it was a terrorist attack
screams and heavy smoke filled the air
she could n't hear her own screams
she thought she was dead
when her husband , who also was injured , lifted her leg , he too let out a scream
she said she thought he was in shock
she rolled over onto her stomach and crawled over broken glass , shredding her arms
she dragged herself to the forum
" i saw all five of my toes , but i saw a lot of blood , " she said
" i did n't see my ankle
" a ballroom dancer , haslet-davis ' left leg would later be amputated below the knee
" when someone removed adam 's shoe , an artery was spurting blood
" i do n't care if it 's illegal
she appeared to glare at dzhokhar tsarnaev , who did not look at her
earlier this week , prosecutors showed jurors an image of dzhokhar tsarnaev taken when he was in a holding cell
" on wednesday , dzhokhar tsarnaev 's lawyer , miriam conrad , sought to discredit the use of the image
in it , dzhokhar tsarnaev is seen looking into the camera touching his hair
gary olivera , a deputy u.s. marshal for 14 years , admitted that the camera was encased in a reflective surface and dzhokhar tsarnaev could have been using it as a mirror
also wednesday , jinyan zhao told the jury about her niece , lu , a " beautiful nerd " and graduate student at boston university who was killed in the bombing
zhao recalled what lu 's mother said to her : " ' no matter what i do n't want to believe it is her hand

the officer who found sean testified at trial that he had wounds to the temple , neck and head
sean would become the fourth victim of the dzhokhar tsarnaev brothers
" prosecution shows what it calls dzhokhar tsarnaev 's defiant message to u.s. prosecutors said the brothers killed sean because they wanted his gun
less than two weeks after tsarneav was found guilty on every count , the jury deciding his punishment is hearing about the lasting impact of his deeds
" there is sadness and a sense of loss
it was remarkable the amount of support we got from the community , but sean 's death hangs like a weight
saturday was the second anniversary of the bombing
since sean 's death , she 's very scared of anything that might happen to any of the other children
