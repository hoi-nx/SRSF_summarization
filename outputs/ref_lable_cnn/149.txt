are we alone in the cosmos ? or might there be intelligent life elsewhere ? last week , nasa scientists discussed in very concrete terms the steps to discovering life elsewhere in the universe over the next decade or two
since then , ground - based surveys and nasa 's kepler satellite have discovered nearly 2,000 confirmed " exoplanets , " and thousands more candidates await confirmation
life on earth developed in its oceans about a billion years after the planet formed
that suggests that rocky planets with liquid water on their surfaces might also have developed primitive forms of life
life as we know it is carbon - based and requires liquid water
extrapolating from discoveries to date , astronomers estimate there are perhaps 40 billion earth - like , habitable - zone planets in our milky way galaxy alone
of course , there is a difference between single - celled organisms -- which developed 3.8 billion years ago and remained the most sophisticated form of life for another billion years or so -- and mammals , which appeared about 200 million years ago
intelligent life that can communicate via radio waves with other intelligent life is less than 100 years old here on earth
so while planets that develop simple forms of life may be a dime a dozen , the number that have sentient beings with whom to converse -- even assuming they evolved as humans did , with ears and spoken language , or eyes and written language -- is likely to be tiny
if they all have histories like the earth 's , there might be 1,000 planets in the milky way that could support communicative beings
astronomers have found signatures of organic molecules , the building blocks of life , in the interstellar material that permeates the space between stars in our galaxy
nasa 's james webb space telescope , to be launched in 2018 , will look for evidence of life in the atmospheres of rocky , habitable exoplanets
nasa 's rovers have shown that mars was once much more habitable
life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own milky way galaxy , is practically inevitable
signs of life on exoplanets orbiting nearby stars will probably be discovered in the coming decades with advanced telescopes
