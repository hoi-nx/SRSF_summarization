boardwine 's path to fatherhood was unconventional , but virginia 's appeals court said tuesday he is legally entitled to be a part of his son 's life
boardwine 's friend , joyce bruce , had used his sperm and a turkey baster to get pregnant
she also thought that because they never had sex , she was entitled to be the boy 's sole parent , according to court documents
the court of appeals of virginia decided differently in weighing the commonwealth 's assisted conception statute and denying bruce 's appeal to deny boardwine visitation
it agreed with a circuit court ruling that method of insemination did n't come from medical technology
" the plain meaning of the term ' medical technology ' does not encompass a kitchen implement such as a turkey baster , " the appeals court wrote in its decision
bruce 's attorney , monica t. monday , said she would need to talk to her client before she can comment about whether they will file an appeal
boardwine initially was hesitant when bruce approached him in 2010 with the turkey baster idea , the court document says
they tried the turkey baster method a few times
joyce bruce said the visits were " strained
bruce argued that she used " noncoital reproductive technology " to get pregnant , and boardwine was technically a sperm donor
the appeals court affirmed the lower court 's ruling , saying the turkey baster does n't constitute reproductive technology
boardwine was awarded joint legal custody and visitation
