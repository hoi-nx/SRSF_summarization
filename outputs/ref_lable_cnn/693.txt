obock , djibouti amina ali qassim is sitting with her youngest grandchild on her lap , wiping away tears with her headscarf
she lay awake , she says , in a village mosque on the yemen island of birim , counting explosions as the baby cried
qassim and her family fled birim at first light , piling in with three other families
twenty - five of them squeezed into one boat setting sail through the bab al-mandab to djibouti
it 's now being crossed by desperate yemen in rickety fishing boats seeking refuge from the conflict threatening to engulf their country
qassim 's son mohamed describes the families ' journey across this part of the red sea as " a window into hell
" it took them five hours to cross into the north of djibouti , where the government is providing the refugees with temporary shelter in this unfinished orphanage here in obock
her two daughters are trapped back in yemen , in taiz
i ask her how many days it was after the saudi arabia aerial bombardment began that they left
" " may god please have mercy on yemen
