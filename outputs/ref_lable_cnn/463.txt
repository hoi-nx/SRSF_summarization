caller : " hello , i 'm trapped in this plane and i called my job , but i 'm in this plane
" operator : " you 're where ? " caller : " i 'm inside a plane and i feel like it 's up moving in the air
" the frantic 911 call came just as the alaska airlines flight had taken off from seattle-tacoma international airport on monday afternoon
the caller was a ramp agent who fell asleep in the plane 's cargo hold
the ramp agent who took the untimely nap and caused all the fuss is an employee of menzies , a contractor for alaska airlines that handles loading the luggage
he 'll no longer have the option of dozing aboard one of the airline 's planes
" the menzies employee has been permanently banned from working on alaska airlines planes , " said bobbie egan , a spokeswoman for the airline
other than being scared , the agent never was in any real danger
the cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled , the airline said
" because what if it 's someone who could have been a terrorist ? " the employee started work at 5 a.m. and his shift was scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m. , just before the flight departed
the agent was off the two days prior to the incident and had taken a lunch break and a break in the afternoon before making his way into the cargo hold , according to a source familiar with the investigation
the team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee 's cell phone , but did not receive an answer
