there was a larger message in the article about a purported gang rape that rolling stone retracted on sunday night -- a part of the story that was never disputed : the uva is under continuing investigation over how it handles sexual assault on campus
the school has never expelled a single student for sexual assault -- even when the student admitted to it
the virginia attorney general asked the law firm of o'melveny & myers to take a look at how the university historically handled allegations of sexual assault by its students
that includes how uva officials handled the allegations in the discredited rolling stone article by a student the magazine called " jackie , " especially since the school knew about the allegations for more than a year before the article came out
when a university dean arranged for her to talk to police about that alleged assault , she also told the story of the alleged 2012 incident
rolling stone 's story opened up a conversation about the topic , and then women began coming forward to talk about a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims
rolling stone had a line in its original story : " uva 's emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998 , 183 people have been expelled for honor - code violations such as cheating on exams
and yet paradoxically , not a single student at uva has ever been expelled for sexual assault
" after the article published , uva admitted this and instituted a zero - tolerance policy on sexual assault going forward -- although that policy was never defined , so it 's unclear what it means
when the story was deleted from rolling stone 's website , that was lost
" you lose a lot of other people 's voices who were in that article , " said sarah roderick , a survivor and uva student , " and a lot of good things that could have come about
along with the o'melveny & myers investigation , there 's also an open title ix investigation into uva by the u.s. department of education as a result of a civil suit
the attorney who filed the suit , james marsh , told cnn that uva medical staff lost or destroyed evidence from the alleged sexual assault victim he 's representing , making it impossible for her to move forward and get justice
rolling stone says their account would have been a red flag
ryan duffin , one of the trio , said he felt deceived by jackie , but he also pointed out that erdely 's mistake in fact - checking was about one single incident , and the fallout has caused a much bigger issue to be lost
" it might have been less dramatic , but it would have probably focused on some of the other uva students who shared much more common stories of acquaintance rape on campus
" before the report came out , abraham axler , the student body president , said that some good had come from the article because it forced uva to institute new policies and to open up a conversation on a topic that needed to be discussed nationwide
if you come forward and share your story , if you do n't have the date right , every detail down , you 'll think , ' i 'm going to be accused of being a liar
