the leader of yemen 's houthis rebels vowed not to back down on sunday as a top saudi military official claimed weeks of airstrikes had significantly weakened the shiite group
" our fighters will not evacuate from the main cities or the government institutions , " rebel leader abdul-malik al-houthi said in a televised address
" his comments came after more than three weeks of saudi - led coalition bombings aimed at pushing back the houthis , who surged into the capital of sanaa in january and ousted president hadi from power
hadi still claims he 's yemen 's legitimate leader and is working with the saudi and other allies to return to his country
" it 's the right of the yemen people to stand against the attacks in all possible means as long as the attacks continue , " al-houthi said sunday
" but there are signs of some fracturing among forces loyal to former yemen president ali abdullah saleh , many of whom have fought alongside the rebels
