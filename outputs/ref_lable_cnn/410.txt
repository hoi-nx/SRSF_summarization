countries around the world have launched massive aid operations to help victims of the nepalese earthquake , but distribution of aid faces challenges as nepalese is still trying to come to terms with the scale of the disaster
with over 4,400 dead , 8,000 injured and 8 million people across nepalese affected , numerous aid groups and at least 16 nations have rushed to send supplies and workers to the stricken country
but now the nepalese government and army who are leading the disaster response face another problem : how to effectively coordinate and organize the massive influx of humanitarian aid
nepalese relies on only one international airport to receive and deliver aid
relief organizations say the tarmac at tribhuvan international airport remains jam - packed with a large number of cargo planes
according to a u.n. situation report , main roads in kathmandu are open , but remote areas are largely inaccessible
" due to the mountainous geography , infrastructure damage , collapsed bridges and damaged roads , access to many of the affected areas is reported to be extremely limited , " read the report
the nepalese government has not been able to provide relief to all affected areas due to difficulties in transporting goods , a government official told cnn
just two days after the earthquake struck , nepalese authorities leading the response are still trying to fully understand which areas have been affected , how they are affected and what the priorities are
the operation to get aid to survivors in nepalese is still " very ad hoc " and it will be a few days before the distribution becomes organized because the government is still constrained by the scale of the disaster , says chapagain
