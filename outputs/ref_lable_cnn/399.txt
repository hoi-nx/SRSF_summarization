tokyo a second robotic probe sent into the crippled fukushima nuclear plant has captured images of a strange green glow
tepco ( tepco ) deployed the second remote - controlled robot last week after the first one broke down
the robot detected lower radiation levels and temperature than expected , an indicator that cooling systems were working effectively , according to a statement released by tepco
tepco decided to cut off the cable connected to the device on april 12 as it had already collected data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations , completing around two - thirds of the originally planned route
four years after the devastating nuclear crisis , the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter
tepco called the robotic probe an " unprecedented " experiment
