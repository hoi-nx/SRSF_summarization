in the hours after the funeral of gray , a community center and apartment complex that local leaders expected to serve as a catalyst for the rebuilding of a long blighted baltimore neighborhood went up in flames
the $ 16 million mary harvin transformation center was being built in a part of town where half the properties are vacant buildings or barren lots , where unemployment rates reach 25 % and poverty and despair is rampant
" disheartened and bewildered " was how the rev. hickman , pastor of baltimore 's southern baptist church , described feeling tuesday as he surveyed the still - smoldering ruins of the centerpiece of a community rebuilding effort led by his church and a coalition of other congregations
this can not be the legacy of baltimore
" the project was to include about 60 senior citizen apartments and a community center
the brick building burned to the ground in the riots that followed monday 's funeral for gray , who died mysteriously on april 19 , a week after baltimore police arrested him
anger over gray 's death may have spurred monday 's violence -- including buildings and cars set ablaze by rioters , looting and clashes with the police -- but members of baltimore 's clergy said it was also spurred by lasting issues with young african - americans in the city
" baltimore is a tinderbox
" high concentrations of poverty , underfunded and failing schools , neglected public housing projects and a lack of employment opportunities have been among the social issues long simmering below baltimore 's crumbling row houses , according to the local church leaders
" i think the reason that they burned it is exactly the reason why we needed it , " hickman said of the community center
" the rev. thomas , pastor of greater gethsemane missionary baptist church and member of the coalition , said parts of baltimore have not recovered from the 1968 riots that followed the assassination of the rev. martin luther king jr. those riots sped up the flight of city residents to the suburbs
hundreds of millions of dollars were poured into the revitalization of the historic inner harbor , a renaissance that eluded communities such as baltimore
" when i left downtown and came into baltimore , i see no national guard , no troopers , " he said
" hickman said the senior housing complex and community center was to open in november or december
the partner churches are expected to complete other projects offering affordable housing and mixed - use developments in baltimore
the center is being built by the woda group , a low - income housing developer
if we can rebuild iraq , we can rebuild baltimore
