a brutal raid on the garissa university college in kenyan has left nearly 150 people dead -- including students -- and dozens more wounded
the americans embassy in nairobi said al-shabaab militants have claimed responsibility
the harrowing attack comes just months after al-shabaab militants murdered non-muslim workers in a kenyan quarry
it has also recruited some americans , particularly from the somalia - americans community in minnesota
al-shabaab is a somalia group that the americans designated as a foreign terrorist organization in march 2008
the group has been blamed for attacks in somalia that have killed international aid workers , journalists , civilian leaders and african union peacekeepers
before admitting to the kenyan quarry attack , al-shabaab claimed responsibility for the july 2010 suicide bombings in kampala , uganda , that killed more than 70 people , including a americans citizen , who had gathered at different locations to watch the broadcast of the world cup final soccer match
in 2011 , a americans official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information said the group was estimated to control up to 1,000 fighters
in february 2012 , the group 's leader , ahmed abdi godane , and al-qaeda leader ayman al-zawahiri released a video announcing the alliance of the two organizations
al-shabaab 's predecessor was aiai ( aiai ) , which worked to create an islamist emirate in somalia
and that move inflamed al-shabaab , which then attacked ethiopian forces and gained control of parts of central and southern somalia , according to a 2011 case study by rob wise , who was then with the counterterrorism program at the center for strategic and international studies
in 2011 , after attacks on tourist destinations in northern kenyan blamed on al-shabaab , the kenyan government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern somalia
analysts say tension appears to have been growing within al-shabaab between somalia and foreign fighters , several hundred of whom are thought to have entered somalia in recent years to join the group
abu mansour al-amriki , a former al-shabaab fighter and prolific english - language propagandist for the group , said in a video posted online last year that he had had a fallout with al-shabaab " regarding matters of the sharia and matters of strategy " and feared for his life
al-amriki , whose real name is omar hammami , was reportedly killed in somalia by al-shabaab
al-shabaab has also " succeeded in recruiting a number of americans to fight in somalia , most of whom are from minnesota , " cnn national security analyst bergen wrote in a cnn column
in 2008 , the fbi launched operation rhino , " a serious effort to crack down on anyone traveling to somalia to support al-shabaab , " bergen wrote
the americans believed then that the group was coordinating with al-qaeda groups in yemen and might have been plotting attacks in the region and abroad
in 2011 , the u.n. declared a famine in the southern somalia regions of bakool and lower shabelle , and al-shabaab reversed an earlier pledge to allow aid agencies to provide food in famine - stricken areas
the americans has supported u.n. - backed african forces fighting al-shabaab and strengthened its counterterrorism efforts against the group
in january 2013 , french forces attempted to rescue a french intelligence commando held hostage in somalia by the group
in january 2013 , for the first time in more than two decades , the americans granted official recognition to the somalia government
