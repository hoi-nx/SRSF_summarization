the world 's seventh - largest economy is heading toward collapse
an economic powerhouse conservatively valued at $ 24 trillion , one that annually churns out the equivalent of $ 2.5 trillion , is under assault
however , i am not referring to one of the g8 economies , but to the " super economy " of the ocean
it 's one that for far too long has been ignored and taken for granted -- and it is going downhill fast
the health and wealth of the ocean are assessed in a wwf report released thursday , reviving the ocean economy
the report is the result of a hard economic analysis performed by the boston consulting group built on a foundation of the latest ocean science provided by the global change institute of the university of queensland
the fact is that the ocean feeds us , employs us , offers protection and plays a direct role in the lives and livelihoods of people throughout the world
a figure that may get lost in the headlines generated by our report is perhaps most telling : seventy percent of the ocean 's overall economic value relies on its continued health
that may seem like a far - off possibility to some , but it is a future foretold by the many details in this report
fortunately , our report identifies actions that would revive the ocean economy , three of which are critical this year
the economic case for why the ocean is so critical to livelihoods around the world is clear , and we will not be able to plead ignorance if we collectively preside over the collapse of the ocean economy
after all , it 's far better to avoid an economic collapse than be forced to scramble to pick up the pieces .
