working as a warden in rwanda 's volcanoes national park , home to the endangered mountain gorilla , edwin sabuhoro was determined to do whatever was necessary to protect the animals he was committed to defend -- including putting himself in harm 's way
following a series of incidents in 2004 where wildlife had been lost , edwin sabuhoro volunteered to infiltrate poachers on their own turf by disguising as a potential buyer for a baby gorilla
" i felt so bad that i had put these people in jail -- but i felt so good that i saved a baby gorilla , " recalls edwin sabuhoro , whose next move was to visit the jailed poachers , as well as their families , to apologize for tricking them and find the reasons behind their actions
" i thought of an idea of turning poachers to farmers , " says edwin sabuhoro , who took all of his savings -- $ 2,000 -- and divided it to poachers to rent land , buy seeds and start farming
while talking to tourists who came to visit the volcanoes , edwin sabuhoro came up with an idea to capitalize on their interest in the area , and provide work for former poachers
so we built a cultural village in 2006 -- before we finished , we had tourists visiting us
" in 2010 , we got $ 30,000 net income from the cultural village and put this back to different activities in the village level
" edwin sabuhoro , whose work with the cultural village has received international recognition , including a chance to briefly meet u.s. president barack obama as a young african leader , is now trying to take his idea further to other national parks across african where poaching is causing similar problems
