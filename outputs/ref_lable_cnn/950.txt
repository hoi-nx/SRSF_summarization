for more than four days , police say , a 21 - year - old quadriplegic with cerebral palsy was left lying in the woods of philadelphia 's cobbs creek park with only a blanket and a bible

low temperatures reached the mid- 30s during the week , and rain was reported in the area wednesday and thursday
the man is unable to communicate how he came to be in the park , but walker told reporters that the man 's mother , whom he did not identify for cnn , left him there monday morning
" sometime at 11 a.m. , the mother went to visit her boyfriend down in maryland , over in montgomery county , and we believe she placed the child into cobbs creeks park , " walker said at a news conference
walker told cnn the man was transported to presbyterian hospital , but cnn affiliates reported he was being treated at the children 's hospital of philadelphia
" officials at philadelphia 's school of the future , which the man attends , became concerned when he did n't show up for classes and tried to contact his mother but eventually reached an aunt , cnn affiliate wpvi reported
