but the seemingly innocuous genesis of police authority ( initial stop and question , pulling someone over for a traffic violation ) becomes significant because of the potential result ( deadly force )
in south carolina earlier this month , walter scott was the subject of a bench warrant for over $ 18,000 in unpaid child support , according to court records
that means that once he was stopped , he probably knew before the police officer that his own arrest was a foregone conclusion
but failure to pay child support is not a crime
it 's rightly a civil matter
skipping child support court should similarly not be a crime either
this means that a bench warrant for failing to appear in child support court is n't about catching criminals -- it 's bill collection , only with a collection agency bristling with lethal and other weapons , and acting under color of law
then there are cases like the walter scott case
still , given our justifiably dim view of deadbeat dads and child support court scofflaws , there is ultimately something dickensian in our remedy for enforcement
yes , parents who ca n't resolve noncustodial support can turn to the courts , but once the courts and law enforcement are involved , they do things their way
south carolina family courts enforce their child support orders through civil contempt proceedings
at the hearing , that parent may demonstrate that he is not in contempt by showing that , well , he would love to pay , but right now he 's just in the process of getting himself together -- and he actually has a job interview tomorrow or some variation of the well - established language of support shirkers
the bottom line is dad can try to demonstrate he 's too poor to pay his child 's support
if he fails to demonstrate this inability , the court may hold him in civil contempt and actually imprison him , unless and until he purges himself by making the required child support payments
if he ca n't , he 'll be stuck in jail until he does pay
and let 's face it : while it 's hard to drum up a lot of sympathy for deadbeat dads , jailing someone for their debt makes it a little difficult to , you guessed it , earn money to pay that debt
other warrants , like those for contempt of a support order , have nothing to do with crime
they 're bill collection and are essentially civil in nature
yet we 've foisted that duty on the police as an ersatz collection agency
when they run a driver 's name on a routine traffic stop and a deadbeat arrest warrant comes up , those same police who are armed with tasers and firearms are suddenly tasked with arresting a guy for failing to pay his bills
walter scott might have run because he knew the drill
the walter scott situation has highlighted some harsh truths
if we continue to arrest and jail deadbeat dads , we ca n't be surprised when an armed police officer uses excessive and deadly force to arrest them
while no one should be shot for failure to pay support , we 're also training police that a warrant is a warrant and an arrest is an arrest
note : an earlier version of this article did not make clear that states do make failure to pay child support a crime .
