a top aqap leader -- who a few years ago was in a united states detention facility -- was among five killed in an airstrike in yemen , the terror group said , showing the organization is vulnerable even as yemen appears close to civil war
ibrahim al-rubaish died monday night in what aqap 's media wing , al-malahem media , called a " crusader airstrike
a yemen defense ministry official and two yemen national security officials not authorized to speak on record confirmed that ibrahim al-rubaish had been killed , but could not specify how he died
al-rubaish was once held by the united states government at its detention facility in guantanamo , cuba
" the united states has been active in yemen , working closely with governments there to go after aqap leaders like al-rubaish
a prison break earlier this month freed 270 prisoners , including some senior aqap figures , according to a senior defense ministry official , and the united states pulled the last of its special operations forces out of yemen last month , which some say makes things easier for aqap
