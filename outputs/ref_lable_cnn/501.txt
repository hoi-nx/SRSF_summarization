real estate in london 's swankier suburbs can catch a buyers ' eye
" the africans who are coming into london now are africans who themselves have worked for their money , " explains nkontchou , a british - nigerians wealth manager based in london
" these investors are having a considerable impact on london 's property market and they mainly come from just six countries : nigerians , ghana , congo , gabon , cameroon and senegal
of these , nigerians are splashing out the most cash when it comes to bricks and mortar in the british capital -- typically spending between $ 22 and $ 37 million on securing a property , according to luxury property agents beauchamp estates
their research shows that over the past three years africans have spent over $ 900 million on luxury residential property in london
for evidence that london still attracts high - end buyers , look no further than the sale of a penthouse in mayfair which fetched $ 40 million earlier this year
educated thinking as well as an intelligent investment , many of the african buyers see these houses as a way of maintaining long standing cultural ties with london -- and it 's here they want to send their children to school
harrow , eton , cheltenham ladies college are all among the list of respected institutions that teach the offspring of wealthy africans
the nigerians embassy in london calculates that nigerians nationals now spend over $ 446 million per year on fees , tutoring and accommodation at british schools and university
" education usually means putting the children on an international stage , and that 's one reason why this is feeding into the demand for property in london
" virtually all the transactions are for end use , not rental investment , which indicates that the african buyer market in london has significant room for growth , " says gary hersham , director at beauchamp estates
