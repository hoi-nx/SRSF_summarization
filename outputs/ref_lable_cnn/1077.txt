atlanta " do you use toilet paper ? " that 's the question 26 - year - old shreeves receives most often
it 's not exactly a typical question , but shreeves , who lives in atlanta and is the site manager for the nonprofit keep atlanta beautiful , lives what some may consider an atypical lifestyle : she creates almost no waste
the small amount of waste shreeves does create goes straight into a 32 - ounce mason jar that sits three - quarters full right next to her kitchen sink
this is all the waste she has collected in nearly half a year
six month 's worth of garbage for shreeves is similar to what the average person generates in half a day
shreeves began her journey into zero - waste living two years ago
she had just quit her job working in television and decided to move to ecuador for a few months
she had read a blog post by a woman who lives a zero waste life in new york called the no trash project , and she was inspired
" the average person throws away a ton of trash a year , " shreeves said
" upon her return from ecuador , shreeves decided to take the lifestyle she started before she left to the next level
in april of last year , she officially began to live zero waste
in the first week , she filled up half the mason jar with paper towels after grabbing them to dry her hands , just out of habit
but she stayed strong and a year later she is at the point where she composts , makes her own shampoo , toothpaste and even uses reusable feminine products
shreeves packs her bags every day with a cup to drink out of , a metal tin and a reusable fork and knife , a cloth napkin and a couple canvas bags
