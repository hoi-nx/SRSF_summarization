bates , 73 , shot and killed a man while playing cops and robbers with real police
bates was a reserve deputy sheriff , which allowed him to " work full time jobs in the community and volunteer ... time in a myriad of events such as the special olympics and tulsa , " according to the tulsa county sheriff office 's website
he had taken part in more than 100 operations with the violent crimes task force , according to his lawyer
on april 2 , bates thought he was going to use a taser on harris , who deputies had just tackled after he sold an undercover officer a lugar pistol and then took off running
but bates was n't holding a taser
and despite what bates would later claim , harris was not running like a man with a gun
in fact , harris was running fast and his arms were pumping very much like a man who is not protecting a gun in his waistband
a tulsa police official said the agency has 130 reserve deputies , many of them wealthy people who make donations to the police
but i doubt there are many volunteer septuagenarians working with the violent crimes task force
how easy is it to confuse a gun for a taser ? police officers generally look with a skeptical eye toward volunteers
what is the point of background checks , psychological tests and the professional training police undergo if a person can donate a few grand and go out on patrol ? some people are a little too eager to be police officers
police departments hate cop impersonators ( it 's illegal , by the way ) and try and weed them during the hiring process
that said , there are good volunteer police officers
nyc , for example , has auxiliary police
auxiliary police and similar programs reinforce the notion that the police are the public and the public are the police
volunteers remind us all that policing is a noble public calling , and most police work does not have to be done by overly militarized swat officers
an auxiliary program also allows young recruits a way to dip their foot into the police world before taking the plunge
police departments should encourage more productive interactions between police and the public
