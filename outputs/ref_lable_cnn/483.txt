washington in a broad bipartisan vote , the senate on tuesday gave final approval to a medicare reform bill that includes a permanent solution to the " doc fix , " a method the government has used to ensure payments to medicare providers will keep up with inflation
the bill , which passed 92 to 8 , also includes a two - year extension of a popular children 's health insurance program
senate passage came just hours before cuts to physicians would have taken place since the last temporary " doc fix " had already expired
some conservative senators , including gop presidential candidate ted cruz of texas , balked at the more than $ 200 billion price of the bill and pushed an amendment to have the costs offset
" ted cruz voted against the bill , as did sen. marco rubio of florida , another gop running for president
gop presidential contender sen. rand paul of kentucky voted for the bill .
