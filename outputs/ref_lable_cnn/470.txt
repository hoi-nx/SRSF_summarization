you might call her a watchdog , because this boston area doberman really has a thing for timepieces
last thursday , courcelle came home from work to find 5 - year - old mocha -- a pure bred fawn - colored doberman pincher -- hovering over a pile of screws , metal pieces , three watch heads and some chewed leather straps
" my husband , who 's the most calm person that i know , called me up and said , ' i 'm not quite sure if i should panic , ' " said courcelle 's wife , parkinson
the 80 - pound doberman , whom her owners describe as " more goofy than scary , " had pulled down a basket of wrist wear from a shelf in their bedroom and eaten nearly all the contents
the couple took her to the mspca 's angell animal medical center , a 24 - hour emergency and specialty hospital , where a veterinarian performed a 3 - hour endoscopy to explore the contents of her belly
mocha was a repeat offender : just last summer , she got very sick and had to have emergency stomach surgery after a piece of plastic from an orange juice container perforated her intestine
she had 28 staples down her belly and 10 inches of intestine removed , parkinson said
fortunately this time , the jewelry remains were still in mocha 's belly and had not made their way into the digestive tract
the veterinarian removed " about a pound of leather straps and metal pieces and detritus " during the endoscopy , and let nature take its course for the remaining pieces , mspca spokesman halpin said
) and there was the 100 - pound bull mastiff who ate his owner 's brie that was set out for a party -- along with the cheese knife
she found one article about a newfoundland whose owner knew something was awry only when he heard an alarm go off from his dog 's belly
" we 've taken every imaginable thing that could fit down the gullet of a dog out with surgery , " halpin said
" i am convinced that he and mocha joined forces here to destroy all of his current watches in order to make room for apple 's new watch
