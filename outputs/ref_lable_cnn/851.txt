dubai it 's with some trepidation that i set off for the al marmoum camel race in dubai
as the only gulf national in the cnn team , i am expected to be familiar with camel racing , an ancient tradition in the region
but despite my attempts to dress in a kandora , a uae national dress , my modern outlook on life means i am a total outsider in this world
we take our place on the floor and slowly , the world of camel racing begins to open up to us
over arabic coffee and dates i am told that remote controlled robots have replaced children as camel jockeys -- this primal sport is moving with the times
and in addition to the honor and prestige , the camels are racing for thousands of dollars in prize money and fancy new cars for their owners
it 's surprising how spectacular camel racing can be
camel racing bears no relevance to the modernity embraced here , but this old - fashioned sport is equally as fascinating .
