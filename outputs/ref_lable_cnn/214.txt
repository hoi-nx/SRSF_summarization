it takes a village to raise a triathlete
since returning home from our kickoff weekend where we got to experience life as a full - time triathlete , i 've been juggling training life with a full - time job , hectic commute and time with friends and family
with my fit nation teammates spread far and wide , this was a solo effort
throw in a notorious chicago winter that refused to go gently into that good night , and i 'll admit it : i was not very diligent in getting all of my training done
" partner up , " the soletri sisters facebook status read
jae rockwell , the founder of my local women 's fitness groups , women run the world , posted this mantra to help us keep ourselves accountable
i 'm lucky to count a handful of both experienced and aspiring triathletes among my friends
annastasia w. , who 's training for her first ironman half - triathlon this summer , suggested a group brick workout at our local gym
she invited several other women , including complete newbies , through the soletri sisters facebook group and 10 of us met up on a cold chicago morning to swim for 15 minutes , bike for 30 minutes and run for 15 minutes
i traveled to little rock with three phenomenal " fitspirations " : samantha goga , natali villarruel and umber rahman -- who are members of an obstacle course race group called the midwest vikings
riding outside with the wind whipping your face , chasing your friends and breathing fresh air is exhilarating and i 'm looking forward to many more rides outdoors
there are so many others we keep me inspired , accountable and motivated
