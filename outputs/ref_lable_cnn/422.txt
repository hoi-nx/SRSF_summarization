schumer seems to be trying single - handedly this week to make everyone in american laugh
the comedian took a fake tumble on the red carpet tuesday night at the 2015 time 100 gala in new york -- right in front of fellow honorees kanye west and kim kardashian , who stepped around her as they moved down the line
" i saw them , and i asked my publicist , ' can i dive in front of them and act like i fell ? ' and she said , ' i ca n't stop you , ' " schumer told people
the prank came the same night the third season of schumer 's hit show , " inside amy schumer , " premiered on comedy central
