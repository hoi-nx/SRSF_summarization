boston tsarnaev 's bombs tore through their bodies : singeing flesh , shattering bones , shredding muscles and severing limbs
but on tuesday , jurors also began to hear about the holes his bombs left in the hearts of the survivors and the families of the dead
now that he has been found guilty on every count , the jury must decide whether boston marathon bomber tsarnaev , 21 , should live or die for what he has done
this is the victim impact part of the case , and the testimony was heartbreaking
four young people are gone , and grief fills the spaces they once occupied
a father with a shock of white hair cried for the daughter he called " princess
" " krystle was the light of my life
she was extremely smart , hardworking , beautiful , every father 's dream
i miss her a lot , " said campbell , dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter , a 29 - year - old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 boston marathon
she was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations , he said
" nobody fills that boot now
" others are expected to come and cry for lingzi lu , " a jolly soul , " assistant u.s. attorney pellegrini said , quoting the slain chinese grad student 's father
more tears will be shed for martin richard , who was 8 and looked just like his dad
and for sean collier , who was remembered at his memorial service by these words : " big heart , big smiles , big service
" " tsarnaev murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain , they had time to be scared and frightened , but they had no time to say good - bye , " pellegrini told the jury
" and that is the very essence of terror
" timeline of bombings , manhunt and aftermath to understand the toll tsarnaev 's bombs took , jurors must know the stories of his victims , the prosecutor said
" these young women , this young man and this little boy , all of them were loved and they loved in return , " pellegrini said
" before he murdered them in some of the cruelest ways imaginable , they were sons , they were daughters , they were grandchildren , they were brothers and they were sisters
" by contrast , jurors also were left with an indelible image of tsarnaev , taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held
he glares into the camera defiantly , his middle finger raised in a profane salute
" this is tsarnaev , unconcerned , unrepentant and unchanged , " pellegrini said
" tsarnaev saw the people he killed as " the enemy , " she said
he even called them that , " pellegrini added , referring to the message tsarnaev scrawled onto the sides of a boat where he hid from police after the bombings
" the people who were maimed by tsarnaev 's bombs are also testifying during the sentencing phase of the trial as prosecutors try to show the impact on victims of the attacks
the stories they told on the witness stand were even more gripping and horrific than the stories told during the guilt phase of tsarnaev 's trial
her bone - chilling cries could be heard on a video played in court -- the most graphic of many graphic images the jury has been shown
doctors were able to save reny 's leg , but others were n't so lucky
an amputation above the knee is the most difficult injury to recover from , jurors have learned at this trial
" it 's kind of hard to explain but i want to get it right for all of you to understand , " she told the jury
but she can never forget she 's a double amputee
" there 's always a level of discomfort
" the bottoms of my limbs , there 's this constant numb burning sensation
the only way i can describe it is it 's like you have the worst athlete 's foot in my life
