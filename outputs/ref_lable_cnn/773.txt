london time 's running out for uk to decide who they 'll back , as polling booths prepare to open across the country in an election that could change the political landscape
it 's been a blink - and - you - miss - it campaign , especially by americans standards , where candidates can take years to finesse their messages
the election could result in the handing of power from david cameron 's conservative government to the labour , led by miliband -- or a frenzy of wrangling from leaders as they attempt to forge alliances with smaller parties
very strict rules govern the reporting of uk elections , but until they kick in , here are some things you should know -- who are the candidates , what are the issues , who 's likely to win , why bacon sandwiches matter , what is " ukip " and , if the queen is n't in charge , what does she do ? the queen does n't run uk before we get on to the candidates , let 's dispel one common misconception
queen is officially uk 's head of state , but she 's only nominally in charge
visit : windsor castle , the queen 's country residence ( windsor and maidenhead ; +44 20 7766 7304 ) , royalcollection.org.uk / visit / windsorcastle so who are they voting for ? duh , they 're voting for a new prime minister
but in a uk parliamentary the vote is more indirectly aimed at appointing a new government
votes are tallied by constituencies -- political fiefdoms , really -- some of which date back centuries to when uk was run by barons , or maybe even elves -- each with a seat in parliament
of course , in reality , people may be swayed by party figureheads and see voting as a direct endorsement of their leadership , personality or -- true things -- their ability to eat bacon sandwiches and point at fish
that 's because uk 's elections are run on a " first - past - the - post " basis
it 's an analogy that highlights how similar uk politics is to horse racing , just with fewer doping scandals
here 's how it works : the elected parliament consists of 650 seats , each representing a different number of constituents -- anywhere between 21,000 and 110,000
the stunning islands of the outer hebrides , off the western coast of mainland scotland , are part of the uk 's smallest constituency by voter numbers

if that happens , eyes will be on the smaller parties including the scottish national party , the libdems and the upstart uk independence party
his party is n't expected to win many seats , but it could result in some unlikely romancing -- as the last vote did when the libdems hopped into bed with the conservatives , much to the anger of some supporters

high street , ascot , west berkshire , ascot.co.uk what are the issues ? there 's the future of uk 's cherished yet financially challenged national health service -- the free medicare system that 's undergone so many botched political procedures in recent years , it can barely bring itself to take off the bandages
ukip 's rise has spurred uncomfortable cross-party pledges to beef up controls to end decades of population - swelling immigration , a concern , apparently , among uk 's descendants of viking , norman , roman and anglo-saxon invaders
there 's the economy -- how to tackle uk 's budget deficit and foster financial recovery ( without relying on the cheap immigrant labor that the politicians want to stop entering

still , uk elections are n't without their entertainment -- most notably provided by fringe candidates
