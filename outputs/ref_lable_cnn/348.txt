mao 's " little red book , " a selection of the chairman 's quotations , was required reading during china 's cultural revolution in the 1960s and 70s
china has now updated the practice for the digital age -- launching a smartphone app starring its current leader , president xi jinping , and featuring his latest speeches , statements and publications
the app features the latest news about xi jinping and allows users to access the traditional texts that xi jinping quotes from
it 's unclear how many people have downloaded the app , which is available on apple 's app store
lam , a china politics scholar at the chinese university of hong kong told cnn the app forms part of xi jinping 's efforts to cultivate a very different image to his predecessors
xi jinping is keen to be portrayed as a strong leader and as a man of the people -- he 's been photographed eating dumplings and has appeared in three animated cartoons
his down - to - earth behavior has drawn a huge number of fans , who address him as " xi dada " -- xi jinping -- but it 's also aroused concern among some china analysts , who believe that xi jinping is using the state propaganda apparatus to build a cult of personality
" this is the 21st century 's little red book , " lam says
