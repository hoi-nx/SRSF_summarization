the 40 - year - old mother - of - four was at home when saturday 's deadly 7.8 - magnitude earthquake struck , bringing the 5 - story building down around her ground floor apartment

tanka maya sitoula , who talked to cnn through an interpreter , says she remained confident she would survive throughout her ordeal amid the rubble
" what did she do for 36 hours ? " i was just lying down , " she says
" tanka maya sitoula 's husband mahendra , a butcher , said he called out for help for hours after the quake , as he could hear her shouting in the rubble of the collapsed building
" it took 18 hours before the necessary help arrived , he said

inspector singh from india 's national disaster management authority was supervising search and rescue efforts at the sitoulas ' former home tuesday -- a bright pink building , pancaked into two levels , with an entire wall sheared off to reveal its purple interior
" singh said workers had recovered one body from the building , adding that he believed eight to 10 others remained trapped inside
