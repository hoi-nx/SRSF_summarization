the jailing of four blackwater security guards , eight years after they killed 17 iraq civilians in a shooting in baghdad , is a positive step for justice -- but is also not enough
the kind of horror represented by the blackwater case and others like it -- from abu ghraib to the massacre at haditha to cia waterboarding -- may be largely absent from public memory in the west these days , but it is being used by the islamic state in iraq and syria ( isis ) to support its sectarian narrative
in its propaganda , isis has been using abu ghraib and other cases of western abuse to legitimize its current actions in iraq as the latest episodes in over a decade of constant " sunnis resistance " to " u.s. aggression " and to " shiite betrayal " â as phrased in an isis publication from late 2014 titled " the revived caliphate , " which chronicles the rise of isis since 2003
as the iraq government today struggles to regain the support of sunnis in its fight against isis -- or even renew intra-sunni trust -- this invocation of u.s. transgressions by isis should be a sobering reminder of the importance of good governance in the pursuit of a solution to the unrest in iraq
the lack of accountability in the aftermath of the u.s. intervention in iraq not only paved the way for abuses like abu ghraib and blackwater , it also fuelled sectarian tension in the country -- and today isis is reaping the benefits
the u.s. poured money into iraq after the 2003 invasion , but it did not make this support contingent upon a fair distribution of power and resources by the iraq government
all those factors contributed to a rising sense of injustice that is now being conveniently packaged by isis to push its own version of iraq history
the publication first recounts attacks on abu ghraib at the height of the u.s. intervention by al qaeda in iraq ( aqi ) -- isis ' predecessor -- to free imprisoned " sunnis " who had been detained by the u.s.
in bridging a decade of history and in placing the shiite squarely in the category of " enemy , " isis is sending a strong message that its current fight in iraq is about reversing longstanding injustices against sunnis and restoring a sense of sunnis belonging under the umbrella of the " caliphate
" it is becoming clear that isis can not be defeated in iraq without buy - in from the country 's sunnis
