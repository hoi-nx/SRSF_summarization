when wardy , author of " redefining girly " and a passionate advocate for fighting gender stereotypes , heard from a frustrated mom on facebook , she knew she needed to do something
so she shared the mom 's story
in a blog post , wardy told how the mom , veronica of richland , washington , wanted to buy " big hero 6 " fabric to make pillows for her two children
the problem ? the fabric did n't include two of the heroes from the movie : the female characters , honey lemon and gogo
she got an answer from the company but it did n't help
girl empowerment ads like goldieblox : do they work ? a licensing manager for springs creative responded that the company has found that boys do n't want girl characters on their things
" what happened next shows that parents , aided by social media outrage , may have more leverage to combat gender stereotyping in our culture than they realize
and the " big hero 6 " example -- along with a similar recent one involving toms , the shoes retailer -- suggests that manufacturers may be finally getting it , too
first , the rest of the story about springs creative and the " big hero 6 " fabric : after sharing veronica 's story with her readers and her 6,700 twitter followers , wardy encouraged people to give springs creative a piece of their mind
women responded in droves , pointing out how black widow , the female character in the popular " avengers " superhero movie franchise , is often excluded from merchandise and how cereal boxes rarely include female characters
" the company said it would be talking with disney " immediately " about additional designs for " big hero 6 " that would incorporate all the characters
veronica said she was surprised the company responded so quickly
on the normally progressive retailer 's web landing page for kids were photos that some parents felt played into gender stereotypes
two hours later , wardy received a comment from toms on her facebook page , saying that the company completely agrees and that the wording has been changed to now say " new arrivals for kids
" " we 're really grateful whenever our community brings something like this to our attention , " said doug piwinski , senior vice president , global marketing and communications for toms
" so , here 's my question : are the two speedy responses from companies after women spoke out on social media more a sign that companies are truly getting it about gender stereotypes and girl and boy empowerment , or more a sign of the power of parents ? or are they a mixture of both ? how to super bowl # likeagirl wardy said there 's no doubt that companies are in business to protect their bottom line , and that will always be a motivator
but she said these back - to - back incidents show what can happen when parents make it clear they wo n't buy products from companies that sell gender stereotypes
' " veronica said it 's a sign of the power of parents becoming " more aware , reactive and using social media to make their voices heard by companies that market to children
" it is clear , from these two examples , that parents using their voices online and with their wallets can encourage companies to change
" if companies are n't paying attention by now , they most certainly should be
" pink , princess - y and sexy too soon do you think more companies are getting the message to include girl characters on merchandise ? share your thoughts with kelly wallace on twitter or cnn living on facebook .
