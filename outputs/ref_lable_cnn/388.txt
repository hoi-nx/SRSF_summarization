the stark video of a south carolina officer gunning down an apparently unarmed black man as he ran away with his back to police has prompted an equally fast - moving reaction by officials and the public alike
the video is being dissected frame by frame by authorities and media outlets , all in an effort to reconstruct what exactly happened between north charleston police officer michael slager , a five - year employee of that force , and scott , 50
michael slager , 33 , was charged tuesday with first - degree murder after firing eight shots at scott , killing him
michael slager is also now " terminated " from the force , north charleston mayor keith summey said wednesday
added police chief driggers on wednesday : " i watched the video , and i was sickened by what i saw and i have not watched it since
" both scott and michael slager had once served in the u.s. coast guard , with scott 's service occurring 1984 - 86 and michael slager 's 2003 - 09
here 's what we know of the fatal shooting : michael slager pulled scott over at 9:33 a.m. saturday for a broken taillight , according to authorities
rather , michael slager and scott are on a path or roadway in a parklike setting bordered partly by a chain - link fence
" the officer said that scott ran from the vehicle during the traffic stop , " scott family attorney l. stewart said
according to the police report , scott did not comply with the officer 's demands
scott 's brother , anthony scott , said his brother had trouble with child support and had an outstanding warrant against him , but that his sibling was n't prone to violence
the officer contended he used a taser stun gun on scott and that scott tried to take that weapon , authorities said
" the video shows scott running away , with his back to the officer
to anthony scott , the videotape shows his brother was " running for his life " away from the officer to escape more of the taser
as scott runs away , the officer pulls his service pistol and fires eight times , the video shows
as the shots are being fired , scott keeps running away from the officer , the video shows
later in the video , when the officer approaches scott 's body , he drops a dark object next to the man
it 's also unknown whether scott took the officer 's taser , or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body
immediately after scott was shot , according to the video , someone yells , " put your hands behind your back ! " scott , motionless and face - down on the ground , is handcuffed
it was michael slager who apparently called police dispatch
about 90 seconds after saying that scott " grabbed " his taser , the officer describes scott as unresponsive and having wounds to the chest , right thigh and buttocks , according to the transcript
anthony scott goes to the scene and finds it curious to see police tape around his brother 's vehicle and the officer 's vehicle
" he felt " a little bit of anger and happy at the same time , " the brother said
" i have two stepchildren and one on the way , " michael slager told a magistrate through video conferencing
the city of north charleston will continue to cover the insurance for the pregnancy of michael slager 's wife , the mayor said
an autopsy on scott , performed sunday , " revealed that mr. scott sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body and the manner of death was ruled ' homicide , ' " charleston county coroner rae h. wooten said wednesday
anthony scott said wednesday that his brother was " shot in the back four times
" the autopsy findings support family 's claims that the police used excessive use -- even if the video never existed , anthony scott said
anthony scott and family attorney stewart believe the object that officer michael slager relocated at the crime scene is the taser , they said
stewart also accused the officer of trying to plant evidence by moving the taser and placing it close to scott 's body
" he drops the taser , kills mr. scott , walks all the way back , picks something up off the ground from where he was taking the shots , comes back to the body , waits a second , drops it on the ground , and then pretends to be recovering it and putting it back on his holster , " stewart said , referring to the taser
neither officer michael slager or his attorney could be reached for comment wednesday
