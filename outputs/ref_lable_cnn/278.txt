when al-shabaab gunmen slaughtered 147 people at a college campus in garissa , kenyans , on thursday , it was the bloodiest blow islamist extremists have dealt to the country since the 1998 bombing of the u.s. embassy in nairobi
but it was also yet another pave stone in the long path of violence between kenyans and the somalia militants
to understand thursday 's attack , one must understand this : kenyans and al-shabaab are at war
although al qaeda was behind the 1998 attack that killed more than 200 people , al-shabaab has killed many more kenyans and is by far the country 's most persistent tormenter , according to a university of maryland study
" thus began a bloody vicious cycle , with al-shabaab retaliating on kenyans soil with ever more spectacular mass killings
kenyans special forces moved in at the campus located about 90 miles from somalia 's southern border
passengers on a bus in kenyans 's north were told to recite from the quran or die in november 2014
shortly after the bus carrying some 60 people departed mandera , near somalia 's border , al-shabaab gunmen stopped it in a hilly area and barged in
in its claim of responsibility , al-shabaab said the dead were christians , and their killing was retaliation mosque raids by kenyans
a day after the attack , kenyans security forces retaliated with an offensive across the border into somalia
last may , tour companies evacuated vacationers from kenyans after the uk and u.s. issued alerts that there was a high threat of attacks
before the garissa massacre , the westgate mall attack was the deepest wound al-shabaab had inflicted on kenyans
al-shabaab said the attack was retaliation for kenyans participation in africa union military operations in somalia
even with al-shabaab 's shooting in garissa , al qaeda 's bombing of the u.s. embassy in 1998 remains the single bloodiest islamist terror attack on kenyans soil
in short succession , bombs detonated at u.s. embassies in kenyans and tanzania back then
