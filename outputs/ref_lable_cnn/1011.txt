recently , a new york judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via facebook
what exactly is " service of process " ? serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle : if you are going to sue someone , you should at least let them know about it
sounds simple , right ? in theory it is
in practice , it turns out people do n't like being sued
it also turns out that , to many defendants , procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense
although every state is different , the law of service of process has evolved this way : the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person , and have some proof that the person was the defendant
so , the law had to develop methods of alternate service , but carefully balance a defendant 's right to have notice of a lawsuit , against a diligent plaintiff 's access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable
as reliable as the u.s. mail is , regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers
neither snow , nor rain , nor heat , nor gloom of night , will keep them from delivering those papers
this means that you take a hammer and nail , and nail the papers to the defendant 's front door
if you ca n't find a defendant , a judge might let you serve by publication
at first blush , the idea of service by facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him
when it comes to serving papers , however , " traditional " does n't necessarily mean " good
for those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a facebook announcement in a news feed , along with the photos of dinner or kittens , to be " liked " by all your gawking " friends , " we 're not quite there ... yet
where email is n't available , it is facebook private messaging , which should be as private as email
that 's the form of service authorized by the court here
