ravi opi , kavre district , nepal by the time you reach the outskirts of nepal 's capital , even the roads are showing signs of the sheer magnitude of this earthquake -- and the enormity of the task awaiting a country struggling to come to terms with devastation and tragedy
the main highway that heads east out of kathmandu shows massive cracks , the tarmac torn apart by the force of saturday 's huge tremor
one lane is bisected by gaping , half - meter ( 1.5 feet ) fissures
they 've been filled in with rubble and dirt , allowing passage for those desperate citizens to reach their families in outlying districts
it takes an age , though , picking our way along damaged roads to a small village community , ravi opi
it is only 30 kilometers ( 20 miles ) east of kathmandu but the journey takes almost two hours -- and the travel times likely to be compounded the farther out from the city people go
the community is off the main highway , down a dirt track that quickly finds itself winding through forested slopes and terraced fields
they farm corn here , and millet , and vegetables
compared to the capital , and the regions west of kathmandu and closer to the epicenter , the people here were relatively lucky
still , passing through villages it 's clear that damage has been suffered
in ravi opi a village official walks quickly by , telling us over his shoulder that 90 % of the houses are currently uninhabitable
some are still standing , but seem precarious and the residents are too scared of aftershocks to move back inside
patchy reports have filtered through of entire villages leveled by the quake or engulfed by landslides
we find her sitting as close as she can to the ruins of the house that she built with her late husband
she was transported by motorbike -- few here have motorized transportation ; most walk -- to a missionary hospital in a neighboring village , 12 kilometers ( 7.4 miles ) away from here
throughout this region , there have been small landslides and people have been industrious in clearing rubble from the roads
there is little sign of aid having made it out here
elsewhere in ravi opi , other unfortunate families count the cost of the disaster
" i started digging with my hands , " he says , still very much in shock , but remembering his frantic efforts among the remains of his damaged home
and all this a mere 90 minutes drive from the capital
these are the places where aid has yet to arrive , and where no one really knows the full extent of human loss or how many tragedies like the one at this home have unfolded
