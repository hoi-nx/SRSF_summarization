thinking about presidential candidates ? apparently , hormones are a major factor one should consider
according to one female businesswoman in texas , hillary clinton should n't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she 'll start an unnecessary war
when george w. bush waged an unnecessary war in iraq -- was his testosterone to blame ? as rios , the ceo of go ape marketing , sees it : " we 're built differently , we have different hormones
" " with the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war , " rios wrote in a facebook post
if rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the oval office , she 'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president
rios has taken a lot of flak for her " biblically " inspired beliefs , but she 's not the only one who 's arguing that a woman 's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern
time magazine declared hillary clinton the " perfect " age to be president , because she 's a postmenopausal woman who is " biologically primed " to lead
if discussions about a candidate 's hormones are what we have to look forward to , the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed
but underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration : the bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015 , a female candidate will be hard - pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias
but what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability , but a bias in how women and girls are viewed
in a compelling series about women and work , wharton school professor adam grant and facebook coo sheryl sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes
it 's overt : there are more men on corporate boards named john , robert , william or james than there are women on boards altogether
the bias is also covert : when students rate their favorite professors , they describe the men as " geniuses " and the women as " nice
hillary clinton might not be the perfect candidate , but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the white house a much steeper climb
it 's better for the bottom line ( companies with more women in leadership roles make more money )
" apparently rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about canadians : kim campbell became the country 's first female prime minister in 1993
