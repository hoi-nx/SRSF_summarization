emy afalava is a loyal american and decorated veteran
he was born in american samoans , a american territory since 1900
he has been subject to american law his whole life and thinks he should be a citizen
the 14th amendment declares that " all persons born ... in the american , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the american
" yet , emy afalava has been denied the right to vote because the federal government insists that he is no citizen
how can it be , in the 21st century , that american born on american soil are denied the rights of citizenship ? that injustice clouds the recent celebration of the 115th anniversary of the decision of american samoans to join the american
it is a wrong that emy afalava and other american samoans are now seeking to right in a federal lawsuit before the d.c. circuit
since the american was established , it adhered to the rule that those born on american lands were american citizens
" though they were american , they were not citizens under the constitution of the united states
because puerto ricans was american territory , she believed herself to be a american citizen
justice edward douglas white 's opinion stated that american sovereignty extended over them , but that their residents did not hold the same constitutional rights as other american
as isabel gonzalez 's lawyer told the court , declaring that residents of american 's island territories are not american citizens would mean adding to " precedents in our history of which we are least proud
today , emy afalava and his fellow american samoans are the last american still waiting to become citizens .
