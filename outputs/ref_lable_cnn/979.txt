the altamura man became the oldest neanderthals to have his dna extracted by researchers
scientists in southern italy have known about him since 1993 , when spelunkers spied his skull staring blankly back at them from its nook in the lamalunga cave , deep under the town of altamura
the cave explorers told researchers at the university of bari what they 'd found , according to their report published in march in the journal of human evolution and phys.org
altamura man 's intact skull and jumbled pile of bones made for a great specimen , but they were wedged into a panoply of stalactites and stony globules deposited by water dripping over them for tens of thousands of years
researchers decided not to rescue the bones for fear that trying to ease them out of the cave 's calcified grip would shatter them and ruin altamura man
analysis of the calcite has shown the bones to be 128,000 to 187,000 years old
