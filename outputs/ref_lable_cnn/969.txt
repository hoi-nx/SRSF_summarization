boston sending boston marathon bomber tsarnaev to prison for the rest of his life would bring years of punishment and rob him of martyrdom , jurors were told monday
" we have seen more pain and more horror and more grief in this courtroom than any of you would have thought possible , " attorney bruck said as tsarnaev 's defense team began what could be a two - week campaign to avoid the death penalty
" bruck told jurors there are only two punishments for them to choose from : death , or life in prison without any possibility of parole
" we are asking you to punish jahar by imprisoning him for the rest of his life
" the evidence will show that if you sentence jahar to a lifetime of thinking about what he did , you 'll both punish him and protect society
" tsarnaev , 21 , was convicted this month of all 30 counts against him ; 17 of those counts carry the death penalty for the murders of four -- krystle campbell , 29 ; lu , 23 ; richard , 8 ; and collier , 26
lead defense attorney judy clarke -- a nationally known death penalty opponent -- has acknowledged that tsarnaev and his brother , tamerlan , set off the bombs and shot mit campus cop collier
but she is expected to build a narrative showing her client as a puppet of his dominant older brother
only the 19 - year - old younger brother who helped is left
" bruck tried to use a photo prosecutors introduced last week -- showing tsarnaev raising his middle finger at a surveillance camera in his federal courthouse cell -- to make his point
" several members of tsarnaev 's family arrived in boston over the weekend , but the defense is closely guarding its witness list
court filings indicate that the defense plans to call expert witness janet vogelsang , a sociologist , to explain tsarnaev 's difficult upbringing as the overlooked child of immigrants -- displaced russian muslims whose american dream failed
under federal law , the jury 's decision must be unanimous
a deadlocked jury would result in an automatic life sentence for tsarnaev -- which means the defense only needs to convince one juror to spare his life
the boston globe reported over the weekend that fewer than 20 % of those polled in massachusetts favor the death penalty for tsarnaev
