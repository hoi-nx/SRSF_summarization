the solar impulse 2 , the experimental plane attempting to fly around the world without using a drop of fuel , has been grounded by the weather in china
their mission , which the pilots say is aimed at proving the power of renewable energy , and inspiring innovation , has been 12 years in the making
but so far , the solar impulse 2 has been spending a lot of time on the ground
the latest setback came when a thursday takeoff was canceled , because the cross winds in nanjing , the plane 's destination , were forecast to be too strong around its expected landing time
" our boss is the sun , " says solar impulse spokeswoman durgnat
" even with the delay , durgnat says , the plane technically is n't behind schedule
that 's because the team needs to wait until the end of the month for the northern hemisphere days to get longer , before the plane can venture across the pacific to hawaii
with more than 17,000 solar cells along the tops of its wings and fuselage , the solar impulse 2 stores up energy during the day , in order to power the motors that carry it through the night , typically at speeds no faster than a car on a highway
piccard spends a few hours of the afternoon in the cockpit , training to prepare for the solar impulse 's crossings over the pacific and atlantic ocean , what the team calls " the moment of truth
" the plane will then return to abu dhabi , where it had taken off
the team expects him back in china early next week
borschberg and piccard , who piloted an earlier version of the plane across the u.s. in 2013 , are no strangers to adventure
borschberg is a former fighter pilot , and piccard was part of the first team to circumnavigate the earth nonstop in a balloon in 1999 .
