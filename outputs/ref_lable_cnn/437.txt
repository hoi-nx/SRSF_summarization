the latest outbreak of bird flu -- the worst in the united states since the 1980s -- is not a likely threat to humans , reports the cdc
but as with any potential threat to human health , they are preparing for the worst just in case
the cdc and the usda held a press conference wednesday to talk about preparations
" the risk to humans is low , our food supply is safe , " said dr. clifford , the usda 's chief veterinary officer
" since mid-december , 16 states have seen bird flu turn up in commercial poultry , backyard chickens , and in flocks of wild and captive wild birds , according to the cdc
on monday , health leaders in iowa said more than 5 million hens would have to be euthanized after bird flu was detected at a commercial laying facility there
in the united states , some 3.5 million birds had already been euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease , according to the usda
the news is bad for the birds , but not for humans
the cdc considers the likelihood of bird to human transmission of the virus " low " according to dr. fry , a medical officer with the cdc national center for immunization and respiratory disease , influenza division , epidemiology and prevention branch
" that said , human infections have occurred " with another strain of the virus , found in africa and in asia , so the cdc can not rule out the possibility of human infection , fry said
the cdc said it is also monitoring at least 100 people who have worked with sick birds
the virus does not spread through people eating chickens or eggs
