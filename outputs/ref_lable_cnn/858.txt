fifteen buffalo were shot and killed on friday after a day on the loose in new york
the chase , which took farmers and police officers from five jurisdictions through forests and over the hudson river , ended with " snipers " from the animals ' farm gunning down the buffalo from the side of the road , according to lt. heffernan of the bethlehem police department
" heffernan described the hectic last moments of the chase : " they were setting up a perimeter around the animals in the secluded area , they got spooked and they charged through our guys , " heffernan said
the herd then stampeded across the interstate highway , breaking through a wire fence
four men from gem farms in schodack , new york , from where the buffalo escaped , were on the scene by a ravine in coeymans , new york , to kill the animals , a decision heffernan said was n't made lightly , but that was necessary
mesick , the 87 - year - old owner of the farm , sat in the car listening to the radio as his buffalo were shot
" twenty - two buffalo escaped from the farm on thursday -- half the farm 's stock -- including six that were shot thursday night in rensselaer county , mesick said
" the last buffalo were shot 20 miles from the farm , he said
the herd broke through three strands of high tensile barbed wire to escape the farm , and later swam across the hudson river , according to mesick , still surprised
