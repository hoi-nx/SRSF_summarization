if newly revised nypd training materials are approved by a federal judge , new cadets could be taking courses reminding them " not to engage in racial profiling
" the proposed training materials , overseen by appointed federal monitor zimroth , were submitted to manhattan federal court judge torres on monday for approval
they include directives to " not tell or tolerate ethnic , racial or sexist jokes " and to " not imitate the speech patterns " of others
" do not engage in racial profiling , " the training materials read
it diverts us from catching real criminals
" the training notes also instruct new cadets " not to use terms or words that devalue groups of people or stereotype them " and " not to imitate speech patterns of other racial , ethnic and class groups when communicating cross culturally " because " they appear disingenuous , artificial , and possibly racist
" the revised training notes , which include 140 pages of instruction and powerpoint slides , are a result of a 2013 federal ruling declaring the nypd 's " stop , question and frisk " practice unconstitutional
" the current training materials had not undergone a comprehensive review for some time ... [ and ] did not address some important subjects or account for some changes in nypd policies and law , " zimroth wrote in a cover letter to torres
" all parties agreed it was essential that the materials be rewritten for the current class to reflect current law and policy
" the nypd collaborated with zimroth 's team in crafting the final training materials
if approved , the new training materials will be integrated into the class curriculum for the current class of cadets
