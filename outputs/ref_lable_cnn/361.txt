mountaineers have returned to everest for this year 's climbing season , resuming the quest to summit the world 's highest peak after a deadly season last year
in 2014 , the nepalese climbing season ended after a piece of glacial ice fell , unleashing an avalanche that killed 16 nepalis who had just finished their morning prayers
the april 18 accident was the single deadliest incident to ever occur on everest
the deaths launched fierce debates about the enormous risks faced by the sherpas and the dangers of climbing everest
in order to reduce risks , the route through khumbu icefall , the notoriously treacherous path where the 16 were killed , has been changed to one that takes longer but is expected to be safer
" at this point in the season , climbing teams have not yet entered khumbu icefall , which is essentially a frozen river rapid with jagged pieces breaking off and moving
nepalese has issued 347 permits this year to climb everest , with 125 of them from the previously shortened season , according to the nepalese ministry of tourism
it 's a slight increase from the 334 who were given permission last year
the local nepalese committee that determines the path up everest announced in february that a different route had been selected
the climbers will now take a central route through the khumbu icefall , avoiding the area where the deaths occurred
" i think it will be an hour longer on the icefall , " said alan arnette , who is blogging from everest base camp this season
" but one company , alpenglow expeditions , said it would stop climbing from the nepalese side , where the climbers have to go through the icefall , in favor of the northern route from china
" according to the china tibet mountaineering association , 320 people have been registered to climb the northern route to everest this year
the china side of everest has typically been less popular than its nepalese counterpart , because of concerns of government closures
some everest observers say the northern route has harsher weather and more rocky terrain , but it also does n't have an icefall
the increasing popularity of the northern route has caused concern amongst nepalese companies that climbers will divert to the china side
" i can already see the shift with mountaineers i speak to , " said dawa steven sherpa , who is based in nepalese
" more people are going to go to tibet than nepalese
nepalese needs the tourism far more than china does
but he explained why he 's heading back to everest this year on his blog
