besieged and bombed by syria forces for more than two years , the desperate residents of this palestinian refugee camp near damascus awoke in early april to a new , even more terrifying reality -- isis militants seizing yarmouk after defeating several militia groups operating in the area
" an estimated 18,000 refugees are now trapped inside yarmouk , stuck between isis and syria regime forces in " the deepest circle of hell , " in the words of u.n. secretary-general ban ki - moon
yarmouk , the largest palestinian refugee camp in syria , was formed in 1957 to accommodate people fleeing the arab - israeli conflict
the camp , which sits just 6 miles from central damascus , has been engulfed in fighting between the syria government and armed groups since december 2012
activists and residents in yarmouk tell cnn that as many as 5,000 people have tried to flee their homes since isis stormed the camp , but have no place to go
as the fighting raged in yarmouk , the director of the jafra foundation -- the only aid group that has been able to get into the camp -- painted a grim portrait of the conditions on the ground since isis arrived
the head of the plhr in syria ( plhr ) , who fled the camp and syria in october 2012 , said the people of yarmouk were in dire need of help
but now , as terror closes in on yarmouk from all sides , residents have two choices -- to attempt to flee what was their place of refuge , or to stay inside what the u.n. says now resembles a camp of death
" now i am scared of two things -- i am scared of ( isis ) and the regime , " the yarmouk resident told cnn
