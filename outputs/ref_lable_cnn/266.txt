in the beginning ... there was the bible , and it was a very good book
but this catholic had n't read it -- at least , not from cover to cover
my name is laura bernardini and i 'm a director of coverage at cnn.com , which means i manage our newsgathering and newsroom in washington
i 'm also a lifelong catholic
i have never read the bible from genesis to revelation
this from someone who jokingly refers to herself as the highest - ranking catholic in the bureau
my excuse always has been that catholics have their bible passages read to them at mass every sunday
still , it made me wonder : why i had not read the good book cover to cover ? i took a scriptures class in 9th grade of my catholic high school , but we moved through that year with only selected passages to journal about
in that newsroom conversation this week , daniel burke , the religion editor at cnn.com , suggested i read the bible each day for a year and chronicle it weekly for belief
one catholic friend offered to join me , suggesting i get a blank journal to help me take notes
another friend 's daughter is making her first holy communion in may , and has also offered to connect us because her class is reading the bible in school
will i make it all the way to revelation come next spring ? i start on easter sunday
