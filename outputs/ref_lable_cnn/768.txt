if there 's one thing that hurts more than the saddle sores from cycling around china for 460 days , it 's having the bike you did it on stolen just days before completing your epic trip
that 's what happened to cyclist wang as he neared the end of a two - wheel trek that covered thousands of miles through every major province in the vast country , according to local media
arriving in the southern city of shenzhen , in southern guandong province , wang locked up his trusty mountain bike , loaded with panniers , to check out electronics markets in the city 's huaqiangbei area
despite police initially saying odds were stacked against the bike ever being recovered , shenzhen 's finest managed to track it down and return it
the smn reported that police apprehended an alleged criminal and sent wang a photo of a bike they recovered
now , with 29,200 kilometers under his tires , wang can continue the final few days of his epic journey
. wang , a recent university graduate , who embarked on his trip with a budget of little more than $ 100 , had earlier turned down offers from across china to help him get a new bike , vowing to walk if he could n't be reunited with his " old lover
