tehran , iran the basij is a militia made up of fighters loyal to iran 's religious leaders ; their mission is to protect the country 's islamic order
but iran 's elite revolutionary guard 's quds force , led by general suleimani , is already training , advising and supporting iraqi shia militias in their fight against isis
iran , militias ' involvement in isis fight a mixed blessing iranian officials , who believe their strategy is making a difference in the fight against isis , say they would like better cooperation with the u.s. , but point out that the level of trust simply is n't there
" at the moment , we consider the u.s. to be a threat to us because its policies and actions are threatening to us , " said general ahmad reza pourdastan , commander of iran 's ground forces
" and the feeling is mutual : the u.s. , which is leading the air campaign against isis in iraq , has denied any direct coordination with iran
iran will do what it takes to fight isis iranian believe air strikes against isis are not effective , and feel that the u.s. and its allies are not trying seriously enough to defeat the group
" if they want to destroy isis , it is possible for them to achieve that , " said major - general hassan firouzabadi , iran 's chief of general staff
" we hope that one day , because of their national interests and the will of their nations , the u.s. and the uk will decide to really fight isis
" in isis , iran and the u.s. share a common enemy , but -- for now at least -- no apparent common iran - saudi proxy war erupt ?
