you may know mindy kaling from fox 's cult hit comedy " the mindy lahiri , " in which she plays mindy lahiri , a perky , quirky ob / gyn juggling her career and love life in new york
recently , however , mindy kaling 's brother vijay chokalingam unveiled a project of his own , and while it has been getting a lot of attention , it has n't generated quite as many laughs â either from observers or from his famous sibling , who told him it brought " shame upon their family
" you see , vijay chokalingam revealed that , as an undergraduate at the university of chicago , he engaged in a daring ( his view ) or ridiculous and offensive ( pretty much everyone else ) scam : he applied to medical school claiming to be african - american
vijay chokalingam had spent his college years as a " hard - partying frat boy , " and achieved a less than stunning 3.1 gpa
upon facing graduation and exploring his med school options , he realized that fellow indian-americans with his grades were getting turned down from the universities of his choice â but that " black , hispanic , and native american applicants with my grades and test scores were much more likely to gain acceptance
to accomplish this goal , vijay chokalingam shaved his head of its naturally wavy black locks , trimmed his " long indian - americans eyelashes , " checked " black " under the optional race / ethnicity declaration and submitted his application to 14 schools under his childhood nickname " jojo
" what 's truly curious is that even if you agree with vijay chokalingam that affirmative action is merely a form of " systematic racism , " when all is said and done , it offers very little evidence of the " privilege " that he claims is accorded to black , hispanic and native american candidates
yet even while representing himself as black , vijay chokalingam received only a single admission offer , to st. louis university 's school of medicine , which falls somewhere between 57th and 67th in national rankings
which really cuts to the heart of what 's so sad about vijay chokalingam 's racial farce
like others who 've recently been exposed for falsely claiming racial identities â including putative presidential candidate jeb bush , who registered himself as " hispanic " on a 2009 voter form , and massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren , who was excoriated during her campaign for having claimed native american ancestry in the past â vijay chokalingam wanted to claim the fruits of racial affiliation without having to carry black people 's burden
because what 's most ironic about vijay chokalingam 's decision to ride on his sister 's coattails in telling his story : while asians are well represented in medicine , our numbers are vanishingly low in the entertainment and media world , and until the recent breakthrough of modern pioneers like mindy kaling , it was impossible to imagine film and television that included our faces , voices and stories
mindy kaling 's immense talent and charisma made her a star
