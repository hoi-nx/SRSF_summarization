landing them upright on a platform floating in the ocean ? well , that 's never been done before
spacex , the private space exploration company founded by billionaire musk , hopes to give it a try
but weather forced it to scrub monday 's plan to launch
spacex said on twitter that tuesday at 4:10 p.m. et will be the next opportunity for the company to launch a two - stage falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called dragon on a flight from cape canaveral , florida , to the international space station
after the launch , spacex will try to guide the bottom stage of the rocket upright onto a platform , or what it calls an autonomous spaceport drone ship , in the atlantic ocean off florida
" spacex tried to land a falcon 9 on the drone ship in january , but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded
and if the landing does n't work ? spacex says it will keep trying and , after it masters landing at sea , hopes to someday land rockets on the ground
this is the sixth spacex mission to the international space station
