a door bearing a graffiti drawing by british artist banksy was seized by police in gaza on thursday after a dispute over its sale , a gaza police official told cnn on thursday
the owner of the door , rabea darduna , filed a complaint with a gaza court stating that , without realizing its value , he sold the door for just $ 175 u.s. the iron door will remain in the possession of the khan younis police in southern gaza until a court hearing at a date yet to be determined
when rabea darduna 's gaza home was destroyed in last summer 's war , he says he felt he was left with nothing
he sold the door to bring in some money to care for his six children , not realizing the prize he had
" we sold it as we would sell an iron door , " rabea darduna said monday , " for $ 175
" rabea darduna says he was duped into believing the door was a normal door when it was really a canvas for banksy , one of the world 's most famous graffiti artists , who had painted a greek goddess with her head in her hand
" banksy 's graffiti in gaza has become an attraction after he visited in february and painted a series of political messages
some of banksy 's art has sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars
alshanbari says he 's had offers for banksy 's portrait of a cat playing with a ball of mangled metal , but he refuses to sell
in text accompanying the image on his official website , banksy wrote : " a local man came up and said ' please -- what does this mean ? ' i explained i wanted to highlight the destruction in gaza by posting photos on my website -- but on the internet people only look at pictures of kittens
