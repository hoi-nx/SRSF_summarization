two tsa screeners have been fired after conspiring to grope attractive men at denver international airport , denver police said
here 's how police say the scheme worked : when the male tsa officer noticed a man he found attractive , he would alert a female tsa officer
the female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through
and that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area , prompting the male tsa officer to pat down the passenger , police said , citing a tsa investigation
but during the patdown , the male tsa officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger 's front groin area and buttocks , which violates tsa policy
the agency launched an investigation , and investigator higgins monitored the two tsa officers in question , denver police said in a report
he interviewed the female tsa officer , who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times , police said
