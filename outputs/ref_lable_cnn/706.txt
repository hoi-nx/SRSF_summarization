china 's cybercensors have long used a " great firewall " to block its citizens from reading critical articles from western news websites or consuming other content it disapproves of
but it 's no longer enough for them , says a study published friday
they 've developed a new it weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders , including in the united states
the study 's authors have named it the " great cannon , " and it operates in plain sight
going on the attack so visibly and handily within another country 's borders will probably draw international ire , the study 's authors say , and beijing may have counted on that
" this is a powerful attack capability , and we are curious about the risk and benefit analysis that led the china government to reveal it with this highly visible denial of service attack , " said researcher scott-railton
the reason china censors are taking that risk : free - speech cyberactivists have found ways to get around the great firewall and give china readers greater access to the west 's free press
" it blasts targeted web servers with massive distributed denial of service attacks , and it uses the web browsers of unsuspecting web surfers to do it
the cannon wrecked two online services with ddos attacks in march , say the researchers from the university of toronto 's citizen lab , the international computer science institute , the university of california-berkeley and princeton university
" a modest technical change could turn the great cannon into a malware delivery device for infecting the computer of a target individual anywhere in the world who visits a china server , " scott-railton said
this might include all emails headed in and out of china , he said
" one of the great cannon 's targets that the researchers studied was an obvious one -- greatfire.org , run by china expats bent on fighting beijing 's censorship
they monitor china citizens ' access to international news sites such as german news service deutsche welle or the tibet post
critical articles from the times are a particular fly in the ointment for beijing , and china has turned away at least three of the paper 's reporters in short succession , according to a united states congressional commission on china
both services suspected china was behind their attacks and used the great firewall to carry it out , according to statements and media reports
if it sees requests going out into the world for content it does n't want citizens to see , the researchers say , it discreetly injects forged messages to the foreign server and the china user 's computer to make them stop communicating
users going to baidu , one of china 's most prolific web services and most successful internet companies , can become unknowing proxy warriors against the great cannon 's targets , the study says
in the overwhelming number of cases , when traffic came into china from the outside world , the great cannon let it through to baidu 's advertising servers
but government cybercensors ' monitoring of traffic to and from baidu 's servers could hurt its reputation as a major player in international commerce
" deployment of the gc ( great cannon ) may also reflect a desire to counter what the china government perceives as united states hegemony in cyberspace , " the researchers write
