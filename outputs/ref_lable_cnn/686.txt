players rose and players fell away on moving day at the 2015 masters
mcilroy went out in 32 and briefly raised the crowd 's hopes that he had a sniff of completing an improbable grand slam on sunday night
but he dropped two shots late on in the round to finish six under par. woods comeback ? a rejuvenated woods showed touches of his old class mixed with the ragged unpredictability that has marked his new game to finish six under too
" it could have been a super low today , " a disappointed woods said after his round
in the end , there was lots of moving , but no one could move quick enough or far enough to trouble spieth
infallible the 21 year old has been nothing short of a sensation at augusta
his infallible first two rounds gave the 21 year old from dallas , texas a five shot lead going in to the third round
spieth 's 15 birdies are just 10 away from mickelson 's masters mark set in 2001
he could also break woods 270 set in 1997
as it happened , spieth played a steady , almost conservative round
echos of 1996 ? when reminded of some of the great augusta comebacks , including nick faldo 's 11 shot swing in 1996 , woods still believes anything is possible
yet , for all the movement of mickelson , woods , rose and mcilroy , they made just a one shot dent into spieth 's second round lead
