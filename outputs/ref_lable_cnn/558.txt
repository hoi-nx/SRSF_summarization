for five decades , bikram choudhury built an empire
the signature " hot yoga " bearing his name drew throngs of devotees , spawning studios teaching the practice all over the world
but now , the bikram brand is in jeopardy , with some yoga studios dropping his name after the guru was accused of rape or sexual assault by six of his former students
responding to the allegations for the first time in an exclusive interview with cnn , bikram choudhury said he wanted to set the record straight
" bikram choudhury repeatedly denied sexually assaulting anyone , saying he would never resort to physical aggression to have sex because he has so many offers
" so if i really wanted to involve the women , i do n't have to assault the women
" he said he feels sorry for his accusers , claiming they 've been manipulated by lawyers to lie
it 's not them saying that , " he said
" but bikram choudhury 's accusers say he 's the one who 's been lying
" this stuff that he 's teaching is really good stuff , but he 's hurting people and hiding behind this good stuff so people do n't believe he 's capable of hurting people , " said baughn , a former student who now accuses bikram choudhury of sexual assault
" he 's got to stop lying behind it
and he 's got to stop doing this to people
" bikram choudhury is the founder of bikram 's yoga college of india
he 's featured prominently on its website , which details his system of performing 26 unique yoga poses while in a very hot room
with studios heated to 105 degrees , he credits the steamy , sweaty stretches with transforming people 's bodies and minds
he said he 's guided by a deep calling to help others
civil lawsuits filed in los angeles superior court tell the story of a different bikram choudhury , describing him as someone who preyed on young women who looked to him for guidance
besides baughn 's claim of sexual assault , five other women have come forward with civil lawsuits claiming bikram choudhury raped them
baughn said her father helped her take out a $ 7,000 loan so she could attend bikram 's teacher training
in a meeting in bikram choudhury 's office , she said , the guru seemed to make an advance
then , she said , bikram choudhury cornered her late one night , making it clear she had to sleep with him in order to advance her career
' " bikram choudhury , she said , claimed she 'd never win a yoga competition if he did n't have sex with her
in another instance , she said bikram choudhury pinned her against a door and sexually assaulted her when she was left alone with him late one night at a teacher training course
bikram choudhury said baughn 's claims are false
" it 's not truth
he repeatedly denied assaulting his accusers or ever having consensual sex with them
but when asked whether he 'd had sex with other students , he responded , " yes and no. " " i have no intention to have sex with any of my students or any women , " said bikram choudhury , who said he 's been married to his wife for more than 30 years
but when asked for evidence , bikram 's attorney advised him not to give cnn names
robert tafoya , bikram choudhury 's attorney , said there are plenty of reasons to doubt the accusers ' claims
" and yet , after this lawyer sends out these kinds of blasts in social media asking people if they 've been a victim of bikram choudhury , all of a sudden these people come forward and all have very similar claims
" carney shegerian , baughn 's attorney , said that 's simply not true
" she 's 5 now , 5Â½
bikram choudhury vowed to clear his name
