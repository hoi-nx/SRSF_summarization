however , a new medical technology , an easily applied microneedle patch , could be the key to that goal
the biggest challenge standing in the way of eradicating polio has involved the operational logistics of getting the vaccine to people who need it , especially in difficult areas plagued by violence or poverty
the microneedle patch , which resembles a small , round adhesive bandage , could bring polio vaccines to the doorsteps of the people that need it
by applying it to the skin and pushing down , the vaccine is delivered in a matter of minutes
rather than requiring highly trained medics , minimally trained personnel could go from door to door , quickly administering the vaccine
it 's been 60 years since a mass inoculation of salk 's vaccine began with school children in april , 1955 that caused polio cases in the u.s. to drop by almost 90 % over the course of two years
the vaccine was eagerly awaited because , according to the cdc , about 35,000 people annually became disabled because of polio in the u.s. in the 1940s and ' 50s
the organization funded the two vaccines -- one created by salk and another by sabin -- that would lead to the protection of most of the world against polio
salk 's vaccine , developed in the 1950s , involved injecting a virus that was " killed , " while sabin 's vaccine -- which he worked on in the 1960s and which was administered orally -- contained a weakened version of polio
the sabin vaccine actually helped boost immunity in communities beyond the individual because people shed the weakened virus in their feces
it came to replace the salk in many places between 1963 and 1999 , according to the smithsonian
but the injected " killed " virus version is what 's given in the u.s. today because of the rare instances of people developing polio from the oral vaccine
there 's evidence from ancient egypt that paralytic polio existed there and even infected royalty
the u.s. saw its first polio outbreak in 1894 in vermont , with 132 cases , according to the smithsonian
that is , until the vaccine came on the scene
polio was declared eradicated in the u.s. in 1979
" in the u.s. , where there 's no problem anymore , we still want to have the population protected , " said michael katz , senior advisor and interim medical director of the march of dimes
children should receive four doses of inactivated polio vaccine , delivered as an injection , at ages 2 months , 4 months , 6 to 18 months , and 4 to 6 years , according to the cdc
most u.s. adults were vaccinated as children and do n't need another dose
