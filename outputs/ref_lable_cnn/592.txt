recently , nashville 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
believe it or not , nashville prosecutors have offered this option four times in the past five years
there has been public outrage at the notion that a defendant in american in 2015 would be offered a choice of sterilization as part of a plea deal
some have claimed this practice " evokes a dark corner of american history " where the mentally ill or " deficient " were forced to undergo sterilization
yeah , that 's true
female sterilization is linked to the controversial " eugenics " movement , which advocated for the notion that the human race can be improved by selective breeding of people with superior genes
there is even a 1927 court case , buck v. bell , in which the justices ruled that a state statute permitting compulsory sterilization of the unfit and " imbeciles , " " for the protection and health of the state , " was constitutional
but buck v. bell dealt with involuntary sterilization of people because of their mental disabilities , not because they were being punished for a crime
you can hate sterilization , and the tennessee case may have the creepy feel of the antiquated practice of eugenics , but it 's not that
present - day sterilization plea deals involve a voluntary choice of sterilization by persons accused of a crime , and for whom sterilization will be part of their punishment
others may argue that the court has already spoken on the issue of compulsory sterilization as punishment , and struck it down
that 's true too , sort of
suppose arguendo ( for argument 's sake ) that sterilization is judicially labeled a cruel and unusual punishment , violating the eighth amendment
you waive your fourth amendment protections against search and seizure when you answer " yes " to an officer 's " mind if i look in your trunk ? " you waive your fifth amendment privilege against self - incrimination when you try to explain to the detective in the interrogation room how that body got in your vehicle 's trunk
so then , if we can validly waive our other constitutional rights , can we waive our eighth amendment rights and choose a cruel and unusual punishment , even if it would otherwise be unconstitutional ? and are people outraged because this is a new step in punishment or a new frontier and a slippery slope in the world of plea deals ? nope
if sterilization plea deals are likely constitutional , and we 've been doing it for a while , then that begs the question : why the outrage now ? why the story that a tennessee prosecutor was fired for a plea bargain that appears to be widely practiced ? there are really only two possibilities
and what if it 's a young female high school teacher having sex with her 17 - year - old student ? most of our gut feelings shifted from " maybe " to " no " just now
of course , sterilization wo n't prevent a female sex offender from offending again , no more than sterilization will prevent a male offender from offending again
why else has castration of men not been a blip on the radar , but offering a woman the option of sterilization is suddenly a travesty ? of course , we have to consider the related justification
are sterilization plea deals morally right ? it 's hard to say
