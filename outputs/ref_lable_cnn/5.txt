abbott did n't say what permanent actions , if any , would be taken against indonesia
one of the men 's indonesia lawyers , todung mulya lubis tweeted his apologies
" indonesia president widodo appeared to shrug off the diplomatic recall , telling reporters that " our legal sovereignty must be respected
six other inmates were executed , including nigerians raheem salami , silvester obiekwe nwolise , okwudil oyatanze and martin anderson ; indonesia zainal abidin and brazilian rodrigo gularte , who was said to be mentally ill. on wednesday , brazilian 's foreign ministry released a statement expressing " deep sadness " at gularte 's execution , saying that brazilian president dilma rousseff had urged her indonesia counterpart to spare him due to his " psychiatric condition
" gularte is the second brazilian to be executed in indonesia this year , with the first -- marco archer cardoso moreira -- prompting the country to recall its ambassador for consultations
the indonesia government had originally announced that nine prisoners would be executed , but at the last moment filipina veloso was spared
philippines embassy officials said veloso would be returned to yogyakarta prison in central java later on wednesday
they say she was offered work in malaysia , but when she arrived she was told the job had been filled and was n't aware the bag she 'd been given for the return journey to indonesia was filled with drugs
a tenth prisoner , frenchman serge atlaoui , was also scheduled to be executed but his case was delayed while a court considers a legal challenge
the men -- then aged in their early twenties -- were arrested in 2005 as part of the " bali nine , " a drug smuggling gang that intended to import 8 kilograms ( 17.6 pounds ) of heroin from bali to australia
the pair were transported with other prisoners to indonesia 's so - called " execution island " in march , and after being given 72 - hours notice of their execution on saturday , chan married his longtime girlfriend , febyanti herewila , on monday in prison
on tuesday , lawyers for the men also said indonesia 's judicial commission had yet to properly investigate claims of corruption during their original trial and sentencing

however , before the executions , indonesia insisted that all legal avenues had closed
under indonesia law , the death penalty is carried out by a 12 - man firing squad , although only three guns are loaded with live ammunition
