i do n't always talk about news events with my daughters , but there was something about the story of espn reporter britt mchenry and the wildly offensive way she spoke to that towing company employee that made me bring it up
it 's something that my husband and i just do -- we show respect to everyone from a taxi driver to a teacher to the president of the united states
let me say right here that i have lost my cool from time to time , whether it 's been a phone call with a credit card company to complain about late fees or an experience of bad service at a restaurant
) some of mchenry 's comments , such as how she 's " on television , " imply that she may have the dangerous thinking that she , by dint of her career , education and income , is better than people who do n't get paid what she does or have the same kind of career or educational opportunities
mchenry showed that she either forgot those " golden rule " lessons from childhood or that she has n't really lived her life with that mantra
mchenry has since apologized on twitter , saying she said " some insulting and regrettable things , " and that as frustrated as she was during an experience at a towing company in virginia , she should " always choose to be respectful and take the high road
" but it 's not clear that apology will satisfy anyone who watched the video of her exchange with the towing company worker
" i see this britt mchenry video , and think : it 's not just about how a celebrity should n't act in public , it 's how all of us should n't act , " wrote " cait " on twitter
said " shannon , " also on twittter , " i had no idea who britt mchenry was before but ... now i know she 's the kind of woman i hope i 've taught my daughters not to be
let 's let her be an example to others , " wrote c cooper on a change.org petition asking mchenry 's employers to fire her
the mchenry story seemed to strike a chord in our household because my older daughter asked what was going to happen to her
this morning , i told her mchenry was suspended for a week by espn , and that led to another conversation
celebrity apologies : the good , bad and uncomfortable so , britt mchenry , check out these examples of how the rich , famous and powerful handled stressful situations with grace and dignity
" everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance , " davis , the first girl to earn a win and to pitch a shutout in little league world series history , told espn
finally , witherspoon may be the closest example for mchenry to consider when it comes to overcoming a very offensive episode
now , did mchenry learn that when a towing company worker or anyone else makes you incredibly angry , you never berate them for their weight , job , appearance and income ? let 's hope so
can you think of other examples where the rich and powerful responded to a stressful situation with grace instead of disrespect ? share your thoughts with kelly wallace on twitter or cnn living on facebook .
