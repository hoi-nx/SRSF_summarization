from late january , when patriots was living through one of its bleakest and snowiest winters , to a warm and sunny afternoon in april , the jurors in the first - degree murder trial of former nfl star hernandez have considered how a promising young athlete who earned millions came to take the life of his onetime friend and future brother - in - law , lloyd
on wednesday , they convicted hernandez , who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole , after deliberating more than 35 hours over parts of seven days
after the verdict , jurors agreed to meet with reporters , at times laughing nervously while shedding light on what some described as the grueling deliberation process
" it 's a very big decision to make , and every one of us ... made sure we came to the best conclusion , " one juror told reporters
" everyone 's life changed because of this
" " it 's the hardest thing i 've ever done in my life , " she said later about serving on the jury
" asked whether they would say anything to hernandez , one of the women on the panel said simply , " nothing
do they have any feelings about the 25 - year - old former star ? " for me , judge garsh said , ' keep your mind suspended , ' " said a female juror
" did they know anything about hernandez or the case before the trial ? one juror responded : " nothing
the jurors said they found out about hernandez 's other legal woes from garsh only after they reached a verdict
hernandez potentially faces three more trials , one criminal and two civil actions
prosecutors have said hernandez fatally shot de abreu and furtado when he fired into their 2003 bmw
hernandez pleaded not guilty at his arraignment
the families of de abreu and furtado filed civil suits against hernandez , and a judge froze his $ 5 million in assets , pending the outcome of the double - murder trial
the freeze includes the disputed $ 3.3 million signing bonus payment hernandez claims he is owed by the patriots
hernandez is also being sued by a man who claims hernandez shot him while they were in a limousine in miami in february 2013
alexander bradley claims hernandez wounded him after the two got into a fight at a miami strip club
" it 's amazing a lot of the information we learned today , " a female juror said wednesday
kraft testified that hernandez proclaimed his innocence to him and told the team owner that " he hoped that the time of the murder ... came out because i believe he said he was in a club
" " to this day -- we just went through a three - month trial , and this is now two years later -- we still do n't know the exact time of lloyd 's murder , " a male juror said
" so i do n't know how hernandez would have had that information two years ago
" the system is designed to be fair to both sides , " he said
" the jurors did not find credible the defense team 's contention that hernandez 's co-defendants -- wallace and ortiz -- carried out the murder
" " we were all shocked about that , " a female juror told reporters wednesday
asked about post-trial fame or the possibility of book deals for their role in the sensational case , a female juror smiled
