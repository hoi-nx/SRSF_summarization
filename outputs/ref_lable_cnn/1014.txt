melbourne , australia a man stands on a beach in a distant land
he wades through the gentle dawn light , arms outstretched , his head held high
he is fully dressed ; not a tourist but a freedom fighter
a photograph of this man , beamed around the world , becomes a universal symbol of the struggle against tyranny and the sweet triumph of liberty
if you thought the man might have been an anzac on the shores of gallipoli , such is the power of persuasion
it 's easy to lead a horse to water when , in the centenary year of the gallipoli campaign , our nation is at saturation point with battlefield remembrance
the sum total of television programming , beer advertising , political grandstanding and opportunistic marketing suggests that the historical legacy of australia 's involvement in the first world war boils down to a simple equation : young ( white ) man plus distant beach equals sacrifice
there is nothing intrinsically wrong with military commemoration that honors the dead
last weekend i planted gallipoli rosemary in my backyard ; part of the proceeds go to the avenues of honour , a national project to preserve and restore australia 's living memorials
more objectionable is the fact that war remembrance is played like it is a zero sum game
to widen the scope of historical tribute , and also recall the words and deeds of the australia men and women who fought against the prescribed route of militaristic sentiment , is to risk being branded disrespectful and divisive
but the unassailable fact is that the first world war ripped australia asunder
even at the time , the wwi itself was divisive , a historical reality belied by today 's bland , blanket coverage of " the anzac spirit "
australia 's participation in the war was contested from the outset
" as the carnage at gallipoli brought home the realities of war , recruitment fell and peace activism became more widespread
" the enduring legacies of the first world war emanate beyond the battlefields of gallipoli , manifested not only in the " shattered anzacs " whose families bore the burden of care , but also in the class and sectarian divisions that shaped australia 's social and political relations in the 20th century
perhaps , by the 125th anniversary of the gallipoli campaign , when we again celebrate our national liberation narratives , we will come to associate riverbanks , as well as beaches , with the potent ebb and flow of freedom
