it 's easy to be anxious about the threat posed by the isis
and although it 's important to start with the caveat that isis is indeed trying to scare and confuse us , i took away some tentative lessons from speaking with the people who have traveled inside the minds of isis
first , isis is clearly about religion -- its version of radical islam -- but it is also about power
there is increasing evidence that the military backbone of isis is made up not by a group of isis zealots , but rather high - ranking officers from saddam hussein 's army -- baathists who were at least ostensibly secular
an internal isis report detailing its organizational structure was reported on last week in the german weekly der spiegel
next , isis presents itself as a global organization , but it has thrived because of a local cause
the group has gained territory , cash and recruits primarily because of the rage and rebellion of the sunni of iraq and syria , who believe they must fight the shiite to secure their own survival and strength
the reality is that that sunni cause is going to endure for some time
the americans has been successful in its tactical battles against isis and has managed to push the group back from many of its gains in iraq
but the sunni of the region will remain in rebellion and the sunni - dominated areas will remain in turmoil -- chaos that isis will be able to capitalize on this chaos
of course , one of the big questions has been : is isis a threat to the west ? the group 's leaders declare that it is
but their ambitions appear to be mostly centered on their arab enemies , on building a caliphate in iraq and syria
the leaders of isis have recognized that above all , they are a messaging machine , which in turn becomes a recruitment machine
