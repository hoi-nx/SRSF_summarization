holmes made his introduction to the world in a colorado cinema filled with spectators watching a midnight showing of the new batman movie , " the dark knight rises , " in june 2012
holmes is accused of opening fire on the crowd , killing 12 people and injuring or maiming 70 others in aurora , a suburb of denver
holmes appeared like a comic book character : he resembled the joker , with red - orange hair , similar to the late actor heath ledger 's portrayal of the villain in an earlier batman movie , authorities said
but holmes was hardly a cartoon
holmes says he was insane at the time of the shootings , and that is his legal defense and court plea : not guilty by reason of insanity
opening statements in his trial are scheduled to begin monday
holmes admits to the shootings but says he was suffering " a psychotic episode " at the time , according to court papers filed in july 2013 by the state public defenders , daniel king and tamara a. brady
evidence " revealed thus far in the case supports the defense 's position that mr. holmes suffers from a severe mental illness and was in the throes of a psychotic episode when he committed the acts that resulted in the tragic loss of life and injuries sustained by moviegoers on july 20 , 2012 , " the public defenders wrote
holmes no longer looks like a dazed joker , as he did in his first appearance before a judge in 2012
he appeared dramatically different in january when jury selection began for his trial : 9,000 potential jurors were summoned for duty , described as one of the nation 's largest jury calls
holmes now has a cleaner look , with a mustache , button - down shirt and khaki pants
if this new image sounds like one of an academician , it may be because holmes , now 27 , once was one
just before the shooting , holmes was a doctoral student in neuroscience , and he was studying how the brain works , with his schooling funded by a u.s. government grant
yet for all his learning , holmes apparently lacked the capacity to command his own mind , according to the case against him
a jury will ultimately decide holmes ' fate
he described the approaching trial as " four to five months of a horrible roller coaster through the worst haunted house you can imagine
" the jury will have to render verdicts on each of the 165 counts against holmes , including murder and attempted murder charges
raised in central coastal southern california and in san diego , holmes is the son of a mathematician father noted for his work at the fico firm that provides credit scores and a registered nurse mother , according to the san diego newspaper
holmes also has a sister , chris , a musician , who 's five years younger , the newspaper said
his family then moved down the southern california coast , where holmes grew up in the san diego - area neighborhood of rancho peã±asquitos , which a neighbor described as " kind of like mayberry , " the san diego newspaper said
holmes attended westview high school , which says its school district sits in " a primarily middle - to upper - middle - income residential community
" there , holmes ran cross-country , played soccer and later worked at a biotechnology internship at the salk institute and miramar college , which attracts academically talented students
holmes attended college fairly close to home , in a neighboring area known as southern california 's " inland empire " because it 's more than an hour 's drive from the coast , in a warm , low - desert climate
the doctoral in neuroscience program attended by holmes focuses on how the brain works , with an emphasis on processing of information , behavior , learning and memory
holmes was one of six pre-thesis ph.d. students in the program who were awarded a neuroscience training grant from the national institutes of health
a syllabus that listed holmes as a student at the medical school shows he was to have delivered a presentation about microrna biomarkers
holmes was " denied access to the school after june 12 , 2012 , after he made threats to a professor , " according to court documents
holmes began to fantasize about killing " a lot of people " in early june , nearly six weeks before the shootings , the station reported , citing unidentified sources familiar with the investigation
citing statements from the university , holmes ' attorneys have argued that his access was revoked because that 's normal procedure when a student drops enrollment
nine minutes before holmes went into the movie theater , he called a university of colorado switchboard , public defender brady has said in court
no , he had two months left on his lease , holmes wrote back , according to the times
in december , holmes ' parents , who will be attending the trial , issued another statement : they asked that their son 's life be spared and that he be sent to an institution for mentally ill people for the rest of his life , if he 's found not guilty by reason of insanity
