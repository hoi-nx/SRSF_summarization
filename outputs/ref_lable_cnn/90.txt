a group of six young minnesota men conspired to sneak into syria and join isis " by any means necessary , " federal prosecutors said monday
the group of friends , ages 19 to 21 , were arrested sunday
" what 's remarkable about this case was that nothing stopped these defendants from plotting their goal , " said u.s. attorney luger of the district of minnesota
" they were not confused young men
these are focused men who are intent on joining a terrorist organization by any means possible
" recruiting for the isis terrorist network is a particular problem in minnesota 's community of somali immigrants
they plotted for 10 months , luger said
the complaint describes a man , identified only as " nur , " who has spent time in syria and allegedly helped the six accused men
