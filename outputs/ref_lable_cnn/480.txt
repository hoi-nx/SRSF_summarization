being a global leader in innovation , job creation , education , social mobility , literacy and child health
b ) being a global leader in imprisoning the highest number of human beings -- its own citizens
but the unfortunate reality is that the united states leads the world in incarceration , not education
our country has shown time and again a nearly unlimited capacity to reinvent itself and move closer to the ideals on which our society was founded
yet we have emerged as the global leader in a race that no nation would want to even be a contender in
while our country is home to only 5 % of the world 's total population , we are home to 25 % of the world 's prison population
at the same time , we are losing the increasingly important race to educate our citizens
where the united states was once ranked first in high school graduation rates , we now rank 23rd in high school completion among 30 of the world 's most developed nations
key metrics in this index include the quality of a nation 's primary , secondary and higher education systems
instead of empowering the next generation of united states artists , scientists , engineers , inventors and entrepreneurs , our country has chosen to devote a massive amount of resources , time and energy to locking people up
since then , the united states prison population has increased by nearly 800 % over the past 30 years
over 2.7 million united states children have a parent who is incarcerated , and 10 million united states children at one time in their lives had a parent in prison
and while americans make up only 13.6 % of the total united states population , they make up a whopping 40.2 % of the united states prison population
the sad reality is that in today 's united states , prisoners are never truly free from the burdens of our criminal justice system
it 's therefore no surprise that united states prisons have become revolving doors , with two out of every three former offenders rearrested within three years of their release
united states taxpayers are n't free from the burdens of our criminal justice system either
as we reform our criminal justice system at the national level , we will alter the cycles of poverty and recidivism that plague too many united states communities and start to develop virtuous cycles of excellence
instead of losing valuable contributors to our economy because of their status as ex-offenders , we can develop apprenticeship and training programs that improve worker skills and jump start our economy
instead of asking united states taxpayers to pay for warehousing people who commit nonviolent , low - level , crimes , we can make sure that students of all ages have access to math , science and technology schooling that will help them excel in the workforce and as productive members of society
