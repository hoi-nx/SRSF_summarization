it 's clear from hillary clinton 's campaign rollout -- a video announcement / campaign ad / short film that debuted sunday afternoon -- that she will make women and being a woman central to her outreach
in case you 're skeptical , vox has posted a handy " by the numbers " for her campaign video , and there are 38 people besides clinton in the two - minute ad
this is all fine and good ( and predictable ) if you acknowledge that the proportion of women who vote has exceeded the proportion of men who vote in every presidential election since 1980
and let 's not overlook the fact that clinton is in fact a woman , and that 's a fine thing to celebrate
she can simply look back to the most recent elections to see that overplaying to one half of the eligible - voting population failed spectacularly all over the country , in red and blue states , when that strategy was employed by both male and female candidates
as i 've previously written , the 2014 midterm elections saw the death of a political meme : the " war on women
but it is noteworthy that democrats who overtly pandered to women at the expense of real issues ( and men ) crashed and burned
in new york , a democrats candidate for congress , martha robertson , drew laughs from the audience during a debate for accusing her opponent of engaging in a " war on women
but while democrats were screaming about the republicans ' " war on women , " few in the media acknowledged that the democrats ' deficit among men was actually greater than the republicans ' deficit among women
exit polls in 2014 showed that men voted for republicans over democrats by a 16 - point margin , and women voted for democrats by only a four - point margin
