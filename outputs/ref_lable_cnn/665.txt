it 's no surprise which image is making the headlines from this week 's gathering of leaders from nearly three dozen nations in panama : a historic handshake between president barack obama and cuba president castro
but this first meeting of barack obama and castro since they announced plans to start normalizing diplomatic ties should not be the end of the summit story
or at least barack obama is hoping it wo n't be
after all , the president has had some unhappy experiences at hemispheric summits , where the headlines have often focused on some less than flattering moments
the reality is that the united states has been losing ground in this increasingly important region , and barack obama needs to put on a strong performance in panama at the summit of the americas if the united states is to have a chance of improving ties with neighbors who should be best friends , but who have drifted away as latin america has been focused on challenges at home and instability in the middle east
unfortunately , latin america has lost influence in latin america to a hyperactive china , a cunning russia and a troubling iran , all of which have made inroads in the region at washington 's expense
and back in 2009 , the president -- new on the job -- was caught flat footed by a fast - talking , fiery anti-american president of venezuela
the summit hit a depressing low for the barack obama administration when chavez walked up to barack obama and , as the cameras clicked , handed the latin america president a copy of the book " open veins of latin america , " which blames the region 's woes on the united states and europe
all this stands in contrast to the optimism of the early clinton years , when the president issued an invitation to " democratically elected " heads of state of latin america , which was then breaking the chains of military dictatorship
can barack obama manage something similar this time ? true , the president has come armed with his new cuba policy
unfortunately , in an effort to placate critics who say barack obama is not doing more for pro-democracy activists , the white house has miscalculated with venezuela , handing the repressive regime of chavez 's successor , maduro , a stick with which to beat the united states barack obama has long and rightly ignored maduro 's claims that the united states planned to overthrow him
all of this suggests that if barack obama plays his cards right , he will have the opportunity to explain to the people of latin america that their goals are also latin america 's goals ; that like them , he supports democracy , human rights , the rule of law , full freedom of expression and free elections in every country
but if barack obama can show them that the united states is a true partner in efforts to improve their lives , then he will leave a longer - lasting legacy in the region than just a handshake .
