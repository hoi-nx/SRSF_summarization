espn 's britt mchenry this week found herself in the news , rather than reporting on it , after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in arlington , virginia
among the highlights , as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to liveleak : " i 'm on television and you 're in a f * * king trailer , honey , " and " i would n't work at a scumbag place like this
" espn , meanwhile , announced that mchenry would be suspended for a week
the video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only mchenry 's responses , not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on
the employee even threatens to make the video public
did mchenry keep going because she has that much of a self - destructive streak ? or because she truly could not help herself ? or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game ? how britt mchenry could have responded these days , there 's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace , whether it 's lindsay lohan or brian williams or britt mchenry , who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing : that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial
( be honest : when is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot ? ) but we 're really no better than she is
who was worse : mchenry or the people who made that video public , and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation ? who is worse : britt mchenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee 's bad teeth , or the twitter masses who call for justice and " the return of class " -- who express views like , " part of me feels bad for britt mchenry
poor thing actually believes she was hired for ' brains ' and ' education ' ? should n't they question whether , in fact , mchenry could have actually been standing up for herself ? sorry to break it to you , but these days , we 're all bullies
at least britt mchenry owns up to it .
