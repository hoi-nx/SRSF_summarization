hong kong it 's not just east asia
around the world , we 're becoming collectively more near - sighted
near - sightedness , or myopia , means nearby objects appear clearly , but those farther away look blurry
the rates of myopia have doubled , even tripled , in most of east asia over the last 40 years , researchers say
several places like hong kong , singapore and taiwanese have rates in the 80 %
in south korea , myopia rates among 20 - year - olds have leaped from 18 % in 1955 to over 96 % myopia in 2011
and it 's a global issue -- rates of myopia are also rising in western nations like germany and the u.s.
" it 's about 40 % in the u.s. , compared to about 25 % in the 1970s , " said dr. michael chiang , clinical spokesperson for the american academy of ophthalmology
but researchers say reducing risk of myopia is easy , free and readily - available : get some sunlight
the epidemic of myopia amongst east asians has triggered cultural questions about why so many young people develop vision problems
many have long believed that reading , studying or staring at your phone caused short - sightedness
and there 's the usual grumblings that young people spend way too much time glued to their screens
researchers say kids and teens need to get sunlight during the critical years of their development while their eyeballs are still growing
despite these eye exercises , rates of myopia in urban china have soared to nearly 90 % , according to recent studies
" china has among the highest rates of myopia and it 's the only country in the world that does eye exercises , so it 's probably not working all that well , " said congdon
but researchers say there are serious implications of such high rates of myopia among young people
in singapore , 82 % of 20 - year - olds are myopic
" it 's a potential way to increase the amount of light , in hopes of preventing myopia and allow kids to continue ( their ) education without inconvenience for them , " morgan said
researchers want to measure the rates of myopia among students in these " bright light classrooms " compared with those in traditional classes
