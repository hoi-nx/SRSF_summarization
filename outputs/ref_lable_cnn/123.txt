as tourists stroll between yellowstone supervolcano 's 300 active geysers , taking selfies in front of thousands of bubbling , boiling mud pots and hissing steam vents , they are treading on one of the planet 's greatest time bombs
yellowstone supervolcano 's magma reserves are many magnitudes greater than previously thought , say scientists from the university of utah
most of it is in a newly discovered magma reservoir , which the scientists featured in a study published on thursday in the journal science
it may help scientists better understand why yellowstone supervolcano 's previous eruptions , in prehistoric times , were some of earth 's largest explosions in the last few million years
the university of utah scientists also created the first three - dimensional depiction of the geothermal structure under yellowstone supervolcano , which comprises three parts
yellowstone supervolcano 's ultimate heat source reaches down 440 to 1,800 miles beneath earth 's surface -- and may come from its molten core
it is responsible for fueling the newly discovered reservoir that lies on top of it
the magma chamber , which scientists already knew about , lies on top of the reservoir -- and draws magma from it
compared to yellowstone supervolcano 's past , mount st. helens was a picnic , when it covered washington state with an ash bed about the size of lake michigan in 1980
to understand the consequences of yellowstone supervolcano 's previous eruptions , open the history books to 1815 , when tambora blew many cubic miles of debris skyward and killed about 10,000 inhabitants of indonesia in an instant , according to a report in smithsonian magazine
its dust may have blocked sunlight around the world , chilling the air and dropping the earth 's climate into a frigid phase that garnered the year 1816 the " year without a summer , " some climatologists believe
those were the two largest eruptions in north america in a few million years , the usgs said , and they each buried in ash more than a third of what is now the continental u.s. " if another large caldera - forming eruption were to occur at yellowstone supervolcano , its effects would be worldwide , " the usgs says
so , it 's no wonder scientists have cast an eye on yellowstone supervolcano for a while
the university of utah researchers gave the yellowstone supervolcano 's magma bowels a sort of ct scan , said lead researcher hsin-hua huang
volcanic activity triggers 2,000 to 3,000 small earthquakes per year , and the shake and shock waves travel at different speeds through molten , hot and other rock
here are the upper magma chamber and lower magma reservoir by the numbers
even if the next explosion is many thousands of years away , yellowstone supervolcano 's cavernous heat tanks poke up an occasionally surprise
calbuco volcano erupts for first time in more than 40 years university of university of utah seismologists discover magma reservoir under yellowstone supervolcano from the university of utah on vimeo .
