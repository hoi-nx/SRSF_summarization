atlanta silently moving deep beneath the ocean 's surface , combat submarines can employ the element of surprise to carry out devastating attacks on naval fleets and land targets
" we know they are out experimenting and looking at operating , and clearly want to be in this world of advanced submarines , " vice adm. mulloy told the house 's sea power subcommittee in february
mulloy , who is deputy chief of naval operations for capabilities and resources , says china submarines are still technologically inferior to those used by the u.s. , but that margin of difference is shrinking
concern that china could match u.s. underwater capabilities in the near future has encouraged the development of an unmanned drone ship to independently track enemy ultra-quiet diesel electric submarines over thousands of miles to limit their tactical capacity for surprise
initiated by a pentagon research group called the darpa ( darpa ) , the anti-submarine warfare continuous trail vessel ( actuv ) would be able to operate under with little supervisory control but also as remotely controlled or piloted vessels , depending on the circumstances of specific missions
" an actuv prototype vessel is already in production and , if testing is successful , the u.s. navy could move to the next phase of development by 2018 .
