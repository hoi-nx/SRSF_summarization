in 1944 , 16 - year - old lee of taegu , korea , was lured by a friend of hers to meet with an older japanese man
there , the girls were forced into sexual slavery , serving four to five japanese soldiers every day for a year
when japanese prime minister abe addresses a joint meeting of congress on wednesday , he has an opportunity to do right by these women , and issue an unequivocal and irrefutable apology -- something that carries the weight of his government
in 2007 , in the very same chamber the prime minister will be issuing his address , the house sent a profound message to the japanese government by unanimously passing house resolution 121 , which i authored
the resolution called on the japanese government to formally acknowledge , apologize , and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for its imperial armed forces ' coercion of young women into sexual slavery ; publicly refute any claims that the sexual enslavement and trafficking of the " comfort women " never occurred ; and educate current and future generations about this horrible crime
in 2006 , during his first term , prime minister abe unleashed an international firestorm of criticism when he stated that there was no evidence of japanese coercion and complicity in setting up and running the " comfort women " system
and during his second term , abe and his right - wing allies have continued to question history -- even trying to dilute and rewrite it
last year , i , along with 17 of my house colleagues , wrote to the japanese ambassador to the united states , calling the timing and contents of the japanese government report on the 1993 kono statement : regrettable , unfortunate , unacceptable , and destabilizing
last year , meanwhile , the abe administration tried ( and failed ) to get the united nations to partially retract their authoritative 1996 report , which called on japanese to apologize to the victims and pay reparations to survivors who had been forced into sex slavery
most notably , earlier this year , the japanese government tried unsuccessfully to change passages in united states history textbooks about the " comfort women
" some say that japanese has already apologized enough and it 's time to move on
in 1988 , congress passed , and president ronald reagan signed into law , the civil liberties act , which was a formal apology to united states citizens of japanese ancestry who were unjustly put into internment camps during world war ii our government made a mistake , but they apologized for it , and healed many wounds as a result
the germany chancellor angela merkel has urged prime minister abe to face japanese 's history
i will be in the house chamber when prime minister abe delivers his address
both of us hope the prime minister will take the privilege of this opportunity and finally , and firmly , apologize , and commit to educating the future generation honestly and humbly
