north korean is in the headlines again
according to a wall street journal report thursday , chinese nuclear experts have told the united states that pyongyang may already have as many as 20 nuclear warheads
the key takeaway from the latest assessment of north korean 's nuclear capability is not in the actual number of warheads , but the type of warhead , as this gives a better clue to the future of the country 's weapons capabilities
true , the reported chinese estimate of 20 warheads is large enough to constitute a nuclear " arsenal
the big takeaway from the report is instead the prediction that north korean could be in a position to double its arsenal by next year with weapons - grade uranium
if that assessment is correct , and pyongyang can indeed boost its nuclear stockpile by the end of this year to around 40 warheads by utilizing highly - enriched weapons - grade uranium , then the plutonium program that the united states and members of the six-party talks had been negotiating over this past quarter century would suddenly seem trivial
why ? for a start , it would mean that north korean 's activities would undoubtedly meet the definition , if it had not already , of a runaway nuclear weapons program , with the potential to be fueled by a large supply of raw uranium buried in north korean 's mines
washington and seoul have tended to have a policy that leans toward downplaying north korean threats , at least when there is n't a full - fledged crisis going on
first , gortney 's statement , when combined with the latest chinese assessment , implies that north korean now not only has nuclear weapons , but the ability to miniaturize such weapons for a warhead that could be placed atop a missile with range rings extending to the united states mainland
