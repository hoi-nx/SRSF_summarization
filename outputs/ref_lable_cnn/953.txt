the flashpoint ? a controversial beijing - backed election proposal tabled wednesday that pro-democracy legislators have already sworn to veto , describing it as " ridiculous
" in a speech before the city 's legislature , chief secretary carrie lam said that if approved , the proposal would give hong kongers the right to vote for their next leader in 2017
the catch , of course , is candidates would have to be approved by a mostly pro-china committee
dissenting pro-democracy legislators wearing black marched from the chamber as soon as lam 's speech ended
some legislators raised yellow umbrellas , a symbol of the occupy movement
lau said that she and other pro-democracy candidates would cast votes to ensure it does not become law
hong kong 's leaders argue its latest proposal fulfills the long - awaited promise of universal suffrage by giving each resident the right to cast a vote
" now all you have is a vote , and the candidates must be vetted by a committee consisting of business and political elites
" to say the majority of hong kongers want to support this nonsensical package is a blatant lie
" to become law , the proposal must receive the support of two thirds of hong kong 's 70 legislators
but lau and 26 other pro-democracy legislators make up more than a third of the chamber , meaning they can veto the bill
hong kong 's leadership has warned pro-democracy legislators against the veto , saying the city might never again receive a chance for political reform
in response , lau and other pro-democracy legislators will launch a citywide campaign this weekend to rally public opinion against the proposal
