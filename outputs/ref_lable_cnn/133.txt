a federal grand jury has charged millionaire real estate heir durst , a convicted felon , with unlawful possession of a firearm
in this week 's indictment , durst , 71 , is accused of possessing a .38 caliber revolver , which authorities allegedly found in his hotel room last month
he faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if found guilty of that charge , according to the indictment
a louisiana judge ruled last month that durst , who is charged with first - degree murder , will be held without bail at a facility near new orleans
durst was featured this spring in " the jinx , " a hbo documentary about him
last month , court documents claimed that durst had a loaded .38 - caliber revolver , marijuana , his passport and birth certificate , a latex mask with salt - and - pepper hair attached and more than $ 40,000 cash
but the bigger courtroom fight will probably unfold in los angeles , where the district attorney filed a first - degree murder charge against durst last month
prosecutors accuse durst of " lying in wait " and killing berman , a crime writer and his longtime confidante , because she " was a witness to a crime
" berman was shot in the head in her beverly hills home in december 2000 , shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of durst 's first wife , kathleen mccormack durst
durst has long maintained that he had nothing to do with berman 's death or his wife 's disappearance
fbi agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where durst lived over the past five decades , a u.s. law enforcement official said
durst 's attorney , deguerin , said it 's a sign that authorities are desperate
