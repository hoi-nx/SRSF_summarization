an amnesty international report is calling for authorities to address the number of attacks on women 's rights activists in afghanistan
the report , entitled " their lives on the line , " examines the persecution of activists and other champions of women 's rights not only by the taliban and tribal warlords , but also by government officials
the brutal murder of farkhunda , a young woman in afghanistan , whose body was burnt and callously chucked into a river in kabul , shocked the world
but what also made international headlines was the fact that for the first time in history , women in afghanistan became pallbearers , hoisting the victim 's coffin on their shoulders draped with headscarves , under the gazes of men ; unreservedly sobbing and shouting messages of women 's solidarity as they marched along the streets
in 2013 , the u.n. in afghanistan ( unama ) released statistics that showed the number of women killed in the country had increased by 20 % from the previous year , although the number of civilian victims had decreased , said amnesty international in the report
the special representative of the u.n. secretary-general in afghanistan at the time , jan kubis , told the u.n. security council that " the majority ( of women killed ) is linked to domestic violence , tradition , culture of the country
" women activists have been deliberately targeted
" the afghanistan government has done very little to protect them , " amnesty international 's afghanistan researcher , mosadiq , tells cnn
" perpetrators almost always walk free , and threats reported by women rights defenders are often simply ignored
" but what is striking is the resilience of the activists , who continue their work despite their lives being on the line
" unlike anything i have seen in my decades of campaigning for women 's rights in our country
" ghaffer , 32 , is a women 's rights activist and spokesperson for the solidarity party of afghanistan -- a small but outspoken political party based in kabul and twenty provinces that fights for issues such as democracy , social justice and women 's rights
the party was the first to be banned in the country for accusing afghanistan leaders and commanders of war crimes and demanding that they be brought to justice
taking part in farkhunda 's funeral and protests against her death , she tells cnn that despite the onslaught of violence against afghanistan women over the years , this was the worst case
" so the women of afghanistan showed that we will not keep silent anymore ... and we are not ready to accept more brutality and violence against women , " said ghaffer
" men ( at the funeral ) , they said you have to do this , because this is how you can change the hatred in afghanistan
" without men , it is not possible for women to get their rights , " she says
but at the same time , women need to step forward for their rights
" mosadiq says the fight for women 's rights was established a while ago
" women 's activism in afghanistan is nothing new -- the women 's rights movement has grown substantially since 2001 , and has fought for and achieved some very significant gains
