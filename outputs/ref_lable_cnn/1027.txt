laying down tracks for their debut album in the recording studio in la , faarrow , 25 and her sister siham , 27 could not be further from their hometown of mogadishu
the sisters were born in the somali capital but were forced to flee after war broke out in 1991
heading south to la by way of atlanta , the singing sisters with a bold flair for fashion are now embarking on a musical journey , gearing up to unleash their afro - pop sound to the world
cnn 's african voices caught up with the sister act -- known collectively as faarrow ( combining the translation of their names into english -- iman means " faith " and siham means " arrow " ) to talk about music , aspirations and somali
what are some of your musical influences ? iman : we love michael jackson , lionel richie -- stuff my mom would listen to and play -- and the spice girls
cnn : you are working on your debut album now -- how 's that been ? siham : we 've been working with elijah -- he 's actually an actor
cnn : so now that you 've found your " missing piece , " how would you describe your sound ? siham : our music before was experimenting with afrobeat sounds but now it 's more of a fusion ( of what ) we are inspired by
it 's pop with undertones of hip hop and rhythmic african percussion
it 's a fusion of everything
cnn : what are you listening to right now ? siham : oh my god , there 's so many ! iman : sia with " chandelier
" siham : i really love this new song -- i do n't know if iman is going to agree with me -- but his name 's lunchmoney lewis , it 's called bills ; i love it
cnn : as well as your music , you both work with the unhcr high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr ) -- how did you start your humanitarian work ? iman : ever since we were kids we wanted to help somali , we always talked about it
' and we did some research about dadaab refugee camp , it 's a massive camp that has taken in sudanese refugees , somali refugees , rwandan refugees -- pretty much anywhere there was a conflict
cnn : but then you decided to " up your game " as it were ... iman : yes , then we started a non-profit and we 'd do small benefit concerts in toronto and in san diego -- wherever there was a big somali community we would do outreach but all we had was our singing , working with unhcr in a capacity as a spokesperson
" we wanted to do a socially conscious brand where we sell these bracelets where it goes back to projects in kenya or somali with women providing them with a sustainable income
iman : i do n't feel like we ever lost that feeling like we 're creative spokespersons for our generation as well as for somali
' we do n't have to become doctors so we can one day give back to somali and help rebuild -- it 's such a beautiful dream but not ours
