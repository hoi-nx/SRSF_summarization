it 's only a few weeks since the first presidential announcement but already it feels like the campaign is in high gear
although the campaign has barely begun , most of the candidates -- and some probable candidates -- are already starting to make mistakes
most of the mistakes will simply be blips along the way , but some of them might end up being more damaging if they feed into negative perceptions that voters have about the candidates
here are a few notable mistakes in the past few weeks : trying to separate himself from the pack , new jersey gov. chris christie called for substantial cuts to social security
he also promised to reverse the marijuana legalization laws that many states have been enacting in response to ballot initiatives
while chris christie sees social security cuts as a way to " go big " in crafting a platform for a possible presidential run , as many republican have discovered social security is a very popular program and one that has strong support from u.s. who are over 60 -- a big part of the electorate
on marijuana legalization , chris christie inserted himself into an issue that has growing public support in red and blue states , especially with the younger and independent voters who chris christie is promising to bring into a potential campaign
if chris christie continues to veer right it will be harder to sell himself as the moderate in the race , and yet there is little chance that he will secure conservative votes over someone like sen. cruz
the texas senator , who has been one of the leading opponents of president obama 's health care plan , acknowledged that he would be enrolling in the obamacare program since his wife was taking a leave of absence from her job to help with the campaign
as the so - called " libertarian " in the campaign , paul is aiming to attract younger republicans who otherwise are not interested in the party
the interview focused most media attention on paul 's temper and his interactions with women rather than his message
as has been correctly pointed out , while her grandfather was an immigrant , it appears that hillary clinton 's grandmother was born shortly after her parents and siblings arrived in the u.s. in the early 1880s
" clinton 's campaign video seemed pitch perfect to many observers , as she largely removed herself from the story line
clearly the biggest " gaffe " in the run - up to the clinton campaign was in how she handled the story of her use of a private server rather than the state department email system
although she dragged out the campaign announcement , she certainly should have had more of the team in place given how much attention she would receive
at first she stumbled in her response , giving the accusers time to spin the story as reflecting a tendency to hide information and suggesting that she was still the untruthful person so many people suspected
given that rubio is not one of the most well - known of the candidates , outside of republican political circles , his timing was not perfect
all of these are still relatively small missteps in the very start of the campaign
