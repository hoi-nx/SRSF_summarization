for years , when i 'd tell new friends i was half - armenian , a puzzled look would cross their faces , before they 'd ask something like , " do you have a country ? " or , when there was a spark of recognition , they 'd chortle , " ah , you 're the people with the last names all ending in ' ian ' ! " in fact , one of our most famous armenians , cher , was better known for her oscar - winning portrayals of italians , and had dropped her own identifying surname
the decimation of our people , too , was reduced to a footnote -- if we were lucky -- in tomes about world war i , when more than one million armenians were killed during the last days of the ottoman empire
most of the time , though , the coverage was about how armenians and turks hate each other like cats and dogs , that the turks continue to deny that ethnic cleansing occurred , saying the armenians had hatched a rebellion , and that the leaders had no choice but to deport them from their homes and put them on the road that led to their deaths
as kardashian , sister khloe and their two cousins recently toured armenia -- on the eve of the 100th anniversary of the mass killings , which is marked on april 24 -- they spotlighted a humanitarian crime that pope francis recently called " the first genocide of the 20th century
after the kardashian trip to armenia , my elderly mother anahid called me nearly breathless with pride : " have you seen ? the genocide is all over the news ! that famous lady , kardashian , has done it ! " my mother 's own father , stepan miskjian , with his own " ian " surname , had narrowly survived the killings
when the kardashians first rose to fame , many armenians cringed over their potboiler storyline , their million - dollar weddings to basketball players and rappers , multiple divorces , and a clothing line at sears
through their fame , though , people began to learn about armenians -- even people outside los angeles , where the armenian population is as thick as the kardashian hair
that united states may also have been equating the ancient culture with the latest " keeping up with the kardashian " plotline was a source of discomfort for the community
but every once in a while , kardashian would tweet something about the issue -- and slowly the community began to warm to her
and every april 24 , the day in 1915 when ottoman empire turks began rounding up the community 's intellectual leaders , we mobilized
this year , it took a reality star , famous for balancing a cocktail on her rump , to catapult it to the top of the news once again , like it was on december 15 , 1915 , when headlines like " armenians or in exile , " splashed across the new york times and other international media
