president obama took part in a roundtable discussion this week on climate change , refocusing on the issue from a public health vantage point
i asked him about the science behind climate change and public health and the message he wants the average americans to take away , as well as how enforceable his action plan is
here are five things i learned : the president enrolled at occidental college in l.a. in 1979 ( he transferred to columbia university his junior year )
he credits the clean air act with making americans " a lot " healthier , in addition to being able to " see the mountains in the background because they are n't covered in smog
peer - reviewed epa studies say that the clean air act and subsequent amendments have reduced early deaths associated with exposure to ambient fine particle pollution and ozone , and reduced illnesses such as chronic bronchitis and acute myocardial infarction
" no challenge poses more of a public threat than climate change , " the president told me
when i asked about the strength of the science supporting the direct relationship between climate change and public health , he said , " we know as temperatures rise , insect - borne diseases potentially start shifting up
we know , in a very straight - forward fashion , that heatstroke and other heat - related illnesses and deaths potentially increase , and so what we 're doing here is to make sure that in addition to public awareness around the potential for big storms like hurricane sandy or big wildfires or droughts , that people recognize there 's a very personal , potential impact in climate change , and the good news is we can do something about it
" in many ways , obama is attempting to reframe the discussion around climate change as a public health issue that affects all of us , while conceding that we do n't fully understand the magnitude of the correlation between rising temperatures and impact on human health
when asked what the average americans can do about all this , the president encouraged ordinary citizens , doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials " to try and make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change
" he also issued a presidential proclamation declaring april 6 - 12 as national public health week " to better understand , communicate and reduce the health impacts of climate change on our communities
" the average americans can also do their part to reduce their own carbon footprint , including : change your incandescent light bulbs to compact fluorescent lights
if every house in the americans switched its bulbs , we could reduce the electricity spent on lighting by half
according to the americans department of energy , this practice can save $ 100 a year on your energy bill
obama did not appear particularly concerned about the current supreme court challenge to the affordable care act
obama did tell me that if the supreme court challenge is upheld , however , there is no plan b. " millions of people would lose their health insurance
