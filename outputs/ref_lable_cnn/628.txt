dan swangard knows what death looks like
as a physician , he has seen patients die in hospitals , hooked to morphine drips and overcome with anxiety
dan swangard was diagnosed in 2013 with a rare form of metastatic cancer
the operation was successful but dan swangard , 48 , knows there 's a strong chance the disease will return
and if he gets to a point where there 's nothing more medicine can do , he wants to be able to control when and how his life ends
" it 's very real for me , " said dan swangard , who lives in bolinas , california " this could be my own issue a year from now
" that 's one of the reasons dan swangard joined a california lawsuit last month seeking to let doctors prescribe lethal medications to certain patients who want to hasten death
if he were given only months to live , dan swangard said , he ca n't say for certain whether he would take them
the lawsuit argues that while it is against the law in california for anyone to assist in another 's suicide , these cases are not suicides
rather , the suit argues , they are choices by a dying person on how his or her life should end and decisions about one 's own body protected under the state constitution
separately , two california state senators have proposed a bill that would allow doctors to prescribe lethal medication to certain terminally ill adults
three states -- oregon , washington and vermont -- already have laws allowing physician - assisted deaths
this time , she and her legal team decided to include among the plaintiffs two doctors with life - threatening illnesses , swangard and a retired san francisco obstetrician
" historically , doctors have been some of the most vocal critics of assisted suicide , also called aid - in - dying
the american medical association still says that " physician - assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician 's role as healer
" similarly , though it has n't taken a position on currently proposed legislation , the california medical association has said that helping patients die conflicts with doctors ' commitment to do no harm
but a recent survey of 21,000 doctors in the american and europe shows views may be shifting
according to medscape , the organization that did the survey , 54 percent of american doctors support assisted suicide , up from 46 percent four years earlier
dan swangard is among those who believe that taking care of patients means letting them choose how their lives should end
that 's not the same as killing patients or facilitating suicide , he said
dan swangard completed his medical residency in san francisco in the middle of the aids crisis ; young men were dying all around him
doctors spend so much time trying to extend life that few focus on what patients want in their last days , he said
" dan swangard 's own illness was discovered in early 2013 during a long overdue check - up
but when the doctor pressed on dan swangard 's stomach , he felt a mango - sized mass. he had a visceral feeling , he said , " something bad was happening
it was the same cancer that took steve jobs ' life -- one that does n't generally respond to chemotherapy or radiation
the doctors told him they believed they got all the cancerous cells
but dan swangard was tormented by questions : am i going to be alive in a year ? is my cancer going to come back ? " i was n't sleeping , i was n't exercising , i was marinating in my own sadness and fear of what this all meant , " he said
' " since his diagnosis , dan swangard said he has had a greater understanding of his patients ' struggles
earlier this year , a physician friend asked him if he 'd be willing to join the california case
when he dies , dan swangard said , he wants to be surrounded by people he loves
he is in remission but he knows that what happens with the cancer is largely outside his control
an mri last year showed a small lesion in his liver , which doctors are watching closely
dr. liner , a fellow plaintiff who only recently met dan swangard , lives with the same uncertainty
like dan swangard , liner does n't know if he would take the medication
