london british police investigating a spectacular heist in the heart of london 's jewelry district said friday they knew a burglar alarm went off but did n't respond
southern monitoring alarm company called the metropolitan police service , also known as scotland yard , at 12:21 a.m. april 3 to report that the burglar alarm had been activated at hatton garden safe deposit , mps said in a prepared statement
" the call was recorded and transferred to the police 's cad ( computer - aided dispatch ) system , " the statement said
" a grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required
this investigation is being carried out locally
" the theft was so big that police have n't come up with a value for what was stolen
a former police official in london has speculated that the loss could run to Â£ 200 million , or $ 300 million , in a remark widely reported by news media
numerous british news organizations put the value of the loss in the hundreds of thousands of pounds
detective chief inspector johnson of the london metropolitan police flying squad said police were still identifying the owners of ransacked safe deposit boxes and trying to contact them to learn what had been lost
the british tabloid daily mirror claimed friday to have obtained closed - circuit tv footage that captured the robbery being carried out
the video showed people inside the building dressed like utility workers with their faces covered
they carried large bags , what looked like drill equipment and other tools , then exited with trash bins
toward the end of the video , a white van can be seen on a street during daytime with individuals loading back their gear and the trash bins
british police told cnn they have not released any video of the heist
when asked about the video published by the daily mirror , police said they could not confirm that it was footage from the hatton garden robbery and that officers have not seen that particular video
the daily mirror 's time stamps , which cnn has not been able to independently verify , show employees locking up for the weekend at 9:19 p.m. on thursday
if the footage , and its interpretation by the newspaper are correct , at least six people were involved in the heist just four minutes later , the first of the thieves , nicknamed " mr. ginger " by the newspaper for his red hair , appears in the building holding a black bag
the heist would not be reported to police for two more days , on tuesday morning when employees of the company arrived for work
