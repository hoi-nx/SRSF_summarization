washington an iranian military observation aircraft flew within 50 yards of an armed navy helicopter over the gulf this month , sparking concern that top iranian commanders might not be in full control of local forces , cnn has learned
it also surprised u.s. commanders because in recent months iranian forces have conducted exercises and operations in the region in a professional manner , one u.s. military official told cnn
the navy mh-60r armed helicopter was flying from the deck of the uss carl vinson on a routine patrol in international airspace , the official said
the iranian aircraft made two passes at the helicopter , coming within 50 yards , before the helicopter moved off , according to the official
the official said the helicopter deliberately broke off and flew away in a ' predictable ' manner so the iranian could not misinterpret any u.s. intentions
but after the recent incident , u.s. naval intelligence did not see it again for two weeks , leading to the conclusion that the incident may have been ordered by a local commander who was then reprimanded by higher - ups
the incident comes as the navy patrols the gulf of aden to watch for iranian ships the u.s. believes are trying to bring weapons to resupply the houthi rebels in yemen
the navy would share such intelligence with saudi arabia , a second u.s. official told cnn .
