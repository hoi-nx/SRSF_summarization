london ever written yourself a note , stuffed it in your pocket and headed out into the world only to discover that , somewhere along your journey , the piece of paper has disappeared ? if you live in the british , there 's a small chance that note has found its way into the hands of 23 - year - old daisy bentley
for the past six years , the london - based artist has scoured the streets of cities and towns looking for those odd bits of paper that flutter to the ground when their owners are n't looking
her quest has uncovered a fascinating , if idiosyncratic , collection of shopping lists , reminders , requests , love notes and motivational musings , all poignant pieces of others ' lives
and now a gallery in london has put a selection on display for the public
" bentley began collecting them six years ago after a note caught her eye one rainy night on a walk in her home town of norwich , england
it 's something she confesses has been a lifelong love -- keepsakes ranging from her mother 's cutlery to her own dead goldfish have ended up carefully preserved in her collection for posterity
more recently , the note collection has led to an exhibition at stour space gallery in london 's hackney wick , where bentley works as a shop and studio manager
it showcases a small part of her 1,500 - strong collection
" i always wanted to showcase them , to see what people 's reactions were and if anyone would come forward , " she said
and while some may find the notion of handwritten notes quaint , as social media and smartphones begin to replace handwriting , bentley says she finds the note collection an interesting way for an artist to explore people 's lives
