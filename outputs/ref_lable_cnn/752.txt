two years ago , the storied marathon monday ended in terror and altered the lives of runners , spectators and those who tried to come to their rescue
just last week , dzhokhar tsarnaev was convicted on 30 charges related to the bombings at the race and the dramatic violence that dragged out for days afterward

they wore white , blue and yellow pins celebrating " one boston day , " which was created to recognize acts of valor and to encourage kindness among bostonians
" i think today will always be a little emotional for me -- marathon monday is my favorite day of the year , and will continue to be , despite these tragedies , " bostonian resident lindsey berkowitz told cnn
" i have so much respect and support for all of the survivors , and hope the city continues to come together on this day to embrace the strength and resilience of bostonian , and the love we all have for this great city
