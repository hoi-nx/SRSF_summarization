outside of that , the highly publicized police shootings in ferguson and north charleston bear only mild resemblance
so what 's changed between the shooting death of brown in ferguson , missouri , in august , and that of scott in north charleston , south carolina , last weekend ? and did the backlash and publicity of the ferguson shooting influence the handling of the north charleston incident ? it 's tough to say for sure , but here are some of the stark differences in the cases , the lessons learned by both police and the public , and concrete changes that could help mend tensions in the future
ferguson : officer darren wilson said he shot brown after the two struggled over darren wilson 's gun , and witnesses to the shooting had different accounts -- often conflicting -- of where darren wilson was , where brown was and whether brown was surrendering or charging the officer
north charleston : though it 's unclear what happened in the moments before a bystander began recording the incident on his phone , it 's 100 % clear from the video that scott was not posing a threat to officer slager when the policeman opened fire on scott as he ran away
takeaway : where brown 's killing was a breeding ground for speculation -- with a stark divide between those who said darren wilson was justified and those who said brown was senselessly slain -- no such debate has emerged in the scott shooting
it would be tough to extrapolate for certain , but it 's possible that the clear - cut imagery of an officer shooting a fleeing man in the back resulted in the prompt charges against the officer , and that quick reaction by authorities in south carolina after the video surfaced headed off the sort of violence that repeatedly unfolded in ferguson as the process of determining darren wilson 's fate dragged on for months
ferguson : black residents outnumber whites in the st. louis suburb by more than a 2 - to - 1 ratio , yet at the time of brown 's shooting , there were only three black officers on the city 's 53 - member force , and there was only one african - american member of the six - member city council
) north charleston : it 's closer to an even split here , with census data from 2010 showing the city is 47 % black and 42 % white
as for the city councils , the latest election in ferguson makes its governing body more representative than north charleston 's
" ferguson : there was no bystander video of brown 's death -- no concrete evidence to support or refute different witness claims about what had transpired
north charleston : it 's unlikely slager would have been fired and charged with murder so quickly if not for video shot by witness santana
even north charleston 's police chief said he was disgusted by the footage of scott 's shooting
and even after ferguson 's police chief resigned last month , two officers were shot during a protest at the ferguson police department
north charleston : after scott was killed in south carolina over the weekend , protests in north charleston have been peaceful so far
the takeaway : some ferguson residents say what happened in their city is playing a role in the way north charleston is handling its own tragedy
ferguson : it took ferguson police six days to publicly identify darren wilson as the officer who shot brown , and in the immediate aftermath of the shooting , then - police chief thomas jackson decided not to visit brown 's family
north charleston : slager was identified by authorities and charged with murder on tuesday , two days after santana shared his video with scott 's family
" ferguson : after brown 's death in august , many asked why darren wilson did n't have a body camera
three months later , president barack obama pledged $ 263 million to procure body cameras and training for up to 50,000 police officers
north charleston : slager also was not wearing a body camera when he killed scott
but after the shooting , the mayor said the city was ordering an additional 150 body cameras " so every officer on the street " in the city will have one
that 's in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered , summey said
the takeaway : not everyone agrees that all officers should wear body cameras
but national urban league president morial said more body cameras will help protect not just the public , but also police
