shanghai , china when china 's biggest auto show opens in shanghai this week , the only models on display will be the ones with four wheels
gone , show organizers hope , will be the scantily - clad " car babes " that in previous years have posed provocatively on car hoods and sashayed through the aisles to draw crowds to the 9 - day event
the focus , instead , will be the latest offerings from an array of global car manufacturers , which -- models or not -- are pulling out all the stops to compete for china customers in what since 2009 has been the world 's largest car market
however , the show comes at a turning point for china 's auto market , which is facing a second year of slower growth in 2015 after a decade - long sales and production frenzy
intense competition for china 's drivers means that car manufacturers are increasingly developing vehicles that cater to china preferences
nissan will use shanghai auto show 2015 to unveil the lannia mid-size sedan , which it says has been specially created for " the rising young china generation
" the country 's gearheads have embraced the suv or sport utility vehicle , sales of which jumped a third last year , and many will feature in the displays planned by dozens of europe , japanese u.s. , south korea and china automakers
this year mg , once known for its sleek sports cars and now owned by shanghai automotive industries corp , enters the fray with its first suv , the gs , while ford will give two new luxury suvs their china market debut -- the lincoln mkx and lincoln navigator , the latter favored by hip hop stars
it would be the first car made in china to hit u.s. showrooms and may pave the way for china brands to shake up the u.s. market like japanese and korean car manufacturers did decades earlier
" the car was seen as a status symbol , " says pierre-henri boutot , a partner at bain and co-author of the report
