they are both necessary for the construction of the james webb space telescope ( james webb space telescope ) , intended as the successor to the hubble instrument that has been operating in space for 25 years
hubble has returned spectacular images during the past quarter century but also helped scientists discover that almost every galaxy has a massive black hole at its heart and that the expansion of the universe is speeding up
now scientists are working on an alternative way to peer into the past and search space for signs of life with james webb space telescope -- scheduled to launch in october 2018 on an ariane 5 rocket from french guiana
hubble is about the size of a school bus but james webb space telescope is as big as a tennis court
nasa says that to see these objects the telescope will have to detect objects which are 10 to 100 times fainter than hubble can currently see
instead of studying visible and ultraviolet light like hubble , the james webb space telescope will work in the infra - red spectrum , allowing scientists to detect more distant targets
the new telescope requires a huge mirror of 25 square meters ( about 270 square feet ) -- and a golf ball of gold ( about 48 grams or 1.7 ounces ) to optimize it for infra - red light
nasa says that the project has four main goals -- namely , to search for the first galaxies formed after the big bang , find out how galaxies evolved , observe the birth of stars and planets and investigate the potential for life on other planets scientists hope the telescope will be able to tell us more about objects that formed 13 billion years ago -- about 700 - 800 million years after the big bang
but closer to home , scientists also believe the new telescope will able to detect planets around nearby stars
