however , sometimes during the course of an airline pilot 's career , or anyone 's career for that matter , stress issues may manifest as depression
as the world learns more about andreas lubitz , the co-pilot on germanwings flight 9525 , it is readily apparent that this young man had psychiatric issues far beyond clinical depression
but andreas lubitz 's illness did n't just appear out of thin air
andreas lubitz 's girlfriend made her concerns public knowledge -- unfortunately after events took their course
considering the hoops andreas lubitz had to jump through to have established himself as a germanwings co-pilot , it 's curious to me how the red flags of his illness were missed
to what hoops am i referring ? first , let 's start with his passion for gliders
second , andreas lubitz had to compete successfully in a selection process just to have the opportunity to train through lufthansa 's flight program , a requirement of germanwings employment
opinion : germanwings and the stigma of mental illness once accepted into the flight program , a rigorous training period began
for primary training , lufthansa utilizes an ab initio ( from the beginning ) program based at a facility the airline owns in goodyear , arizona , near phoenix
the training is geared toward a multi-crew pilot license , or mpl , recognized by the international civil aviation organization
airline pilots in the united states are not licensed in this manner , requiring as much as 1,500 hours to qualify as a co-pilot
andreas lubitz had barely over 600 hours of flight time when he committed his act of horror
as with all of the mpl programs , the training involves an intense period of airline - specific instruction
and to add insult to injury , candidates are not paid during the training until such time as they pass a final check ride
using both actual flight experience in a single - engine airplane and simulator time , the student receives about 250 hours of training
aside from observing and checking performance criteria , would n't at least one instructor have noticed behavioral issues in such an intense environment ? and would n't a fellow trainee have noticed also ? according to reports , andreas lubitz took a leave from his training -- a very untypical behavior
was that not in and of itself a red flag ? would n't a manager in lufthansa 's flight department consider it prudent to reconsider a candidate with an indication of potential issues ? after all , the selection process was most likely highly competitive , with other qualified candidates readily available
once the primary training in arizona was complete , andreas lubitz would have returned to germany and completed more specific schooling on the airbus a320 he was about to fly
but even more curious , according to reports , andreas lubitz disclosed a diagnosis of previous depression to lufthansa
in that regard , i find it difficult to believe that none of andreas lubitz 's colleagues made a less than positive assessment at some point in time
depending upon a pilot 's monthly flight time , salary for pilots can be as much as 20 % lower than the mainline carrier
perhaps enough of a disparity existed for germanwings pilots such that medical leave benefits would not have covered andreas lubitz 's absence
