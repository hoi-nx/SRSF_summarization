the mass killings of armenians in the ottoman , which began 100 years ago friday , is said by some scholars and others to have been the first genocide of the 20th century , even though the word " genocide " did not exist at the time
the issue of whether to call the killings a genocide is emotional , both for armenians , who are descended from those killed , and for turkey , the heirs to the ottoman
some turkey still view the armenians as having been a threat to the ottoman in a time of war , and say many people of various ethnicities -- including turkey -- were killed in the chaos of war
in addition , some turkey leaders fear that acknowledgment of a genocide could lead to demands for huge reparations
however , victims of the mass killings also included some of the 1.8 million armenians living in the caucasus under russia rule , some of whom were massacred by ottoman forces in 1918 as they marched through armenia and azerbaijan
friday is the 100th anniversary of that day
estimates range from 300,000 to 2 million deaths between 1914 and 1923 , with not all of the victims in the ottoman
but most estimates -- including one of 800,000 between 1915 and 1918 , made by ottoman authorities themselves -- fall between 600,000 and 1.5 million
whether due to killings or forced deportation , the number of armenians living in turkey fell from 2 million in 1914 to under 400,000 by 1922
while the death toll is in dispute , photographs from the era document some mass killings
germany is expected to join that group on friday , the 100th anniversary of the start of the killings
a u.n. subcommittee called the killings genocide in 1985 , but current u.n. secretary-general ban ki - moon declines to use the word
also , a year ago , on the eve of the 99th anniversary of red sunday , then - turkey prime minister ( now - president ) recep tayyip erdogan offered condolences for the mass killings , which he said had " inhumane consequences
" while turkey vehemently continues to reject the word " genocide , " his remarks went further than those of any previous turkey leader in acknowledging the suffering of armenians .
