there is a special kind of hell reserved for the women who fall into the clutches of today 's jihadi fighters
we are all familiar with the brutality of isis , the self - anointed islamic state , or boko haram , the nigeria terrorists who have pledged allegiance to isis
this new wave of violent islamist groups proudly brandishes medieval methods of cruelty through modern technology as a tool of recruitment and intimidation
what they do to women has an altogether different purpose : it is part of the larger plan of building a " caliphate , " a sharia - ruled state complete with controls and norms harking back to the seventh century or , rather , to the group 's interpretation of life in the early days of islamic
yazidis girls who slipped isis after its siege of mount sinjar describe how they were sent to slave warehouses along with hundreds of other women
there , they were lined up in groups of 50 and displayed for isis fighters to choose among them , some for marriage , others for sexual slavery
an investigation by human rights watch found " a system of organized rape and sexual assault , sexual slavery , and forced marriage by isis forces , " actions that the group says " are war crimes and may be crimes against humanity
women were not a big part of al qaeda 's immediate plans because al qaeda , unlike isis , viewed the establishment of a caliphate as a distant goal , one for future generations
in contrast , isis is actively engaged in building those social structures
isis and boko haram are enslaving them and incorporating them into the daily life of territories they rule , subjecting them to asphyxiating restrictions and abuses that have caused many of them to attempt suicide , according to some of those who escaped -- a phenomenon reminiscent of afghanistan during the rule of the taliban , another radical islamic group that managed to take control and impose unspeakable rules for women
isis is going to great lengths to prove how its treatment of women , including the selling of yazidis prisoners as slaves , is in keeping with islamic law
its online magazine cites islamic writings proclaiming : " we will conquer your rome , break your crosses , and enslave your women , by the permission of allah
from mosul , iraq 's second - largest city , a modern town until isis conquered it last year , women say , " they have withheld all freedoms from us " and describe oppressive , fear - filled lives
and when it comes to women , the method is one that aims to control them as a way to establish the society they envision , one where some women say life is simply not worth living .
