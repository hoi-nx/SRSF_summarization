to be raped by your cousin 's husband ; be jailed for adultery as your attacker was married ; to suffer the ignominy of global uproar about your jailing and assault , but be pardoned by presidential decree ; and then to endure the shame and rejection from a conservative society that somehow held you to blame
the solution in this society ? marry your attacker
that 's what happened to gulnaz , who was barely 16 when she was raped
she 's now carrying the third child of her attacker , asadullah , who was convicted and jailed -- though this was then reduced
gulnaz 's plight -- like so much in beleaguered afghanistan -- disappeared from the world 's gaze once she was pardoned and released courtesy of a presidential pardon
instead of a new start , what followed for gulnaz was a quiet , afghanistan solution to the " problem " -- a telling sign of where women 's rights stand in afghanistan despite the billions that have poured into this country from the american government and its nato allies during more than a decade of war
we found gulnaz in her family home
smile , the name of the daughter born of the rape , is now a shining little girl , bouncing around the house that her mother shares with asadullah 's first wife -- who is also gulnaz 's cousin
asadullah agreed to let us speak with him and gulnaz because , it seemed , he wanted to show us that things were now settled , that under afghanistan 's version of social morality he had done the right thing
he had rescued gulnaz from shame
" 2011 : thousands sign petition for gulaz release gulnaz remains subdued throughout our meeting and does not once look her husband in the eye
a portrait of gulnaz 's liberator in 2011 , the then - president hamid karzai , hangs on the wall
how gulnaz ended up here requires some explanation
there was pressure upon her to marry her attacker after her release
" unfortunately , gulnaz was heavily pressured to marry her attacker by various people within the government which , in and of itself , was immensely disappointing , " her former attorney , an american citizen named kimberley motley , tells us
" gulnaz was constantly told that neither she nor her daughter would be protected if she did not succumb to their pressure to marry ... gulnaz essentially became a prisoner of her environment
" as an uneducated , young , single mother with no family support , it would have been an uphill battle for gulnaz and her daughter
" it is truly chilling to see how things have gone for gulnaz after the level of international attention her story received -- pregnant with the third child of the man who was once her rapist , accepting a life as his second wife , trapped in his home .
