one of us is a college student , born into a political family , while the other is a former congressman from south carolina and father of five children
one of us served on the selection committee for the profile in courage award
the other will receive this award in recognition of the stand he took when he broke with his party and sacrificed his political career to support responsible action to combat climate change
we share an unwavering belief that the america must lead the world on climate change and seize opportunities for unity , growth and progress
we believe that president kennedy 's courageous leadership in space exploration holds lessons that can help guide us forward
in 1962 , president kennedy , speaking at rice , described the space program that he had first announced when he asked the congress to support his ambitious goal of landing a man on the moon before the end of the decade
opening his speech , kennedy stated simply the effect of man 's scientific pursuit : " the greater our knowledge increases , the greater our ignorance unfolds
our knowledge of the causes and dangers of climate change has increased even as our ignorance of its ramifications has unfolded
but climate change is only scary if we choose to sit , wait and do nothing about it
climate change is a chance for all of us to add a chapter to the story of america triumph and human progress
we believe that america will see opportunity in the danger of climate change just like we saw benefits on earth from travel in space
progress on climate change will require courage
we call on our elected leaders to embrace the climate challenge before us and light a path to greatness once again .
