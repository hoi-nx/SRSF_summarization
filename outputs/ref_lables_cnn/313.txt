criminal justice reform is rapidly becoming one of the few bipartisan issues of our time
america has the highest incarceration rate in the world , with 5 % of the world 's population and 25 % of its prisoners
over 65 million people , or 20 % of the country , have criminal records
most disturbingly , nearly 40 % of our country 's prisoners are african - americans , who only make up 13 % of the general population
it 's time for policymakers to address this criminal justice crisis head on
we must change the dismal status quo
no wonder america 's prison population is out of control
according to the pew charitable trusts , incarceration leads to reduced wages ( 11 % drop ) , employment ( nine weeks lost annually ) , and earnings overall ( 40 % annually )
making matters worse , over half of new prisoners are at or below the poverty line and three - quarters of former prisoners are sent back to jail within five years of their release
young adults are 10 % of the population yet comprise 29 % of the country 's arrests
if politicians are serious , they should consider three specific areas for reform
the federal government 's unsuccessful war on drugs has led to unfair punishments for nonviolent drug offenders who made youthful mistakes
and more generally , judges should be free to tailor their rulings to the specific facts and details of the case -- and the person standing before them
it 's the same for police militarization , which has occurred in large part because washington has supplied local agencies with weapons and tools that are inappropriate for use in local communities
fixing our country 's broken criminal justice system should be at the top of the list .
