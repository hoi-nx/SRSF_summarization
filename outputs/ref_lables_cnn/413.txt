the onslaught on houthis rebels in yemen continued tuesday , with the saudi - led coalition asserting increasing control while locals fled the chaos and casualties piled up -- dozens of civilians among them

saudi 's navy now controls all yemen ports , allowing only closely watched non-military medical goods to pass its blockade , according to the source

the state - run saudi press agency quoted saudi minister of foreign affairs prince saud al-faisal as saying tuesday that he would not condemn iranian , but would instead test the country 's intentions " by extending our hands to it as a muslim neighbor to open a new page
on the other side , iranian deputy foreign minister amir-abdollahian said that officials in his country and saudi can help bring about a " political solution " in yemen , according to iranian 's state - run press tv , citing afp
