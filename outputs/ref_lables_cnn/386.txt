ferguson , missouri change has come to ferguson
after months of turmoil and upheaval , months of frustration and anger , the beleaguered city has a new governing board
buoyed by a higher - than - normal 30 % turnout , two african candidates won their wards tuesday night to make the six - member city council 50 % black
ferguson 's population of about 21,000 is 70 % black , but the city council was predominantly white , as is the police force
supporters of both candidates said that from the tragedy of a young black man 's death , a new day dawned in ferguson
i love you , " an emotional jones said at a party held at drake 's restaurant
she will become the first black woman ever to sit on the ferguson council
jones , who resigned her job as a mary kay cosmetics sales director to run for office , said in her ward , she heard the same complaints from a 65 - year - old black man as she did from his white peers
" my job is to be that catalyst so we can put a new face on ferguson , " she said
bell said he wants ferguson 's police officers to be judged by the number of people they know in the community , not by the number of tickets they issue
one other seat was up for grabs in ferguson
fletcher told voters he was best suited for a city council job despite his critics ' claims that he was too entrenched in the old guard
that would be an invaluable asset in getting ferguson back on its feet , he said
the city is required to approve a new budget by the end of june , and the new council will have to look for alternative sources of revenue to replace the $ 3 million or so lost from money generated by traffic tickets and fines
amid the rain , ferguson opened its polls at 6 in the morning with concern that few would come out to vote in such a pivotal election
it was the first city election since white police officer darren wilson shot and killed unarmed black teenager brown in august
the candidates who had run campaigns calling for change hoped a decent turnout would weigh in their favor
charred , heavily damaged buildings still stand as scars of ferguson 's despair and anger
even though she was aware of the problems around her , brown 's killing , she said , woke her up
she thought he had energy and was more in sync with ferguson 's youth
changing the way ferguson polices its people was no. 1 on many a voter 's agenda
even the candidates who take issue with the doj report on ferguson agreed that the city needed change when it came to policing
mcclellan referred to the doj 's finding that ferguson issued fines and traffic tickets to generate revenue for the city
" that 's not a good thing , " mcclellan said as he stood in the drizzle at a polling station , hoping to persuade voters who were still undecided
he said brown 's shooting brought a lot of bad things to light
when the rain let up for a few minutes , a stream of voters trickled into the first presbyterian church in downtown ferguson to cast their votes
ellory and kathy glenn both voted for fletcher 's opponent , hudgins , a political novice who attracted attention as a white man who routinely stood with protesters on the front lines
hudgins likes to talk about how he married a black woman and has a biracial teenage son
he said the couple moved to ferguson after he retired from the marine corps in 1995 because they felt it was a racially welcoming place
but now , after all the problems rose to the surface , it 's time for fresh blood on the council , glenn said
