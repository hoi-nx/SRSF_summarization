since the headline - grabbing murder of u.s. journalist foley by isis militants eight months ago , the world has been regularly confronted with a modern form of an ancient , primally horrifying method of execution
these highly ritualized killings have galvanized international opposition to the group -- and helped attract a wave of foreign recruits to the isis cause
but beyond this , some experts such as psychology professor arie w. kruglanski suggest , the wave of savage beheadings may be having an unlikely knock - on effect
arie w. kruglanski , distinguished professor of psychology at the university of maryland , says the frequent , high profile reports of isis beheadings could result in psychologically " priming " people to be more inclined to emulate them , or threaten to , during moments of conflict or extreme stress
because of the attention that jihadist beheadings have commanded internationally , " the very concept of beheading , that was virtually non-existent in our unconscious prior to these events being propagated , is now there , " he told cnn
but neither has placed the practice in the global spotlight to anything like the same degree as isis 's propaganda , in which the threat is extended to " disbelievers " around the globe
a similar copy - cat effect had been observed with the phenomenon of school mass shootings , said arie w. kruglanski
( whether he was inspired by isis propaganda remains unclear ; he was reportedly a recent convert to islam and had posted osama bin laden and beheading content online
) whether or not " non-jihadist " beheadings are on the increase , this brutal method of killing has inarguably come to occupy a larger part of the public consciousness , as isis 's beheadings have grabbed international headlines and the terror group 's call on supporters to attack " disbelievers " has reverberated worldwide
" beyond this , threats to behead also seem to have gained a wider currency among non-jihadists , said arie w. kruglanski
roderic broadhurst , a professor of crime , policing , security and justice at the australian national university said the isis beheadings may have shown those engaging in attention - seeking threats of violence a sure way to get noticed
the threats and banner demonstrated the way in which the spread of beheading rhetoric may be having a psychologically " brutalizing " effect on society , said arie w. kruglanski , intensifying the violence of our thoughts , words and actions
justin hastings , a senior lecturer in international relations and comparative politics at the university of sydney , said that while isis beheadings " might inspire some people to prefer that particular way to kill people as opposed to others , " he believed it would eventually fall out of favor
while beheading had been adopted by isis as their stock in trade , it would inevitably lose its shock value , driving jihadists to ramp up the levels of atrocity in order to continue capturing international attention
one such dramatic escalation occurred in february , when isis released a propaganda video in which the tactic of beheading was abandoned altogether for fresh horrors -- burning jordanian pilot moath al-kasasbeh alive in a cage
while the executions are viewed by the vast majority of people as repellent , arie w. kruglanski said , they could exert a strong pull for sympathizers by projecting " a sense of godlike power
