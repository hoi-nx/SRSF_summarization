slager , 33 , has been fired , officials said wednesday
she told abc she has n't watched the video of the shooting
slager initially told investigators that he used a taser in a confrontation saturday with walter scott , who was pulled over for a busted taillight
but walter scott went for the taser , according to slager

" slager was proficient with the nonlethal taser
before the officer starts firing at walter scott , the video shows a dark object falling behind him and hitting the ground
later in the video , when slager approaches walter scott 's body , he drops a dark object next to the man
it 's unknown whether walter scott took the officer 's taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body

at the time , slager was searching for a suspect who was described as being 5 - feet - 5 - inches tall
" slager was later cleared in that incident
personnel documents describe slager as " enthused " when he joined the force and said he demonstrated " great officer safety tactics " in dealing with suspects
