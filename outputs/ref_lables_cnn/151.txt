the new emojis are here ! on thursday , apple released a new version of its mobile operating system that includes more diversity than ever when it comes to the race , ethnicity and sexual orientation of its emojis -- those cute little images that users can insert into text messages or emails when words alone just wo n't cut it
the reaction to this new lineup is , as should be expected with almost anything new in today 's hypersensitive climate , a range of cheers and jeers
rather they are seen as recognition that their own ethnicity , sexual orientation , race or even hair color is part of mainstream america -- despite what others might say
now there 's a range of emoji skin tones to pick from , including yellow , brown and black
in fact , thanks to apple , we may even see brown santa emojis this december
apple has now given us gay and lesbian couple emojis , kissing with a heart over their heads
it 's not yet clear if a person who likes to use same - sex kissing emoji couples can be denied service by a person who objects on grounds of " religious liberty
even expanding the flags represented by emojis , as apple has done , comes at some peril
apparently canada is overjoyed that finally apple has included it
i must admit that being partially of palestinian heritage , it 's heartening to see that despite the fact that some refuse to recognize a palestinian state , apple has chosen to now include a palestinian flag emoji
of course the bigger question in the whole diverse - emoji issue is : what took apple so long ? how hard could it have been to add different skin colors to pick from ? that the company ( finally ) did is a step in the right direction : america 's demographics are changing , so our representations of who we are -- even representations as tiny as emojis -- should reflect this
apple has " evolved " in showing diversity -- from brown people to same - sex couples
