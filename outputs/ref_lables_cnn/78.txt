saturday 's deadly earthquake in nepal was the " big one " experts were waiting for based on the region 's history
with the last major earthquake in 1934 , the concern was not if , but when the next " great " earthquake would hit , said ravilious , author of the 2014 article , " kathmandu 's earthquake nightmare
" in a landlocked country like nepal , where infrastructure is fragile to begin with , the consequences of such an earthquake had the potential to be " much more serious , " ravilious told cnn
those fears were realized when a magnitude - 7.8 earthquake centered less than 50 miles from the national capital of kathmandu rocked nepal , toppling homes , historic buildings and leaving more 1,400 dead , authorities said
" this event , while large and tragic , is not unusual for that region of the world as the whole mountain range stretching from tibet almost to caspian sea is an area of major collision between continental plates , " said geological engineer nicholas sitar with the university of california , berkeley 's department of civil and environmental engineering
what 's different this time from 1934 is the size and density of kathmandu , which suffered the brunt of damage in both earthquakes
" the population has exploded in several decades , " usgs spokesman gavin hayes told cnn
" when you get a vast population in the kind of building infrastructure that is n't equipped to handle shaking of an earthquake this size , that 's when you see the scale of disaster we 're seeing now
" an earthquake is the ground shaking caused by a sudden slip on a fault , according to the usgs
