that 's the mayor 's response to an artist 's apology and offer to cover the cost of fixing the " lucy " statue that has put the new york town of celoron in the spotlight this week
the bronze figure of comedian and area native lucille ball has elicited comparisons to a " walking dead " zombie and inspired the facebook campaign " we love lucy ! get rid of this statue
" the sculpture , a gift to the town from its original owners , has been on display since 2009
artist poulin has " had plenty of opportunity to step forward , and our last conversation he wanted $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 , " celoron mayor schrecengost said
" after the story of the statue caught fire online this weekend , poulin publicly apologized monday for his " most unsettling sculpture " in a letter to the hollywood reporter
" from the day of its installation , i have shared my disappointment in the final outcome and have always believed it to be by far my most unsettling sculpture , not befitting of lucy 's beauty or my ability as a sculptor
he said the town is looking for a new sculptor to fix the statue
it seems that nearby jamestown , ny , also has ties to lucille ball 's early years and might be interested in its own tribute to the comedic legend
schrecengost 's tuesday statement referred to an anonymous facebook campaign that he claims is aimed at raising jamestown 's lucille ball profile at the expense of the celoron statue
