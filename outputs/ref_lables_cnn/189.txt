canberra , australia before " bali nine " duo , chan and sukumaran , the last australia executed for drug offenses abroad was van by singapore in 2005
but the australia public 's view of indonesia , and anger with its government , will take much longer to subside
while working assiduously behind the scenes to argue for clemency for the " bali nine " duo , abbott nevertheless appeared to accept the inevitability of the executions , even as he publicly reiterated australia 's opposition to capital punishment
as the duo attracted greater public sympathy -- including from a joint statement by the last six prime ministers urging jakarta to reconsider -- the good , great and popular in australia society also united behind the plea for mercy

given the degree of ongoing cooperation on important issues , such as terrorism , money laundering and drug trafficking , australia and indonesia will continue to work together behind the scenes at the operational levels
but while the indonesia public appears divided as to whether their government acted wisely , the australia public is united that jakarta did not
