seoul , south korea on march 20 , 2013 , a cyberattack brought chaos to several banks and media outlets in south korea
and south korea investigators say they have proof -- the actual malicious codes used in the attacks
the latest high - profile digital incursion , in december , attempted to steal data from south korea 's nuclear operator , including plant blueprints and personnel information
the attack , which james said was simpler than " dark seoul , " came just a few days after sony pictures said their systems has been " hacked , " another attack the south korea authorities blamed on north
seoul announced in mid-march that some of the ip addresses used in december incursion could be traced back to shenyang , china , which can be easily accessed from the north border
codes used in the attack were said to be similar in pattern to those used by the north , south korea authorities said
" the malicious codes used in the attack were same in composition and working methods as " kimsuky " codes known to be used by north , " the prosecutor 's office that leads 17 other government agencies and internet companies in the investigation said in the statement in march
" but many experts say north appears to be investing more in cyberwarfare because it is cheaper than spending on conventional weapons and can cause significant economic damage to its southern rival
indeed south korea 's defense ministry estimates that north is operating a " cyberarmy " of 6,000 workers as it focuses on strengthening its asymmetrical warfare capability
many in south korea believe not enough effort is being put into defending against cyberattacks
a report by the korea institute for industrial economics and trade , a government - funded think tank , estimates that " dark seoul " caused about $ 820 million worth of damage
its report , published in 2014 , predicted that by 2020 , south korea could be exposed to hacking attacks causing up to $ 25 billion in economic damage .
