so while there were some loud , dirty guitars at the 2015 rock and roll hall of fame induction ceremony in cleveland on saturday night , there was as much recognition for rock 's antecedents in soul and blues , speaking less to a particular taxonomy than a spirit that 's beyond words
it 's easy to talk of such spirit when paul mccartney is there to honor ringo starr , and ono is on hand as well
speaking briefly backstage , ono expressed feeling that it was wonderful for ringo starr to be honored , " just sad john and george are n't here , " referring to her late husband john lennon and beatles guitarist and fellow songwriter george harrison
ringo starr was certainly happy to be there â after a long wait , he 's the final beatles to be inducted as a solo act
fifty - one years earlier , ringo starr had been in town to play the very same hall ; he admitted backstage that he did n't remember the cops stopping the show during " all my loving " and making the beatles return to the dressing room for ten minutes until the fans could be calmed
ringo starr said in a backstage interview that he could n't recall the incident specifically , but admitted that there had been a lot of shows in between
others receiving rock and roll hall of fame honors included paul butterfield blues band , early soul act the 5 royales , singer withers , punk rockers green day , lou reed , joan jett & the blackhearts and stevie ray vaughan
beck , yeah yeah yeahs , withers , seymour stein hit rock and roll hall of fame 's weekend festivities the 76 - year old soul legend has n't performed live in many years but had hinted in the months leading up to the induction ceremonies that he might sing once more
" the moment of relative levity was welcome after moving tributes paid to the late lou reed by smith and lou reed 's widow , music artist laurie anderson , who shared the three rules for life that they came up with : " one : do n't be afraid of anyone ; two : get a really good b --- --- t detector and learn how to use it ; three : be really , really tender
she recalled a night when they wound up in the same hotel and lou reed invited her up
