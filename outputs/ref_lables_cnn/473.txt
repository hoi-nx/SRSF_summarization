tokyo it 's a bird -- it 's a plane -- it 's an insanely fast japanese bullet train
a japan railways maglev train hit 603 kilometers per hour ( 374 miles per hour ) on an experimental track in yamanashi tuesday , setting a decisive new world record
" the train broke its own record from last thursday , when it ran at 590 kilometers per hour ( 366 miles per hour ) on a test track
that beat the old record of 581 kilometers per hour ( 361 miles per hour ) , which was set in 2003 during another japanese maglev test
by contrast , the fastest train in the united states , amtrak 's acela express , is only capable of 241 kilometers per hour ( 150 miles per hour ) , though it usually plods along at half that speed
japan railways has been testing their train to figure out the best operational speed for a planned route between tokyo and nagoya , scheduled to begin service in 2027
