" the sentencing phase of the federal case will resume monday
dzhokhar tsarnaev was convicted april 8 on all 30 counts , including 17 that carry a possible death penalty

boston bombing survivor : i am not limiting myself tamerlan , dying from gunshot wounds and having been run over by the car his brother was driving as he fled , became combative in the ambulance
