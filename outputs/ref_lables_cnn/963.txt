relations between iran and saudis have always been thorny , but rarely has the state of affairs been as venomous as it is today
in its most recent incarnation , the iran - saudis conflict by proxy has reached yemen in a spiral that both sides portray as climatic
for riyadh and its regional allies , the saudis military intervention in yemen -- " operation decisive storm " -- is the moment the sunni arab nation finally woke up to repel the expansion of shia - iran influence
for tehran and its regional allies -- including the houthis movement in yemen -- saudis 's actions are in defense of a retrogressive status quo order that is no longer tenable
he was up front and called tehran 's steep deterioration of relations with the saudis over the last decade as one of the principal burdens on iran foreign policy
from lebanon and afghanistan to pakistanis and the gaza strip , the iran - saudis rivalry and conflict through proxy has been deep and costly
but if the questions of syria and iraq prevented a pause in hostilities , the saudis military intervention in yemen since late march has all but raised the stakes to unprecedentedly dangerous levels
unlike in syria and in iraq , the saudis military is now directly battling it out with iran - backed rebels in yemen
" iran provides financial support , weapons , training and intelligence to houthis , " gerald feierstein , a u.s. state department official and former yemen ambassador , told a congressional hearing last week
" we believe that iran sees opportunities with the houthis to expand its influence in yemen and threaten saudis and gulf arab interests
" the iran find the charges biased and point to the saudis airstrikes in yemen as a much bigger case of meddling in a neighbor 's affairs
this came as news broke about two iran teenage boys who had reportedly been sexually assaulted by the police while visiting saudis
general purdastan , the commander of the iran ground forces , taunted the saudis
ayatollah ali - akbar hashemi rafsanjani , a former president and arguably iran 's most vocal advocate of better iran - saudis relations
seeking a political solution is iran 's stated aim for the yemen crisis , but the prospects of such an effort succeeding are slim
iran foreign minister zarif has provided a four - point plan : to get a ceasefire , to encourage the provision of humanitarian aid , to promote political dialogue among warring yemen parties , and to achieve the formation of an inclusive government
but the iran proposal also asks for an end to saudis airstrikes
as zarif put it , " iran and saudis need to talk , but we can not talk to determine the future of yemen
" the saudis have thus far ignored the iran proposal
" not only do the saudis not have any faith in any iran - drafted political package that is welcomed by the houthis , but riyadh believes that the international disposition favors it
the turkish were enthusiastic at first about stopping the houthis -- but in his visit to tehran last week , turkish president recep tayyip erdogan made it clear that he has prioritized iran - turkish trade relations over rivalry in yemen , and emphasized a political solution for the yemen conflict
alternatively , given the absence of willing states to contribute ground troops , riyadh will have to contemplate a full - scale invasion of yemen
as tempting as it might be for tehran to see the saudis bleed in yemen , the danger of this conflict further fuelling sectarian tensions in the middle east will undermine broader regional iran interests
