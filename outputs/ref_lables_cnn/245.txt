the compartment was extremely crowded
twenty - five years later , i continue to hear similar stories of women and girls being harassed on local transportation and other public spaces
the stories can be stomach churning : men masturbating on buses and at bus stops , boys stalking young girls -- both physically and online , men taking pictures of women without permission and uploading them on the internet
a study by we the people found that 80 % of women in mumbai had been street harassed , primarily in crowded areas like trains and railway platforms
most people , including women , only think of sexual violence as rape and tend to overlook touching , groping and stalking , not to mention the " milder " forms of ogling , leering , catcalling and whistling , even though all of this can be intimidating
indeed , many women choose to limit their hours outside , select more conservative clothes , or opt for a longer but safer route home
" the reality is that sexual harassment in india is pervasive in all aspects of life
it hits you in the face every day when you walk down the street , take local transport , go about your daily routine or at the workplace
according to united nations women 's report , 1 in 3 women around the world face some form of sexual violence at least once in their lifetime
this statistic is likely even higher in india
out of the 2,000 women who have attended workshops i 've conducted , only a handful of them have never been at the receiving end of harassment in some setting of their daily lives
why are we constantly limiting our options rather than confronting sexual harassment ? over the past two years , i have been working to encourage women to talk about their experiences and realize the tremendous potential power they hold within themselves through acknowledging the problem and being a part of the change to shift the culture around sexual harassment in india
india has laws for sexual violence in public spaces as well as at the workplace , and knowing these rules gives women the power to confront her harasser
however , despite the barriers , two recent cases in india provide proof that even when the perpetrator is in a position of immense power , coming forward to report sexual harassment can make a difference
similarly , last year , tarun tejpal , founder of one of india 's leading media companies , was arrested for sexually assaulting his employee in an elevator
women everywhere just need to find the courage to speak up
we can not accept harassment as part of our daily routine
