americans on the americans ' no - fly list will now be privy to information about why they have been banned from commercial flights and be given the opportunity to dispute their status , according to court documents filed by the justice department this week
the decision was part of an aclu lawsuit brought on behalf of 13 americans on the list
" unfortunately , we 've found that the government 's new redress process falls far short of constitutional requirements because it denies our clients meaningful notice , evidence , and a hearing
" people on the no - fly list , managed by the fbi 's terrorist screening center , are prohibited from boarding a commercial flight for travel into or out of the americans
before the change , americans citizens and permanent residents who inquired with the government about being denied aircraft boarding received a letter that neither confirmed nor denied their inclusion on the no - fly list
those who appear on the no - fly list will then have further opportunity to dispute their status in writing , with supporting materials or exhibits , and will receive a final written decision from the transportation security administration
