one year after it was perpetrated , the kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls by a jihadist group in nigeria remains a crime almost too horrifying to comprehend : hundreds of teenaged girls , just finishing school , destined perhaps for significant achievement -- kidnapped , never to be seen again
" this crime has rightly caused outrage both in nigeria and across the world , " the country 's president - elect , buhari , said tuesday in marking the anniversary
" today is a time to reflect on the pain and suffering of the victims , their friends and families
our thoughts and prayers , and that of the whole nigeria nation , are with you today
" the girls were abducted on the night of april 14 - 15 , 2014 , in the town of chibok , in northeastern nigeria , about a two - hour drive from the border with cameroon
the government girls secondary school had been closed for a month because of the danger posed by boko haram militants , who are opposed to western education , particularly for girls
then they forced the girls from their dormitories , loaded them into trucks and drove them into the forest
on tuesday , malala yousafzai , the 17 - year - old pakistani girl who was shot in the face for speaking out in favor of girls ' education , sent a message to the kidnapped girls
" i am one of the millions of people around the world who keep you and your families foremost in our thoughts and prayers , " she wrote
nigeria 's current president , goodluck jonathan , was defeated in his campaign for re-election , in part , it is thought , because he failed to effectively combat boko haram
boko haram still controls swathes of northeastern nigeria
according to unicef , 800,000 children have been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict between the nigeria military , civilian self - defense groups , and boko haram
and it says boko haram continues to kill in large numbers
