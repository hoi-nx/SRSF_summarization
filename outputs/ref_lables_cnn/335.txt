american pharmacists association is discouraging its members from participating in executions
on monday , the group voted at its annual meeting to adopt a ban as an official policy , stating that " such activities are fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers
" this bolsters the association 's previous positions to oppose the use of the term " drug " for chemicals used in lethal injection and to oppose laws that require or prohibit pharmacists from participation in lethal injection cases
the group acted this week because of increased public attention on lethal injection , said spinnler , spokeswoman for the american pharmacists association
this was prompted by clayton lockett 's execution by lethal injection nearly one year ago in which he writhed on a gurney for 43 minutes before he died from a heart attack
thirty - two sates allow capital punishment , and lethal injection is still the most common method
