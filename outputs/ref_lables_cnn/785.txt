would you want a tv program about your family history to include details of a distant , long - deceased relative who had owned slaves ? seriously , who in their right mind would want to be tarnished by the sins of an ancestor you had no connection to other than a remote bloodline ? i would n't , and neither did ben affleck , who lobbied producers of a pbs show , " finding your roots , " to remove any reference to his great - great - great grandfather cole , a georgia slave owner in the mid- 1800 's , in an episode that looked at ben affleck 's family history
) here 's the thing that might surprise many , given the tendency of the media to exploit any potentially scandalous material : the show 's producer , harvard professor gates , apparently acquiesced to ben affleck 's request , because when the episode aired in october 2014 , there was no mention of the star 's slave - owning ancestor
when gates asked how he should respond to ben affleck 's request to delete the material , lynton responded , " all things being equal , i would definitely take it out
" and on tuesday , ben affleck , via facebook , admitted that he had urged gates to excise any reference to his slave - owning relative
ben affleck explained , " i did n't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves
after all , ben affleck noted as much in his facebook post , writing that gates " agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices i disagreed with
so it 's unlikely that it was simply happenstance that it left out any reference to ben affleck 's familial slave ownership connection
in any event , pbs has launched an internal review to determine if the show violated its own editorial standards
let 's be clear : " finding your roots " is not an investigative news show ; it 's an entertainment program
in the case of mr. ben affleck we focused on what we felt were the most interesting aspects of his ancestry -- including a revolutionary war ancestor , a third great - grandfather who was an occult enthusiast , and his mother who marched for civil rights during the freedom summer of 1964
" ben affleck has noted that he regrets asking pbs to not include information about his " distant relative
ben affleck had every right to ask for the information about a long - deceased distant relative to be left out of the show
