mullah mullah omar is " still the leader " of the taliban 's self - declared islamic emirate of afghan
that appears to be the primary message of a biography , just published by the taliban , of the reclusive militant who is credited with founding the group in the early 1990s
the taliban 's " cultural commission " released the 11 - page document in several different translations on the movement 's website , ostensibly to commemorate the 19th anniversary of an april 4 , 1996 , meeting in afghan 's kandahar province when an assembly of afghan swore allegiance to mullah omar
several afghan observers say the biography is aimed at dispelling rumors of mullah omar 's demise
" mullah omar was famously camera - shy during the taliban 's six - year rule over most of afghan
to this day , there are only a handful of photographs of the one - eyed leader
mullah omar then all but disappeared after a u.s. - led bombing campaign routed the taliban from kabul in 2001
the biography challenges rumors of mullah omar 's death by offering a description of his daily work schedule , which begins with prayers , study of the quran , and then delivering " orders in a specific way to his jihadi commanders
according to the biography , mullah omar was born in 1960 in a village called chah-i-himmat in afghan 's kandahar province
in one battle , the biography claims , mullah omar and a fighter named mullah biradar akhund destroyed four soviet tanks , even though they were armed with only four rpg rounds
afghan historians have documented the rapid rise of the taliban in the chaotic years after the communist government in kabul collapsed in 1992
the taliban biography says that mullah omar and his compatriots " launched their struggle and fight against corruption and anarchy " after an initial meeting in kandahar in june 1994
while the document denounces the taliban 's post- 9/11 overthrow at the hands of a u.s. - backed coalition of rival afghan fighters , it makes no mention of the taliban 's alliance with bin laden and al qaeda
though taliban militants have continued to battle the u.s. - backed government across afghan , mullah omar has not been seen or heard from in years
the movement claims he continues to oversee a taliban leadership council , judiciary and nine executive commissions , as well as military commanders who operate in all 34 provinces of afghan
