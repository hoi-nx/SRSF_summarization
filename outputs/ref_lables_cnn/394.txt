new york a nypd detective apologized friday for an angry exchange with an uber driver that was caught on video and landed him on modified assignment
i sincerely apologize , " cherry told wnbc 's jonathan dienst
cherry , an nypd detective assigned to the fbi 's joint terrorism task force with top - secret security clearance , faces suspension , reassignment or loss of his clearance after the video of the altercation went viral
" if the conversation initially went differently , we probably would have shook hands at the end of that encounter
" the altercation began monday when the uber driver gestured to a detective in an unmarked car to use his blinker after he was allegedly attempting to park without using it , according to seth , a passenger in the car who uploaded the video to youtube
the video picks up seconds after the detective began yelling at the driver and mocking his accent , and also shows the unmarked car with lights flashing pulled over behind the uber car
in the video , the detective tells the driver he has committed " three traffic and law violations " and then becomes irate and uses expletives toward the comparably calm driver
a visibly upset police commissioner bratton on wednesday said the detective was placed on modified assignment pending an investigation
" " you ca n't judge three minutes of a tape involving me and me alone as indication that that 's the kind of practice of the nypd , " he added
bratton , who said the detective was on duty at the time , issued an apology to the driver and passengers
" in the video , after the detective steps back to his car , the uber driver , who moved to america less than two years ago , turns to the passenger and thanks him for recording the video
that 's really inappropriate , " the passenger tells the driver
" when the detective comes back , he is irate and does n't allow the driver to speak
" i do n't care what you have to say , people are allowed to park their cars on the side of the street without your interference , " the detective tells the driver
" the nypd said the internal affairs bureau is investigating the incident
" the behavior in the video is wrong and unacceptable and we appreciate the nypd investigating the incident
we are in touch with our driver - partner who was subjected to this terrible experience and will continue to provide any support he needs , " uber said tuesday
the board will either refer the decision to the nypd with a disciplinary recommendation , or decide to bring up the officer on administrative charges , with the decision presented to the police commissioner
