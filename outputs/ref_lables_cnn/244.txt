five decades later , i find it almost unfathomable that a politician from my own state is attempting to launch his presidential campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation
but that is what rand paul , who today declared he 's running for president of the american , is doing
since coming to the u.s. senate , rand paul has tried to sell himself as a different type of republican
the problem for rand paul , and the republican at large , is that they do n't back up their words with their policies
a quick survey of sen. rand paul 's positions makes clear that he does not
rand paul kicked off his announcement speech in louisville by declaring " i have a message that is loud and clear : we have come to take our country back
" i have no doubt that under rand paul 's leadership , he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the civil rights act -- which rand paul has done since landing on the national stage ; when there was no department of education -- a department he thinks " should be done away with ; " when women did n't have choices -- choices rand paul seeks to limit in washington ; when dreamers were n't protected from deportation -- protections rand paul currently opposes
when asked about the need for a more robust voting rights act following the supreme court 's dismantling of the law , rand paul dismissively remarked , " we have an african - american president
" when president obama stood with john lewis and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the edmund pettus bridge last month to mark the 50th anniversary of bloody sunday , he inspired us all by saying : " with effort , we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity
what i heard today , did n't change the facts about rand paul 's record
