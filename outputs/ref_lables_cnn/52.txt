a new kansas law banning a common second - term abortion procedure is the first of its kind in the united states
the law , signed by kansas gov. brownback on tuesday , bans what it describes as " dismemberment abortion " and defines as " knowingly dismembering a living unborn child and extracting such unborn child one piece at a time from the uterus
" supporters of the measure described it as a groundbreaking step , while opponents warned it was dangerous and among the most restrictive abortion laws in the country
" " kansas is now not only the sole state with this atrocious law ; it also now has more restrictions on abortion than any state in the united states , " the advocacy group said in a facebook post
carol tobias , the president of national right to life , said in a statement that the kansas law was the first of what her organization hopes " will be many state laws
