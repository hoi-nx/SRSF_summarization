an oklahoma reserve sheriff 's deputy accused of fatally shooting a man he says he meant to subdue with a taser pleaded not guilty tuesday to a charge of second - degree manslaughter
at the hearing , the judge granted bates permission to go to the bahamas for a family vacation
that decision prompted a response from the family of harris , the man bates killed
we are , however , surprised that mr. bates would choose to go on a vacation to the bahamas during this tumultuous time
whether intended or not , mr. bates ' vacationing in the bahamas at this time sends a message of apathy with respect to the shooting and harris 's life
" bates ' preliminary hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. july 2
bates claims he meant to stun harris with a taser after harris fled from officers , but mistakenly shot harris with a gun instead
