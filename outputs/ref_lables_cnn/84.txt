debates on climate change can break down fairly fast
there are those who believe that mankind 's activities are changing the planet 's climate , and those who do n't
but a new way to talk about climate change is emerging , which shifts focus from impersonal discussions about greenhouse gas emissions and power plants to a very personal one : your health
it 's easy to brush aside debates involving major international corporations , but who would n't stop to think -- and perhaps do something -- about their own health , or the health of their children ? this new way of talking about climate change -- and linking it to public health issues -- was part of a roundtable discussion tuesday at howard university 's college of medicine
president obama joined american surgeon general dr. murthy and epa administrator gina mccarthy for a roundtable discussion on the topic as part of national public health week
" i think we 've always known -- or at least in the 20th century we 've understood -- that environment has an impact on public health , " the president told cnn 's dr. gupta
" i remember when i first went to college in los angeles in 1979 , the air was so bad that you could n't go running outside , " obama said
" " there are a whole host of public health impacts that are going to hit home , so we 've got to do better in protecting vulnerable american , " obama continued
the impacts of climate change could make the situation worse
deese cited a recent study by the american thoracic society that found seven out of 10 doctors reported climate change is contributing to more health problems among their patients
" the good news is that , in addition to having doctors and nurses , public health officials , schools of medicine joining together to raise awareness -- and to in some cases impact their practice -- they anticipate , for example , increased asthma instances , and plan ahead of time to deal with those , " obama told gupta
" " communities can start planning for prevention and mitigation efforts more effectively , and hopefully the other thing that happens is that families and parents join with these doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials to try to make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change , " said obama
the impacts of climate change on health will depend on a multitude of factors , according to the epa
" these factors include the effectiveness of a community 's public health and safety systems to address or prepare for the risk and the behavior , age , gender , and economic status of individuals affected , " the epa says on its website
" impacts will likely vary by region , the sensitivity of populations , the extent and length of exposure to climate change impacts , and society 's ability to adapt to change
" the who estimates climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050
" " around the world , variations in climate are affecting , in profoundly diverse ways , the air we breathe , the food we eat , and the water we drink , " writes dr. neira , director of the who 's public health and environment department
" still , there exists a sizable group of people who doubt climate change is happening
" framing global warming as a public health issue rather than as an environmental or national security one produces the most emotionally compelling response among people , since it focuses on the immediate implications a warmer climate would have on people 's lives , " the article says
" when the clean air act was passed , not only was there a terrible smog in los angeles , it was true in most metropolitan areas across the country , " obama said
