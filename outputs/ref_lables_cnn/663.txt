tokyo with the world watching , in his historic address to a joint session of the u.s. congress , the first ever by a japan prime minister , abe surprised nobody by missing a great opportunity to dispel worries and tensions he raises with his revisionist views on history
during this 70th year anniversary of the end of world war ii , abe has been disappointing on japan 's wartime history because he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for japan 's wartime actions in east asia where the bitter legacies remain divisive
and this " abenesia " is harmful to japan 's international image , riles china and korean and thereby undermines the bilateral security agenda
washington deliberately set the bar on history very low for abe because the barack obama administration is more focused on the shared perception with tokyo that contemporary china is a threat requiring a collective response
president barack obama pulled out all the stops to give abe a red carpet welcome because he has delivered more on fulfilling washington 's longstanding security demands than all of his predecessors combined
it is also problematic that abe 's stance on history is a factor in hindering trilateral security cooperation with korean , something the american sees as essential
carefully tailoring his remarks to his audience , abe hit the right notes in many respects , and even inched forward on history
he did express " eternal condolences " about the loss of american lives in world war ii , and noted , " enemies that had fought each other so fiercely have become friends bonded in spirit
many nations play fast and loose with their unpleasant histories , but abe is mounting a significant retreat from japan 's repentant views expressed and embraced since the mid- 1990s , and actively promotes a valorizing and exonerating history under the banner of patriotic education
he is putting his personal agenda on history ahead of the national interest and therefore not meeting the test of statesmanship
of course there is nothing that abe could say that would satisfy china or korean , two nations that suffered longest and most from japan depredations from the late 19th century
in japan , there has been a lot of pressure on abe to explicitly invoke the language of the 1995 murayama statement that stands as the most forthright apology and acknowledgment of war responsibility
murayama clearly condemned " mistaken national policy , " " self - righteous nationalism , " " colonial rule " and " aggression , " but abe has spent his entire political career renouncing this so - called " masochistic " view of japan 's wartime history
fatalistically , abe said , " history is harsh
" well , yes that is self - evident but this should not mean the door is closed on apologies , acts of contrition and atonement and a clear reckoning of the harsh history that still isolates japan in east asia
abe is certainly right that the neighbors are playing the history card and relentlessly hammering japan on the anvil of history , but they were handed the hammer by japan
given abe 's evasive track record about the comfort women system of sexual slavery , a forthright apology or acknowledgment of state involvement was never in the cards
" this cavalier " sh * t happens " attitude towards the comfort women system undermines japan 's dignity and represents a step backward
to counter criticism , abe now refers to japan 's comfort women system in terms of human trafficking , a linguistic ploy to obscure state responsibility for operating this system and make it appear he gets 21st century concerns
journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in japan for some time , but under abe the rules of engagement appear to be nastier
abe got lots of applause from american politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an " alliance of hope
