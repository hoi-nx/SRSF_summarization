a connecticut teen who has been forced to have chemotherapy to treat hodgkin lymphoma lymphoma will remain in temporary custody of the state for the time being , according to her attorney , michtom
a connecticut juvenile court judge issued a written decision wednesday denying a motion to let the teen , identified in court documents as " cassandra c. , " go home
the 17 - year - old is in remission after nearly six months of forced chemo treatments
michtom and attorney taylor , who represents cassandra c. 's mother , jackie fortin , released a written statement after receiving the judge 's decision wednesday : " we are disappointed in this ruling , not least of all because it draws a factual conclusion that is directly contradicted by the weight of the evidence
" cassandra c. was diagnosed with hodgkin lymphoma in september and medical experts gave her an 85 % chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy
she started chemotherapy in november but ran away after two days , according to court documents , when she decided she did not want to put the poison of the treatment into her body
doctors surgically implanted a port in cassandra c. 's chest to administer chemotherapy medications , which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them
cassandra c. is feeling well and is in good shape as far as her health is concerned , according to michtom
" she 's seen in her case the side effects were n't bad , and she 's been well - treated by the nurses and doctors and does want to complete the treatment , " he said
we understand how difficult this has been for cassandra c. and her family , but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life
