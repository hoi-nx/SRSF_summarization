johnson remembers the fear and feeling of helplessness from being on the skywest flight that made an emergency landing in buffalo , new york
" johnson was flying with his brother , his girlfriend and his 8 - month - old son when he says a flight attendant came over the speaker asking for someone who was medically trained to help with a sick passenger
minutes later , johnson says , the attendant announced there was a pressurization problem and told passengers to prepare for the emergency landing
" you 're going to feel dizzy and woozy and lightheaded , and you 're not going to be able to breathe , " johnson recalled the flight attendant saying
the faa on wednesday initially reported a pressurization problem with skywest flight 5622 , and said it would investigate
it later issued a statement that did not reference any pressurization issues
" according to marissa snow , spokeswoman for skywest , three passengers reported a loss of consciousness while on the flight
fifteen passengers were examined by medical personnel at the buffalo airport , but no one was transported to the hospital , she said
the spokeswoman said that maintenance personnel found no indication of a pressurization problem with the aircraft , an embraer e170 , and that the airline continues to investigate the cause
