the lhc ( lhc ) , a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world , is ready for action following a two - year shutdown
after problems that delayed the restart in march , scientists at the cern ( cern ) completed final tests , enabling the first beams to start circulating sunday inside the lhc 's 17 mile ( 27 km ) ring
" today , cern 's heart beats once more to the rhythm of the lhc
" the lhc generates up to 600 million particles per second , with a beam circulating for 10 hours , traveling more than 6 billion miles ( more than 10 billion kilometers ) -- the distance from earth to neptune and back again
at near light - speed , a proton in the lhc makes 11,245 circuits per second
" but we know that this model is not complete , " dr. mike lamont , operations group leader at the lhc , told cnn in march
the lhc could also question the idea that the universe is only made of matter , despite the theory that antimatter must have been produced in the same amounts at the time of the big bang
cern says the energies achievable by the lhc have only ever been found in nature
