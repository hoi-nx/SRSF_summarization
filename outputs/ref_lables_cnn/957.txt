twenty years later , domestic terror threats range from white supremacists to eco-terrorists to anti-government extremists and radical separatist groups , according to the fbi
the fbi 's goal , of course , is to prevent " homegrown attacks " before they happen
unfortunately , this is n't always possible
when acts of domestic terror do occur , the fbi investigates and tries to catch those responsible
from mcveigh and nichols to eric rudolph to ted kaczynski , the fbi is often successful , but every once in a while , the suspects get away
these are the fbi 's most - wanted domestic terrorist fugitives : it was september 26 , 1981 , when a crowd gathered at jfk for an anti-apartheid demonstration
among the protestors , the fbi says , was donna joan borup , an alleged member of the may 19th communist organization
the radical group advocated overthrowing the united states government
the protest turned violent , and donna joan borup allegedly tossed a caustic substance in the eyes of a port authority police officer
according to the port authority , he " lost all or most of his sight
" donna joan borup and others were arrested and released on bail , but donna joan borup never showed up for her trial
an arrest warrant was issued in 1982
today , she would be in her late 50s to mid- 60s , standing between five feet four inches and five feet six inches
according to the fbi , donna joan borup " is thought to have a photographic memory and is highly intelligent

" cheri laverne dalton is wanted for her alleged involvement in the brinks armored car robbery on october 20 , 1981 , when a group of political radicals associated with the black liberation army robbed $ 1.6 million from a brink 's truck in nanuet , new york
time magazine reported in november of that year that the attack happened shortly before 4 p.m. when brink 's guards peter paige and trombino loaded the money into their truck
they opened fire , killing paige
trombino was seriously injured , but survived and kept working for brinks until he was killed in the september 11 , 2001 , attacks while making a delivery in the world trade center
according to the fbi , the robbers drove away after the brink 's robbery , allegedly meeting up with members of the weather underground -- another radical organization
hip hop artist tupac shakur 's stepfather , mutulu shakur ( known as mutulu shakur ) is considered by authorities to be the mastermind behind the robbery
it was classified as the largest act of domestic terror until the oklahoma city bombing
burt 's three accomplices were arrested and served prison sentences for the crime , but the hunt for burt continues
they are suspected to be involved in " at least 25 domestic terrorism criminal actions totaling over $ 48 million in damages , including the largest eco-related arson in history , a $ 26 million arson at the vail inc. , " the fbi said
elf made no secret of its responsibility for the vail inc. fire , and on october 19 , 1998 , issued a statement saying : " vail inc. is already the largest ski operation in north america and now wants to expand even further
