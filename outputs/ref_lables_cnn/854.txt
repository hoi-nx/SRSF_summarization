the investigation into the crash of germanwings flight 9525 has not revealed evidence of the co-pilot lubitz 's motive , but he suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in dusseldorf , german , said monday
investigators have not found any writings or conversations where lubitz shared his motives or confessed to any plans , prosecutor 's spokesman kumpa said
this was before he ever got his pilot 's license , kumpa said
kumpa emphasized there 's no evidence suggesting lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash
the prosecutor 's office confirmed what some media outlets had reported about doctors deeming lubitz unfit to fly , though there were no physical illnesses found
in short , investigators in german and france are not yet ruling anything out
much attention has focused on lubitz 's state of mind , with suggestions that he may have had mental health issues
lubitz , 27 , passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014 , a german aviation source told cnn
an official with lufthansa , which owns germanwings , said that the exam only tests physical health , not psychological health
it 's unknown if lubitz mentioned his problems on a form that asks yes - or - no questions about physical and mental illness , suicide attempts and medications
european pilots must fill out the form to be recertified
the form is privileged information and lufthansa never sees a pilot 's completed form , said an airline spokesperson
lubitz had visited an eye doctor because of vision problems , a european government official familiar with the investigation told cnn
lubitz told a different doctor -- a neuropsychologist -- that he was too stressed with work , the european official said
british 's most senior psychiatrist , sir wessely , told cnn 's christiane amanpour on monday that when a pilot is " acutely depressed or suffering from really any physical illness " that impairs abilities , they can not fly an aircraft safely
the audio from the plane 's cockpit voice recorder has not been released , but the german newspaper bild published sunday what it claims is a summary of the transcript from the recording
cnn can not independently verify the information , which bild says is based on 1.5 hours of audio that was on the cockpit voice recorder
according to bild 's report , sondenheimer told co-pilot lubitz that he did n't manage to go to the bathroom before takeoff
once that 's finished , lubitz again told the captain he " can go anytime
three minutes later , air traffic controllers try to contact the plane and receive no answer -- shortly after which an alarm goes off in the cockpit , warning of the " sink rate , " bild reported
passengers then begin to scream , according to the transcript obtained by bild
lubitz 's breathing can still be heard on the voice recorder , according to bild 's report
france 's accident investigation agency , bea , told cnn that the agency was " dismayed " by the voice recording leak to bild
communications between air traffic control and a plane 's cockpit can be downloaded privately , but that 's less common in european than it is in the united states
that device could reveal crucial details about what happened during the final moments of the flight
about 150 german investigators -- some specializing in homicide cases and others in identifying remains -- are in the french at the site of the crash , dusseldorf police said monday
french investigators at the crash site said they are optimistic they will be able to identify most of the passengers but added that " it may not be possible to find the human remains of all the 150 passengers , as some of them may have been pulverized by the crash
a new path under construction to the crash site will reduce the time it takes to reach the area , he said
le vernet mayor francois balique told cnn the path was within 100 meters of being finished
family members of those aboard flight 9525 , meanwhile , are making the grim pilgrimage to the crash site
