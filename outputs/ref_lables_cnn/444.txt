facebook may soon need to add " just got served divorce papers " to its list of relationship statuses now that a new york judge has said the social media site is an acceptable way for a brooklyn woman to serve her husband with a summons for divorce
ellanora baidoo has been trying to divorce her husband for several years , according to her attorney , spinnell
baidoo has been able to reach her husband by phone and " he has told her that he has no fixed address and no place of employment , " according to court documents
" before cooper agreed to her using facebook , baidoo had to prove the facebook account belongs to her husband , and that he consistently logs on to the account and would therefore see the summons
spinnell said baidoo 's marriage to blood-dzraku began to unravel shortly after they married in 2009 because her husband refused to participate in a ghanian wedding ceremony that would include both their families the couple never lived together , according to court documents
