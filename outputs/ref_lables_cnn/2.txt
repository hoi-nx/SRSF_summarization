a year after its cannes debut and finally seeing a theatrical release , " lost river " is still causing quite a stir
booed at its premiere and mocked by reviewers , ryan gosling 's first feature as director has been divisive , to put it mildly
but there has been one shining light cutting through the fog of critical hyperbole : its setting , a besmirched and decaying detroit
wavering on the brink of annihilation , yet providing kindling for its own rebirth , the city is captured in all its waning splendor , the perfect backdrop for ryan gosling 's post-industrial gothic
speaking about the film in london , ryan gosling made clear that the city was at the heart of the project -- in fact , without detroit 's crumbling edifices there would be no film at all
ryan gosling said that " lost river " began as a collection of speculative shots of the brewster-douglass projects , the first black social housing development in u.s. and a place motown legends the supremes and boxer joe louis once called home
" i heard [ the authorities ] were going to tear them down , " ryan gosling said
" ryan gosling 's affection for the detroit is longstanding , the actor growing up " not too far away " in cornwall , ontario
" it seemed like everything cool came from detroit ... the whole american dream , " he reminisces
speaking in broader terms , ryan gosling argues " there are lost rivers everywhere and we wanted to share the experience these people were having
similarly , ryan gosling references the heidelberg project during the discussion , a community organization in the city 's mcdougall-hunt neighborhood , reimagining derelict buildings as giant canvases for budding artists
" as much as the visual content of " lost river " revolves around a maudlin preoccupation with dereliction -- and perhaps plays on the outside world 's perception of detroit -- aspects of the narrative suggest hope and the possibility of reincarnation for the city
ryan gosling claims this paradox should exist when discussing detroit , and is precisely what the film is trying to convey
" it does n't define detroit , it 's just part of what it 's dealing with right now
