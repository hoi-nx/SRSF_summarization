hillary clinton 's online declaration for president means the focus will now shift to the campaign and to what kind of president she might be
and nowhere will the speculation be greater than in the area of foreign policy , certain to be a major issue in the upcoming campaign
there 's another one , too : the first secretary of state to become president since buchanan
only a handful of the nation 's top diplomats have gone to the white house ( thomas jefferson ; james madison ; james monroe ; john quincy adams ; martin van buren ; and buchanan )
too few of our secretaries of state have had the necessary experience of elected office or the desire , ambition and temperament to compete for the top job
still , on balance , clinton 's tenure at the state department should be a real advantage during the campaign , particularly when compared with the absence of foreign policy experience among her prospective republicans rivals
but this will be no cake walk for her on the foreign policy side
clinton will face a harder balancing act : how to stand by the policies that she helped craft in obama 's first term and still separate herself from an administration her opponents will blast as weak , vacillating and fairly or not , responsible for a world that is seen to be much worse , especially in the middle east and with russia , than when president obama took office
indeed , given the president 's vulnerabilities on foreign policy , she ca n't afford to be seen as obama 's third term
in her memoir " hard choices , " she 's already laid the foundation for distancing herself from obama on issues such as doing more for the syrian opposition and being tougher on russia 's vladimir putin
much less enamored with the obama 's " let 's engage our enemies " trope , clinton may have doubts herself
unlike president obama , the clintons have strong credentials on the israeli issue
clinton 's time at the state department should help her in a presidential campaign where america are looking for strong and prudent leadership in foreign policy and more adult supervision in the white house
the republicans will try and show that benghazi and the email controversy have tarnished her image as secretary and claim she did n't accomplish much
but given the problems she confronted -- iran , stalled israeli - palestinian two - state negotiations ( none ready for any kind of solution or breakthrough ) and a president who dominated rather than delegated foreign policy , she performed ably enough
still , four years as secretary of state will help her project the kind of confidence and competence that will appear to many as an important credential to lead america in a dangerous and turbulent world
and in a presidential campaign where none of her opponents has her long experience in international affairs , that can only help
clinton 's biggest challenge on the campaign trail and in office should she win is whether she can develop a foreign policy vision and an effective approach to the world that strikes a better balance between the risk - readiness of george w. bush and the risk - aversion of obama
