italy have a saying : " too much of something cripples it
" we 're overcrowded with so many frescoed churches , medieval castles and roman ruins that we simply do n't know what to do with them , let alone care for a proper upkeep
we 've turned blind to their value and beauty
there are nearly 5,000 " gems " scattered across the country , ranging from museums to archaeological areas and monuments
italy boasts the highest number of unesco world heritage sites in the world -- 50 , several of which risk crumbling to the ground due to neglect and lack of public resources
and there are another 42,000 that are at the mercy of mudslides , floods and natural calamities
the unesco - listed basilica of assisi , where st. frances ' tomb lies , is just the last of a series of national shames
we 're talking of one of the biggest pilgrimage sites in the world -- not to mention its artistic value
i remember once an american colleague asking me : " but what does italy do with its immense cultural heritage " ? good question
but we do n't and trouble is italy does n't know how to exploit this treasure
or , worse , italy could n't care less to promote its assets
the true but sad thing is that restyling in italy is mainly thanks to private funds and sponsors
it 's also about not having a sense of artistic and cultural attachment , the care to cherish a country 's valuable monuments
and that 's because italy have always lacked a sense of national belonging : italy , despite its millenary history , is one of the world 's most modern states , unified in 1861
patriot massimo d'azeglio once said : " now that we 've made italy , we need to make italy
there 's so much italy could do with what it has , that it could live off tourism
entrance tickets to the coliseum , italy 's top site that each year lures more than 6 million tourists , cost a maximum of 12 euros
one could argue that italy does well to open for free the lord 's doors , but probably in some " critical " cases a minimum cost to enter would n't hurt
if we do n't have enough space to showcase all of them or the money for their maintenance , why not give them over to other countries to run ? or sell them to rich businessmen ? similar options make state authorities ' hair stand on end : they stress art belongs to the italy people and should remain in public hands -- even if it 's inaccessible and unenjoyable
fine , rome was n't built in a day
