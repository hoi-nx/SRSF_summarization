it came a day early
baltimore investigators handed their files on gray 's death over to prosecutors thursday , but the public should n't expect much
it 's largely a procedural step , and given the overtures from baltimore officials , the state 's attorney 's decision on whether to file charges against the six officers involved in the arrest will not be immediate
no reports will be made public , police commissioner batts said , echoing an assertion he made last week that even after the prosecutors receive the files , the task force assigned to gray 's death will continue investigating
the gray family 's legal team had no expectations otherwise
" i hate to say this , but i think if people are waiting for answers or charges to come , " attorney mary koch said this week , " i do n't think that 's going to happen based on the way the process works , and i think that the government officials need to advise people of how the process honestly works and to lower their expectations about what 's going to happen
" prodded on whether the public should expect her or batts to announce findings , she said she did n't want to " seek justice for optics " and explained she had spoken to schools , clergy and community leaders about what to expect
finally , asked flat out if people should expect an end to the saga when the report was handed over , she replied : " well , it ca n't be the end
there 's been no charges
" we 've told the family from the beginning that answers were not going to come quickly and that the investigation needed to be full and complete , ... and hopefully what will happen is the correct people are charged , those charged are prosecuted and that prosecution sticks , " she said
perhaps lost amid the chaos that has descended on baltimore is that there is not one , but two investigations , seeking to determine how gray suffered a fatal spine injury in police custody
the mayhem since gray 's april 19 death a week after his arrest -- the looting , vandalism , blazes , attacks on police and firefighters , marauding criminals stoking the havoc -- has overtaken , or at least outweighed , updates about the investigations
newly appointed attorney general loretta lynch said monday that the justice department 's civil rights division and the fbi " will continue our careful and deliberate examination of the facts in the coming days and weeks
" rawlings-blake requested that the justice department take a look at the police department , the baltimore sun reported , saying her request came on the heels of the newspaper 's report that the city had paid almost $ 6 million in judgments and settlements in 102 police misconduct civil suits since 2011
asked during her thursday interview why no police officers have yet been charged in gray 's case -- given that if the case involved civilians instead of officers there would ostensibly be probable cause for arrests -- rawlings-blake , an attorney by trade , said the question amounted to speculation and cited her efforts to reform the baltimore police department and repair the community 's mistrust in police
" quite likely , but it could be the same situation , and at the end of the day , it 's about this case and making sure we 're getting this case right
we owe it to the city , and we owe it to the gray family to find out exactly what happened
" according to police , officers encountered gray on april 12 and he " fled unprovoked
" three officers gave chase , apprehended gray and carried him -- screaming , his legs dangling listlessly -- to a police transport van
once at the police station , officers requested an ambulance , which took gray to the university of maryland 's shock trauma center , where he died a week later
an autopsy report indicated gray died of a spinal injury , but batts has said that the medical examiner was still awaiting a toxicology report and a spinal expert 's analysis before issuing his final report
though the investigation is not yet complete , batts said last week there are at least two indications that officers involved in gray 's arrest did not follow protocol
" that gray was n't buckled has raised speculation that he was injured during what 's known as a " rough ride " or " nickel ride , " in which officers place a handcuffed suspect in a police van and drive recklessly so as to toss the suspect around
asked if gray could have incurred his injuries via a rough ride or outside of the van , batts said there is " potential " that both could be true
baltimore police have established a task force of 30 investigators -- including members of the force investigation unit and homicide detectives -- to look into gray 's death , batts said
" that 's where the apprehension of gray occurred , and quite frankly , that 's exactly where gray should have received medical attention , and he did not , " davis said last week
from there , according to the narrative davis provided last week , the van then traveled about half a mile before stopping again " to deal with mr. gray , and the facts of that interaction are under investigation , " he said
