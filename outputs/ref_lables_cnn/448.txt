barney frank , to say the least , knows his way around politics
barney frank , you 'll recall , was the first member of congress to marry someone of the same - sex while in office , and among other things , he had some choice words for closeted politicians who vote against lgbt rights
" we 're winning " is a phrase i 've heard a lot recently as it pertains to lgbt rights
) barney frank 's " we 're winning " declaration was oddly timed , too
less than 24 hours after his talk , the governor in the next state over signed an anti-lgbt " religious freedom " bill into the law -- one that allows businesses to challenge in court local laws that forbid discriminating against customers based on sexual orientation
" many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action , " indiana gov. mike pence said
so we have : a fledgling proposal to kill the gays out west , laws to deny us goods and services in the heartland , and if the rhetoric of 2016 hopeful cruz is a barometer , a federal ban on same - sex marriage still on the republicans table
" progressives enjoyed poking fun at cruz , the tea party darling when he announced his presidential bid , but according to the american civil liberties union , " the indiana rfra [ religious freedom restoration act ] is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate
alabama supreme court chief justice roy moore made headlines for telling state officials and judges to disregard a federal court ruling that overturned the state 's ban on same - sex marriage
a federal judge in cruz 's home state of texas blocked a federal rule that would have granted married , same - sex couples access to the family and medical leave act , a law that helps employees stay home to take care of a severely ill spouse
it seems clear that even if cruz does n't capture the republicans nomination , whoever does will undoubtedly make some concessions to appease lgbt rights backlash currently underway in conservative states
that could include one of cruz 's agenda items : a constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriage , usurping whatever ruling comes out of the supreme court in june , when the court is expected to rule on whether such marriage is constitutionally protected
and the ncaa can issue strongly worded statements , as it did over indiana 's new anti-lgbt law , and -- along with others in corporate america -- can threaten financial repercussions for discriminatory laws
barney frank said when progressives get angry they march in the streets , and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls
if that holds true in 2016 , " winning " is going to feel very strange
according to former arkansas gov. huckabee , " it 's like asking someone who 's jewish to start serving bacon - wrapped shrimp in their deli
" louisiana gov. jindal said , " i certainly will support cruz and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage
i know barney frank and others have said " we 're winning " but sitting here , watching the life being sucked out of democracy year in and year out feels more like a defeat than a victory .
