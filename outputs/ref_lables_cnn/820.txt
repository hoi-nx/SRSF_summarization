the united states and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with iran in lausanne , switzerland , on thursday that limits iran 's nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon
just last month , in an attempt to head off such an agreement , house speaker john boehner invited israel prime minister netanyahu to preemptively blast it before congress , and 47 senators sent a letter to the iran leadership warning them away from a deal
rather , the objective has always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements so that iran could not covertly develop a nuclear arsenal before the united states and its allies could respond
it would reduce iran 's low - enriched uranium stockpile , cut by two - thirds its number of installed centrifuges and implement a rigorous inspection regime
another dubious assumption of opponents is that the iran nuclear program is a covert weapons program
iran 's continued cooperation with iaea inspections is further evidence on this point , and we 'll know even more about iran 's program in the coming months and years because of the deal
in fact , the inspections provisions that are part of this agreement are designed to protect against any covert action by the iran
what 's more , the rhetoric of some members of congress has implied that the negotiations have been between only the united states and iran ( i.e. , the 47 senators ' letter warning that a deal might be killed by congress or a future president )
if the agreement reached by the p5 +1 is rejected by congress , it could result in an unraveling of the sanctions on iran and threaten nato cohesion in other areas
another questionable assertion is that this agreement contains a sunset clause , after which iran will be free to do as it pleases
some of the restrictions on iran 's nuclear activities , such as uranium enrichment , will be eased or eliminated over time , as long as 15 years
but most importantly , the framework agreement includes iran 's ratification of the additional protocol , which allows iaea inspectors expanded access to nuclear sites both declared and nondeclared
thus , going forward , if iran decides to enrich uranium to weapons - grade levels , monitors will be able to detect such a move in a matter of days and alert the u.n. security council
but any agreement with iran will not be so balanced
the restrictions and obligations in the final framework agreement will be imposed almost exclusively on iran
