well , hernandez , the former patriots tight end and now convicted murderer , made none of those excuses
he walked into court with an air of bravado , his head held high like the $ 40 million , nfl superstar he was just a couple of years ago
hernandez did n't offer a plausible alibi
his own attorney , james sultan , admitted that hernandez " witnessed " the killing of lloyd , " committed by somebody he knew , " but said his client did not commit the crime
" the arrogance of hernandez , " a new yorker headline accused
what does it matter that hernandez was arrogant in court , or walked with too much swagger , or even smiled at his girl ? like it or not , that is who he is
and for once , this time it appears the jury carefully considered the damning mountain of circumstantial evidence against this defendant and came to the right decision : guilty of first - degree murder in the 2013 slaying of lloyd
hernandez , 25 , was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole
still , it 's hard not to feel sadness over such a senseless waste of life for both lloyd and now hernandez , who were once friends
football was the best thing hernandez ever had , especially after he father died suddenly after a routine hernia surgery in 2006
at 17 , hernandez went off to the university of florida and seemed headed for greatness
by the time he was drafted in 2010 by the patriots , hernandez had already been labeled a " troubled player
" but neither the patriots nor the nfl has anything to be ashamed of in how they handled the hernandez case
there 's no reason to second - guess what went wrong , to ask " how could a star nfler be a murderer ? " the nfl for the most part does a great job vetting its players , and certainly hernandez is an anomaly in the league , where despite the ugly headlines , the overwhelming majority of players are upstanding , law - abiding citizens
and patriots bashers ( me included ) would be mistaken to try to find fault with the team for drafting hernandez despite his troubled past
hernandez himself may have explained it best as he was being taken out of the courtroom : according to a law enforcement source close to the case , hernandez told officers escorting him , " ' hey man , i 'm going to miss you guys
