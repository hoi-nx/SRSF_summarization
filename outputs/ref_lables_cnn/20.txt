just eight months ago , a young woman named kekula was single - handedly trying to save her ebola - stricken family , donning trash bags to protect herself against the deadly virus
today , because of a cnn story and the generosity of donors from around the world , kekula wears scrubs bearing the emblem of the emory university nell hodgson woodruff school of nursing in atlanta , where she 's learning skills she can take back home to care for her fellow liberia
" i 'm thankful to cnn and i appreciate the people who made donations , and i 'm thankful to emory university for accepting me to study
" at emory university , kekula has asked for special training on certain skills , such as caring for burns , a common type of injury because children in liberia sometimes fall into the open fires used for cooking
" kekula , 23 , was just a year away from finishing up her nursing degree in liberia when ebola struck and her mother , father , sister and cousin came down with the disease
kekula could n't continue her nursing education in liberia , because the schools had closed
david smith , an associate dean at emory university 's nursing school , said they accepted kekula because they were struck by how both she and emory university each treated four ebola patients at around the same time last year -- and emory university had dozens of doctors and nurses and millions of dollars in technology while kekula had nobody and nearly no supplies
