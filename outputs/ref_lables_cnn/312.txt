n institutional failure at rolling stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the uva
" the columbia team concluded that " the failure encompassed reporting , editing , editorial supervision and fact - checking
" hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication
the magazine 's managing editor , will dana , wrote , " we would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout , including members of the phi kappa psi fraternity and uva administrators and students
" brian stelter : fraternity to ' pursue all available legal action ' the next question is : can uva , phi kappa psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation ? the supreme court said in jordan v. kollman that " the elements of libel are ( 1 ) publication of ( 2 ) an actionable statement with ( 3 ) the requisite intent
" " actionable " means the statement must be both false and defamatory
of course , the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the first amendment to the united states constitution , but also the virginia constitution
true statements can not be defamatory
neither can pure statements of opinion , because they theoretically can not be either true or false
but the rolling stone article certainly purported to be fact , and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers " true
a plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were " of or concerning " the plaintiff
on the other hand , rolling stone 's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid ( after all , the membership changes somewhat every year ) , that even though the fraternity 's reputation is tarnished , the members have suffered no individualized injury
as for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story , that 's likely a group that moves from the small category to large , and the members of greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit
lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on facebook , but that such cases are rarely actually filed
the uva situation is not your run - of - the - mill defamation case
the university wo n't be able to sue , but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim , and they can make a tangible case for damages , then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases .
