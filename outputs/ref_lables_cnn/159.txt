late one night on facebook , a girl with cystic fibrosis messaged a boy with cystic fibrosis , and both their lives were changed forever
the girl , katie , read that the boy , dalton , was very sick
no , you do n't , katie wrote back , and told dalton a bit about herself
but for katie and dalton , that was complicated -- and dangerous
cystic fibrosis patients should n't be near each other because they can share infections that could cripple their already fragile lungs
dr. anstead at the university of kentucky , katie 's pulmonologist since she was a little girl , had lectured her many times that face - to - face meetings with other cf patients were a bad idea
in their online conversations , one of the first things dalton told katie about himself was that he had burkholderia cepacia , a horribly dangerous infection for people with cf " i was like , ' hi , i 'm dalton from missouri and i have burkholderia cepacia , ' because it 's such a big deal in the cf community , " he remembers
" katie listened to her heart , even if it might hurt her lungs
she asked dalton to come visit her in flemingsburg , kentucky
" i told dalton i 'd rather be happy -- like really , really happy -- for five years of my life and die sooner than be mediocre happy and live for twenty years , " katie says
" so on august 28 , 2009 , dalton drove more than six hours from st. charles , missouri , to katie 's hometown in flemingsburg , kentucky , where they 'd arranged to meet at the dairy queen
at 7:10 pm -- they remember the time precisely -- katie got out of her car and saw dalton leaning against a brick wall looking cool and handsome in his sunglasses
" katie took dalton and his mother , renee , who 'd made the trip with him , to have dinner with her and her parents , debbie and john donovan
later the young couple drove around flemingsburg , and dalton gave her a necklace for her nineteenth birthday , which was two days before
too ill to work , dalton quit his job at his family 's auto repair shop , and katie quit hers as a store clerk
dalton 's came first , and on november 17 , he had his transplant
i was so happy for him , " katie says
the month after dalton 's surgery , upmc discharged katie -- she says they told her it would be psychologically good for her to get out for a while
medicare -- the federal insurance program for the elderly and for anyone with disabilities -- would n't pay for another hospitalization until katie had been out of the hospital for sixty days
but katie was too sick to stay out of the hospital for six days , much less sixty
so katie relied on medicaid , public insurance that was supplied by her home state of kentucky
anstead explained that most lung transplant centers , including the two in kentucky , do n't do transplants on patients with burkholderia cepacia , referring them to larger centers like upmc that have more experience with such complicated cases
katie and dalton , now 24 and 23 , were desperate
going on her husband 's private insurance was n't an option , since dalton is on his father 's policy
in february , anstead wrote a letter to medicaid , pleading with them to make an exception and pay for katie 's care at upmc , even though it was out of state
" upmc counters that medicaid told them that if they want to care for katie , they would have to sign up hundreds of their doctors to accept medicaid patients
" upmc wants to help katie , and our physicians and staff have done everything possible to make that happen ... it is up to medicaid to address this situation
" today , katie waits in limbo in her hospital bed , hoping that the three parties -- medicare , medicaid , and upmc -- will work things out so she can get her new lungs
" if katie does n't get her transplant , not only will she die , but she 'll never be near her husband again because of the risk that she could give him her infection , which could be deadly for him as he 's on drugs to suppress his immune system
as a result of inquiries from cnn , on wednesday aaron albright , the director of the media relations group at the cms arranged for a caseworker to call katie at the hospital
" caught in the middle between the hospital and insurance , katie tries to stay strong , just as she advised her husband to do nearly six years ago in their first facebook conversation
katie and dalton were glad to hear it
