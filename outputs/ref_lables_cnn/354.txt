japanese prime minister abe is scheduled to speak wednesday to a joint meeting of congress
the address marks the first time in history that the head of the japanese government will address the entire congress , and given the importance of the united states - japanese relationship , it is an invitation long overdue
so far , prime minister abe 's appearance has garnered much less attention than last month 's speech to congress by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu
nevertheless , abe arrives in washington at an opportune time to help along the economic centerpiece of the " pivot , " the trans-pacific partnership free trade agreement , or tpp
the tpp is a potentially massive free trade agreement involving the united states , japanese and 10 other pacific - facing nations -- combined , these countries account for 40 % of global gdp
but the immediate battle in congress is not over the tpp directly , but something called trade promotion authority , or " fast-track
" trade promotion authority , which would allow trade agreements such as the tpp to come before congress without amendment , has been on the books for decades
there is near universal agreement that the current talks can not be concluded unless the congress reauthorizes trade promotion authority , without which the 11 other nations that are parties to the talks can not be confident that the united states speaks with one voice
provisions in the trade promotion authority bills just voted out of the committees will require review for at least four months after the negotiations are concluded and before congress can grant final approval to the tpp
which brings us back to prime minister abe 's speech
so , what will the prime minister say , and will his support for tpp be enough to sway congress ? certainly , abe has a lot riding on the agreement domestically ; he has faced opposition from agricultural interests at home who are usually firm backers of his ruling liberal democratic party , and could be hurt politically if the negotiations collapse
this suggests that the big challenge for abe on wednesday will be to reframe the debate over trade promotion authority and the tpp in a way that convinces the united states people that the trade agreement is not about enriching united states corporations and outsourcing united states jobs , but strengthening the united states - japanese alliance and establishing trade rules that will eventually help the united states and other countries combat the unfair trade practices of china
and with that in mind , prime minister abe wo n't be the only one hoping he can turn in a convincing performance on wednesday .
