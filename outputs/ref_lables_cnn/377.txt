isis operatives have executed two groups of prisoners , believed to be ethiopian christians , in southern libya , according to a video released sunday by the terror network 's media arm
the al - furqan media video -- which is highly produced and titled " until there came to them clear evidence " -- shows two groups of men , one in orange jumpsuits and the other in black , being killed at different locations in southern libya , according to the video 's narrator
to the nation of the cross , we are back again on the sands , where the companions of the prophet , peace be upon him , have stepped on before , telling you : muslims blood that was shed under the hands of your religion is not cheap , " the narrator says in arabic on the 39 - minute video
" quoting prophet , the narrator says that those who " perform prayer and pay alms " will have " their blood and property " protected by the prophet unless islam dictates otherwise
" you pay ( tax ) with willing submission , feeling yourselves subdued
earlier in the video , a different speaker says christians in the northern iraqi city of mosul were given the choice to embrace islam or maintain their syrian christian faith and pay a tax
at the beginning of the video , a man who appears to be a judge in a court enforcing islam 's sharia law holds up documents and says a syrian christian had owed a syrian muslims 550,000 syrian pounds ( about $ 2,900 ) since 2004 , but the muslims was unable to obtain the money under president bashar al-assad 's regime
the gist is that muslims are commanded to fight those who do n't believe in allah or the judgment day ( islam 's equivalent of judgment day ) unless the nonbelievers pay a tax or tribute
