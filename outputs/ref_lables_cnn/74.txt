duhok , kurdistan in the canvas expanse of the shariya refugee camp , thousands of yazidi live within hearing distance of one of kurdistan kurdistan 's frontlines with isis
the vast majority of the camp 's occupants are from the town of sinjar and fled the isis assault there back in august
isis took thousands of yazidi captive
but the islamist militants separated the young women and girls to be sold as sex slaves
in its fourth edition of " dabiq , " the isis online magazine , an article titled " the revival of slavery before the hour , " outlines the group 's twisted justification and guidelines for the enslavement of the yazidi
we 're told that women who have just given birth or are breastfeeding are considered impure and can not be taken as sexual slaves -- but hanan , 19 , was neither of those things
" isis : enslaving , having sex with ' unbelieving ' women , girls is ok for the first week , hanan was held with 50 others , regularly beaten and threatened with torture , and fed just a bowl of rice
the group was then taken to a three story building in mosul she described as a sex slave warehouse , where hundreds of girls and women were held
from that group hanan was separated into a smaller group of seven and taken into a house in a village
' treated like cattle ' : yazidi women sold , raped , enslaved by isis two isis fighters guarded the door and ordered the girls to clean and bathe themselves
they said to us we are going to do to you what we did to her , " hanan says
" hanan and the others decided they had to try to escape
four hours later they were out of isis territory
now physically free but mentally still captive , hanan remains tormented -- like so many others , by what she has been through and what those still with isis are being forced to endure -- a fate worse than death
