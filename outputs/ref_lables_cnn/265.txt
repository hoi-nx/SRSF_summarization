on this occasion , however , i found myself flipping through images from a devastating time we dearly wish had never happened but can not afford to forget
five years after the deepwater horizon oil rig disaster that killed 11 people , devastated livelihoods and wreaked havoc on the already fragile natural resources of the gulf region , it 's time to ask ourselves : what have we learned ? and what are we willing to do make sure it does n't happen again ? i spent much of 2010 in the gulf , traveling through the communities , spending time with the people and witnessing the impact of this environmental catastrophe
first , it 's important to understand that the principle " out of sight , out of mind " does n't apply in the communities of gulf coast states
on this most recent trip , i saw the ghostly remains of entire islands virtually swallowed up by the oil , and i learned about oystermen and fishermen whose livelihoods are still crippled by what happened five years ago
imagining daddy : a rig worker 's daughter and her dreams of course , that 's not to say progress has n't been made
but make no mistake : though a kind of normalcy has returned to the gulf region and important progress has been made , the oil is still there
what we do and do n't know about the oil spill a recent study from florida state university estimates that up to 10 million gallons of that oil is still on the seafloor of the gulf
it 's important to note that for areas like the gulf , which are already affected by drilling , many of the common - sense safety reforms called for by the national commission on the oil spill in january 2011 have yet to be implemented
and yet , early this year , the obama administration proposed a five - year offshore oil and gas drilling plan that , in addition to new areas in the gulf , would open the southeast atlantic coast from virginia to georgia , as well as the majority of the wild arctic to offshore oil and gas drilling
taking the time and effort to understand our natural resources before we exploit them is another
despite its importance to navigation , fishing , oil and gas development , and maritime safety , our understanding of how the gulf system works remains extremely limited
independent research free of corporate and government influence in the gulf is critical
projects like habitat mapping can result in countless ecological and economic benefits , such as improved assessments of fishery health , a baseline for tracking success of billions of dollars in restoration efforts , an essential foundation for modeling and monitoring the gulf ecosystem , and a planning tool for better managing one of the hardest - working bodies of water in the world
the students were all horrified and upset by what was happening in the gulf
the following local and national coalitions and organizations offer great starting points to become involved in the movement to restore the gulf and its communities , and to make sure we take steps to prevent history from repeating itself : the gulf future coalition , ocean conservancy , the natural resources defense council and the national wildlife federation .
