which is why the work of ernst haas is so striking
ernst haas , one of the 20th century 's great photojournalists and image - makers -- an early member of the great magnum photos cooperative who was famous enough in his prime to have been the subject of a museum of modern art exhibit in 1962 -- was also a regular on movie sets
it was a necessity in those early days , said jacob , the editor of a new book of ernst haas ' movie photography , " ernst haas : on set
photographers such as ernst haas were entrusted to bring their talent and style to the work
such distinction is obvious from looking at ernst haas ' work -- some of which is as famous as the movies he worked on
) but ernst haas also has a way of documenting the artificiality of film work , whether it 's capturing the sprawling , workaday set of 1965 's " the greatest story ever told " or snapping a relaxed picture of barbara streisand as dolly in 1969 's " hello , dolly ! " social media follow @ cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography
and some of ernst haas ' other color images , especially his work for 1961 's " west side story , " fit in neatly with others in his catalog , as ernst haas was known for an impressionistic blur of hues that jacob calls " the ernst haas effect
" ernst haas died in 1986 , and despite being celebrated during his life , his name is somewhat forgotten these days
jacob hopes that " ernst haas : on set " reminds people just what a master he was
" on the other hand , people who know ernst haas well do n't actually know this work , because it was work for hire and was n't ever put together in this way before
