looting , fires and violence descended on baltimore
like most who know and love that city , i was heartbroken
i was once a cop in baltimore
police , trying to save their city last weekend , were blamed both for doing too little and for doing too much
the ghetto , and i 'm talking class and not race , was on full display by monday
the whole nation saw beautiful baltimore at its worst
the protests started in response to the death of freddie gray in police hands
( and forced testimony ca n't be used in prosecution ; police officers too have constitutional rights as criminal defendants
here 's the thing : police officers who were n't there do n't know what happened to freddie gray
if there are criminally guilty cops , police have no problem with justice
those who cut fire hoses and burned down homes and businesses ? police deal with them every day , literally
in baltimore this year -- just like last year and just like next year -- police will arrest tens of thousands of poor black men , mostly on drug charges
these are communities , like the baltimore 's eastern district , in which more than 10 % of men are murdered
if all of american had homicide levels found in parts of baltimore , there would be over 300,000 murders per year ( as opposed to the still shamefully high 12,000 homicides in american )
and yet some continue to think of police as the main problem rather than part of the solution
but baltimore is not ferguson
the police department is 50 % non-white
so is the police commissioner
the city is 65 % african-american
a nice retired african - american gentleman calls 911 because the kids in front of his house , also black , are rowdy , breaking bottles , selling drugs , and otherwise being disrespectful
just out of the police academy , i pulled up to countless of these situations
ultimately police are in a no - win situation
but even if there were no racist or brutal cops -- if every cop were a polite , fit , college - educated , bilingual , african - american gentleman or woman -- this would n't solve the greater problems of the ghetto or even police abuse
police abuse has less to do with race than poverty and class
