the palestinian officially became the 123rd member of the icc on wednesday , a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in palestinian territories
the state of palestine signed the icc 's founding rome statute in january , when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed " in the occupied palestinian territory , including east jerusalem , since june 13 , 2014
" later that month , the icc opened a preliminary examination into the situation in palestinian territories , paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against israelis
israelis and the united states , neither of which is an icc member , opposed the state of palestine ' efforts to join the body
but palestinian foreign minister riad al-malki , speaking at wednesday 's ceremony , said it was a move toward greater justice
" governments seeking to penalize palestine for joining the icc should immediately end their pressure , and countries that support universal acceptance of the court 's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership , " said balkees jarrah , international justice counsel for the group
" in january , when the preliminary icc examination was opened , israelis prime minister benjamin netanyahu described it as an outrage , saying the court was overstepping its boundaries
" we will continue to oppose actions against israelis at the icc as counterproductive to the cause of peace , " it said
the inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since june
the icc was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes
