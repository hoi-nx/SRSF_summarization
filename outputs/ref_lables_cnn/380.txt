a jury of rolling stone 's media peers has dissected the magazine 's disastrous , discredited story about rape on the campus of the university of virginia , and the emerging consensus is that rolling stone 's lapses and sloppy blunders amount to journalistic malpractice -- made all the worse by the magazine 's head - in - the sand reaction to the thorough , devastating report released by a panel of investigators from the columbia university graduate school of journalism
rolling stone 's egregious mistakes of reporting and editing are regrettable but understandable
before the original story , " a rape on campus , " was pulled from the rolling stone website , it registered 2.7 million hits following its publication in november -- more than any noncelebrity story in the magazine 's history
but the story began to unravel almost immediately when washington post reporter t. rees shapiro took a closer look , leading rolling stone to back away from the story and request a review by the columbia university graduate school of journalism
rolling stone writer erdely never verified the identity of the attacker and therefore never confronted him with the allegations ; she never spoke to three of jackie 's friends who allegedly talked with jackie immediately after the attack , and she never gave the fraternity a fair chance to respond , refusing to provide specific information about what happened and when
and at every step of the way , when jackie began acting flaky -- refusing to provide basic information needed to verify her story or vanishing for weeks at a time without returning calls from the reporter -- neither erdely nor her editors or the magazine 's fact checkers made the hard but necessary decision to hit the pause button and decline to run the story
having worked part time as a journalism professor for a decade ( including one semester at columbia ) , i would agree with colleagues who call rolling stone 's lapses the kind that would be unacceptable in a freshman classroom
" what would rolling stone in its heyday write about an institution that screwed up unbelievably , damaged people 's lives , but punished no one ? " tweeted john bresnahan , the capitol bureau chief of politico
" rolling stone outsources its investigation to columbia and proceeds to do nothing in terms of individual accountability afterward ? ok ... , " tweeted pundit joe concha
" rolling stone 's senior editors are unanimous in the belief that the story 's failure does not require them to change their editorial systems , " the columbia report says
dana told the columbia team : " it 's not like i think we need to overhaul our process , and i do n't think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things
" that smug attitude pretty much ensures rolling stone 's newsroom managers will commit another goof in the future
at a minimum , they should heed the wise counsel of my friend grueskin , an executive editor at bloomberg who formerly served as dean of academic affairs at the columbia j - school
" until wenner and his team learn that basic lesson -- and revamp their hiring , editing and fact - checking process accordingly -- the rolling stone fiasco will eventually be followed by another , one made less forgivable because we all saw it coming .
