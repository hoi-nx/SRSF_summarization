at first blush , rogers and mcguire seem like any other small business owners -- polite , hardworking and passionate about what they do
but there 's the potential for things to get a little awkward when the conversation turns from " hi " s to highs
she and rogers , 34 , own the breckenridge cannabis club , a recreational marijuana dispensary in the historic and scenic ski town of breckenridge , colorado
the couple started their business as a medical cannabis dispensary in 2010 , but when colorado became the first state in the nation to allow the sale of recreational marijuana , they saw a once - in - a - lifetime business opportunity
previously , they were only permitted to sell medical marijuana to the approximate 4,500 permanent residents of breckenridge ; when the new legislation took effect on january 1 , 2014 , they could then sell to any of the 30,000 - plus tourists ( 21 years or older ) who visited the town during peak season
by the end of the first day of " recreational " sales , they knew their lives had changed forever
the two said they brought in more than $ 47,000 in sales , roughly 30 times their normal daily sales of medical marijuana
the long lines and enthusiastic patrons also raised the ire of some of the residents who felt the shop detracted from the town 's " family - friendly " atmosphere now , the pair 's journey to build a legal marijuana empire is documented in the new cnn original series , " which premieres sunday , april 19 , at 10 p.m. et / pt. " somebody is going to become a mogul , " rogers said
in 2014 , legal marijuana was a $ 700 million industry in colorado and was billed as the fastest growing industry in the americans
and , according to a a 2014 gallup poll , 51 % of americans favored legalizing marijuana , though that was down from the previous year 's approval of 58 %
it 's a majority , but a slim majority -- and 23 states still prohibit marijuana outright
" that classification makes it difficult for banks -- which are federally regulated -- to do business with marijuana retailers , even legal ones
the couple says their grandmothers ' attitude shift is what they 're hoping for on a larger scale : while you may not agree with them , entrepreneurs in four states and the district of columbia are out to prove that recreational cannabis and capitalism can coexist
" will they succeed ? tune in to " cnn original series , " sunday nights at 10 p.m. et / pt.
