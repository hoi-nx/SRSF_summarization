" i am concerned that every bite and every sale not only delivers an unhealthy snack , but also a dangerous nutrition message
and i 'm surprised that more doctors are n't speaking up about this
thin mints , the most popular cookie , contains refined white flour , sugar , partially hydrogenated oil , and high fructose corn syrup
the first ingredient in those caramel delites is sugar , but they also contain corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup , for a total of 6 grams of sugar per cookie
that 's a lot of sugar , and while some experts debate whether high fructose corn syrup is any worse than sugar , we agree that both , in the vast quantities we united states consume , contribute to obesity
both high fructose corn syrup and sugar in the united states are largely made from genetically modified crops : 95 % of the sugar beets grown in the united states are gmo , as is 88 % percent of the corn
canola oil , another cookie ingredient , is also of concern : 90 % of rape seed ( from which canola is produced ) is gmo , too
suddenly those cookies seem less benign , do n't they ? if that is n't enough to dampen your cravings , recent studies have found a causal link between sugar and heart disease
and trans fats have been well documented to increase the risk of heart disease
a few years ago , this was a big story , and most products now boast that they have zero trans fats
" " you might be thinking , ' wow ! i 'm glad dr. victoria maizes was n't my mom ! " but my kids will tell you i love a good dessert
there is too little conversation on the hazards of sugar , white flour , gmos , and trans fats from those whom you would expect to call them out : physicians
after all , pediatricians , whose job is to protect the health of children , have a sum total of zero hours of required nutrition education in their residencies
and yet , there is compelling evidence that a diet rich in vegetables and fruit , whole grains , fish , nuts , and moderate amounts of dairy and alcohol , as well as avoiding smoking , obesity -- and exercising 30 minutes a day -- lowers overall mortality by 65 %
similar results were found in the study published under the name " healthy living is the best revenge " , which showed that eating a healthy diet ( fruits , vegetables , beans , whole grains , nuts , seeds , and low meat consumption ) would prevent 78 % of chronic disease , 93 % of diabetes , 81 % of heart attacks , 50 % of strokes and 36 % of all cancers
what if , this spring , the girls sold fresh fruit and vegetables , tomato plants or flowers , or even pedometers ? what if in addition to their characters and confidence we directly addressed the health of their bodies ? read more : what girl scout cookies taught me about life
