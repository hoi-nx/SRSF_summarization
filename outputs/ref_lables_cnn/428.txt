beijing chinese 's state prosecutors on friday formally charged the country 's former security czar with accepting bribes , making him the highest - ranking communist official ever to face corruption charges
zhou , 72 , was also charged with abuse of power and leaking state secrets , the supreme people 's procuratorate , the highest prosecution authority in chinese , said
as a member of the ruling communist 's politburo standing committee -- chinese 's top decision - making body -- zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people
at the height of his power , zhou controlled police forces , spy agencies , court systems as well as prosecution offices across chinese -- and was n't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of " preserving social stability
" now , prosecutors have accused zhou of " taking advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and illegally accepting huge amounts of money " during his long political career
zhou was notified of his legal rights during the investigation and his lawyer 's views were heard , according to a statement by the prosecutors
the president of chinese 's supreme court recently told reporters there would be " open " trials for accused former leaders like zhou
however , the charge of leaking state secrets may allow authorities to shield certain legal proceedings from public view in zhou 's case
state media have painted an intricate web of officials , cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around zhou before the crumbling of his power structure last summer
zhou and his family members were said to have accumulated enormous wealth , in a blatant exchange between money and power
