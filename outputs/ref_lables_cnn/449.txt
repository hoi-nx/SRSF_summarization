dallas mavericks owner mark cuban advised twitterers to have their blood tested for everything available -- and to do so every three months
following her mother 's cancer diagnosis , singer taylor swift urged her fans to remind their parents to get screening tests
but there are many lab tests to order on yourself : medicare 's clinical diagnostic laboratory fee schedule lists over a thousand
they are not all blood tests , but a lot of them are
and since blood tests require blood , you would surely develop at least one medical problem if you actually followed mr. mark cuban 's advice to get them all : anemia
) some might argue that this freedom to test is the path to a healthier society
but the primary effect wo n't be more health , but rather more medical care
fundamentally well people will appear in doctors ' offices with " abnormal " results
abnormalities are common in normal people , as we learned when whole - body ct scanning was in vogue a decade ago ( thankfully , only briefly )
so doctors will increasingly face one of two options : take the time to reassure these new patients that their results are n't really that abnormal or chase down abnormal results with more testing
further testing will often make clear that the initial results were false alarms
often it wo n't be clear what to do , but doctors will be pressed to do something
the disturbing truth is that it is hard for us to make well people feel better
but it 's not that hard for us to make them feel worse
decades of research have shown that there are real side - effects to testing the well : more anxiety ( that ca n't be good for your health ) , more procedures ( which often involve needles , pain and can even lead to complications like collapsed lungs ) and more treatment for " disease " not destined to cause problems ( as in over a million additional american men treated for prostate cancer , ditto women for breast cancer )
i can tell you one thing for sure , the freedom to test wo n't save money
sure , a competitive market will drive down prices for individual tests
but if you feel well , do n't think that testing will make you feel better
a breast cancer monitoring bra -- i ca n't make this stuff up
just as carrying a gun does n't necessarily make you any safer , testing yourself does n't necessarily make you any healthier .
