this week , social media heralded as # motheroftheyear toya graham , the baltimore single mom who pulled her son , who was holding a brick , away from the scene of a riot
a video of graham yanking young michael from a group of protesters -- and subsequently pummeling him with her fists and a few slaps upside the head -- went viral
many called her a hero : a mother determined to stop the cycle of violence
and yet , was n't she also promoting violence ? her own reaction , after all , was to yell , curse and hit
" why is america celebrating the beating of a black child ? " asked a writer at the washington post
is n't violence at home what leads to violence outside the home ? is n't this why rioting happens ? i 'm not excusing violence in any form
mothers who will do whatever it takes to protect their children and steer them through the increasingly tricky course of adolescence
i do n't see graham as an abusive mother spreading the gospel , or at least the inevitability , of violence
i do n't see her as a hero , either
but graham 's actions are evidence of her commitment as a parent
for better or worse , she knows her son
she knows that she 's the mother of an adolescent boy living in a city caught up in a very heated , violent moment
and she will do anything to protect her son , including put herself in a dangerous situation to pull him out of there
can we all say that ? toya graham raises an important point that 's often missing in the discussions of how to curb violence : moms have power
