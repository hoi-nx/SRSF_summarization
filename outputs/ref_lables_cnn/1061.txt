swiss physicist jean-pierre wolf is working on yet another impressive addition to that list : using focused laser beams to affect the weather
it sounds like black magic , but it 's actually a cleaner version of cloud seeding , a form of weather modification that has been used for several years -- most famously by china in preparation for the 2008 olympics , when they launched rockets to seed the clouds and prevent rainfall during the opening ceremony
how does laser actually affect the weather ? just like cloud seeding , it can create new clouds where there are none , by inducing condensation : naturally occurring water vapor is condensed into droplets , and ice crystals form , mimicking the natural process that creates clouds
that way , rainfall can be triggered to " empty " the atmosphere and increase the potential of dry weather later on : " we did it on a laboratory scale , we can already create clouds , but not on a macroscopic scale , so you do n't see a big cloud coming out because the laser is not powerful enough and because of a lot of technical parameters that we ca n't yet control , " professor jean-pierre wolf told cnn 's nick glass
that is not to say that the laser he 's tested is n't powerful : at one terawatt , it has the same energy produced by all the nuclear power plants on earth : " of course , it does n't last very long , " jean-pierre wolf said
through lasers , those effects could be smoothed to have less rain in flooding - prone areas and more rain in drought - prone areas : " you can transport the water to a different location , " jean-pierre wolf said
affecting the weather could also turn out to be one of our best bets at limiting the impact of climate change
professor jean-pierre wolf reckons lasers could be used to " repair " the weather , reducing the occurrence of hurricanes , thunderstorms , flooding , and drought
