sanaa , yemen al qaeda fighters attacked a prison in the coastal yemen city of al mukallah early thursday , freeing at least 270 prisoners , a third of whom have al qaeda links , a senior defense ministry official has told cnn
government troops arrived early thursday and clashed with the al qaeda fighters , and most of the militants fled , the officials said
the sectarian nature of the conflict is drawing in regional rivals saudi arabia , which is predominately shia-sunni -- and is the country to which hadi ultimately fled -- and iran , which is predominately shiite and supports the houthis rebels
because of that , the conflict in yemen risks becoming a proxy war in the struggle between the iran and the saudi arabia for preeminence in the middle east
