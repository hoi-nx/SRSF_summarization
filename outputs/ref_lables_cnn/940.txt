from banking to hospitality and real estate to e-commerce , ashish thakkar built his vast business empire from scratch
the ugandan tycoon started small with a little computer shop that kept him busy after leaving school at 15
these days , his mara group spans over 20 countries and he 's been called " africa 's youngest billionaire
" in late 2013 ashish thakkar joined forces with the former boss of barclays bank -- bob diamond -- to start an investment fund focused on africa called atlas mara
but his vision spans beyond africa , and earth -- ashish thakkar was the first african to sign up for the opportunity to travel to space with richard branson 's company , virgin galactic
cnn 's marketplace africa spoke to ashish thakkar about african innovation , entrepreneurship and collaboration
how is the current business landscape on the continent ? ashish thakkar : right now in the last 18 years i have been active on the continent , i have never seen so much global excitement around africa that i 've seen today
the climate and the ease of doing business on the continent has drastically improved
unfortunately , it 's one of those cases where perception is so different from reality
you 've got to remember , as africa , we are 54 countries
some of the countries may be challenging and may have issues , but that can not be an excuse to generalize the entire continent which is unfortunately something that happens quite a bit
cnn : why do you think that entrepreneurs are so important to the future growth of the african continent ? at : we have a very young demographic -- 85 % of our populations are under the age of 35
where do our entrepreneurs go for advice and the right guidance ? and it 's something , frankly , that i am extremely passionate about , because the answer to unemployment is not foreign direct investment or large scale manufacturing plants , etc. it 's going to be nurturing small and medium enterprises
so , it 's great to see that there is a real entrepreneurial vibe coming into the system , and innovation is totally embedded into that
cnn : what is it about africa that encourages innovation ? at : the biggest advantage we have at the moment , and you 've seen this with mobile phone penetration , is that we do n't have legacy systems
today , we have over 750 million phones on the continent -- more than north america and western europe put together
i spend a lot of time with young entrepreneurs when i travel across the continent , and just seeing the kind of innovation and new ideas and concepts that they 're coming up with is just so inspiring
cnn : what advice would you give to a young entrepreneur who 's just starting out ? at : entrepreneurship is a journey , it 's not a destination
cnn : is this africa 's century ? at : mara 's logo is the african lion and our little joke , which a lot of people do n't appreciate , hence i love it even more , is that the indian tiger and the chinese dragon have had their days and it 's now the african lion 's turn
