marietta , georgia the little - known star of this week 's no. 1 car chase movie , " furious 7 " is n't a car
film producers hired a lockheed c - 130 hercules to fly five cars 12,000 feet high , open a cargo door at the rear of the plane and parachute them out in a spectacular free - fall stunt
geronimo ! happy 60th birthday to the hercules -- the oldest continuously produced family of military planes in history
lockheed has been making these airplanes longer than the legendary b - 52 bomber and the famous u2 spy jet
unlike those planes , the c-130 hercules has never become a household name
the fact that " furious 7 " producers chose a plane that was designed in the 1950s tells you a little something about the success of the hercules
the film makes it appear as if another plane -- a c-17 globemaster iii -- drops the cars
shooting the scene posed unique logistical challenges , said stunt coordinator jack gill in a featurette video about the mission
jeremiah beaudin of international air response co-piloted the stunt
it refuels helicopters in flight
at lockheed 's marietta , georgia , factory in 1955 , the governor of georgia christened the first production c-130a by smashing a bottle of chattahoochee river water across its nose
on tuesday , exactly 60 years later , georgia gov. deal recreated the ceremony -- christening a brand new hercules during a birthday party of sorts for lockheed executives and military dignitaries
" inside the plane 's cockpit , lockheed test pilot knoblock said he 's done a lot of air - drop testing while flying c - 130s
" there 's a trade off -- between dropping it low and being more accurate ... and dropping it high where you have a little more safety in how it will land
" knoblock also explained how the c-130 hercules 's robust landing gear helps the plane survive difficult landing conditions
" meanwhile , in the back of the plane , lockheed loadmaster lucky madsen showed off the plane 's new reversible deck , which makes it easier to switch the floor from a flat surface ... to a floor with rollers embedded in it
the legacy surrounding the hercules has been built by 60 years of successful missions , including : in 1989 , a flight crew aboard a hercules named teal 57 was credited with saving the crew of a noaa hurricane hunter airplane
four c - 130s helped rescue passengers from a hijacked air france flight in 1976
during the military build up to 2003 's u.s. - led invasion of iraq , a hercules test dropped the biggest conventional weapon in the pentagon 's arsenal -- a so - called moab -- known in military circles as " the mother of all bombs
" a c-130 hercules ejected the 21,000 - pound bomb out its rear cargo door high above florida 's eglin air force base
that 's how amazing this plane is
but nothing lasts forever , and the c-130 hercules is no different
