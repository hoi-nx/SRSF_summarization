hong kong china president xi and india prime minister modi are two dynamic leaders at the helm of the world 's two most populous nations
" and all along , modi has issued his call to " make in india , " encouraging companies all over the world to manufacture their products in india where there is a vast talent pool and low - cost production
while modi 's india is out to put its economy on the fast track , china 's economy is slowing after over 25 years of breakneck growth
and it 's been predicted that india could outpace china as the world 's fastest growing economy as soon as this year
so is the world 's largest democracy primed to overtake the world 's biggest single party state as the next economic miracle ? opinion : what india can learn from china not so fast , says china watcher and india today correspondent krishnan
" china is still pulling away from india , " the beijing - based reporter said
" if india grows 7.5 % this year and china grows 7.4 % , i think it makes a good headline
but i think people should n't get carried away about what it means in terms of a gap between china and india
" china 's economy may be slowing down but india faces a longer list of economic challenges including higher unemployment , chronic inflation and an overwhelming lack of basic infrastructure
but despite modi 's big pro-business push , india simply ca n't size up against china 's raw economic might
" after 30 years of dedicated efforts in building china into a manufacturing powerhouse , it would take a long time for india to build that kind of manufacturing capability , " said haiyan wang , managing partner of the china india institute
" so when you ask if india could compete with china , i do n't think that is going to be happening -- not in the next 20 years
" there no question that india 's rise is far less threatening than china 's rise
" with the 1962 border dispute still vividly remembered by many in india , the impression of china as a threat stands in the way of further economic integration between the two countries
" if you look at india 's seven northeastern states , which are probably in the most dire need of infrastructure , it 's inconceivable for any of those states to allow a china company to come and build roads , " said krishnan
" if these two countries come together , 40 % of the world 's people are going to be prosperous , " said vellamore
