and somehow , many trends these days seem to somehow involve a member of the kardashian clan
the latest : lip plumping
it even has a hashtag : # kyliejennerchallenge do n't worry , we said , " what the ... ? " too
now , the nets say you should stick your lips in a shot glass , suck all the air out and then pull it off to reveal your all - new plump kisser , just like kylie jenner
the hashtag # kyliejennerchallenge has been trending on twitter in recent days , with posters showing off the often disturbing results of their efforts
kylie jenner has tweeted her disapproval of the lip - plumping trend she inspired
it 's a trend that predates the kardashians , but they certainly gave us a lot of it : the sideboob , the flash of breast from the side of a dress , shirt or just about anything else that can be draped on a woman 's body
according to google , the arbiter of all things , search interest in sideboob has fallen off since its 2012 peak , when huffington post dutifully reported " another day , another sideboob " shot from kardashian
how about something newer ? surely you 've heard of the " belfie " ? a term reportedly coined by kardashian herself , this charming practice -- a butt selfie -- involves posting self - photography of one 's posterior , thusly : the trend took off last year , with a deluge of broadcast butts and not a little derision , but may have reached its peak with the apparently real belfie stick -- a device for taking " perfect belfies simply and quickly
" butt never fear , kylie jenner is here to keep the trend going , with a belfie taken just this month liked by 1.4 million people : here 's a fact for you : in 2014 , the number of women undergoing " buttock augmentation " rose by a mountainous 86 % , according to the american society for aesthetic plastic surgery reports
why ? kardashian , of course , say the doctors
" while a rounder , more curvaceous derriere has been in vogue for a number of years , celebrities like ( nicki ) minaj and kardashian have brought the attention to the rear to an all - time high influencing more women to undergo buttock augmentation to achieve the hourglass look , " dr. constantino mendieta said in an asaps statement
meet jordan james parke , who made news this year with an interview with britain 's the sun newspaper in which he reportedly said he spent $ 150,000 to look like , you guessed it , kardashian
he later told us magazine he does n't want to look exactly like kardashian
