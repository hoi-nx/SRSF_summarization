isis fighters seized several districts in the iraqi city of ramadi in an hours - long assault friday that included suicide and car bombs , an iraqi provincial official said
at least 10 iraqi security forces were killed in the attacks , according to faleh al-essawi , the deputy head of iraqi 's anbar provincial council
and the head of the iraqi military operation in anbar province , gen. qassim al-muhammadi , was wounded
isis took over parts of that western anbar city in the first half of 2014 , and it 's been part of a tug of war ever since
but they did n't find all of them : a few weeks later , isis detonated hundreds of homemade bombs from a tunnel underneath an army headquarters there , according to sabah al-karhout , the head of the anbar provincial council
iraqi and allied forces have made inroads in recent weeks , beating back the group that calls itself the islamic state , which took over vast swaths of iraqi and neighboring syria last year
still , isis remains a formidable force and , as the ramadi assault shows , one that 's still capable and willing to go on offense to take territory
that may be best illustrated by the case of mosul , iraqi 's second largest city and the site of one of its biggest embarrassments when iraqi soldiers and police dropped their weapons and fled their posts as isis forces advanced last june
