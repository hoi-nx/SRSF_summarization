garissa , kenya first came the gunshots
then the footsteps , as al-shabaab militants followed her into her dorm room
her two roommates hid under their beds , until the gunmen called them out
" ( the gunmen ) told them if you do n't know to read to them in the muslim word , whatever , and then you lie down , " cheroitich told cnn
" the 19 - year - old student at kenya 's garissa university college did n't see what happened next , but she heard more than enough
cheroitich 's survival story , which she recounted to cnn on saturday , is a rare bright spot in what has been a horrific week in garissa , a town about 90 miles from the somalis border , and throughout kenya
it is all due to al-shabaab , the islamist extremist group that is based in somalis but has n't confined its terrorism to there -- as evidenced by thursday 's university attack and the 2013 siege of nairobi 's upscale westgate mall
saturday , the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming as it promised " another bloodbath " in kenya
" the fallacy and satanic mindset of al-shabaab is that in somalis , they kill muslims and somalis , " jama said
police in garissa on saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack
a large crowd gathered , despite the baking sun and foul stench
kenya president kenyatta also had some harsh words saturday for al-shabaab , as well as any those who supported them
five arrested in kenya attack in a nationally televised speech , kenyatta said the nation 's fight against terrorism " has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and the financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities and were seen previously as ordinary , harmless people
" kenyatta condemned " corruption of the worst and most criminal kind ( when ) kenya ... finance , hide and recruit on behalf of al-shabaab
describing al-shabaab as an " existential threat to our republic , " kenyatta urged his fellow kenya to " tell those that believe a caliphate is possible in kenya that we are one indivisible , sovereign and democratic state
