washington the flight voice recorder aboard germanwings reportedly captured blaring cockpit alarms , warning co-pilot lubitz to " pull up " and that " terrain " was ahead
with reports that lubitz apparently ignored those warnings , there are new calls from aviation experts to develop and deploy enhanced crash avoidance software that could take control of an aircraft away from a pilot and steer the plane to a safe altitude
if a pilot is incapacitated or ignores audible warnings , the plane 's flight guidance software could take over and plot a course to a safe altitude â
in cars , these avoidance systems sometimes deploy brakes or slow a car down to a safer speed , and help maintain safe distances from other vehicles
in fact , more than 10 years ago , following 9/11 , airbus , the manufacturer of the doomed aircraft , was working to d â evelop aircraft crash avoidance software with tech giant honeywell -- in part to prevent jetliners from being flown into large buildings or mountains
" for any situation where you are relieving the pilot 's control of their plane , there has been pushback not only from the pilots , but from airlines
there are some sectors that believe that ultimately the pilot must maintain overall control of the plane and that that is your best bet for a safe flight
" however , she adds , in the case of the germanwings crash , " this technology , i believe , would have saved the flight
not only would it have saved this flight and the germanwings passengers , it would also save lives in situations where it is not a suicidal , homicidal pilot
or , indiscriminately the aircraft could be taken over on just a normal flight and they ( cockpit crew ) would n't be able to get control back
" he also worries that the autopilot software could be vulnerable to hackers
" but in an incident like the germanwings tragedy , where a pilot is being blamed for the crash , schiavo says there must be additional safeguards and that this technology would be a start
for example , he says , the federal aviation administration rule that two people must always be in the cockpit during a flight might also have saved the germanwings flight
that is a practice that several overseas carriers -- including germanwings and its parent company , lufthansa -- have now adopted
