caledonia , michigan ben and offrink met in college
it was n't the most romantic setting -- a study group for calculus - based physics -- but ben managed to turn it into a story worth telling by cheating
" i set up a study group and ended up telling the other people not to come so it would be just the two of us , " said ben with a smile
" he was sneaky , " says offrink
" yeah , i wanted to meet her , " says ben , " and that was the best way i could figure out
ben , now 34 , and offrink , a newly minted 30 - year - old , were married and raising little maeve , 3 , and baby hazel , 3 months , in caledonia , michigan , when life suddenly turns upside down
" i thought it was sciatica , " offrink says of the back pain and the " odd " feeling that prompted her to go to the hospital
" " it " turned out to be an intramedullary glioblastoma , a highly aggressive form of brain cancer
offrink 's version was extremely rare because it was lodged in her spine instead of her brain
" so it 's actually tangled into the spinal cord itself , " ben explains
after a week of treatment , offrink suddenly lost feeling in her legs
before long , offrink was paralyzed from the belly button down
offrink nicknamed her tumors and decided to " terminate " them
" you pronounce it as ' tumah tumah - nator , ' " ben says
" as offrink continued to fight and improve , in august 2014 , ben got some terrible news
the hodgkin lymphoma he had fought and battled into remission when he was 20 had reappeared
" i thought it was never a concern again , " ben says
it 's been over 15 years
" ben was slated for a clinical trial with an experimental drug , but his alkaline phosphate levels were too high to meet the requirements
" some days it does feel like a battle , " ben admits
offrink 's cancer , which had retreated from her spine , suddenly appeared in her brain
what is offrink 's reaction ? " i 'm not giving up , " she says
" " for me it 's just something that you have to do , " ben says
" maeve , who is 4 years old now , and hazel , 1 , will have a home with ben 's brother if the worst is to happen , and friends are setting up fundraisers for the girls ' education
but that 's not the focus of ben and offrink 's fight
" " she 's not just doing it for herself , she 's doing it for her whole family , especially her girls and her husband , ben , " said jay tomczak , offrink 's older brother
" if , right now , we can find two or three trials that maybe offrink can get into , or a trial drug for me to try instead of the path i 'm on right now , it could definitely benefit us , " adds ben
