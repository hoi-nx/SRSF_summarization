the sun had n't risen at garissa university college
it started with an explosion and gunshots around 5:30 a.m. thursday ( 10:30 p.m. et wednesday ) at the kenyan school 's front gates
at one point , they burst into a room where christians had gathered and took hostages , said lecturer ayora
" then they proceeded to the hostels , " ayora told cnn , referring to the university dorm , " shooting anybody they came across -- except their fellows , the muslims
" according to afp , the gunmen separated the students by religion and allowed muslims to leave
that 's what al-shabaab did in a december raid on a quarry in the kenyan village of kormey , near the somali border , that ended with at least 36 killed
it was n't until about 15 hours after the attack began that the explosions and gunfire around garissa finally ended
" by then , 147 people were dead and plans were " underway to evacuate students and other affected persons , " the kenya national disaster operation centre tweeted
" it is a very sad day for kenyan , " nkaissery said
" such terrorism , sadly , is n't new to the people of eastern kenyan
while it is based in somali , the militant group has made bloody incursions into neighboring kenyan -- most notoriously a 2013 siege of nairobi 's upscale westgate mall that left at least 67 dead
needless to say , that aim is n't shared in most places -- particularly in kenyan , where more than 80 % of citizens are christian
what makes thursday 's attack different is what was targeted -- an institute of higher learning , presumably filled with innocent students with no direct part in the kenyan and allied governments ' fight against al-shabaab
such an attack is more reminiscent of what other islamist extremist groups , the pakistan taliban and boko haram , did in respectively attacking a school in peshawar , pakistan , and kidnapping more than 200 girls at a school in chibok , nigeria
garissa university college began in the 1990s as garissa teacher training college before evolving , by government decree , into its current form as a degree - granting institution in 2011
it 's too early to tell what the future now holds for garissa university college
but kenyan president kenyatta on thursday urged people around the african nation " to stay calm as we resolve this matter
