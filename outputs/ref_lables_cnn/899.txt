this weekend , millions of people are expected to tune in to watch two men beat each other up
why is this ? we 'll explore , but first let 's get something out of the way : the big fight between pacquiao and mayweather wo n't " save " boxing , a sport that has fallen precipitously since its 20th century heyday
if anything , the so - called " fight of the century " just reinforces the sport 's problems , as two aging heroes collide in what might be the last nationally relevant fight for a very long time
there 's so much wrong with boxing 's business model , but all you really need to understand is this : most sports fans probably ca n't name a single active boxer after mayweather and pacquiao
some might know that the long - reigning heavyweight champ is a towering ukrainian with a boring jab - happy style , but most would n't come up with his name ( wladimir klitschko )
boxing is n't fading away because we 've finally awoken to its brutality but from a combination of catastrophic mismanagement and competition from mma -- a younger , more dynamic and better - managed competitor
in the course of just two decades , the ufc has grown from a freaky - violent carny sideshow into a mainstream sport
" but why do we like to watch fights in the first place ? over the past 20 years , i 've watched boxing and mma in a spirit of nervous fascination
if we just wanted blood and pain , we would n't bother with the tame violence of pay - per - view fisticuffs
for them , boxing is n't really a sport
a fight was drama sweated down to the bones -- a metaphor for the whole human condition , with everything noble and ugly on display
so should we feel virtuous as we watch mayweather and pacquiao 's epic brain damage contest ? i would n't go that far
a fight puts the darkest stuff in human nature on display : the bared fangs , the blood , the frenetic drive to do harm
when mayweather and pacquiao clash at center ring on saturday night , the good angels of human nature will yearn to turn away -- and to lean in .
