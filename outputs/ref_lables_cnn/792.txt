do you remember the talk about plans for iraqi - led force to try to take back mosul this spring ? well , you might want to forget it
nearly three months after a u.s. official said up to 25,000 iraqi troops were expected to return to the key northern iraqi city in april or may , a senior official in president obama 's administration said thursday that washington is " not putting a timeframe on " a possible invasion
mosul has long been the big prize in the iraqi government 's fight -- aided by a u.s. - led military coalition , which has carried out airstrikes for months -- to defeat isis
it has also long been a source of embarrassment , considering how it fell after iraqi troops dropped their weapons , abandoned their posts and ran for their lives when militants arrived last june
iraqi forces aided by iranian - backed shiite militiamen took that northern city , the same place where isis allegedly massacred iraqi troops last year
and it 's more important not only to iraqi , but isis , meaning the terrorist group has all the more reason to go all - out to defend it
there are no plans for u.s. combat troops involvement in an eventual operation , they say , but airstrikes have already targeted isis positions in the area
