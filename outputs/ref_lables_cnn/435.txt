we 're 2 degrees from a different world
humans never have lived on a planet that 's 2 degrees celsius ) warmer than it was before we started burning fossil fuels , in the late 1800s , and climate experts say we risk fundamentally changing life on this planet if we do cross that 2 - degree mark
" this is gambling with the planet , " said wagner , the lead senior economist at the environmental defense fund and co-author of the book " climate shock
yet for all of its importance , i do n't think the 2 - degree threshold is as famous as it should be
meaning : this one little number carries huge importance as a way to focus the world 's attention
it 's so significant that it 's going to be the subject of my reporting for the rest of the year
i 'm calling that effort " 2 degrees , " and i need your help to make it work
) tell cnn 's john sutter which of these climate change stories you like best - and he 'll report on the winner
they focus on what a 2 - degree world might look like
we asked for your questions about climate change and about the 2 - degree threshold , specifically
we 'll continue to explore the importance of this number together
but below you 'll find quick responses to seven basic questions about this crucial number
if you 'd like to follow this project as it evolves , i 'd encourage you to sign up for the " 2 degrees " newsletter
they 'll shape the way i spend the rest of the year reporting on this super-critical number
nordhaus , 73 , proposed the 2 - degree threshold in a 1977 ( 1977 ! ) paper titled " economic growth and climate : the carbon dioxide problem
" if there were global temperatures more than 2 or 3 degrees above the current average temperature , this would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years , " he wrote in " the climate casino
science has continued to raise red flags about 2 degrees of warming
and that work has led policy experts to conclude that a 2 - degree world is something none of us should want
" you need a judgment call for these things , " said jaeger , chair of the global climate forum , who has written on the history of 2 degrees celsius
" and this 2 - degree thing was a judgment call that happened at the interface of science and policy
" germany was first to push 2 degrees as an policy goal , jaeger told me
later came the european commission , the g8 , the u.s. national academy of sciences and , most significantly , the copenhagen accord , which was signed by more than 100 nations who agreed 2 degrees would be too much
but here are some striking facts about what scientists expect a post- 2 - degree world to look like
hurricanes are expected to become 2 % to 8 % more intense
the ipcc estimates 20 % to 30 % of animals and plants species will be at " increasingly high risk of extinction " at or near the 2 - degree mark
" i 'm from new mexico , " said nordhaus , the economist who proposed the 2 - degree threshold
and that 's obviously affected by warming
think of 2 degrees like a sort of speed limit -- or a zone of increased risk
and 2 degrees , policy experts agree , is certainly risky territory
some of that warming is " locked - in to the earth 's atmospheric system , " that organization says
" if you want to stay below 2 degrees , you have to reduce emissions at an amazing speed -- to an incredible degree , " said jaeger from the global climate forum
if we continue burning fossil fuels at the current rate , we could hit 2 degrees of warming before midcentury
scarier still , we could hit 3 to 5 degrees of warming by 2100
some writers have called for the world to abandon the 2 - degree target , saying it 's too ambitious , or even naive
if you think 2 degrees sounds bad , 5 degrees is far , far worse
" it 's akin to killing the planet , basically
if we shoot for 2 degrees and end up at 3 , that 's still better ( or less awful ) than 5 or 6
