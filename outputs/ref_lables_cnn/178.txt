much like the ardent young royal - watchers of today , enamored by the kate 's very being , i was similarly captivated by diana when i was a youngster
as the world awaits the impending birth of william and kate 's second baby , potential names have become the topic of rampant speculation and heated debate
if the assumptions are correct , she will be the first princess of cambridge born into the royal family in 182 years
traditionally they pick dynastic names , and there are plenty to choose from : elizabeth , alice , victoria and charlotte have all been frontrunners , but the sentimental favorite among punters remains diana
in a recent today show poll , 32 % of americans predicted the name was a shoo - in , and in the uk the bookies ' odds of a baby named after her late grandmother change almost daily as diana becomes an increasingly popular choice
that said , in the event the couple do welcome a baby girl , i would hope that they do not opt to name her diana
today diana 's name is as divisive as the very institution of monarchy itself : while some have virtually sainted her , others have been vehemently critical , accusing her of being childish , unhinged and self - serving
contrary to popular belief the queen was very fond of diana , but should her name be bestowed as a first name upon the baby , it would be perceived as a slap in the face to the monarchy
diana 's name conjures up both positive and negative responses the world over , and whichever side of the fence you 're on , the moniker seems to me an almighty burden for a newborn baby to carry
since diana 's death almost 18 years ago , william has honored his mother 's memory in a private and personal fashion
the hymn guide me o thou great redeemer , which was sung at both diana 's funeral in 1997 and at the memorial marking the tenth anniversary of her death in 2007 , was chosen for the royal wedding
william does n't need to name his second - born child after his mother in order to honour her ; he does so by being a good husband and father
