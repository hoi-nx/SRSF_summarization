one of tokyo 's most prominent districts has taken a small , but potentially significant step to recognizing same - sex unions in japanese
the government of shibuya ward , one of the capital 's most famous shopping and trendy entertainment districts , passed ordinance on wednesday paving the way for " partnership certificates " for same - sex couples , allowing them some of the rights of married heterosexual couples
same - sex partners who are registered with the district 's ward office will be able to hold visitation rights in hospitals and co-sign tenancy agreements
while the certificates will not be issued until later in the summer and are not legally binding , proponents of marriage equality in socially conservative japanese say that the ward 's decision is a step in the right direction
while shibuya 's decision does not yet equate to heterosexual marriage , the hope is that the move will be the beginnings of promoting marriage equality for gay communities
" what is important for the lgbt ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) community in shibuya is the ruling will make us visible in society , " matsunaka said " it could be a strong driver for shibuya citizens to learn and know what kind of problems lgbt people are facing
" taiga ishikawa , tokyo councillor and the first male gay local assembly member in japanese , told cnn the ordinance was a " big first step for the protection of human rights
a recent poll found that a slight majority at 52.4 % oppose gay marriage , but support amongst young adults in their 20s and 30s is as high as 70 %
while prime minister shinzo abe and the ruling liberal democratic party " do n't like the idea of same - sex marriage , but at the same time the issue is gaining momentum
" conservative groups were vocal in their opposition , with one , known as the network pushing for normalization of education , telling the japan times that granting same - sex couples the same rights as all other japanese citizens would degrade the " familial system and practice that heterosexual unions have long preserved in human history
