the best part of the supreme court oral arguments about marriage equality was when justice ginsburg alluded to s&m
ok , she did n't actually mention s&m , but ginsburg talked about how the institution of marriage has already changed from long ago , when it was " a dominant and a subordinate relationship
" " yes , it was marriage between a man and a woman , but the man decided where the couple would be domiciled , " said ginsburg
" mary bonauto , the attorney arguing on behalf of the four same - sex couples who petitioned the supreme court , said in response : " that 's correct
and again , because of equality and changing social circumstances , all of those gender differences in the rights and responsibilities of the married pair have been eliminated
that means that by 1967 , when the supreme court considered the constitutionality of such laws , bans against interracial marriage had been officially part of the america " definition " of marriage for over 300 years
just 20 years after the supreme court struck down the anti-miscegenation laws still in effect in 16 states , clarence thomas and his wife , virginia , were married
james braxton peterson , director of africana studies at lehigh university , has written , " the fact that the clarence thomas ' marriage required progressive supreme court action must in some way inform their sense of this moment
clarence thomas did n't say one way or the other , though his remarks outside court and in dissenting opinions suggest he 's firmly opposed to the supreme court doing for other loving relationships what it once did for his own
but perhaps the example of clarence thomas speaks to what seems most glaring about the oral arguments in the marriage equality cases , namely that just as with the rest of america , the supreme court seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics
still , the marriage equality arguments seemed even more shaped by politics than the law
so , while the definition of marriage has unarguably evolved , a fact hopefully the supreme court will soon confirm with a ruling in favor of marriage equality , what 's also clear is that the court has evolved
blown by the winds of partisanship whipping up america in general , the supreme court is increasingly divorced from reason and submissive to politics
