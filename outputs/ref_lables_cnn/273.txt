north korean leader kim has backed out of next month 's visit to moscow for world war ii anniversary celebrations , kremlin spokesman peskov said thursday
" the visit was highly anticipated because it would have marked kim 's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership of north korean in late 2011
he was to have met with russian president vladimir putin as part of the may visit to coincide with victory day , marking the 70th anniversary of the soviet 's victory over germany in world war ii kim also could have had the chance to rub elbows with the heads of about 30 other governments , including the leaders of china , cuba , india , germany , vietnam and venezuela
kim 's trip had been anticipated since late december , when russian state media reported that moscow had extended an invitation
still , north korean has a number of issues it 's been wrestling with for years
according to shin , intelligence officials say the north korean leader is ruling in an impromptu manner and does not countenance excuses or any views that vary with his own
cnn 's matthew chance reported from moscow , and cnn 's ed payne and greg botelho wrote this story from atlanta .
