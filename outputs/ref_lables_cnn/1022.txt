ultrahaptics is a young company with a big dream : changing the way we interact with electronic devices
their technology creates tactile three - dimensional shapes literally out of thin air , using ultrasound
" through an emission of sound waves , sensations are projected through the air and to the user
changes in air pressure are perceived as suspended tactile surfaces , creating invisible -- but tangible -- interfaces
the rising tide of virtual reality seems unstoppable : facebook 's oculus rift and magic leap are leading the pack , but several other companies are readying devices in a field that could shake the foundations of electronic entertainment
but even though it is incredibly convincing , virtual reality completely bypasses the sense of touch : applying ultrahaptics ' technology to it would allow users to not just see the virtual world projected in front of their eyes , but to touch it as well
carter , ultrahaptics ' cto , sees potential in the merging of these technologies : " the ability to put on your virtual reality goggles and not just explore visually and through your headphones , but also touch what you can see , is a really exciting possibility , " he told cnn 's nick glass
creating buttons and shapes literally anywhere they 're needed opens up a slew of possibilities for more traditional devices as well
) several devices can already be controlled with gestures , but ultrahaptics add an extra layer of feedback , by generating the sensation of a force field : " haptics is more than just the sense of touch
what you 're feeling , what sort of pressure , the tactile sensation given by an object or surface
to create their invisible buttons , ultrahaptics use a small collection of ultrasonic speakers , concentrating the sound waves to a specific point
" we have everything from consumer electronics companies making things like speakers , radios , alarm clocks , through home appliance companies making cooker hoods , washing machines , to virtual reality in gaming companies
