melamchi , nepalese even from high above , flying in an indian air force helicopter , it is easy to see that the people of melamchi , central nepalese , are happy to see us
residents in this remote village , about a 44km drive from nepalese 's capital , kathmandu , stand on the distinctive steeply terraced hillsides and wave furiously as the relief flight passes overhead
the mission , a joint effort between indian air crew and a nepalese army medical team , is only the third operation of its kind to reach the village since saturday 's massive 7.8 - magnitude quake , which left more than 5,000 people dead
the aircraft is stuffed to capacity with tents , medicines and packages of tinned tuna , instant noodles and rice , all bundled haphazardly aboard the mi-17 by soldiers at the air base in kathmandu barely 15 minutes earlier
in the days since the quake , injured people from the region have been told to find their way to melamchi so they can be picked up by the relief flights , he says
they 've sent about 500 of the most seriously injured people for treatment in kathmandu already -- the majority by road -- but many more are stuck in a local clinic waiting for help
among the injured brought on board the flight is forshani tamang , accompanied by her son
he and other family members carried forshani tamang for four hours to reach melamchi
with their home destroyed and their stores of grain lost , the family are in crisis
when the helicopter touches down at kathmandu airbase , the patients are swiftly unloaded and unceremoniously laid out on the tarmac in the emergency triage area in front of an aircraft hangar , and paramedics scramble to administer iv drips to those in need as forshani tamang 's son feeds her a cracker softened with water , the relief team turn to prepare for another mission
