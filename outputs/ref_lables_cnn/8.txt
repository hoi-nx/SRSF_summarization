in a tragic echo of the catastrophic events in haiti in 2010 , a powerful earthquake struck one of the poorest nations on earth today
the latest estimates from seismologists put the magnitude at 7.9 , which would actually makes it about 40 % larger than the 7.8 currently being reported
we knew this disaster was coming eventually
geophysicists have long monitored how fast the earth 's plates are moving , and we know that the entire subcontinent of india is being driven slowly but surely underneath nepal and tibet at a speed of around 1.8 inches per year
latest updates on nepal earthquake over millions of years , the squeezing has crushed the himalaya like a concertina , raising mountains to heights of several miles and triggering earthquakes on a regular basis from pakistan to burma
in the 81 years since the 1934 bihar earthquake , the land mass of india has been pushed about 12 feet into nepal
think of all that movement getting stored in a giant spring lying under nepal
fallen : nepal 's historic landmarks sometimes , energy stored in the spring gets big enough to slip catastrophically , releasing all that pent - up strain and generating shaking strong enough to destroy buildings and kill people over a huge area
in haiti in 2010 , although the earthquake was more than 20 times weaker than saturday 's , well over 100,000 people are thought to have been killed around port-au-prince by the shaking and its after - effects
yet despite some differences , the nepal and haiti earthquakes also share similarities -- both geological events were known to be approaching , and both struck areas afflicted by widespread poverty , rapid increases in population in urban areas , uncoordinated changes in building infrastructure and lack of adherence to improved building codes
studies have long predicted that the kathmandu area was due a magnitude - 8 earthquake , or higher -- one study predicted between 21,000 and 42,000 fatalities if a magnitude - 8.1 earthquake had struck the area
still , this catastrophe comes at a delicate time for nepal as it emerges from a long - running civil war and its economy has been improving steadily
