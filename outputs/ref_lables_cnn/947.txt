this is week three of an ongoing series : a catholic reads the bible
read week one and week two
when i started this project , my brother texted me , " wait until you get to lot
i am horrified by the story of lot in genesis
( feel free to call me dense as you read this )
lot is the central character in the grim story of sodom 's demise in chapter 19
lot is visited by divine emissaries to investigate if there are indeed enough good people to save the town
hospitable bunch , huh ? those " intimacies , " we are meant to understand , account for sodom 's wickedness
" ) to protect the emissaries from the mob , lot offers up his virginal daughters
oh , and while lot 's chosen family members flee the destruction , lot 's wife turns around and is turned to salt
after god destroys sodom , lot 's daughters worry that there are n't any men left , so they get their father good and drunk and have sex with him
after reading that section , i put my bible down
i could n't read anymore
then i read it again
what was i reading ? what are the morals , the meaning , i 'm supposed to get from these ghastly stories ? this is not the god that i have known for nearly 42 years
it 's not the version of the god i pray to daily
there were much easier things to write about this week in the pages that i read
the lot story struck me -- hard
