seoul in the first few days after the sewol disappeared beneath the yellow sea , divers pulled body after body from the watery wreckage , bringing the dead home
the divers stopped searching months ago because of the winter and water conditions , and the south korea ferry remains on the bottom of the sea floor
the sewol sank on april 16 , killing 304 people , mostly high school students who were on their way to a field trip to jeju island , off south korea 's southern coast
" park 's case is an unsettling one -- emblematic of what remains unresolved a year after the sewol ferry sank
but families say the underlying problems that led to the sinking of the sewol are far from resolved
on april 16 , the sewol ferry , carrying hundreds of high school students , began sinking after taking a sharp turn
as the ferry tilted sideways , water seeped in and objects in the ship toppled over , injuring people and blocking their way out
on thursday , the one year anniversary of the disaster , south korea 's president park geun-hye called for the salvage of the sewol 's wreck " as soon as possible
" " recently , there was an announcement that it is technically possible to salvage sewol ferry
a government study on raising the ferry released last week identified a crane and floating dock as the safest way to look for the missing
the sewol ferry is over 20 years old and there are fears it could fall apart during the extraction , according to the south korean ministry of oceans and fisheries
the process could take over a year and a half , and that it would cost the south korea government anywhere from $ 91 million to $ 182 million
since the days immediately after the disaster , families have criticized the government over its response
the captain of the first coast guard ship sent to rescue the sewol passengers was found guilty of negligence and making false reports
the recovery efforts have also taken a deadly toll with a total of six deaths -- a diver searching the sewol died in may , and in july , five people died after a helicopter carrying emergency workers involved in the operation crashed
park , the south korea president , pledged major reforms , dismantled the coast guard and vowed an investigation into what went wrong
that promised investigation has been hampered by politics and disagreements between the families and the government over who should participate in the investigation
in the case of sewol , the ferry was found to be loaded with double its capacity
the sinking spurred a debate about the shortcomings of the government and what preventive measures should have been taken
" the tragedy of sewol was also virtually caused by accumulation of corruption , irregularity and going blind eyes , " park said on thursday
