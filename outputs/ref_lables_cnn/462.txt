the public outrage over the " religious freedom " bills recently passed in arkansas and indiana caught the governors of those states completely off - guard , judging by their confused and contradictory responses
but the politicians underestimated the pushback organized by local and national businesses , including companies with no previous record of public support for social equality
for the past three decades , socially conservative evangelicals and pro-business interests have been powerfully allied against government regulations , environmental initiatives and social welfare programs , while supporting lower taxes for the wealthy and pushing back against the growing diversity in americans 's population
hence , after indiana gov. mike pence signed a law that opened a new door for discrimination against same - sex couples , the threat of boycotts and other retaliation was swift , from groups as diverse as the national collegiate athletic association , the indiana pacers , walmart , eli lilly , apple and even the marriott international hotel chain
marriott international was founded by marriott , a dedicated mormon , and is now run by his son bill , also a mormon who fully accepts his church 's teachings about traditional marriage
" asked about the discrepancy between his religious rejection of same - sex marriage and his marketing overtures to same - sex honeymooners , marriott pointed to the bible 's injunction of unconditional love , but added " beyond that , i am very careful about separating my personal faith and beliefs from how we run our business
a cnn poll taken in february found that 72 % of millennials nationwide believe that same - sex couples have the right to have their marriages recognized as valid
even among white evangelical protestants , 43 % of millennials support same - sex marriage , compared with less than 20 % of those their grandparents ' age , 68 and older
in the first 24 hours after arkansas passed its version of the " religious freedom " bill , the twitter hashtag # boycottarkansas was used 12,000 times
americans has crossed a threshold where it is no longer a good business model or political strategy to be intolerant of diversity , whether that pertains to race , ethnicity , gender or sexual orientation
and more than half of americans live in states where same - sex marriage is legal
