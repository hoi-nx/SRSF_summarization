during an expedition through the brittany region on the west coast of france , photographer le coq noticed an unusual tree
he positioned himself at the base of the tree and turned his camera upward , filling the frame with the trunk and its spindly branches
one day i was taking a break during an excursion in the broceliande forest , looking for the best place to settle , when i discovered a small clearing with a tree without leaves
i stayed for hours looking around , taking some pictures and i found myself lying down under the tree
the tree 's branches were rising as if to touch the sky
the images are soothing and repetitive ; each tree is photographed from the bottom looking up
branches take on their own patterns in the sky , creating a symmetry that is both interesting and comforting
a row of trees shot in paris speaks to the geometry of a modern city
cactus branches look like spears piercing the sky
appearance is not the only factor that sets the trees apart
" each tree has its own personality , " he said
the viewer should " become a third actor in a scene with trees and skies
" the branches are the mirror of the roots
