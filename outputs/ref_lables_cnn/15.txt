dr. moschetto , 54 , pleaded not guilty wednesday to criminal solicitation , conspiracy , burglary , arson , criminal prescription sale and weapons charges in connection to what prosecutors called a plot to take out a rival doctor on long island
moschetto 's attorney , randy zelin , said wednesday that his client " will be defending himself vigorously , " the new york post reported
" doctors are supposed to ensure the health and wellbeing of people , but dr. moschetto is alleged to have replaced that responsibility with brazen , callous and criminal acts , " acting nassau district attorney madeline singas said in a statement
police officers allegedly discovered approximately 100 weapons at moschetto 's home , including hand grenades , high - capacity magazines and knives
the investigation began back in december , when undercover officers began buying heroin and oxycodone pills from moschetto in what was initially a routine investigation into the sale of prescription drugs , officials said
during the course of the undercover operation , however , moschetto also sold the officers two semiautomatic assault weapons as well as ammunition , prosecutors said
" the fire damaged but did not destroy the office of another cardiologist whose relationship with dr. moschetto had soured due to a professional dispute , " according to the statement from the district attorney 's office
moschetto allegedly gave an informant and undercover detective blank prescriptions and cash for the assault and killing of the fellow cardiologist , according to prosecutors
