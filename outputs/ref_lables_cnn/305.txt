the much - discussed trailer for " batman v. superman : dawn of justice " just got a makeover
instead of ben affleck and henry cavill facing off , this version wonders what it would be like if comics ' classic characters adam west and christopher reeve took their places
( warner bros. pictures , the studio behind " batman v. superman , " is owned by time warner , as is cnn
cnn : where did this idea come from ? burns : i 'm pretty hyped for " batman v. superman
" as soon as i saw the trailer , my brain immediately went to the classic " batman " [ tv series ] and i thought how funny it would be if this film was made at the time
