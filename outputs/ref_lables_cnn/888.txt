vergara 's ex-fiance is speaking out about their dispute over frozen embryos created while they dated
in an op - ed published by the new york times on wednesday , loeb explained his rationale for fighting to keep the two female embryos he shares with the actress
" i wanted to keep this private , but recently the story broke to the world , " loeb wrote
" loeb says he met the actress in 2010 and they got engaged two years later , at which point they decided to create the embryos and conceive a child via a surrogate
after two attempts failed to bring fertilized embryos to term , they created two more embryos using her eggs and his sperm
should n't a man who is willing to take on all parental responsibilities be similarly entitled to bring his embryos to term even if the woman objects ? " loeb said he filed a complaint against the 42 - year - old actress to prevent her from destroying their two embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization
loeb has said he believes " life begins at fertilization " and wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term
" usually when embryos are created , whether the couple is married or just consenting adults , there 's usually a power of attorney that is described to these embryos , if they are frozen for future use , " he said
