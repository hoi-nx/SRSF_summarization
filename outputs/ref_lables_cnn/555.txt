washington it 's the mistake that hillary clinton wo n't make again : ignoring her gender
the low - key video she released on sunday announcing her run for the white house is filled with women -- young , old , black , white , asian and latina -- working in their gardens , taking care of their kids and getting ready for life in the working world
clinton , who made herself the center of her campaign announcement in 2007 , is barely in the video at all , appearing at the end as a kind of everywoman whose story and fight could be folded in with all the others
the challenge for clinton in breaking the " highest , hardest glass ceiling " that she described in 2008 is laying out a precise campaign vision that connects with all voters , while generating excitement and anticipation over the possibility of making history
clinton could be helped by an improving climate for women in politics
the question is this : are they ready for hillary clinton as that woman ? " according to a recent pew poll , nearly three quarters of americans expect to see a woman president in their lifetime
but that hope splits along partisan -- not gender -- lines
only 20 % of republicans women hope to see a woman president and nearly 70 % of democratic women do
interactive : hillary clinton tries again in the run - up to her announcement and at women - centered events , clinton sometimes strode on stage to the song " i 'm every woman , " and recalled how she juggled work and motherhood as a young lawyer

" her new campaign website is plastered with pictures of women , with clinton , in a blue cloth coat , holding a cup of coffee listening intently to another woman as a man looks on
the emphasis on women -- and the progress of women -- as a possible underlying campaign theme is a reversal of her 2008 strategy , which stressed experience and competence over history
" republicans certainly hope the gender play backfires and that voters are fatigued by the kind of identity politics that have defined the obama years
" as we talk about the polling that is out there , that gets in hillary clinton 's way and she 's not authentic
and democratic found that in states such as texas , kentucky and georgia , white married women and white working class women tended to prefer republicans
packer gage , who has been talking to women in focus groups about clinton 's run , said that to many women , the " idea of hillary clinton is more popular than the reality
" " she starts out having some benefits of gender because she is something different , but then starts to feel like a typical politician and gets back down to earth , " said packer gage , who runs burning glass consulting , a firm that coaches republicans on appealing to women voters
" you do see her starting to frame her campaign as a campaign for women , but that 's a narrow campaign , not a winning campaign
" among republicans , former hewlett packard ceo fiorina might mount a challenge to clinton and try to neutralize some of the former first lady 's strengths as the lone woman in a field dominated by men
kentucky gop sen. rand paul , who launched his presidential campaign last week , has noted that the clinton foundation took money from foreign countries who oppress women , suggesting that the pro-woman framing wo n't be an easy sell
" whoopee , hillary clinton is off and running , " she wrote in a statement
" i 'm ready for hillary clinton
