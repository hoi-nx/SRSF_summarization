can you imagine paying $ 1,000 a month in rent to live in a one - car garage ? nicole , a 30 - year - old woman , does n't have to imagine this scenario because it 's her everyday reality
cnn recently published a powerful piece called " poor kids of silicon valley " that documents the affordable housing challenges facing families in the san francisco bay area
another chronicles a husband and wife named rich and stacey , both of whom have jobs , who are living in a san jose homeless shelter with their two kids because they do n't have the money to go anywhere else
although silicon valley has unique characteristics , it is n't the only community confronting these challenges
our entire nation is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis
the agency i lead , the american hud , recently released a report estimating that 7.7 million low - income households live in substandard housing , spend more than half their incomes on rent or both
and the more they spend on housing , the less they have to invest in their children 's education , build up savings and shop at local businesses
these are outcomes that hurt our nation 's economy and require us to respond with swift and bold action
first , we 're focusing on preserving the affordable housing that already exists
since the mid- 1970s , we have directed and insured loans for multifamily properties that have resulted in more than 700,000 affordable units
so we 've launched a preservation effort with private partners to keep these properties affordable for generations to come
it 's cost neutral for the federal government and making a big impact for communities such as lexington , north carolina , where the local housing authority is making 58 years ' worth of repairs in just 22 months , including new lighting , modern windows and better insulation to help residents stay warm and cut energy costs
in addition to preservation , hud is also working to create new affordable housing
for instance , hud awarded $ 94 million in targeted homelessness assistance to 274 programs across the san francisco bay area , including silicon valley , in january
our nation 's affordable housing challenges wo n't be solved overnight , and we still need to do more to make sure that more folks are able to prosper
by leveraging private investment and increasing collaboration with state , local and tribal governments and other traditional housing partners , i know we can build a future where affordable housing is available to all .
