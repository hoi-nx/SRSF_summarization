i 'm haunted by the video of officer michael slager firing eight shots at walter scott as he fled his encounter with north charleston police -- his back turned to the officer
what i find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen walter scott and allows him to die face - down in the dirt while michael slager appears to plant an item next to his body
however , there is another camera that -- had it been deployed -- might have prevented the entire tragedy : a police body camera
throughout the entire encounter with walter scott , it 's clear michael slager had no idea someone was filming him
if michael slager had been wearing a body camera , walter scott would probably still be alive , and michael slager would n't be facing the possibility of life in prison -- or a possible death sentence
body cameras are expensive to deploy , sure
and storing the massive amounts of data that body cameras create costs even more
that cost , however -- if we 're talking the monetary kind -- may be eclipsed by the punitive damages delivered to walter scott 's family in an inevitable civil suit against the north charleston police department
most importantly , we have to ask ourselves this : what 's the value of a human life ? certainly it 's worth the price of some mass data storage
police body cameras can help break this cycle
i will admit that body cameras are only an interim solution
they only help compensate for the real underlying problem , which is this : there is a bias against black men that has infiltrated the criminal justice system , and we are seeing it in the disproportionate shooting of black men
when we look at this footage -- and when we see the dashboard camera from the other south carolina officer who last year shot a man who was reaching for his driver 's license -- it 's clear that many cops are more likely to interpret actions , even routine actions , from black men as potentially aggressive
in the meantime , if we ca n't immediately root out racial bias , we can at least put a bright spotlight on it , and we can start by focusing on the one interaction where racial bias results in the loss of life -- we can start by placing body - mounted cameras on cops .
