a columbia student who was accused of rape is suing the new york city school for allowing his accuser to publicly brand him a " serial rapist " according to the lawsuit , paul nungesser was cleared of responsibility in sulkowicz 's 2013 rape claim , as well as others that came to light after sulkowicz went public with her allegations in various media interviews
her case drew national attention after she started carrying a mattress around campus to protest the school 's handling of the complaint , saying she hoped to show how " flawed " the university disciplinary system is when it comes to sexual misconduct cases
they have also both said in separate interviews with the new york times that paul nungesser was cleared of responsibility in a disciplinary hearing
paul nungesser , an international student from germany , filed a federal discrimination lawsuit last week against the school ; its president , bollinger ; and the visual arts professor who oversaw sulkowicz 's mattress project , " carry that weight , " as part of her senior thesis
the lawsuit alleges the defendants violated paul nungesser 's right to an education free of gender - based discrimination by allowing sulkowicz to speak out against him after he had been cleared of wrongdoing
during an april 2014 news conference at columbia , sen. kirsten gillibrand stood alongside sulkowicz as she called paul nungesser a " serial rapist " and said she fears for her safety while he 's still on campus
the harassment continued , the lawsuit claims , when columbia visual arts professor kessler let sulkowicz " transform her personal vendetta " into a " columbia - sponsored calumny " by supporting " carry that weight " for her senior thesis , allowing her to earn school credit through " this outrageous display of harassment and defamation
" the defendants " had the power , as well as the legal and contractual obligation " to protect paul nungesser , who is also a senior , the lawsuit claims
" by refusing to protect paul nungesser , columbia first became a silent bystander and then turned into an active supporter of a fellow student 's harassment campaign by institutionalizing it and heralding it
" if artists are not allowed to make art that reflects on our experiences , then how are we to heal ? " the project essentially consists of sulkowicz carrying a twin - size mattress wherever she goes on campus , but not off campus
