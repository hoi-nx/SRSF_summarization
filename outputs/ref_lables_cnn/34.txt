nine of ten mostly foreign prisoners on death row in indonesia have been given 72 hours notice ahead of their execution , according to a spokesperson for the attorney general 's office
" seventy - two hours notification means three days , at least , to go to the execution
in other words , there will be no execution less than 72 hours after notification , " spontana told cnn by phone sunday
meanwhile , edre olalia , a lawyer acting for philippines maid veloso , told cnn sunday that veloso had telephoned her sister on saturday at about 5:30 p.m. local time and said her execution will take place on tuesday , april 28
opinion : why executions wo n't win indonesia 's drug war the ten on death row , which also include two australia citizens andrew chan and myuran sukumaran -- members of the so - called " bali nine " smuggling ring -- as well as prisoners from ghana , brazil , nigeria and indonesia , had their petitions for clemency denied by president widodo in late 2014
a statement sunday from foreign minister julie bishop said the australia government had been notified that the execution of andrew chan and myuran sukumaran would be carried out " imminently
" " i spoke to mr. myuran sukumaran 's mother raji yesterday and assured her the government would continue to seek clemency from indonesia president widodo for both men
" nothing can be gained and much will be lost if these two young australia are executed
" the two australia , convicted for their role in a failed 2005 heroin smuggling plot , tried to challenge the president 's decision earlier this month but lost an appeal for the state administrative court to hear their case
australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair and has unsuccessfully proposed a prisoner swap with indonesia as a way of avoiding their deaths
