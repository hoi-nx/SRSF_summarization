yemen officials said saudi airstrikes targeting a military base on tuesday hit a nearby school , injuring at least a half dozen students
the information came from two officials with the governor 's office in ibb province , where the school is located , as well as houthi sources from the rebel group that is fighting for control of the country
a third source , with the education ministry in ibb , said three students had been killed at the al bastain school in maitam , in southwestern yemen , as a result of an airstrike
the officials from ibb 's governor 's office said the al hamza military base was targeted because houthi have been sending reinforcements from ibb to nearby provinces
the school , which is about 500 meters ( one - third of a mile ) from the base , was not the main target , the officials said
the incident was another example of what has become evident in recent days : the chaos in yemen , now the scene of some of the most chaotic fighting in the middle east , has left civilians -- noncombatants , both locals and foreigners -- caught in the crossfire
the fighting has killed hundreds of people in less than two weeks
at least 74 children are known to have been killed and 44 children maimed since the fighting began on march 26 , unicef said monday in a statement
separately , saudi airstrikes wiped out about a fifth of the armored vehicles recently captured by southern separatists opposing the houthi near aden , according to a senior official in the separatist movement
the official expressed frustration about the lack of coordination between the saudi military and friendly forces in the region , including the anti-houthi southern separatists
" the saudi have no one on the ground in aden , " he said , calling for the military to work out a means of coordination
about 20 pieces were destroyed in the saudi attack that took place near an old oil refinery
over the weekend , a saudi - led coalition smashed parts of yemen 's defense ministry central command in the capital , senior yemen officials said
but the airstrikes have destroyed much of the city 's infrastructure
the electricity has gone out on 16 million yemen living in houthi - held areas , the yemen officials said
yemen and foreigners are scrambling to leave
this was a flight that no one wanted to miss. many were not newcomers to yemen
" over the last few days , indian has evacuated 2,500 people from yemen , said vijay kumar singh , the indian deputy foreign minister overseeing the evacuation
why is saudi bombing yemen ? houthi rebels control sanaa , including the airport
but because of the airstrike campaign , the saudi to some extent control air access , so getting people out requires coordination
who 's joining saudi 's fight against the houthi ? yemen has descended into chaos in the weeks since houthi rebels , shiites who complain of being marginalized in the majority sunni country , forced president hadi from power
hadi fled aden in late march , ultimately for saudi , when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city
the conflict prompted saudi , a predominantly sunni nation and yemen 's neighbor to the north , to intervene with force along with other arab nations
the houthi are allied with iran , saudi 's bitter rival across the persian gulf , and the saudi do not want an iran proxy in power on their border
gen. ahmed asiri told reporters that the ties between the rebels and iran were clear
he accused iran of training yemen youths to use military aircraft and weapons
united states defense secretary ash carter " emphasized the importance of limiting civilian casualties when conducting airstrikes " when he spoke with saudi defense minister prince mohammed bin salman on monday , the pentagon said
what about sharing intelligence when it comes to identifying targets ? that 's a sensitive issue , given the rebels ' ties to iran and concerns about civilian casualties
guidance from u.s. central command stops short of allowing the united states to tell the saudi what targets to bomb , according to two united states defense officials who confirmed details of the guidance to cnn , but declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter
the guidance allows the united states to review targets the saudi have selected , the officials said , and advise them if there are civilian areas nearby or other " no go " spots such as mosques and hospitals
