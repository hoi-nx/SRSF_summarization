miami despite the glitz and glamour miami is known for , the odds for some children growing up there are bleak
many schools face high dropout rates , after - school programs are being eliminated and students are failing
those at - risk children are ones that bernstein is trying to help through his nonprofit , guitars over guns
" music is the most important tool we have in reaching these kids , " said bernstein , 30 , a professional musician
his program operates in two of miami 's poorest communities , miami and allapattah
it pairs middle - school students with professional musicians , providing free instrument instruction and mentorship
since 2008 , bernstein 's organization has worked with more than 225 students in miami-dade county
he says his group has seen more than a 90 % increase in academic performance and school attendance of students in the program

calhoun : what can students expect when they join your program ? bernstein : as a new gogo student you 'll get to try out all the instruments
and some of these mentors are actually from the neighborhoods and the schools that these kids are at currently
as professional musicians , most of us know what kind of power music has in terms of dealing with the things that are going on in your life
and the reasons that we target the neighborhoods that we have the program in are because these kids are facing the most challenges with being successful in and out of school
we like to bring them to studios and also to other places in miami because we want them to experience something outside of their own neighborhood
how has that passion translated into your work with these kids ? bernstein : i 've built my life on how important the feeling i get from playing music is
