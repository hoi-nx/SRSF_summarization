the migrant crisis that has suddenly drawn hundreds of journalists to sicily has been brewing for years , but in the past 10 days , with as many as 1,600 deaths in the mediterranean , suddenly minds are focused -- for now
hundreds of africa migrants were caught between the libyan civil war ( back then some optimistically called it a " revolution " ) and the deep blue sea
they had come to misrata from ghana , nigeria and elsewhere , hoping to board rickety boats to cross the sea to europe
and now that boom in human misery is coming in waves to the shores of italians
aware of the tragedy underway , however , italians are alarmed at the prospect that this year alone as many as a million migrants could arrive in europe , according to one european union official
that is certainly the case in the sicily port of catania , where many migrants arrive
the city 's mayor , enzo bianco , insists city residents bear no ill will toward the migrants , but says catania , and sicily can not absorb the ever - growing numbers
the rest of europe must help carry the burden
" increasingly , some italians are losing their patience
others , however , insist italians must keep its doors open
" indeed , in tougher times , millions of impoverished italians left their homeland to settle in the americas and australia
but now , today , italians are grappling to deal with the consequences of an array of old and new ills , ranging from failing states and failing economies to endemic corruption , hopeless poverty , oppression and injustice that no one state or group of states can solve without a gargantuan , expensive and politically daunting effort
