washington a year after isis became a household name in u.s. , using brutality and savvy propaganda to challenge al qaeda and its affiliates for jihadist adherents , u.s. prosecutions of would - be recruits have exploded
the flurry of arrests -- at least 25 people have been detained since january -- is a sign that complicated , manpower - intensive investigations begun when isis started seizing swaths of territory a year ago are finally being completed
but they also highlight the unique challenges that isis poses in comparison with al qaeda , which has attracted fewer u.s. - based recruits
like a new rock band storming the music charts , isis has benefited from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , law enforcement officials said
at first , most of the recruits were self - starters -- people radicalized on their own from consuming isis propaganda from youtube videos and other social media
much of the propaganda comes in the form of slick movie trailer - style videos , some glorifying brutal practices such as the beheading of anyone who isis leaders decide does n't comport with their medieval brand of islamic
but once those initial western recruits arrived , living in the self - declared isis caliphate spanning parts of syria and iraq , they started to directly entice friends and other contacts back home to join them
in minnesota , nine men have been charged as part of an alleged cell of recruits linked to u.s. abdi nur , who turned up fighting with isis in syria in 2014 and began to appeal to his friends to come to the middle east
and the isis recruiters have an easier path to drawing supporters than al qaeda has had
there are signs western recruits have risen to high levels in the isis organization , with their influence reflected in the latest propaganda , counterterrorism and intelligence officials said
and while the large number of arrests show that law enforcement officials are succeeding in their disruption efforts , it also means that u.s. authorities do n't see the lure of isis receding any time soon
