the verdict of the opinion polls on the uk election debate between seven party leaders was simple enough : between david cameron of the conservatives , ed miliband of labour , clegg of the lib dems , farage of the ukip , natalie bennett of the green party , nicola sturgeon of the snp and leanne wood of plaid cymru , the welsh nationalists , there really was no clear winner
comres for itv , which staged the debate , had david cameron , ed miliband and farage tied first with 21 % and nicola sturgeon close behind on 20 %
icm for the guardian scored it ed miliband 25 , david cameron 24 , farage 19 and nicola sturgeon 17
yougov for the times put nicola sturgeon first with 28 points to 20 for farage , 18 for david cameron and only 15 for ed miliband
back in the 1950s , uk politics was simpler : labour and conservatives combined took 97 % of the votes
in our anti-politics age nationalists and others have advanced and the leaders ' tv debate was no gladiatorial contest with a straightforward outcome
from a highly confused affair we can perhaps take six lessons : as the incumbent prime minister , david cameron is probably wise to have refused all invitations to go head to head with ed miliband alone in verbal fisticuffs
ed miliband has been given a hard time by the uk media who have gloated over his difficulties in eating a bacon sandwich and presented him as an awkward geek
as it is , election time media exposure has already seen ed miliband 's ratings as a leader improve
in an earlier clash involving separate sessions before a studio audience and in a grilling by uk tv 's grand inquisitor jeremy paxman , david cameron proved vulnerable on broken promises to cut immigration , on the number of people employed on zero - hours contracts and on being too kind to the rich in his taxation policies
ed miliband has looked unconvincing on how he will fund his promises to continue cutting the budget deficit and how he will curb immigration ; he also is still embarrassed when questioners remind audiences how he knifed his brother david to get the leader 's job
the impression so far is that uk 's voters do n't much like the conservatives despite the recovering economy but do n't quite trust labour to continue the improvement
ed miliband , told by his handlers to look tough , is using the " i " word too much
back in the 2010 uk election debates the clear victor was clegg of the lib dems
then the two main party leaders frequently found themselves parroting " i agree with clegg
the party once dismissed by david cameron as a collection of " fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists " is a serious threat to the conservatives -- and labour -- despite the many gaffes that seemed to cost it some momentum lately
to " win " a tv election debate you need to avoid gaffes yourself , to wrongfoot your opponent , and to offer some excitement that gives your campaign the chance to develop momentum
