the lawyer for bates , an oklahoma reserve deputy who fatally shot a man he meant to subdue with a taser , on saturday released documents that he says verify some of bates ' training as a law enforcement officer
the documents show bates had one taser training class over a six - and - a - half - year period , took three firearms training classes and qualified 10 times , from 2009 to 2014 , to use a handgun
" bates has met all the requisite training required by oklahoma to be a reserve deputy , " said the lawyer , wood , in an interview with cnn
wood said he got them from bates , who asked the tulsa county sheriff 's office to provide his training records
the sheriff 's office has turned down cnn 's requests for the training documents , saying they are part of the investigation
the documents are important because bates ' training has become a central issue in the case
the lawyer for the family of the man who was killed claims that bates , 73 , was n't qualified to be on the force , but received preferential treatment because he 'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff
bates had one taser training class , on march 4 , 2009 , according to a document with a heading from the council on law enforcement education and training , which sets the standards for training peace officers in the state
bates had weapons training once in september 2008 and twice in 2009 , according to sheriff 's office records that bates obtained , wood said
he says he meant to use his taser on harris during the april 2 arrest but accidentally fired his handgun instead
" i shot him ! i 'm sorry ! " bates is heard saying on video of the incident
in an interview friday with the " today " show on nbc , bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies
questions have already been raised about bates ' training and when his service with the tulsa county sheriff 's office started
" wood said bates started working for the sheriff 's office in late 2007 or 2008
but the sheriff 's office has said bates had been a reserve deputy since 2008
bates , who worked as a police officer for one year in the 1960s , completed 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience since becoming a reserve deputy , according to the sheriff 's office
the tulsa world said 480 hours of field training are required to be an " advanced " reserve deputy , which bates claimed to be
the department 's summary of bates ' weapons training shows he scored 80 - 84 those four times
the council on law enforcement education and training records show bates took 14 training classes worth 20 credit hours on december 10 , 2013 , and 20 classes worth 31 credit hours on december 11 , 2014
wood said bates may have been cramming in his required training before the end of the year by taking computer classes
