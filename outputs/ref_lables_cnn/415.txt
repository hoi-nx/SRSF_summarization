on the stage of a tv studio in phnom penh , cambodian-american ly is telling an engrossed audience a tragic , but familiar , story
on april 17 , 1975 -- 40 years ago today -- life as ly knew it was shattered when her hometown , the cambodian capital of phnom penh , fell to the genocidal khmer rouge regime of the communist party of kampuchea
ly , then 13 , was separated from her mother and two of her sisters who , along with virtually the entire population of phnom penh -- about two million people -- were sent on a forced march into the countryside to work
the urban evacuation marked the first phase in the khmer rouge 's revolutionary program of social engineering , intended to establish a new order -- free of money , family ties , religion , education , property and foreign influence
aimed at creating an agrarian utopia , it would instead prove one of the worst genocides of the modern era , resulting in the deaths of at least 1.7 million cambodian -- about a quarter of the country 's population -- over the next four years
ly remained in the capital with her father and four other siblings , three of whom would succumb to starvation and disease in the following years , before her father was shot to death before her eyes in 1979
since production began five years ago , the television show , " it 's not a dream , " has reunited members of 54 cambodian families shattered by the genocide
the series is just one example of the ways in which cambodian 's traumatized society is beginning to undertake the fraught , painful business of reckoning with their history
" the scars of the khmer rouge are very deep and physical and present in modern cambodian , " said seng , a human rights lawyer whose parents were killed by the regime , and who moved to the u.s. as a refugee before returning to her homeland as an adult
" for decades after the khmer rouge were driven from phnom penh by soviet - backed vietnamese forces in january 1979 , the regime 's crimes were seldom spoken about , let alone attempts made to seek redress for victims
far from being snuffed out by the vietnamese invasion , the khmer rouge existed for another two decades
after fleeing the capital in 1979 , khmer rouge leader pol pot and his supporters established a stronghold in the west
" in many villages , people have been living side by side with the executioners for decades , " said krisna uk , executive director of the center for khmer studies
etcheson , a cambodian expert at the school for conflict analysis and resolution at george mason university , said that " for many years , there was a virtual taboo on even speaking of the khmer rouge , as if the very words were ... a malevolent spirit lurking in the corner of every room
" the silence was also due to the fact that cambodian , in seng 's words , " lacked the vocabulary " of therapy and healing to process a crime of the magnitude of the one perpetrated against their society
the khmer rouge 's attempts to reboot society at " year zero " had involved a concentrated effort to exterminate the country 's educated classes -- doctors , lawyers , accountants , engineers , merchants and clergy
" nearly two generations of young cambodian men grew up learning little more than how to kill , " said etcheson
" even today , said uk , young cambodian are not taught about the genocide in high school
in an impoverished country -- one of asian 's poorest , albeit with 7 % predicted economic growth this year -- most young people seemed to be focused on getting ahead than looking back , she said
some were even skeptical that the khmer rouge 's crimes -- the systematic butchery of the " killing fields " -- had really occurred , she added
founded in 2006 , the eccc in the courts of cambodia ( eccc ) is a " hybrid " tribunal using both cambodian and international judges and staff to investigate the khmer rouge 's crimes against humanity and bring leading regime figures to justice
" opinion : an ongoing struggle for justice after the khmer rouge in the first case heard , kaing guek eav , also known as comrade duch -- commandant of the notorious tuol sleng prison where more than 14,000 people were killed -- received a life sentence for war crimes , crimes against humanity , murder and torture
three people were charged last month in relation to those cases : former khmer rouge navy commander meas muth ; im chaem , a former district commander accused of leading a labor camp ; and ao an , a former deputy accused of overseeing massacres at detention centers
prime minister hun sen , cambodian 's strongman leader for decades , has long been a vocal opponent of 003 and 004 , claiming that pursuing the cases could push the country towards civil war
etcheson , a former investigator for the tribunal , has described it as an " imperfect vessel " for delivering justice , but says cambodian 's leaders must strike a balance between two imperatives : delivering justice for victims , and completing the reintegration of former khmer rouge into society
undoubtedly , cambodian today have overcome the fear of talking about the genocide -- to the extent that even the perpetrators feel emboldened to say their piece
krisna uk said the country has seen a wave of khmer rouge memoirs , written by former cadres wanting to argue their case before they die
khieu samphan , " brother number four , " published one such effort ahead of his trial , while sikoeun suong , a sorbonne - educated former diplomat for the khmer rouge regime , published his " journey of a khmer rouge intellectual " in france in 2013
he told an interviewer from france 's le monde last year that he believed that khmer rouge dictator pol pot 's prescriptions for cambodian were sound
" i remain convinced that the marxist analysis made by pol pot of the socioeconomic situation of cambodian , a poor and sparsely populated country , was correct , " he said
but for a few of them , at least , cambodian 's opening up about the genocide has finally brought about the prospect of some healing , however bittersweet
