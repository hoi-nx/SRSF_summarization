the hillary clinton presidential campaign surely anticipated the coming wave of inquiries and criticism about conflicts of interest involving big foreign donors to charities run by the clinton family -- questions set to get a thorough airing in a new book called " clinton cash : the untold story of how and why foreign governments and businesses helped make bill and hillary rich " by peter schweizer , coming out may 5
my guess is that the issues raised by the book will prompt clinton to put its candidate on the road , where she can continue holding loosely scheduled , informal meetings with ordinary americans -- the sorts of people more concerned about local jobs than whether some foreign government or company paid a big speaking fee to bill clinton in hopes of getting special treatment by secretary of state hillary clinton
it 's not that the alleged conflicts are n't potentially serious ; as i recently noted in these pages , they are
the donors included canada 's foreign affairs department , which is promoting the keystone xl pipeline
and several news outlets have reported that banks and other companies with business before the americans government were donors to the clinton global initiative , a sister group that was spun off from the clinton foundation
a bank giving money to charity in hopes of buying leniency from the government is a cause for concern , but until and unless a smoking gun appears in the form of a clear exchange of money for favors , it becomes hard to say what , exactly , is wrong with donating cash to aid in a good cause like combating world hunger or helping to rebuild haiti
even among the banks fined for wrongdoing that contributed to clinton charities , noted jaffe , " there 's no indication the clintons had any knowledge of the ongoing investigations into banks supporting the foundation 's efforts
a more serious critique of the clinton foundations is that they have been an administrative and financial quagmire from their origins , running deficits , expanding uncontrollably and cutting deals that not only raise ethical questions but cast the family 's management skill in a less - than - flattering light
unless the forthcoming book unveils some blockbuster new information , questions about the clintons ' charities is likely to wind up on the same political shelf on which voters seem to have parked concerns about hillary clinton 's use of private emails to conduct state department business
calling extensive exposure of conflicts of interest " distractions " suggests that clinton knows what the polls suggest : that in a nation still struggling to emerge from a long recession , voters will likely judge her on something other than the efficiency and ethics of her charities .
