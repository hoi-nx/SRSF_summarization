a new york jury deliberating the fate of the man charged with the 1979 killing of 6 - year - old etan patz is struggling to reach a verdict
the little boy 's disappearance , more than three decades ago , sparked an era of heightened awareness of crimes against children
deliberations resumed on thursday , one day after new york supreme court justice maxwell wiley ordered the jury to continue efforts to reach a decision on the guilt or innocence of a bodega worker named pedro hernandez
pedro hernandez confessed to police three years ago , but his lawyers said he made up his account of the crime
etan patz 's parents have waited more than 35 years for justice , but some have questioned whether that is even possible in pedro hernandez 's case
pedro hernandez told police in a taped statement that he lured patz into a basement as the boy was on his way to a bus stop in lower manhattan
but pedro hernandez has been repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia and has an " iq in the borderline - to - mild mental retardation range , " his attorney fishbein has said
police interrogated pedro hernandez for 7Â½ hours before he confessed
" i think anyone who sees these confessions will understand that when the police were finished , mr. pedro hernandez believed he had killed etan patz
but in november , a new york judge ruled that pedro hernandez 's confession and his waiving of his miranda rights were legal , making the confession admissible in court
pedro hernandez is charged with two counts of second - degree murder for allegedly intending to cause the boy 's death and for a killing that occurred during a kidnapping
since their young son 's disappearance , the patzes have worked to keep the case alive and to create awareness of missing children in the united states
in the early 1980s , etan 's photo appeared on milk cartons across the country , and news media focused in on the search for him and other missing children
