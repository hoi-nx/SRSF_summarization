boston after weeks of dramatic and emotionally wrenching testimony in the boston marathon bombing trial , jurors deliberated for more than seven hours tuesday
but they have n't reached a verdict yet
the jurors sent out two questions , which are scheduled to be addressed when they return to court wednesday morning
dzhokhar tsarnaev , the 21 - year - old accused boston marathon bomber , faces life in prison or the death penalty
on monday , the jury saw a video of the moment a bomb exploded and disemboweled an 8 - year - old boy and ripped the leg off his sister
the blast killed a 23 - year - old graduate student from china
the jurors heard more horror from april 15 , 2013
at one point , prosecutors played a video that showed the scene after a bomb exploded -- blood and injured victims everywhere and the sounds of a child howling
his mother lost her leg
dzhokhar tsarnaev 's defense attorney judy clarke tried to persuade jurors that her client 's older brother , 26 - year - old tamerlan , who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack , was the instigator of the marathon plot
dzhokhar tsarnaev fidgeted at the defense table as he has done throughout the trial
bill richard , father of bomb victim martin , 8 , craned his neck to watch dzhokhar tsarnaev as the prosecutor spoke
dzhokhar tsarnaev " chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on boston , " chakravarty said
" he chose a day when there would be civilians on the sidewalks , and he targeted those civilians : men , women and children
" the prosecutor showed a picture of dzhokhar tsarnaev and his brother , tamerlan , in the marathon crowd
the day of the bombings , chakravarty said , " they felt they were soldiers
" dzhokhar tsarnaev is accused of 30 counts , including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism
if dzhokhar tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts , the trial will proceed to a second phase , the so - called penalty phase
that part of the trial will include evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors , and the jury will be asked to weigh elements that make this crime especially heinous against details from dzhokhar tsarnaev 's background and mental health history that would weigh in his favor
" he was there , " clarke conceded as the trial opened , but the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare dzhokhar tsarnaev 's life
jurors were shown a photo of dzhokhar tsarnaev standing by a tree behind the family of martin
" chakravarty quoted martin 's father who earlier testified , " i guess we were just unlucky that day
the brothers ' acts that day were intended , he said , " to make a point
' " the defense has maintained that dzhokhar tsarnaev , who was 19 and flunking out of college at the university of massachusetts , dartmouth , fell under the sway of his older , more radicalized brother
during the 15 - minute rebuttal period , prosecutor weinreb told jurors not to be distracted by the defense 's " attempt to point the finger at somebody else
" " there should be no doubt in your mind that the defendant and his brother are equally guilty , " he said
" weinreb pointed out that after the bombing , dzhokhar tsarnaev went to the grocery store
" if you are capable of such hate , such callousness that you can murder and maim 20 people and then drive to whole foods and buy some milk , can you really blame it on your brother ? " the radicalization of dzhokhar tsarnaev from the start , prosecutors presented a compelling case in which the horrors of april 15 to 19 , 2013 , were vividly brought to life once again
according to testimony , tamerlan set off a bomb made from a 6 - quart pressure cooker , explosive powder from fireworks , duct tape , nails and bbs on boylston street near the finish line
twelve seconds later , dzhokhar tsarnaev allegedly detonated a second , similar bomb outside the forum restaurant , slightly more than a block away
dzhokhar tsarnaev struck tamerlan , who was wounded , when he charged police in the car
" dzhokhar tsarnaev ditched the stolen car and sought shelter in a dry - docked boat parked in a trailer in a backyard in watertown
