bernie sanders , my vermont senator and , indeed , a friend of many years , is now running for president
he is barely known to the general public , which makes him a very long shot indeed to win election to the highest office in the nation
those who follow politics a little more closely will possibly think of him as some left - wing kook that only the most liberal state in the union would ever dream of electing to the senate , as we did in 2006
let me add this , as someone who has followed him closely ( and with admiration ) for a long time : when people stop to listen to bernie sanders , they realize that -- whether or not they agree with his ideas -- he is , without a question , an authentic voice who speaks without fear
i remember when bernie sanders was mayor of burlington ; it is the largest city in vermont ( which is n't saying much )
he 's a progressive , holding his seat in the senate as an independent , although he votes with the democratic on major issues
when bernie sanders decided to run for jim jeffords ' seat in the house in 1988 , many considered him a long shot
make no mistake about this : vermont is n't just a rainbow - colored state full of ex-hippies and leftists in berets
it 's an agricultural economy , and bernie sanders has understood this well
he has thoughtfully supported vermont 's dairy - farming community over many years
he has also been a strong supporter of vermont 's hunting culture -- much to the annoyance of many on the left , who wonder why the nra does n't attack him
i was never prouder of bernie sanders than during the run - up to the invasion of iraq
so what would it look like if , by some bizarre chance , bernie sanders caught fire and became president ? he would certainly work hard for universal health care , which has been a passion of his
famously , on december 10 , 2010 , he gave an eight and a half hour speech on the floor of the senate opposing the reinstatement of bush - era tax cuts , a vivid piece of rhetoric worth looking at closely by anyone who wants to understand bernie sanders 's views
how many americans politicians have ever said this aloud ? and what does he really mean by that term ? bernie sanders knows what he 's doing
and it 's working people who seem mostly to interest bernie sanders
he has been one of only a few voices in the senate in the past decade who has consistently pointed out that extreme right - wing factions funded by " millionaires and billionaires " ( one of bernie sanders 's favorite mantras ) have held sway over americans politics for as long as anyone can recall
what he will do , however , is move hillary clinton on matters of importance to progressives : the restraining of wall street and large corporations , the scandal of how americans allows its political campaigns to be funded and the welfare of working class americans , who seems pathetically easy to persuade -- again and again -- to vote against their own economic interests
