five years after the deepwater horizon rig exploded and unleashed the largest marine oil spill in the nation 's history , we are still experiencing -- yet only beginning to truly understand -- its profound environmental and economic repercussions
in fact , reports indicate that the gulf 's seafood industry , which supplies the u.s. with roughly 40 % of its seafood , is finally starting to rebound
one of the populations that can provide insight into these questions is the gulf crab
crabs play an important role in the region : roughly 60 million pounds were fished in the gulf in 2012 , earning tens of millions in revenue
i have been working with colleagues at florida international university and university of louisiana at lafayette to better understand what might be happening biologically inside the crab when it is exposed to oil and the dispersant used to respond to the spill
using the power of genomics and computational biology , we analyzed the genes of flat back mud crabs that were exposed to oil from the macondo prospect where the deepwater horizon rig was drilling when it exploded or to a combination of oil and dispersant in the lab. by studying gene expression , the process that turns information from a gene into a product that functions within a cell , we searched for indicators that might signal exposure to oil and , based on the types of changes we might see , clues as to how the crabs respond
it 's not just gulf crabs that are experiencing changes
research on different species and other aspects of the regional environment is starting to show that there could be long - term effects resulting from the oil spill and the response to the spill
this not only has consequences for the gulf area , where oil drilling continues , but also for communities along the atlantic coast , where the obama administration has recently announced a plan to open unprecedented oil and natural gas exploration
( bp 's vice president of communications , geoff morrell , told cnn that wildlife species in the gulf have " bounced back and " there is no data that suggests there are any long - term population - level impacts to any species
