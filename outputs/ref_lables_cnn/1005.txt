henry louis gates stands accused of scrubbing part of a segment in his pbs documentary series " finding your roots " because the actor affleck put pressure on him
affleck 's concern was that the segment would have aired his family 's dirty laundry , which includes a slaveholding ancestor , benjamin cole
affleck said , in a statement posted on facebook , that he " did n't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves
" and henry louis gates later explained that he subbed that part of the segment for another that made for more " compelling television
and affleck 's initial reluctance to acknowledge his truth ( an impulse , he said on facebook , he regrets ) is surprising
last month , affleck lent his star power to support continued foreign assistance for the democratic republic of congo by testifying before congress
the irony here is that none of this would have ever been found out if sony entertainment 's emails had not been hacked and if henry louis gates had n't written to lynton , ceo of sony entertainment , for advice
" henry louis gates acknowledges that to delete the segment at the request of a guest " would be a violation of pbs rules
" for affleck 's " finding your roots " segment , he substituted a revolutionary war ancestor instead of the slave - owning one
if henry louis gates thought there was no need for the slavery segment because it did n't make for good television , there would have been no need to consult with lynton ; gates could have given affleck what he wanted because he made the assessment of how strong affleck 's story was
the original script , reprinted on gawker and elsewhere , makes it clear , however , that the slave - owner angle makes for better television
here are some excerpts : henry louis gates sets up the segment describing benjamin cole as living in savannah , georgia
then the voice - over lowers the boom : " we wanted to see if we could learn how affleck 's ancestor felt about ( slavery )
" henry louis gates shows the slave schedule of the 1850 census to affleck , who says , " there 's benjamin cole , owned 25 slaves
affleck 's segment had the potential to continue an important dialogue -- but the brand management part of affleck won , and the rest is history
henry louis gates has to deal with pbs and wnet 's internal review
