panama , panama ending a decades - long standstill in united states - cuba relations , president obama met for an hour saturday with his cuba counterpart raul , the first time the two nations ' top leaders have sat down for substantive talks in more than 50 years
the meeting in a small conference room on the sidelines of the summit of the americas came as the two countries work to end the the cold war enmity that had led to a total freeze of diplomatic ties
and while both leaders proclaimed progress had been made , a key stumbling block -- cuba 's place on the united states list of countries that sponsor terror -- remained unresolved
" this is obviously an historic meeting , " obama said at the beginning of his session with raul , claiming that decades of strain had done little to benefit either cuba or citizens of the united states
" raul , who earlier in the day said he trusted obama , acknowledged there would be difficult stumbling blocks as his nation works to repair ties with the united states
" speaking to reporters after his session with raul , obama said the meeting was " candid and fruitful " and could prove to be a " turning point " in his push to defrost ties with cuba
" but in terms of the overall direction of cuba policy , i think there is a strong majority both in the united states and in cuba that says our ability to engage , to open up commerce and travel and people to people exchanges is ultimately going to be good for cuba people
before obama arrived in panama on wednesday , he spoke with raul by phone , laying the groundwork for what will become a new era of relations between the neighboring countries
" the cold war has been over for a long time , " obama said during opening remarks at the summit saturday
" that exhortation , however , seemed to be lost on raul himself , who expanded what was meant to be a six - minute speech into a 50 - minute address lecturing leaders on cuba 's revolution and giving a litany of perceived grievances to cuba over the past 50 years
but he distinguished obama from past united states presidents , saying he respected obama 's move toward reconciliation
" in my opinion , president obama in an honest man , " raul said through an interpreter
" a united states administration official said raul 's long list of grievances was expected , despite the move toward diplomatic ties
obama set to test engagement doctrine with cuba in panama his meeting with raul on saturday is n't being billed as a formal bilateral session , but obama 's aides are still characterizing the event as the highest - level engagement with the cuba government since then - vice president richard nixon met with fidel castro in 1959
" the reason we 're here is because the president strongly believes that an approach that was focused entirely on isolation , focused entirely on seeking to cut off the cuba people from the united states had failed
" the overtures to cuba have not been universally popular in the united states ; some lawmakers were irate that obama was seeking to engage what they regard as a corrupt government
" as we move toward the process of normalization , we 'll have our differences , government to government , with cuba on many issues -- just as we differ at times with other nations within the americas , just as we differ with our closest allies , " obama said at a meeting of civil society leaders friday
the long history between the united states and cuba obama closed out his time in panama with a news conference where he covered topics ranging from hillary clinton 's expected presidential announcement to his framework deal with iran on its nuclear program
after the president 's remarks , mccain tweeted " so pres. obama goes to # panama , meets with raul and attacks me - i 'm sure raul is pleased
