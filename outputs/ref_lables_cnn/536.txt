two years ago in a less turbulent time , premeau and danke launched a small business , memories gourmet pizza , in their wisconsin town
but all that was threatened this week when people began mistaking them for memories pizza of walkerton , indiana , which made national headlines after its owners said they would refuse to cater a same - sex wedding
people posted angry comments on memories gourmet pizza 's facebook page and called its phone number to protest
and almost overnight , premeau and danke found themselves thrust unwillingly into a national debate over indiana 's controversial religious freedom restoration act
indiana pizzeria finds itself at the center of ' religious freedom ' debate premeau thinks the firestorm was sparked by people googling " memories pizza " and confusing the two businesses -- despite the fact that nichols and walkerton are in separate states and almost 300 miles apart
he and danke tried to defuse the outcry with a facebook post saying in part , " we are not that company in indiana , nor do we agree or condone their words or actions
" in response , they began getting messages of support on facebook , along with a few sharp - tongued comments from supporters of the other memories pizza
