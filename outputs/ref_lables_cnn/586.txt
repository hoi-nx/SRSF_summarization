boston now the real boston marathon trial can begin
a federal jury 's decision to convict tsarnaev of 30 charges related to the 2013 boston marathon bombings was the most anticlimactic of anticlimaxes
we have n't learned much new , although harrowing details about the deaths of the tsarnaev brothers ' four victims have come out
more than anything , many people find something cathartic in seeing the seemingly insolent , unrepentant tsarnaev being brought to justice
the only issue to be decided is whether tsarnaev should be executed
was tsarnaev so thoroughly under the sway of his radicalized older brother , tamerlan , that he should be spared lethal injection ? or had this seemingly typical teenager transformed himself into a hardened jihadist who obsessed over al qaeda propaganda such as the article " make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom " ? what kind of justice should tsarnaev receive ? there is no death penalty in massachusetts , and in september 2013 , according to a globe poll , 57 % of respondents supported life in prison for tsarnaev ; just 33 % said he should be executed
but imagine a different scenario in which tsarnaev had been allowed to plead guilty in return for a life sentence
he should be allowed to fade away into the obscurity of a maximum - security prison cell
the people who deserve to be remembered are those he and his brother killed on marathon day â martin richard , krystle campbell and lingzi lu â and sean collier , the mit police officer they executed in cold blood
