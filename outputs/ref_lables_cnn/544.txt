when photographer johan bavman became a father for the first time , he took more than a passing wonder about how his native sweden is said to be the most generous nation on earth for parental leave
he used his photography to document the real - life experience of other fathers taking full advantage of sweden 's extraordinary program , which allows mothers and fathers to take long , long leaves from their careers so they can care for their newborns
get this : sweden grants a total of 480 calendar days of parental leave , with 390 of them paid at 80 % of income , with a maximum of 3,160 euros a month or $ 3,474
fathers have to share that leave with mothers
so to promote both parents to raise their children , sweden has mandated that 60 of the 480 days be " daddy months " or " partner months
in reality , only 12 % of sweden couples equally share the 480 days of leave , johan bavman said , with women continuing to lead the way as the stay - at - home parent and men as the careerist
still , johan bavman mused last summer about how the policy impacts those men who use the full measure of their parental leave
" i did n't want to bring out fathers as superdads , " johan bavman said
the fathers have become more understanding of their wives and even their own mothers , johan bavman said
johan bavman is looking for a total of 60 fathers to photograph , to culminate in an exhibition and a book
johan bavman is a freelance photographer based in malmo , sweden
from 2008 - 2011 , he worked as a staff photographer at sydsvenskan , one of sweden 's largest newspapers .
