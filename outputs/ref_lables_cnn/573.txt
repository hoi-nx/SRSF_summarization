most days , 16 - year - old zobott walks into huntley high school in suburban chicago around 7:30 a.m. like any high schooler might
zobott is enrolled in huntley high school 's blended learning program , which merges internet - based instruction with a more traditional classroom setting
one - third of the school 's 2,700 students are enrolled
" having to work online makes it really accessible to do the work that i have to get done , " said zobott , a top - ranked junior who balances a heavy load of extracurricular activities with schoolwork
" huntley high school students and educators often refer to the program simply as " blended
unlike many traditional online learning programs , students have the option of a flexible schedule during allotted blended learning days
" in blended learning , we focus on the content
" the " homegrown " program , which launched in 2011 , gives students who struggle in certain content areas more one - on - one time with teachers during the school day , pasco said
" before blended , that had to happen after school or before school or on saturday or maybe not at all , because we had too many other activities that encroach upon ( students ' ) academic day , " pasco said
" there 's actually much better accountability , " said burkey , the superintendent for huntley high school 's school district , which includes about 9,500 students
" blended learning is not a panacea , and the success of the program is n't about spending a bunch of money on technology
" burkey said there were plenty of questions about blended learning when it was first introduced to the chicago district in 2011
one concern : how was the district going to pay for it ? it turns out the blended learning program spends about $ 8,500 per student , less than the illinois average of $ 12,000 per student
in a study published in 2014 in elearn magazine , 92 % of students surveyed at huntley high school said that they were satisfied with the blended learning experience , and no teachers reported negative experiences with it
since blended learning was implemented , huntley high school 's average composite act score has gone up nearly a point , from 22.1 to 23.0
the blended learning program helps him better prioritize his busy schedule
what 's still left to be determined about blended learning is how well students do in college or jobs after they graduate , burkey said
my own kids are still in elementary and middle school , so they have not done blended learning yet , but they definitely will when they get to high school
