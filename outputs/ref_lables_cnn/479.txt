greenpeace activists have climbed aboard a shell oil rig to protest the company 's plans to drill in the arctic near alaska
" we made it ! we 're on shell 's platform
" everyone can help turn this into a platform for people power ! " the rig , the polar pioneer , is on its way to the arctic via seattle
the environmental activists caught up with it about 750 miles northwest of hawaii , greenpeace said
greenpeace is furious over a decision last week by american authorities to lift the suspensions on leases to drill for oil and gas in the chukchi sea , which lies between northern alaska and russian
the american government 's decision " means that in 100 days , shell could begin drilling in the alaska arctic , " greenpeace said
shell 's work in the arctic has suffered some setbacks in the past , including a drilling barge that ran aground off southern alaska on december 31 , 2012
in the current episode , the activists pursued the polar pioneer , which shell is leasing from transocean , as it traveled thousands of miles aboard a transport vessel from malaysia , greenpeace said
