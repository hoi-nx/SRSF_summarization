actress mindy kaling 's brother says that he posed as a black man years ago to get into medical school and that the experience opened his eyes to what he calls the hypocrisy of affirmative action
the revelation comes as ingam , who is of indian descent , is pitching a book about his experiences as a " hard - partying college frat boy who discovered the seriousness and complexity of america 's racial problems while posing as a black man
" on his website , almostblack.com , vijay chokal - ingam says he hatched the plan in 1998 after realizing in college that his grades were n't going to be good enough to get into med school as an indian-american
" so , i shaved my head , trimmed my long indian eyelashes , and applied to medical school as a black man , " he wrote on the website
" what started as a devious ploy to gain admission to medical school turned into a twisted social experiment
despite a relatively mediocre 3.1 college grade - point average and a good - but - not - great score of 31 on the mcat , ingam claims he was wooed by several top medical schools
first , there is no point of comparison : vijay chokal - ingam never applied to medical schools as an indian-american
vijay chokal - ingam eventually attended slu , dropping out after two years
vijay chokal - ingam says his story shows how affirmative action " destroys the dreams of millions of indian-american , asian american , and white applicants for employment and higher education
as might be expected , vijay chokal - ingam 's claim has n't gone over well in some quarters
" " whatever you feel about affirmative action , let 's consider that one person 's experience over a decade and a half ago -- an experience that ultimately did n't yield any deluge in acceptance letters anyway -- is not really indicative of the current state of college admissions , " wrote salon 's mary elizabeth williams
" instead , vijay chokal - ingam 's story is one of a successful woman 's brother liberally using her name to drum up attention and controversy
" vijay chokal - ingam 's sister , formerly of " the office " and current star of tv 's " the mindy project , " is among those who are n't on board , he wrote on his website
