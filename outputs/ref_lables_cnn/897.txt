hillary clinton is now officially a candidate for president -- and the never ending clinton story rumbles on
she started as the first lady that the right loved to hate , then the deceived wife , next a senator , then a candidate for president in one of the most dynamic primaries in history and finally , a secretary of state
the gop have their aristocratic bushes , the democrats have their clintons
and if hillary clinton or jeb were to win two presidential terms , then in the 44 years from 1981 to 2025 , 28 will have had a clinton or a bush in the white house
" but even though hillary clinton has been around nearly my entire lifetime , the economist may speak for many when it asks : " what does hillary clinton stand for ? " there is a paradox she presents : she is by far the best - known presidential candidate across both parties and , for the moment , almost unchallenged within her own
yet even though diane feinstein can assert confidently that hillary clinton " does n't ' need ' ( the white house )
there are good grounds for a liberal primary challenge to clinton
these are the issues that her democrats rivals are running on
nevertheless , there is a strange contradiction between the constant assertions that democrats want a race and the polling evidence that clinton would beat anyone who tried to take her on
why do liberals demand a conversation about policy if the only answer they can still come up with is hillary clinton ? the explanation is that the democrats is intellectually impoverished
the democrats ' challenges , however , are just as substantial
barack obama was elected at one of the highest points of national democrats popularity
but , since then , democrats power has been whittled away in successive congressional and local elections -- leaving the party without significant representation in the deep south and absent any mildly conservative support at all
democrats have become about defending the honor and reputation of their president rather than proposing bold new reforms
who really imagines that hillary clinton is the kind of personality that can spark a renaissance of thinking or a rejuvenation of activism among liberals ? to repeat the question : what is she exactly running for ? if she has one trump card to play , however , it is reinvention
if there is little intellectualism left in liberalism , at least hillary clinton is clever
