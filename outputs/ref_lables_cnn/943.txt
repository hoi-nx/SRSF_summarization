after a weekend shipwreck off the coast of italian that may have killed hundreds of migrants , the international organization for migrants said monday that there may be three more migrant boats in distress in international waters
authorities still do n't know the fate of many of the passengers , including children , who were on the large ship bound from libyan to european that capsized saturday night in the frigid waters of the mediterranean
that sinking may be the worst in a series of disasters in which migrants have lost their lives on vessels that are too rickety to survive long voyages
a bangladeshi survivor told investigators there were 950 people on board
maltese authorities , who are working with italian rescuers , said around 50 people had been saved
two of the survivors were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in sicily , according to italian police officer maria guia federico
on monday , european union ministers met in luxembourg and proposed a 10 - point plan to help address the crisis
" the european union high representative for foreign affairs and security policy said the european union must fight human traffickers , strengthen european ' duty to save lives at sea and share responsibility when it comes to the resettlement and relocation of refugees
" we need to fight the organizations that are trafficking and smuggling people , so that we can prevent desperate people from leaving in desperate conditions , " mogherini said
" migrants have been attempting the perilous journey across the mediterranean to southern european for years , but authorities have reported a sudden surge in the past 10 days , along with a grim spike in the number of those who are killed en route
as rescuers approached the boat in response to a distress call saturday night , authorities say , migrants moved to one side , hoping to be saved
according to one bangladeshi survivor , large numbers of people remained trapped inside the boat as it sank
smugglers -- human traffickers organizing the voyages -- had locked the doors to the lower levels of the vessel , the survivor told italian authorities
" a mass grave is being created in the mediterranean and european policies are responsible , " said de filippi , the president of the international aid group doctors without borders
" de filippi called on european states to immediately launch large - scale search and rescue operations with proactive patrolling as close as possible to libyan shores
" faced with thousands of desperate people fleeing wars and crises , european has closed borders , forcing people in search of protection to risk their lives and die at sea , " he said
" save the children similarly called on european officials to do more
" with each day we delay we lose more innocent lives and european slips further into an immoral abyss
" there is a well - oiled machine with the human traffickers , first by land and then by sea , and they feel the need for these desperate people who just want to get to european at all costs , " said rome - based journalist barbie nadeau
" we 're swamped , " gozi , the italian minister for european affairs , told french daily le monde
frontex has no vessels or surveillance equipment of its own , so has to rely on european member states to lend it ships
as anti-immigrant parties thrive across the continent , european nations are collectively struggling to cope with the migration crisis on their doorstep
" we ca n't act as if each tragedy is the last while crossing our fingers that another one does n't happen , " gozi told le monde , lamenting " a total absence " of european union policy on how to deal with refugees arriving in european
the european commission , the executive branch of the european union , said sunday it was consulting member states , european agencies and international organizations to prepare what it called a european migration strategy to be adopted in mid-may
but international groups say european governments are failing to do enough
