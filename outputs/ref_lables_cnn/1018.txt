on kabul 's streets , you can easily find the uneasy legacy of u.s. 's longest war
outside one mosque -- mixing with other men desperate for a day 's worth of casual manual labor -- are five men who months ago had one valuable skill nato depended upon : they speak english
they were , each for a different reason -- each for a reason they do not understand -- all fired from their jobs and then blacklisted , they say , meaning they can no longer get work with other government groups or ngo here
i am living in a market , in one of the empty shops
" a third man -- all requested anonymity -- says : " right now i sleep here , on the street , in this mosque area
the u.s. embassy and nato declined to comment for this story
its population is five times what it was when nato arrived here , even by the most conservative estimates , and the violence in the provinces means people swell it further still -- arriving in kabul 's dusty , mountainous bowl of a city in order to avoid the fighting
neighborhoods that were once massively over-priced cliques of foreigners living in " poppy palaces " -- villas allegedly bought from profiteers of the opium trade -- are now empty
it is the same for the restaurants here that used to brim with contractors and ngo workers
drive out east -- past the women in burqas who sit on road bumps , holding their children , hoping drivers will slow enough to throw them change -- and you see roads lined with the detritus of u.s. 's war here
huge lines of excavators , cherry - pickers , and forklift trucks sit idle
exclusive : afghanistan woman forced to marry her rapist further down the road too are more winners - turned - losers of the nato presence here
trucks lined the roads and climbed up to the military bases
now the bases are gone , and the trucks that once supplied millions sit still
each night the houses seem packed -- the commitment to the future still is popular here , despite the uncertainty -- even if the lights that decorate them seem more and more like a symbol of leaving
nato 's efforts to keep them on are reported to have involved diesel power stations that cost billions but were barely switched on
