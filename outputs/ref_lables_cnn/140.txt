since the news broke last weekend that hillary had declared her candidacy , notable among the blitz of news stories are the many that refer to her as the mononymous " hillary , " as if she were a pop star in a pantsuit
the new york post published an item titled " lena dunham backs hillary for president " while gossip site tmz refers to the former flotus , american senator , and secretary of state on a first - name basis throughout its news story on the announcement
even the new republic posted a piece about the run called " there 's nothing inevitable about hillary
" she 's famous enough by now to go by one name , but should she ? while clinton is arguably more widely known than any of her to - date opponents , she 's also a former american senator and secretary of state
and yet , despite her decorated career in government , we 've long called clinton by her first name , and her first name only , in a way we do n't do with men who have held similar , or even vaguely similar , positions of power
according to a university of utah study , clinton was called by her first name four times more than her 2008 rival , barack obama , and so it goes this time around
a position that not only deserves formality and respect , but within a global context seems to require it
her campaign chairman reportedly emailed potential campaign donors yesterday with the missive that " it 's official : hillary 's running for president
" but while we should like our president -- if not desire to have her as a personal friend -- it 's far more important to trust , and respect , her -- and that still requires a level of formality
whether she endorses the idea or not , calling clinton by her first name serves to , at best , reinforce gender and workplace stereotypes -- that women need to be " approachable , " not abrasive or aloof , in order to get the job done and be liked while doing it -- and at worst , infantilize and put her in her place
there 's a reason , after all , that we address current and former presidents as mr. president when we meet them , and not " hey , jimmy ! " and if there 's a reason hillary will be elected as our next president , it 's not because she let us call her hillary .
