australia many australians are understandably appalled by the brutal and pointless executions of andrew chan and myuran sukumaran
consequently , indonesia 's actions raise more general questions about the powers we give to states -- or , more accurately , to those who control the coercive apparatus of the state at any particular moment
state officials can order people to be killed because -- especially in democracies -- we authorize them to do so
and yet even where that authority is deemed legitimate -- as is clearly the case in indonesia -- its significance is only seriously considered at moments like this , when the very personal circumstances of some of its victims become the stuff of popular commentary and media interest
however disappointed we may be in the actions of indonesia president widodo -- in whom so many inside and outside indonesia have invested such hopes as a progressive force -- he can make a couple of claims in his defense
first , widodo -- popularly known as widodo -- is indonesia 's elected leader and is fulfilling his promise to crack down on what he and many other indonesia see as a problem
indonesia 's domestic political context and the need to be seen as not giving favorable treatment to foreigners left him very little room to maneuver
this is not a justification for his actions , but it helps to explain why he was so impervious to pleas for mercy
we may not like indonesia 's laws , but they are being applied even - handedly within national borders where state officials have authority
significantly , it is those same national borders that demarcate the extent of indonesia 's leaders ability -- or even desire , perhaps -- to use their capacity for state - sanctioned violence
other countries -- including australia -- have no such inhibitions and regularly kill perfectly innocent civilians in the course of one conflict or another
would we permit the state to execute people ? not any longer in australia , at least
but before we congratulate ourselves on how civilized and humane we 've become , perhaps we should pause to consider the violence that is still being inflicted on perfectly innocent people around the world in our collective name
what was done in the name of the indonesia state was undoubtedly awful , futile and reprehensible
