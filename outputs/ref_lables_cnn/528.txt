buzz has surrounded hbo 's new documentary " going clear : scientology and the prison of belief , " but scientologist travolta is not a fan
" " i 've been so happy with my ( scientology ) experience in the last 40 years that i really do n't have anything to say that would shed light on ( a documentary ) so decidedly negative , " travolta said
the actor , one of the scientology 's most high - profile members along with stars like tom and kirstie alley , is premiering his new film , " the forger , " in clearwater , florida
" he called scientology " brilliant " and credited the church with helping him to survive the death of his teen son , jett , after a seizure while the family was on vacation in the bahamas in 2009
