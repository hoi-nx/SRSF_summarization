whether a patient is in the hospital for an organ transplant , an appendectomy or to have a baby , one complaint is common : the gown
" you 're at the hospital because something 's wrong with you -- you 're vulnerable -- then you get to wear the most vulnerable garment ever invented to make the whole experience that much worse , " said ted streuli , who lives in edmond , okla. , and has had to wear hospital gowns on multiple occasions
they are disempowering , " said camilla mcrory of olney , md . hospital gowns have gotten a face - lift after some help from fashion designers like these from patient style and the henry ford innovation institute
the gowns are among the most vexing parts of being in the hospital
in 2010 , it introduced new gowns after being prompted by the ceo , who often heard patient complaints when he was a practicing heart surgeon
the prominent academic medical center ultimately sought the help of fashion icon diane von furstenberg , settling on a reversible gown with a front and back v - neck , complete derriere coverage , and features such as pockets , softer fabric and a new bolder print pattern
patients " loved the gowns , " boissy said
" it 's all part of a trend among hospitals to improve the patient reviews and their own bottom lines -- fueled in part by the health law 's focus on quality of care and other federal initiatives
the centers for medicare & medicaid services increasingly factors patients ' satisfaction into its quality measures , which are linked to the size of medicare payments hospitals get
but they can also mean making waiting rooms more comfortable , improving the quality of food served to patients or , as in this case , updating hospital gowns
the detroit - based henry ford health system is in the process of updating its gowns , an initiative that began when the system 's innovation institute challenged students at the city 's college for creative studies to identify and offer a solution to one hospital problem
when the institute tested his gown design , forbes said , patient - satisfaction scores noticeably increased in a few days
what patients wear needs to be comfortable yet allow health professionals proper access during exams , meaning it must open and close easily
beyond cost , more ingrained cultural expectations might also play a role in what hospitals think patients should wear , said lee , an assistant professor of medicine at mcgill university , who co-authored a 2014 study in the journal jama internal medicine , examining whether gowns were important and whether patients might be fine wearing their own or hospital - provided pants , instead of or along with gowns
traditional gowns make it easier to examine patients quickly , and several doctors lee spoke to seemed shocked at the idea that patients might wear garments other than the open - backed gown during their stay
it 's navigating hospital bureaucracies , said eber , president of the california - based company patientstyle , which designs and sells alternative gowns
