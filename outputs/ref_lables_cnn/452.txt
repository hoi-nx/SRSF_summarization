that 's what kankakee county , illinois , sheriff bukowski said saturday about kamron taylor , the 23 - year - old convicted murderer turned jail escapee until his arrest overnight in chicago
authorities around illinois had been looking for kamron taylor since early wednesday , when he jumped a correctional officer at kankakee county 's jerome combs detention center , then took off with the guard 's uniform and suv
surveillance video was the last officials saw of kamron taylor until just before midnight friday , in chicago
but when chicago police contacted their law enforcement counterparts about 60 miles south in kankakee county and told them about the tattoo , it became clearer who the man was
" fingerprints later confirmed that chicago police had indeed caught up with kamron taylor
but , when he does , the sheriff said the convict will likely face an attempted murder charge for his attack of the jail guard on top of his already extensive criminal history
what the sheriff does n't want is for kamron taylor to go free ever again
the assaulted correctional officer remains in an illinois hospital , where his condition has improved and he 's been able to talk to fellow authorities
this qualifies as very good news , given that authorities think kamron taylor " believed that he had killed that correctional officer by strangling him " around 3 a.m. ( 4 a.m. et ) wednesday , according to the sheriff
the guard was left on the jail floor , going in and out of consciousness , for about 35 minutes before authorities -- concerned because the guard had n't responded to calls -- found him , the sheriff said
" we think that because he had the officer 's uniform on , " the sheriff explained this week , " that 's how he was able to effectively escape
" that 's where the big mistake happened , " the sheriff said
