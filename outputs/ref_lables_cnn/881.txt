cedar falls , iowa as aides politely tried to rush cruz from an event in cedar falls to one in cedar rapids , iowa , on thursday , the presidential candidate continued shaking hands with anyone who wanted to meet him
" senator , " he said , " can i pray with you real quick ? " " yeah , " cruz said , as he clasped the man 's upper arm and the two bowed their heads
it was one of the many moments when cruz connected with voters on a religious level last week , as the senator from texas hit the trail in iowa for the first time as a presidential candidate
being the only official contender in the race , cruz drew large crowds during his two - day swing across the state
he 's counting on iowa , known for its vocal and active evangelical base , to propel him forward in what 's expected to be a tough competition among a crowded field of gop candidates
cruz , himself , displays a pastoral swagger when he is speaking on stage and working a room
the past two winners of iowa 's caucuses rose to victory with support from the christian right , and cruz , who announced his bid last month at the well - known baptist school liberty university , is aiming to energize that same base and claim the coveted state as his prize
evangelicals make up a large segment of iowa 's gop voter bloc
according to a des moines / bloomberg politics poll from january , 44 % of likely 2016 gop caucus - goers said they were born - again or evangelical christian
cruz has built a brand as a stalwart conservative willing to buck gop leadership on fiscal issues , but he showed in iowa last week that he 's also eager to champion social issues at a time when many gop are anxious to avoid them

rafael cruz , who 's become a celebrity among christian conservatives , will frequently visit iowa over the next year , cruz told voters
and cruz 's iowa director , bryan english , is a former pastor
cruz 's first television ads are appearing this weekend during programs on fox news and nbc that are pegged to easter sunday
that 's why , for cruz , courting evangelicals is only a component of a three - pronged strategy to win the nomination that also includes dominating the tea party faction and competing for the libertarian base
" cruz argued thursday that the gop needs to bridge the gap between what he described as the ron paul - rand paul faction of the party -- young libertarian - minded voters -- and the santorum base -- evangelicals
" cruz frequently says he wants to see a return of the evangelical vote to 2004 levels , when more than six in 10 evangelicals voted in the presidential election , a higher than normal turnout for the demographic
" it is n't a pond , it 's an unfished ocean of available voters who are conservative
" later in april , voters in iowa will see the bulk of the gop field tackle these issues when they take the stage at an event hosted by the iowa faith and freedom coalition
