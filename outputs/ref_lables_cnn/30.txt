would you build a house with water ? hungary architect matyas gutai believes that water is the perfect material for keeping a house at a comfortable temperature
matyas gutai built a prototype house in his hometown of kecskemet , south of budapest , with his high school friend milan berenyi , after years of research and development
the house was built with a grant from the eu , and showcases the " liquid engineering " concepts matyas gutai has written about extensively
panels , some of steel , and some of glass , make up the structure of the house and a sheet of water is trapped between the inner layers , which equalizes the temperature across the building
the house is actually able to reheat itself , when its hot excess heat is stored either in the foundations of the building or in external storage , to be brought back to the walls when the temperature drops
this is a very efficient and sustainable system : the house can produce its own energy and be more independent of energy suppliers , which could reduce carbon emissions
" our panel can heat and cool the building itself -- the water inside the panel does the very same job as heating , " says matyas gutai
" while studying sustainable architecture at the university of tokyo , in 2003 , matyas gutai got the idea for his water house from a visit to the open air hot baths
despite the snowfall outside the pool , matyas gutai remained comfortably warm inside it -- it was then he realized the importance of water 's surface temperature and its potential use in architecture
" " this research dates back seven or eight years , " explains matyas gutai
matyas gutai has worked in cooperation with universities and manufacturers to make sure the building is viable , and while the prototype house is only a small space ( eight square meters in total ) it demonstrates the power of this new technology
the water house is one way to do that , " said matyas gutai , who currently works as a researcher at feng chia university in taiwan
