a tsa committee concluded that full screening of airport employees nationwide would not lower the overall risk to the public , according to a report released monday
the report by the tsa 's aviation security advisory committee said that full employee screening would not " appreciably increase the overall system - wide protection
" the tsa and most airports could not afford 100 % employee screening , the report said
as a result of the report , tsa secretary johnson announced immediate actions , including criminal background checks every two years for all airport aviation workers , screening of airline and airport employees traveling as passengers , reduction of access points to secure areas at all airports and increased random screening of aviation employees
" immediately following the incident in december 2014 , tsa increased the random and unpredictable screening of aviation workers at various airport access points to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities , " johnson said in a statement
" specifically , the tsa report said employee vetting should be strengthened by " updating the list of disqualifying criminal offenses , instituting continuous activity monitoring through the inclusion of additional fbi ( fbi ) and homeland security data sources , and maintaining a national database of airport employees whose credentials have been revoked for cause
" in addition , the tsa should expand the collection of domestic intelligence , which would include monitoring social media , and expand national reward programs to encourage employees to report security issues , the report said
the tsa report agreed with a 2008 homeland security study that found random screening was more cost - effective than mandatory airport employee screening
rep. john katko , r - new york and chairman of the house homeland security subcommittee on tsa , said , " as threats to aviation security continue to evolve , it is critical that the tsa , as well as the airport community , are adequately prepared to mitigate insider threats
i look forward to having a meaningful dialogue with airport stakeholders and the tsa on what can be done , going forward , to improve employee vetting and screening for those with access to sensitive and sterile parts of airports
