los angeles she 's one of the hottest and most successful latinas in hollywood , but now vergara is playing defense in a legal battle initiated by her ex-fiance : he wants to keep the two frozen embryos from their relationship , both female
the 42 - year - old actress and star of the hit tv sitcom " modern family " split from businessman loeb in may 2014
loeb is suing the colombian - born actress in los angeles to prevent vergara from destroying their two embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization in november 2013 , according to published reports by new york daily news and in touch magazine
the lawsuit cited by the two publications , however , lists the plaintiff as " joe doe " and the defendant as " jane doe
on tuesday , loeb 's attorney abram moore confirmed in a statement that loeb filed the lawsuit
representatives for vergara declined to comment
on " modern family , " vergara plays gloria delgado pritchett , an eccentric and voluptuous colombian immigrant who in recent episodes had a baby
but the sitcom make - believe is far from what vergara is dealing with now
the lawsuit states the embryos should not be destroyed under any circumstances by jane doe until both parties reach an agreement
in his own statement , loeb said he wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term , but he does n't want any money from the egg donor
his statement does n't directly identify vergara as the donor , other than referring to his " ex. " " i have previously offered to waive any parental or financial responsibilities or obligations on the part of my ex , and to even give her the opportunity to be involved with the child in the future , should she change her mind , " loeb said
however life comes to be created , it should have no determination on either the rights of wanting to be or the requirements of having to be a parent , " loeb said
in an interview with abc in april 2013 , while the couple was still engaged , vergara spoke of how she helped create embryos and what motivated her to do it
my boyfriend loeb is three years younger than me and he 's never had a son
for loeb , yes , because he 's never had a baby , " vergara said
during the interview she seemed excited about wanting children with loeb
why not ? " vergara said
the abc anchor asked vergara how far along she was in the process , to which the actress replied : " i took them out already
owen said loeb has a case because no court in california will allow the destruction of the embryos if both parties disagree
" owen said the lawsuit reportedly filed by loeb will now open new issues , and a california court will have to decide to whom the embryos belong
" they are in a nitrogen tank in a clinic in beverly hills , so there the planned parenthood of central missouri vs. danforth case can not be used by the vergara team to allege that the ( embryos ) would present some danger to her health as they did in that case
the lawsuit comes as vergara promotes her new movie , " hot pursuit , " with co-star reese witherspoon
vergara is now reportedly engaged to actor joe manganiello
