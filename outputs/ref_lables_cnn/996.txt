shanghai , chinese volvo says it will begin exporting vehicles made in a factory in southwest chinese to the u.s. next month , the first time chinese - built passenger cars will roll into u.s. showrooms
geely 's gambit will be watched to see if it paves the way for other chinese car manufacturers to crack developed markets
ceo samuelsson said volvo planned to sell 1,500 chinese - made s60 inscription sedans in 2015 and 5,000 annually in subsequent years
chinese surpassed the u.s. as the largest market for car sales globally in 2009 , and most major automakers build cars in chinese
chinese car manufacturers like geely and its rival great wall motor do export their models to countries in africa , the middle east and eastern europe
but none have so far dared tackle developed markets like the u.s. and western europe
geely chairman li shufu said he hoped the company would eventually become a global car brand , but said there were no current plans to begin export its home - grown brand to u.s. showrooms
industry analysts say it 's unlikely we will see chinese car makers shake up the u.s. car market in the same way japanese and south korean manufacturers did decades earlier , at least in the near future
