l'hermione , with three sail masts and bright royal blue and gold markings , is a painstaking replica of an 18th century france frigate that fought with the american ' founding fathers in the revolutionary war
it set sail in france on saturday for virginia to retrace a journey through american history
in 1780 , the original hermione was assigned to a france nobleman , who fought as a general in washington 's army against the british
lafayette carried prized cargo -- news from king louis xvi that france was throwing men , guns and treasure behind the colonies , according to a historical summary on l'hermione 's website
lafayette , who had been wounded in the revolutionary war had gone back to his homeland to lobby on behalf of washington , who was also one of his close friends
lafayette rejoined the fight on the front lines in virginia , while l'hermione did sea battle with its 32 guns against the english farther north
