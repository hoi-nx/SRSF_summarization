when bruce jenner told abc 's diane sawyer and the world on friday night that " yes , for all intents and purposes , i 'm a woman , " the declaration was n't particularly surprising
paparazzi have been stalking the former olympic champion for months , breathlessly documenting his increasingly feminine appearance down to his lip gloss , pierced ears and french manicure
the social media reaction ? a cheer , a shrug -- and not much else
except the occasional prod at jenner also being republican
of course , jenner 's family owned the moment , being the reality tv mavens they are -- the jenners and the kardashians
his other daughter jenner expressed mixed emotions
with courage and bravery , let 's change the world
i am honored to stand by bruce jenner 's side and support him , " kourtney said
" let 's empower people like bruce jenner all over the world by being loving & not mean
" it is always brave to stand in one 's truth
" the jenner interview was a key moment for advocacy groups like glaad and the national center for transgender equality , thrusting lgbt issues into the spotlight
" today , millions of people learned that someone they know is transgender , " glaad tweeted
" as with all things , public opinion is hardly unanimous and social media only represents the views of those who post
" this woman was n't sure what to make of jenner 's announcement
and what would a social media event be without a good dose of humor
many folks seemed to be more intrigued by jenner 's announcement that he 's republican than him coming out as a woman
" i accept that bruce jenner is a republican and wish him happiness , even if i ca n't understand it , " said johnny mcnulty
" i 'll accept bruce jenner 's choice to live how he wants much easier than leftists will accept his politics , " countermoonbat said on twitter
