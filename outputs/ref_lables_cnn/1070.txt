the student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early wednesday , the university said
at a forum held on the steps of duke chapel , close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m. , hundreds of people gathered
" you came here for the reason that you want to say with me , ' this is no duke we will accept
