president barack obama tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with iran even before he became the democratic candidate for president
reaching a good , solid agreement with iran is a worthy , desirable goal
but the process has unfolded under the destructive influence of political considerations , weakening united states 's hand and strengthening iran
barack obama 's political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with iran that if the deal ultimately collapses , he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it
there is a reason one gets the feeling that it is the united states and not iran that is the more eager , even desperate , side in these talks , even though iran is the country whose economy was sent into a deep chill by international sanctions ; the country whose only significant export , oil , lost more than half of its value in recent months
the reason is that barack obama has a huge political stake in these negotiations
the president may insist that the united states will choose no deal over a bad deal , but few people truly believe he has a credible plan b. few believe it , particularly in the middle east and notably among united states 's arab friends , who hold the view that iran is running circles around the united states and outplayed barack obama
as the writer david rothkopf aptly put it , " iran is having a great barack obama administration
saudi arabia has said that it will pursue nuclear weapons if it believes iran has not been stopped , and there is little doubt that other countries among iran 's muslim rivals will do the same
in fact , the notion that barack obama is not handling the iran threat effectively is contributing to a new war in yemen , where saudi arabia and other arab are trying to push back against gains by iran 's allies
we can trace it all back to the democratic primaries in 2007 , when then - sen. barack obama said he would meet iran 's leaders " without preconditions , " leading his rival , hillary clinton , to call the idea " irresponsible and frankly naive
" as the years of his presidency unfolded , and the middle east started coming apart , finding a deal with iran started to look like the one major foreign policy achievement barack obama might leave behind
the framework agreement announced on thursday came two days after barack obama 's march 31 deadline
again , a solid agreement that ensures iran will not produce nuclear weapons would be a most welcome development
it certainly shows the final outcome will differ greatly from what barack obama had vowed
in a presidential debate in 2012 , barack obama described a crystal clear goal for negotiations
it is also clear that it took harsh international sanctions and a collapse in oil prices to bring iran to the negotiating table
the framework agreement starts lifting those indispensable sanctions much too soon
with iran forces gaining ground in arab lands and iran commanders declaring the destruction of israel " nonnegotiable " and threatening saudi arabia , this deal does not look reassuring
but the deal so far looks like ( another ) win for iran
