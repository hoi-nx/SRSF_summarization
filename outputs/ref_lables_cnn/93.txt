washington a new entry and a waiting game on the democratic side , a go - slow approach from a leading gop , and the big stakes of 2016 filled our sunday morning trip around the " inside politics " table
sen. bernie sanders of vermont could make an announcement within days , reports cnn 's nia-malika henderson , adding a populist voice to a democratic race that starts with clinton as the overwhelming favorite
bernie sanders has been exploring a run for months , and was a hit this weekend at a big south carolina democratic event
for biden , watch , wait and ... few think vice president biden is willing to risk a third losing bid for the democratic presidential nomination
so , and as long as we are talking about that , we are still talking about biden , and that 's just the way he likes it
kasich also thinks waiting is best ohio gov. kasich is more visible of late , and makes no secret of the fact that he thinks he is the most qualified among the potential gop 2016 presidential prospects
remember sharron angle ? the gop establishment sure does ! goal no.1 for gop in 2016 is taking back the white house
but preserving their new senate majority runs a close second -- and that will be no easy task , because so many of the competitive races are in states that tend to lean blue in presidential years
so the gop establishment is putting a priority on candidate recruitment and hoping to build on its 2014 successes , which you might recall included an aggressive effort to discourage or defeat tea party candidates viewed as too risky by the establishment
so in nevada , where democrat reid is retiring , there is an intensifying effort to get gop rep. gop to declare his senate candidacy
those two states -- and those two seats -- have special significance in the 2016 maneuvering : reid and colorado democrat michael bennet won narrow 2010 victories in what was for the most part a big gop year
ask the establishment why , and you will get a ton of finger - pointing at the tea party candidates who emerged as the gop nominees -- sharron angle in nevada and ken buck in colorado .
