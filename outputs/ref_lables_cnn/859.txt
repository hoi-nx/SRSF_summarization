the u.s. has made clear that it is ready to step up to the plate on climate change
the u.s. administration on tuesday unveiled details about its proposal to reduce u.s. greenhouse gas emissions by 26 % to 28 % below 2005 levels by 2025
this common - sense and achievable plan to decarbonize the u.s. economy will result in significant cost savings from cleaner technologies and create more u.s. energy jobs to power our homes and businesses
this is an area where the u.s. needs to lead , and doing so will create a better planet for our children and a more prosperous future for our country
the u.s. is n't alone in this global climate effort
in a landmark joint announcement with the u.s. in november , china unveiled its intent to peak its carbon emissions around 2030 and to double its share of zero - carbon energy to 20 %
this shift will require substantial effort from china to retool its economy , increase investment in renewable energy and divest from coal
at the same time , india has set the audacious goal of installing 100 gigawatts of solar power capacity by 2022 , a 30-fold increase from current levels and eight times more solar capacity than the u.s. has today
more than 200 cities , home to 436 million people , have voluntarily committed to saving 13 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury
in the u.s. , carbon emissions fell by 10 % from 2007 to 2013 , the largest absolute emissions reduction recorded , even as the u.s. has recovered from the great recession
with the u.s. showing the way , and with cooperation from other countries , businesses , investors , cities and citizens , we can achieve a prosperous and secure future for all
