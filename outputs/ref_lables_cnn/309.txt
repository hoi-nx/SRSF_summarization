and sabeen surrounded herself there with books , people , and discussions on technology , human rights and women 's entrepreneurship
introducing others to jimi hendrix , street art , and talking politics was not supposed to get her killed
but in pakistan , free speech is dangerous , and mahmud 's exuberant exercise of it made her stick out nationwide
mahmud died from five bullet wounds
mahmud 's killing broke hearts beating for non-violence and progressive values across the country
she freely said what she thought in a place where many people are too afraid to and by doing so spoke for many more people than just herself
but mahmud had just finished leading a discussion group on a topic that many want silenced , when the shots fell
the lahore university of management sciences planned to host the discussion on the topic , with human rights activist mama qadeer baloch , but authorities shut it down
mahmud would not hear of it not going on
" what is the reality ? has the media been silenced on balochistan ? what makes it dangerous for us to talk about pakistan 's largest province at one of our most celebrated universities ? " she invited the discussion to the second floor , also known by the shorthand t2f
she said she knew it was a potentially dangerous move , and she had received death threats in the past when she handled the topic before
mahmud waited to greet visitors , many of them young pakistan seeking freedom of thought , with a hug , a mug and encouragement for pakistan 's future
an artist drew mahmud puttering off on a vespa scooter wearing pants , a blouse and sandals
the artistic expression sticks out and triggers passions , like many things mahmud said and did .
