phoenix , arizona nearly 12 million parents in the united states currently are raising kids on their own
when single parents face a devastating illness such as cancer , everyday needs like cleaning and cooking can become a struggle
jody farley-berens saw the need firsthand , when her childhood friend faced that situation
" making ends meet is insurmountable , " said farley-berens
" there are so many doctors ' appointments , copays , surgeries , prescriptions
and then the inability to work -- any savings that there may have been is gone very quickly
" she did all she could to help
after her friend passed away , farley-berens helped start a nonprofit dedicated to assisting others in similar circumstances
since 2006 , singleton moms has provided practical , financial and emotional support to more than 300 parents in the phoenix area
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for cnn heroes 2015 tiffany montgomery , 48 , was a newly single mom when she was diagnosed with stage - 4 breast cancer
farley-berens ' group pitched in to help , so montgomery could spend more time with her daughter ezri , now 10
" when you ca n't really do much and you 're looking at the dirt on the floor , it 's one more level of stress , " she said
" you have these people that come in , that do n't know you , and ' you 're going to help me with cleaning my house ? ' " " singleton moms has actually changed my whole outlook
they care about you , and they 're demonstrating their love through their actions
farley-berens : i grew up with a girl named michelle who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 30
she was a single mother of four children and i was a young mom with two kids
cnn : i 'd imagine that many people have n't thought about the struggles of being a single parent with cancer
and so , our parents can come home from chemo , sit on the couch and read a book with their child without having to worry about , " ugh , the bathroom needs to be cleaned
cnn : is this work hard for you sometimes , on a personal level ? farley-berens : about 80 % of the parents we support are stage 4 , which means that battling cancer is their full - time job
farley-berens : we 're not just about moms -- we have dads , too ! not a lot , but if you are a single parent , you need the support
we like having any event because cancer sucks , and there 's not a lot of happy that goes with that
no one can understand what they 're going through like another single parent with cancer
cancer can be so defeating
and so , it 's my hope that singleton moms can bring joy and say to cancer , " you ca n't defeat us
