in response to reports of big banks threatening to withhold campaign funds from democrats , sen. elizabeth warren last week offered a defiant response : " bring it on
" warren said she is n't going to slack off on her calls for breaking up banks and other measures to rein in wall street
as hillary clinton prepares to officially launch her presidential campaign this month , she will need to make a choice about how much to highlight issues relating to economic inequality
in other words , there are many signs that democrats are planning to take on the big issue of economic inequality
but in other recent news , the likelihood that new york 's schumer will replace harry reid as leader of the democrats means the dreams of a more economically leftward party are crashing into political reality
while schumer has been a very effective democrat and skilled legislative leader , he is also a wall street democrat who has spent much of his time courting and protecting powerful financial interests who run one of the dominant industries in his state
even at his most progressive moments , president obama relied on wall street donations for both of his campaigns
despite all the talk from conservatives about left - wing " socialism " in the white house , the financial community has been willing to open its coffers to democrats without much concern , even in the 2012 election
democratic party populism ca n't really work within the current campaign finance system
the democrats were , and have continued to , losing their traditional base of campaign support -- organized labor -- which had been a central source of campaign muscle since the 1930s , providing money and campaign assistance during campaigns
not only does the acceptance of our campaign finance system limit the policy choices democrats can make , but it also greatly damages the party 's brand name
without these funds , they wo n't be able to compete
this is why campaign finance reform is so important , without congress changing the fundamental dynamics , there wo n't be much room for populism to thrive
even if democrats select someone like a elizabeth warren as their candidate or hillary clinton decides to move sharply to the left on economic policy , there wo n't be much room for reform when the time of governance actually starts
if democrats really want to take on wall street and tackle economic inequality , they first have to bring about reform of the campaign finance system
