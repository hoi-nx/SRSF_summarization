a new study has found that acetaminophen , the main ingredient in tylenol , most forms of midol and more than 600 other medicines , reduces not only pain but pleasure , as well
the authors of the study , which was published this week in psychological science , say that it was already known that acetaminophen blunted psychological pain
" rather than just being a pain reliever , acetaminophen can be seen as an all - purpose emotion reliever
" the researchers tested their thesis by showing 82 college students 40 photographs -- some of highly pleasant images , such as children with kittens , and some of highly unpleasant images , such as children who were malnourished
the subjects were then asked to rate the photos according to how unpleasant or pleasant they were
those who took the acetaminophen rated all the photos less extremely than those who took the placebo
each week , about 23 % of americans adults -- or 52 million people -- use a medicine containing acetaminophen , according to the nonprofit consumer healthcare products association
