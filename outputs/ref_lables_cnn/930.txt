the justices of the scotus practice politics as much as law -- and that will be clearer than ever when the issue of same - sex marriage comes before the court on tuesday
public opinion on same - sex marriage has turned upside down since the supreme judicial court in massachusetts first legalized the practice in 2003
of course , the constitution has not changed since 2003 , a point that will surely be made by such opponents of same - sex marriage as justice scalia
to originalists like scalia -- those who believe the constitution should be interpreted only as it was originally understood by the framers -- the idea of a constitutional right to same - sex marriage is anathema
but the scotus has always been about a lot more than the intentions of the framers
warren knew that segregated schools damaged the u.s. ' reputation in the contest for hearts and minds around the world , and he steered the court accordingly
warren 's motives had nothing to do with the framers ' intentions , and little to do with the words of the constitution itself , but these kinds of motivations have been common throughout the history of the scotus
but ginsburg 's misgivings about roe have served as an important backdrop to the scotus 's consideration of same - sex marriage
still , when it comes to scotus decisions , it is usually safe to bet that a majority of the justices will come down on the side favored by most of the public
after the court decided united states v. windsor in 2013 , which invalidated most of the 1996 law known as the defense of marriage act , more than a dozen federal district courts around the county said the reasoning of that case required the legalization of same - sex marriage
supporters of the existing laws went to the scotus and asked for stays of the lower court rulings , because the justices themselves had not yet permitted the marriages to take place
but in each case , the scotus denied the stays and allowed same - sex marriages to proceed -- those marriages are now legal in 37 states and the district of columbia
