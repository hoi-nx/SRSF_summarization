" sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; then come , follow me , " jesus tells the rich man in one of his best - known parables
meanwhile , jesus told his twelve apostles to leave their day jobs and follow him on an itinerant mission with few prospects of success and no visible means of support
perhaps the most relevant reference is also one of the most charged passages in the new testament : as the gospel of john tells it , six days before passover , jesus was in bethany at the house of his friend lazarus , whom he had raised from the dead
a woman named mary takes a jar of costly perfumed oil and anoints the feet of the reclining jesus
though 300 denarii was the annual wage of a laborer , jesus told judas to leave her alone , and foreshadowing his fate , said the anointing would be useful for his burial , and besides , " you always have the poor with you " -- but jesus would not always be there
what that passage makes clear is that the jesus community had a common purse because they needed money to survive
jesus and his disciples walked , wore what they had , slept outside or in stayed in friends ' homes
garroway said that it was possible , even likely , that jesus and his followers received donations from supporters , and possibly substantial ones from some of the rich people who were drawn to his ministry despite -- or perhaps because of -- his preaching on the perils of wealth
the luke gives us a glimpse of how jesus ' ministry functioned on a practical level : " soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages , proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of god
" so , according to luke , women whom jesus had healed in turn provided for him out of their " resources , " with mary magdalene and joanna capturing our attention -- one by virtue of her husband , and the other , by her stature in the story of jesus
with her on that morning is mary magdalene , also identified as -- among other things -- a financial supporter of jesus
not only was mary magdalene one of jesus ' most devoted followers , who stuck with him all the way from galilee to jerusalem , from the ministry to the cross and the tomb , but also she provided for him from her own means , said goodacre , a professor of new testament and christian origins at duke university
along with these women , men like joseph of arimathea and nicodemus , both men of stature and wealth , may have chipped in to help fund jesus ' ministry
the gospels reveal that both these men were rich , and supported jesus -- indeed , it was joseph of arimathea who removed jesus from the cross on good friday , anointing his body with the help of nicodemus , and placing him in the tomb that joseph of arimathea had reserved for himself
