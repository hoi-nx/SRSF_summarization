pope pope has accepted the resignation of bishop robert finn , who remained on the job for years after becoming the highest - ranking catholic official convicted in connection with the church 's long - running sex abuse scandal , the vatican announced tuesday
robert finn , who led the diocese of kansas - st. joseph , missouri , was found guilty in 2012 of failure to report suspected child abuse
at the time of his conviction , robert finn said , according to cnn affiliate kctv : " i truly regret and am sorry for the hurt these events have caused
" jackson county prosecutor baker said the conviction and penalty , which included starting a $ 10,000 fund for sexual abuse counseling and mandatory training for church officials on how to report abuse , would have positive ramifications
" we can be assured now that if an allegation of child abuse comes to the attention of the diocese of kansas - st. joseph , there will be no hesitation to report it immediately to the proper authorities , " baker said
the case against robert finn revolved around his diocese 's dealings with ratigan , an independence , missouri , priest who pleaded guilty in august 2012 to five child pornography charges
and robert finn kept his job as bishop , even after his 2012 conviction
cardinal o'malley , who took over the abuse - shaken boston archdiocese and has become one of the pope 's point men in the u.s. , has acknowledged the inconsistency that someone who would n't be allowed to teach sunday school was still running an u.s. diocese
" there 's a recognition of that ... from pope
" moss -- a professor at notre dame , a catholic university in indiana -- said it " does n't look very urgent " that a decision came down only now , nearly three years after the conviction and five months after o'malley 's comments
but the timing of the announcement may make sense given that it comes weeks after pope came under fire for the installation of a new bishop in chile , juan barros , despite protesters ' claims he was complicit in sexual abuse cases there
under the pope 's directive , naumann will be the kansas diocese 's apostolic administrator , in addition to his regular responsibilities in kansas , until a permanent bishop is appointed , according to an announcement on the diocese 's website
" to that point , the co-director of bishopaccountability.org asked for more elaboration than the vatican 's one - line announcement that pope accepted the resignation " in accordance with ... canon law
" anne doyle , from the watchdog group that documents the catholic church 's abuse crisis , called robert finn 's removal " a good step but just the beginning
