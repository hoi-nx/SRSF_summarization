on thursday , npr -- headquartered in washington , just 40 miles away from baltimore -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25 - year - old freddie gray because of still - unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody
titled " baltimore unrest reveals tensions between african-americans and asians , " the five - minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal " what 's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city , " going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was african - americans " targeting asian - owned businesses for destruction
indeed , it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s , the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between asian and black communities first took root in the media consciousness
but while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year , black - owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence , there 's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus
instead , it seems as if asian - owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods
there were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely african americans customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences
for example , in 1993 , the robbery and shooting of lee , a 21 - year - old korean at towson state university , and the subsequent acquittal of his killer , was a point of contention between the korean and african americans communities
decades after the height of media - inflamed tension between asian and african americans , patterns of immigration have shifted
the population of baltimore has shrunk and its economy has contracted
among merchants , there 's ever - greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread , surviving or failing together
for example , the baltimore - based korean-american grocers & licensed beverage association of maryland , founded in 1995 , has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by baltimore 's police , while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents
a kagro - sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the baltimore neighborhoods their member retailers serve
back in 1995 , the baltimore sun profiled soon jae and eun ja lee , owners of lee 's food market in the west baltimore 's sandtown neighborhood -- the same part of the city that npr called out as a locus of asian - black tension
reinforcing the tired narrative of black - asian interracial tension generates heat , but not light
