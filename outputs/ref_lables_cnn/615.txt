washington as the national guard prepared to deploy to help quell riots in ferguson , missouri , that raged sporadically last year , the guard used highly militarized words such as " enemy forces " and " adversaries " to refer to protesters , according to documents obtained by cnn
the national guard 's language , contained in internal mission briefings obtained through a freedom of information act request , is intensifying the concerns of some who objected to the police officers ' actions in putting down riots
the documents obtained by cnn also detail that the national guard was concerned about perceptions of its deployment , with superiors later telling troops to stop using heavily militarized language to describe protesters
" we are deliberately constraining mobilization timelines to the last couple days to minimize backlash from calling up the national guard early , " col. david boyle , army chief of staff at the national guard , informed his officers in a nov. 18 email
" additionally , some in the national guard seemed worried the language in the mission briefings could be problematic
days before the announcement of the grand jury 's decision , an email from david boyle warned of potential consequences from using language that could be " construed as potentially inflammatory
in an email to cnn , he said the documents used in the ferguson mission briefings were " a generic military planning format utilized in a wide range of military missions , so the term ' enemy forces ' would be better understood as ' potential threats
' often in guard operations , threats would include inclement weather , heat , failing levees , etc. " in further comments emailed to cnn late friday , after the initial version of this article appeared , quinn insisted that " while the term ' enemy forces ' appears in a handful of early drafts of the operations order it was also clear that as soon as leadership saw the language , they correctly identified it as being inappropriate for this type of mission " and claimed that the language was changed " well ahead of the grand jury 's decision
" but internal communications from as early as aug. 14 through nov. 18 , when the directive was issued to change the inflammatory language , show numerous uses of the terms that were sent to a large number of quinn commanders and leadership
though the national guard 's actions throughout the fall did not elicit the type of complaints that were directed at the police , some in ferguson were displeased that the guardsman did n't do more to act against looters and vandals
ferguson mayor james knowles criticized the guard at a november 25 news conference , saying that " unfortunately , as the unrest grew and further assistance was needed , the national guard was not deployed in enough time to save all our businesses
" quinn , in his comments to cnn , responded that it would not have been part of the national guard 's mission to confront those destroying businesses
a document titled " operation show-me protection ii , " which outlines the national guard 's mission in ferguson , listed players on the ground deemed " friendly forces " and " enemy forces
" in addition to analyzing the threat general protesters could pose to soldiers , the national guard also briefed its commanders on their intelligence capabilities so they could " deny adversaries the ability to identify national guard vulnerabilities upon which threat forces may exploit , causing embarrassment , or harm to the mong , " the mission set states
but the ways the national guard lists for how this information can be obtained are nothing more than open records , social media , and listening on conversations being carries out in public by civil authorities or law enforcement
