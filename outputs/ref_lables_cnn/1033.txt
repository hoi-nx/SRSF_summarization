the arizona police officer who slammed into an armed suspect with his patrol car told investigators he thought he was too far to take a shot at the man , so he chose the other option , cnn affiliate kvoa reported wednesday
officer rapiejko ran his car into mario valencia in february as the suspect carried a rifle he had just fired in the air
rapiejko sped around another officer as valencia walked through a business park , hit the man from behind with the left side of his front bumper
valencia , who flew through this air , survived and faces more than a dozen charges for an alleged crime spree that day
the marana police department has defended rapiejko , saying deadly force was warranted because the suspect had a rifle , ammunition and was walking toward offices where hundreds of people work
officer who drove into suspect justified , chief says kvoa obtained police inquiry tapes on which rapiejko tells investigators why he chose his car as a weapon
" this is what i deem as a lethal force encounter
" another officer , who was slowing trailing valencia and ahead of rapiejko , says on another recording that if a civilian had stumbled upon valencia , the suspect might have taken a hostage or killed the person
