hillary clinton finally answered the question we 've all been asking for years : will she run for president in 2016 ? with official news of her candidacy just hours old , one thing is already crystal clear : for the next year and a half , clinton will be the barometer by which we assess gender equality in the united states
a win would mean a woman in the white house , which is a vital step in the march toward women 's full political inclusion
but it 's possible that the march will end right there
we 'll raise the " mission accomplished " banner over the women 's movement
women will continue to be less likely than men even to consider running for office
more generally , her loss would perpetuate the myth that women can not win big elections , that the electoral environment is rife with bias and discrimination , and that women must be twice as good to get half as far
" if hillary clinton ca n't win an election , " potential female candidates will ask , " how can i ? " extrapolating from one female candidate 's experiences to women in politics more broadly is always suspect
too often , we treat clinton 's loss to barack obama in the 2008 democratic primary as a referendum on how citizens feel about electing women to positions of political power
in reality , what people knew about hillary clinton likely shaped their views of hillary clinton
after all , for decades , women who have run for office have performed just as well as men
do some voters still question women 's suitability as leaders ? of course they do
the d or r in front of the candidates ' names -- not the x or y chromosomes in their dna -- tells us about how more than 90 % of the population will vote
but men yelling " iron my shirt " at a campaign rally , cable news pundits associating clinton with their ex-wives outside of probate court and manufacturers producing hillary clinton nutcrackers do not change the fact that when it comes to presidential elections , partisanship and the state of the economy tell us almost everything we need to know
but how much does any of this really matter ? sure , voters are amenable to electing women
the problems confronting women in society are just as grave regardless of who occupies the white house
and inferring too much from hillary clinton 's experiences is a risky endeavor
yet the minute clinton announced her candidacy , she became the official litmus test for true gender equality in the united states
that 's a label that no female candidate should have to wear
