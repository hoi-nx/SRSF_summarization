north korea accused mexico of illegally holding one of its cargo ships wednesday and demanded the release of the vessel and crew
the ship , the mu du bong , was detained after it ran aground off the coast of mexico in july
mexico defended the move wednesday , saying it followed proper protocol because the company that owns the ship , north korea 's ocean maritime management company , has skirted u.n. sanctions
but an myong hun , north korea 's deputy ambassador to the u.n. , said there was no reason to hold the mu du bong and accused mexico of violating the crew members ' human rights by keeping them from their families
" according to mexico 's u.n. mission , the 33 north korea nationals who make up the vessel 's crew are free , staying at a hotel in the port city of tuxpan and regularly visiting the ship to check on it
