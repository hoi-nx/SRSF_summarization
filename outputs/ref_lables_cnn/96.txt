this week 's attack on garissa university college is al-shabaab 's fifth major assault in kenya in the past year and a half
why is al-shabaab , a somalia nationalist , islamist group affiliated with al qaeda , targeting kenya ? al-shabaab says its attacks are to protest the more than 3,500 kenya soldiers participating in the african union peacekeeping mission in somalia
but if that is the case , why does n't al-shabaab target kenya military bases rather than attacking undefended so - called soft targets such as kenya malls and universities ? in fact , thursday 's attack on the university is one more sign of the weakness of al-shabaab , which has steadily been losing ground for years in somalia as a result of the african union forces fighting them there , as well as a covert u.s. drone and special operations forces campaign that has also degraded the group 's capabilities
the loss of kismayo , al-shabaab 's last city stronghold and an important port , took a financial toll on the group
ground battles with african union forces have decimated al-shabaab 's rank - and - file , while u.s. drone strikes and special operations raids have killed some of the group 's leaders
