garissa , kenyan the desks of the small madrassa are empty
its 573 students , all male , are staying home after kenyan president kenyatta announced three days of national mourning following last week 's deadly attack at a nearby university
only a few kilometers away , 147 people -- mostly students -- were brutally massacred when al-shabaab militants invaded the campus in garissa , a town in northeastern kenyan
we 've come to this particular islamic religious school because the man suspected by kenyan authorities of being the " mastermind " behind the atrocity -- mohamed mohamud -- once taught here
" what worries authorities here is exactly that -- mohamud was kenyan
but now , say officials , mohamud is in command of an al-shabaab militia based near kenyan 's long , porous border with somalia -- about 118 miles ( 190km ) from garissa -- who are believed to be responsible for numerous cross-border attacks into kenyan
last year , an attack by al-shabaab on a shopping center in the country 's capital , nairobi , claimed the lives of 68 people
now mohamud stands accused of being behind thursday 's attack -- the deadliest attack in the nation since al qaeda killed more than 200 people at the u.s. embassy in nairobi in 1998
the kenyan interior ministry has said at least one of the four gunmen who carried out the attack on the university was also kenyan
