job one for newly appointed attorney general lynch is to create a muscular federal response to months of national unrest over controversial police killings like that of freddie gray , 25
lynch 's job wo n't be easy : as the nation 's top law enforcement officer , she takes the reins of a justice department that has been walking a fine line between nudging local police departments in the direction of better community relations , and threatening legal action against departments where discrimination or brutality are out of control
but as events in baltimore demonstrate , too many local departments are n't getting the message
lynch will need to put down the carrots , pick up the stick and make clear that the justice department intends to crack down on police abuse by using one of its most potent weapons : the power to withhold federal funds from local departments
" in the days ahead , i intend to work with leaders throughout baltimore to ensure that we can protect the security and civil rights of all residents , " lynch said within hours of being sworn in on monday
as attorney general , lynch has several tools with which to guide local law enforcement toward better behavior
a justice department program called cops , launched in 2011 , helps local departments implement best practices
lynch can also apply the tougher approach of suing local departments and securing court - ordered reforms , a power conferred by the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994
the obama administration has sued local departments 15 times -- more than either the clinton or bush administrations -- and has opened 11 more investigations of departments including those in cleveland , miami , and ferguson , missouri
" that leaves lynch with a final , even tougher weapon : the power , under title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 , to deny federal law enforcement dollars to departments that engage in discriminatory practices
the sheriff of alamance county sued the justice department and the case remains unresolved -- but it underscores the fact that lynch has the power to press local departments , legally and financially , to curb local abuses
