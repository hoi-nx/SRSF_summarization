what do walmart , target , and now the koch brothers have in common with the american civil liberties union , colorofchange.org , and the center for american progress ? all of them are adopting or advocating for hiring practices that open up work opportunities for people with convictions and leverage untapped potential in the labor market
koch industries ' recent announcement that it will " ban the box " -- i.e. , remove from its job applications the check - box that asks about convictions -- is a big step forward in the movement to break down barriers to employment for job - seekers with records
it 's one item on a menu of fair - chance hiring reforms intended to ensure that job applicants are evaluated on their skills and qualifications first , rather than judged solely on past mistakes
these policies help reduce recidivism by making employment accessible to job - seekers who need a second chance , and they help break down the stigma of an arrest or conviction record
two generations of the war on drugs , zero tolerance , and aggressive policing have left 70 million adults with arrest or conviction records that undermine their ability to be considered for jobs , even as the job market has grown steadily
millions of people are being left behind , and it 's taking a toll on our economy : the reduced economic output of people with records cost our economy $ 57 - $ 65 billion in 2008 alone
these criminal justice policies disproportionately impact african - americans , who are incarcerated at a rate six times that of whites
companies like koch industries , walmart , target , and bed bath & beyond recognize that this is a huge source of untapped talent , and that 's why they 've already banned the box on their job applications
vermont gov. peter shumlin , georgia gov. nathan deal , and virginia gov. terry mcauliffe recently signed executive orders removing the conviction question from initial applications for state employment
