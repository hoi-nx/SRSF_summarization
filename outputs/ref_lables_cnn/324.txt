back in july , sierra sharry and lane smith were just about to become parents
sierra sharry was eight months pregnant
but then lane smith fell and hit his head
maybe the photographer could make their family complete , just for one picture " they asked me if i would be willing to ' play around ' with capturing their first family photo by editing taos ' daddy in one of their pictures , " kayli rene ' photography posted on facebook
the photographer was n't sure it would work , but they found just the right picture of lane smith -- one that has him looking over his family 's shoulder
" lane smith 's not physically here with us , of course , but that picture represents to us that he is always watching over us and he will always be there for us no matter what , " sierra sharry said
the family photo has become a social media sensation after appearing on the photographer 's facebook page this week
