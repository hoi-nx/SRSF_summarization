aden , yemen it did n't look like much , but we 'd been told it was typical of the kind of craft ferrying the route between djibouti and aden
better , everyone advised , to be low key , even if low key meant faded lights and three water pumps chugging at all times
the wooden vessel was called mecca â after the holy city
we were told we 'd be at the port in aden by the next morning , but as the hours ticked by it soon became apparent that that was wildly optimistic
morning came and we were still only halfway there
it meant hugging the coastline , trying to stay as much as possible out of the deeper water in the middle of the gulf of aden where the world 's navies seemed to be squaring off
after our second sunset , we were finally close enough for my phone to ping with a yemen welcome message
the captain slowed the boat to a crawl so the remaining miles would stretch until daybreak
it was time to go into town to see what life was like for the people of aden
after waiting at port , praying a passing ship would dock , ours had become an unexpected lifeline for some of the families caught in the fighting
the harbor-master asked if we could take 60 refugees
what we did n't realize until it was too late was that the refugees were being charged $ 300 a person : an " exit fee
some of the refugees took over our ship 's galley -- the kitchen
because we 'd brought refugees back with us , we were asked by the djibouti coast guard to dock in the country 's north , in obok , so they could be given the proper status while they wait to see what happens back home
the immigration officials were -- understandably -- a little bemused by our presence amongst a boatload of people fleeing yemen , but to their credit they decided the important thing was that these families were now safe
but eventually we were , and as we watched the djbouti officials unload what remained of people 's belongings onto shore , it was a reminder that these were the lucky ones
thousands more are still waiting back in yemen , hoping they too will reach a safe port .
