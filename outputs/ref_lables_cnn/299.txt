the u.s. has seemingly erupted this week about what it means to live your religion , especially in indiana , where its new rfra faces a firestorm from critics who say it uses faith as a pretext to discriminate against gay people
such state laws have been growing ever since the u.s. rfra became law in 1993 , designed to prohibit the federal government from " substantially burdening " a person 's exercise of religion
here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws , touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an irs accountant to a tea from the amazonian : he was a native american with eagle feathers at a religious gathering of tribes
but not in the eyes of the feds
in 2006 , soto and russell attended an native americans powwow while in possession of eagle feathers , in violation of the federal eagle protection act , which outlaws the killing of bald and golden eagles and even picking their feathers off the ground
the feathers are sacred to native americans
but a federal fish and wildlife service agent found his tribe was n't federally recognized , and soto surrendered his feathers
soto , however , petitioned the federal interior department to return his feathers
the feds said no , because he was n't from a recognized tribe
on march 10 , the federal government returned the eagle feathers to soto
the federal government still maintains it can criminally prosecute soto and his congregants , so soto is seeking a preliminary injunction , claiming the feds are violating the federal rfra , said luke goodrich , soto 's attorney who 's with the becket fund
after losing before a magistrate , rich won an appeal before the 11th circuit court , which cited " the defendant 's meager efforts to explain why florida 's prisons are so different from the penal institutions that now provide kosher meals such that the plans adopted by those other institutions would not work in florida
" recently baptized in the sikh faith , tagore went to her job with the irs in houston in 2005 carrying a new religious item : a 9 - inch kirpan , a small ceremonial sword that resembles a knife but has an edge that is blunted or curved
but the federal government banned her from the building , citing the kirpan as a " dangerous weapon " with a more than 3 - inch blade , and she was later fired from her accounting job because she refused to keep the kirpan out of the workplace
tagore 's attorneys described the settlement as " a groundbreaking policy allowing sikh and other religious minorities to wear religious symbols and attire in federal buildings , " they said in a statement
in chicago , an association of 40 churches called the c.l.u.b. found it too onerous to erect houses of worship in business and commercial zones
the ministers needed a special use permit , but such permits were often thwarted by aldermen or it was too bureaucratic and costly to obtain one , the church leaders claimed
so the pastors sued the city of chicago in 2000 , alleging that its zoning laws violated the illinois religious freedom statute , the federal rluipa and the u.s. constitution
but in 2003 , the 7th circuit court of appeals upheld a lower court decision and rejected the church group 's claims , finding no substantial burden on the churches , which also failed to establish their rluipa claim
" the forty ( 40 ) churches in c.l.u.b. and certainly people of all faiths throughout chicago are outraged by the majority opinion which neuters the rluipa passed unanimously by congress in 2000 , " apostle theodore wilkinson , the group 's chairman , said in a statement
" also alarming is the court 's conclusion that chicago 's religious assemblies have no free speech protection from zoning laws
at the same time , the city of chicago revised its zoning ordinance to avoid " the threat of heightened scrutiny under rluipa , " according to a league of california cities report in 2002
