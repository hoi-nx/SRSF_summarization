west of baghdad , iraqi the call from faleh essawi , the deputy chief of the provincial council , who we were supposed to be meeting up with , came just as we were about to hit the bridge -- the only safe route from baghdad to neighboring anbar province
" isis has taken the east of the city , it 's not accessible , " he says , sounding frantic , rapidly rattling off the neighborhoods and areas isis fighters had just stormed into
moments later , we see the impact : an endless stream of humanity , shell shocked , and exhausted
parents cradle babies in blankets , some struggle under the weight of their belongings , some carry small plastic bags , while others nothing but the children clutching at their hands
cars are not permitted to cross this bridge across the euphrates
the government feels that restricting vehicles will decrease the likelihood of explosives making their way into iraqi 's capital
those too young or too tired to walk pile into metal carts pushed by boys or young men , normally used to carry produce to markets
an elderly woman sits in one , a child in her arms , a worn down plastic doll in her hand
many do n't want to talk , at least not for long
what they just went through is too raw , too painful
one man we encounter describes how isis fighters commandeered his house
" we heard clashes in the early morning , and we could n't see the security forces anywhere , " he recalls
" we saw the isis fighters , they just came into the house , they did n't say a word
they just sent a sniper to the roof
over the weekend isis moved into towns just to the north of ramadi , which lies 68 miles ( 110km ) west of baghdad , sending thousands fleeing on foot into the city
isis had already blocked off access from the south months ago , and the west was contested territory
the east , until now , was not just a relatively safe zone but the only viable entrance and exit
he was shot by a sniper in ramadi that morning as isis fighters advanced -- the bullet barely missed his heart
amriyat al-falluja regularly comes under attack from rockets and mortars from isis positions nearby
fifteen - year - old mustafa ahmed has bandages on his neck , leg , and other parts of his body
they think it 's an isis rocket or mortar attack so we take cover along with the iraqi forces we are with in the hallway , away from the windows
earlier , he had taken us to the front lines , a long berm that stretches along the northern and western parts of the town that is dotted with fighting positions
he says he regularly provides the joint command center with coordinates for isis positions , but so far there have been no significant air strikes or reinforcements
" he claimed that 150,000 have fled , scoffing at statements from iraqi officials in baghdad that reinforcements have been sent to ramadi
