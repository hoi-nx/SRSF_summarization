kenyan 's politicians and public have struggled with these ideas over and over
many kenyan had believed that security improved enough since al-shabaab held nairobi 's westgate under siege for four days in september 2013 , resulting in the deaths of 67 people
but the number of people killed in the attack is plaguing kenyan with self - doubt
so what should kenyan do ? the answer is elusive
here are some of the problems plaguing kenyan 's security efforts
even with a wall , militants could arrive by sea to coastal towns in kenyan that have been islamist strongholds
the border crosses through remote areas , and many somalis have fled their country south to kenyan
the students at the university , many of them christian , hailed mostly from other parts of kenyan
but kenyan also cross north into somalis , some to fight for al-shabaab , then they return home to help whip up fervor with its kenyan affiliate al hijra , cfr has said
the security situation may have deteriorated in recent years after kenyan 's incursion into somalis to battle al-shabaab there , cnn 's david mckenzie said
kenyan wiped out some of the group 's key bases there in operation linda nchi , which began in 2011
but it made the group more diffuse -- and more likely to pop up and hit soft targets in kenyan , said terrorism expert gohel
it 's also simply very difficult to protect every single target from attacks -- especially in kenyan
" if the group 's infrastructure and resources remain intact in kenyan , we will see more attacks taking place
courts have snagged parts of kenyan 's security plans over fears of government overreach
kenyan 's government had recently passed a controversial law giving itself broad powers in the war on terror
but the high court saw it as an affront to civil rights , and it struck down many of its details early this year , according to cfr this included blocking the enrollment of 10,000 new police recruits
kenyatta 's government , which is christian dominated , has wielded an abusive hand against ethnic somalis and other muslim in kenyan , cfr and human rights watch both have said
" security officers from multiple agencies raided homes , buildings , and shops , carting away money , cell phones , and other goods , " human rights watch said
some kenyan are now asking why security forces did not react to those warnings in advance by putting security in place
