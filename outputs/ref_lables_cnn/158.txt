the force is strong in turkish -- or at least it appears to be at one university where thousands of students are petitioning for a jedi temple to be built on campus
the petition , which was started by a student at dokuz eylul university in the western province of izmir , so far has almost 5,500 signatures
" there are less and less jedi left on the earth , " the petition says
... to find the balance in the force , we want a jedi temple
there are mosques everywhere , but no jedi temple ! " the petition was started by caliskan , an 18 - year - old computer science student from ankara
an online debate started last month when karaca , the rector of itu , said he would build a mosque on campus if there was enough support
karaca was referencing another petition asking a mosque be built on campus , which almost 200,000 students signed
twenty thousand students at itu also signed a separate petition in response , demanding a buddhist temple on campus
