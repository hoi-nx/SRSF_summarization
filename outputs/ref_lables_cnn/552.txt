supported by united states intelligence and supplied with advanced united states - made weaponry , saudi jets began airstrikes in yemen late last month in the name of what the kingdom 's washington ambassador described as " restoring the legitimate government " and protecting a " yemen constitution and elections
indeed , saudi motives in yemen likely have nothing to do with protecting the country 's " legitimate government , " its constitution or its electoral process
this approach was evident in 2013 , when saudi voiced its support for the military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of mohamed morsy in egypt , which was in keeping with counterrevolutionary saudi policies that aimed to contain or reverse the results of the arab spring
with all this in mind , the united states decision to stand behind the saudi attack on yemen can best be described as misguided
but one of the biggest miscalculations has been that united states policy has adopted the saudi - gulf narrative on yemen , effectively placing saudi ambitions to control yemen above previous united states priorities like destroying the safe haven for al qaeda there
indeed , the obama administration appears to have abandoned yemen to saudi machinations
this reality was underscored when united states state department spokesperson jen psaki effectively endorsed saudi bombing , saying the " saudi have legitimate concerns about the possible impact of current events in yemen on their security
yet if that policy goal remains in place , then it must be acknowledged that the saudi war on yemen will not only undermine the united states aim of preventing al qaeda from making yemen a safe haven , but also undermine broader united states efforts in yemen
the reality is that saudi and gulf co-operation council jets are effectively acting as al qaeda 's air force by bombing the same group that had managed to uproot al qaeda from several yemen regions
regardless , the results of the saudi campaign are unlikely to be positive -- one only need look at the way a much smaller houthi force than today was able to outfox the saudi military back in 2009
what should be done now ? saudi interests in yemen should not replace those of the united states
a change in approach is essential not only because the saudi - led war on yemen is wrong and destined to fail , but because it might end up further opening the yemen door to iran
but perhaps most importantly , by supporting a self - interested saudi campaign , the united states may actually empower an al qaeda with the potential still to do great harm to the united states .
