five young china feminists , whose detention has provoked an international outcry , may face up to five years in prison over their campaign for gender equality
the women were among detained on march 6 and march 7 in three china cities -- beijing , guangzhou and hangzhou -- shortly before events they had planned for international women 's day on march 8
they were simply calling for an end to sexual harassment , " william nee , china researcher at amnesty international told cnn
" everything they were doing was in line with china 's own laws and policies
" wang said that wei had been subject to lengthy cross examinations during her detention but was well the last time they met on march 31
the five -- who are members of china 's women 's rights action group -- had planned to hand out stickers printed with slogans saying " stop sexual harassment , let us stay safe " and " go police , go arrest those who committed sexual harassment ! " on women 's day
the detention of wei , along with wu rongrong , li tingting , wang man and zheng churan has drawn harsh criticism from the international community
protests have taken place in several cities , including hong kong , that urge china officials to " free the five
" her comment drew a rebuke from china authorities , who said public figures should respect china 's sovereignty and independence
maya wang , china researcher at human rights watch , said the activists were best known for their " performance art " style protests -- occupying public toilets to highlight long lines at women 's restrooms , donning blood - spattered wedding gowns to protest domestic violence and shaving their heads to protest against barriers to higher education for women
