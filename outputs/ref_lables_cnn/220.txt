the white house insists it does n't need congressional approval for the iran nuclear deal announced this month
but while historical precedent suggests the president might indeed have the authority to move forward without congress , the obama administration should probably learn another lesson from history : getting congress ' signature might be worth the effort
true , the fight for congressional approval would be politically bruising and consume a huge amount of energy
but it would still be a mistake to move forward with the deal as an executive - based agreement rather than obtaining the consent of the legislative branch -- a diplomatic breakthrough of this magnitude would be far more enduring with the imprimatur of congress
" on " meet the press , " kerry said , " what we 're looking for is not to have congress interfere with our ability , inappropriately , by stepping on the prerogatives of the executive department of the president
for a start , there is growing pressure on capitol hill -- from members of both parties -- to pass legislation that would give congress the right to review the deal and make a decision about lifting sanctions
on tuesday , a deal was reached on legislation proposed by senate chairman corker that would require president obama to submit the final deal to congress , giving it 52 days to review and approve the agreement
corker told msnbc on tuesday that negotiators had reached a " bipartisan agreement that keeps the congressional review process absolutely intact , full of integrity
" what 's in the iran bill and why all the fuss ? there is good reason for obama to avoid calling this a treaty
but there is also a history of congress causing significant trouble for important international treaties
after iran took american hostages and the soviets invaded afghanistan , the treaties died in the senate
yet there are other examples where even in a contentious congressional environment , presidents successfully pushed for the ratification of treaties that they knew would cost them important political capital , and even once the white house exited the struggle bruised and battered , the historic treaties endured
top gop , dem senators say iran compromise reached this was the case with another treaty that carter asked the senate to ratify : the panama canal treaties of 1978
yet despite excitement in the white house and across the nation about soviets leader mikhail gorbachev 's visit to washington in december 1987 , many conservatives blasted the decision , arguing that reagan had betrayed the conservative cause
the reality is that the signature of congress is still worth a lot in american politics -- the ratification process brings legitimacy to a major and controversial agreement and makes it much more difficult for opponents to attack in the future as some power grab by a president
all this will be true with iran , especially as many members of obama 's own party are leery about the agreement
but in the long term , persuading and pressuring a sufficient number of legislators to sign on to this deal would greatly improve the chances of avoiding a regional war -- and would help prevent iran from becoming a nuclear power
the good news is that there have been some statements from the white house that offer hope it recognizes the centrality of congress in a solid deal
