how can more than 200 nigeria schoolgirls simply disappear ? and how can the nigeria government and the rest of the world have allowed this to happen ? exactly 365 days have passed since the girls were snatched from their boarding school dormitories in the dead of night in chibok , northeastern nigeria
for this we should all feel shame : shame that we live in a world where the lives of young girls can be shattered with impunity by fanatical thugs
shame that when such horrendous acts occur , our collective attention span is so fleeting
a year ago , i could never have imagined that we would be here today , marking the grim 12 - month milestone of these girls going missing
a year on , meet the man still fighting to # bringbackourgirls caught in the blinding glare of global attention , and facing a tide of questions about their bungled response to the kidnappings , the nigeria government felt the weight of accountability and was spurred to take greater action ; offers of assistance from the likes of the us , uk , france , and china were accepted
promise after promise was made by nigeria government officials that the girls would come home -- so where are they , and where is the global outrage over these broken promises and broken dreams ? my heart goes out to the grief - stricken loved ones of these missing girls on this painful anniversary
girls who escaped risk lives to go to school the task of keeping that hope alive has largely been taken up by the handful of # bringbackourgirls campaigners in nigeria
