the racist and offensive emails that resulted in three ferguson , missouri , city employees either resigning or being fired have been released
the exchanges between the city 's top court clerk and two police officers were discovered during a u.s. justice department investigation of racial prejudice in the city 's police and judicial system
the emails -- which make offensive references to president barack obama , first lady michelle obama as well as muslims and minorities -- were obtained by the washington post on thursday after a public records request
police capt. rick henke and sgt. william mudd resigned early last month after the emails were discovered as part of the evidence in the justice department 's scathing ferguson report
the city 's top court clerk , mary ann twitty , was fired in connection with the emails , officials said
in a separate report , the justice department described what it said was a " pattern and practice " of discrimination against african - americans by the ferguson police and municipal courts
in 88 % of the cases in which ferguson police officers reported using force , it was against african-americans
ferguson police chief mum on federal report cnn 's ralph ellis , john newsome and sara sidner contributed to this report .
