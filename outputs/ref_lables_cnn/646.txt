kathmandu , nepal when the earthquake struck , we huddled under a concrete beam -- and prayed
in another room , my grandfather could not comprehend what was happening and , instead of seeking cover , drifted towards the window
outside , a brown dust - cloud rose from the ruins of cottages that had dotted the next hill
i was at my uncle 's place in ramkot , west kathmandu , some 12 kilometers ( 7.4 miles ) east from my family home
after escaping the building for the safety of open air , my first thought was for news of friends and family
calls did n't go through but thankfully texts and data did
i heard from everyone except my mother
worried sick , i foolishly went into the house for a second time to get my belongings and leave for home
the journey towards my family home in sifal was a map of quake destruction , with many houses -- old and new -- torn apart
a woman perched on top of rubble tried to reach for a water container from what used to be her kitchen
in chhauni , an ice cream seller ran double - time with his cart , while his radio relayed the latest
further ahead , a mother and daughter sat down on a pavement so that a grandchild could be fed. across the bishnumati river , uphill towards maru , i ran to get away from the tall houses and made towards the kathmandu durbar area
it was reduced to rubble
temples that sat on impressive staircase - style pyramids were now dust
in putalisadak , i met a cousin who was sitting an entrance exam for a prestigious high school when the quake hit before the allotted time was over
a hawker was selling momos -- a nepal type of dumpling -- under a seven - story building , while policemen guarded a jailhouse
