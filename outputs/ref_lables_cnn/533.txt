getting caught napping on the job is never good
getting caught napping on the job in the cargo hold of a plane takes it to a whole different level
alaska airlines was just barely on its way to los angeles from seattle-tacoma international airport on monday afternoon when the pilot reported hearing unusual banging from the cargo hold
" there could be a person in there so we 're going to come back around , " he told air traffic control
the banging in the cargo hold did come from a person and he turned out to be a ramp agent from menzies aviation , a contractor for alaska airlines that handles loading the luggage , the airline said
the man told authorities he had fallen asleep
the cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled , the airline said
" he started banging back , and he yelled really loud and said , ' we 're getting ready to land , hold on to something
' " the emergency landing spooked the folks aboard alaska airlines
" because what if it 's someone who could have been a terrorist ? " the ramp agent appeared to be in ok after the ordeal
the team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee 's cell phone , but did not receive an answer
alaska airlines said it 's investigating
all ramp employees have security badges , and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired , according to the airline
