the explosion outside the bauchi motor park â happened around 8:30 p.m. after a woman left her explosives - laden handbag near a bus filling up with passengers
the woman pretended to be going to jos and lingered around the bus , which was â waiting to fill up with passengers , according to tasiu , a grocer near the bus station
although no one has claimed responsibility for the attack , boko haram have repeatedly carried out suicide and bombing attacks on bus stations and markets in gombe and other northern cities , making the group the main suspect
boko haram has in recent months been under sustained pressure from sweeping offensives from a four - nation regional alliance of nigeria , chad , niger and cameroon
the regional offensives have considerably weakened boko haram 's capabilities , which has prompted the islamists to resort to attacks on soft targets such as bus stations , markets and schools
