new york wall street is more than ready for hillary clinton
the former secretary of state confirmed on sunday what the political world has expected for months -- eight years after her first failed white house bid , clinton will once again seek the democratic party 's nomination for president
" as clinton sets off onto the campaign trail to reintroduce herself to voters and court donors across the country , wall street elites are ready to roll out the red carpet
but while the enthusiastic support from the industry will be a financial boon for clinton 's newly launched campaign , it will also pose a delicate balancing act when it comes to appeasing a vocal wing of her party that is antagonistic toward the banking sector
clinton , 67 , has long enjoyed a close relationship with the financial industry
as a new york senator for almost a decade , she represented wall street and courted the industry aggressively during her last presidential campaign
now clinton 's allies in the finance world are eager to galvanize a broad network of potential donors in new york and beyond
many on wall street and in the broader business community view her as a dependable , business - friendly force within a democratic party that has grown increasingly populist during president obama 's time in office
wolf , the former ceo of ubs americas and a close obama associate who will back clinton in 2016 , said there 's an " incredible amount of enthusiasm " for her campaign to get off the ground
" i do n't think it 's surprising that the former senator of new york is close to the finance community
" clinton friend and prominent democratic party fundraiser patricof , who founded the venture capital firm greycroft partners , said clinton has " an enormous following " both inside and outside of the finance world
the former first lady 's perceived coziness with wall street is a source of irritation for liberal activists , who hope to push the eventual democratic party nominee to embrace progressive ideals during the 2016 primaries
" clinton 's early gestures have not satisfied some activists , who point to massachusetts democratic party sen. elizabeth warren as their candidate of choice
former republican new hampshire sen. gregg , who served as head of the securities industry and financial markets association , said part of clinton 's challenge stems from the fact that " the center of the democratic party has moved very much to the left
none of these potential candidates will be able to compete with clinton 's extensive fundraising apparatus
after clinton 's announcement sunday , a collection of liberal activists declared that the former secretary of state must prove her progressive bona fides. " we look forward to hillary clinton and other candidates laying out their platforms and hearing whether they embrace the fights that sen. warren has spent her life leading , " said warren campaign manager erica sagrans
" despite clinton 's embrace of more populist rhetoric , finance and business leaders are n't too concerned that she will back policies that are anathema to them
wylde , president of the partnership for new york city , a prominent business coalition , predicted that clinton would be able to maintain her relationship with wall street without alienating the liberal base
the fact that clinton " is knowledgeable and maintains good , open relationships with the business and financial world does not suggest that she 's in anybody 's pocket , " wylde said
