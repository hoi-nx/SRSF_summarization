easter is unique on the christianity calendar , a major point in the cycle of the religious year , and one that has always been able to resist the commercialization and culture warring that surrounds christmas
that 's in part because easter is genuinely about how religious impulses , and patterns , can operate in ways that affect our lives
nevertheless , i 'm often surprised by how little people , even those supposedly within the christianity tradition , actually know about what is called holy week and its culmination on easter sunday
at a time when our culture is roiled by questions of identity and ethics ( and tolerance ) that have profound religious implications , it 's worth pausing to explore this crucial holiday -- and the awareness of the human condition , in all its sadness and glory , that it engenders
after all , holy week calls mostly to those who incline their minds and hearts in its direction with seriousness of intent
why do christians make so much of this springtime week , and make so much of easter weekend ? there is a phrase that many never come across , even among christians : easter triduum
this refers to the three days of easter that begin with good friday , proceed through holy saturday , and conclude with easter sunday
it 's definitely a progression , although the word itself -- triduum -- can refer to any three days of prayer
it 's the day of the crucifixion , when jesus was scourged and beaten , forced to carry his cross to golgotha , the " place of the skull , " and nailed to the cross itself for what must have been an agonizing death
it 's a passageway between the darkness of the crucifixion and the bright hope of easter
this day occupies an anxious space in human experience , when the certain knowledge of something dreadful is n't quite erased -- ca n't be erased -- simply by hope
it 's a day of depression , a day of suspension
then comes easter , with the aura of the resurrection
" this was not , as i 've said elsewhere , the great resuscitation , although that 's part of it , too
easter embraces the great mystery of resurrection , with its promise of transformation -- a shift from one form to another , and a change that moves well beyond any literal understanding
the three days of easter , the triduum , occur only once a year on the calendar
this is the joy of easter , and it 's not something reserved for one day on the calendar
but the ritual enactment of these three days of the easter season reminds all of those who practice christianity -- and perhaps those who do n't -- that we should expect to move through darkness into light
it 's good cause for celebration , too : and one that wo n't easily be co-opted by secular culture .
