they come from more than 20 countries , drawn to libyan as the funnel to europe
in villages in senegalese and elsewhere across west african , young men sell all they have in the hope of a better life in europe , perhaps hoping to join a cousin or brother who made it
motivations among the tens of thousands making the trek to the mediterranean coast are as many and varied as the nationalities involved , according to researchers and human rights groups
but in 2014 more than 80 % of them headed for the libyan coast as the easiest point of embarkation
along the way they must cross deserts and mountains , risk kidnap or robbery , are often cheated or left stranded
the iom ( iom ) has tracked the migrant flows through north africa for years
one eritrean woman told the unhcr ( unhcr ) this month that she had paid $ 5,000 to reach the mediterranean
eritrean and syrian made up half of the migrant traffic to europe last year , according to malakooti , director of migration research at altai consulting and author of one of the most detailed studies of migration patterns
malakooti has recently visited seven countries , including libyan , tunisia and morocco to update her study
the " push factor " is much greater than the " pull " of europe , she says
upheavals and instability across much of west african and the middle east -- combined with the perception that libyan 's doors are open -- have led to a massive increase in the numbers trying to reach libyan
" worsening repression in eritrean " has been one factor , she says -- while eritrean already in refugee camps in sudan have decided to make a dash for the mediterranean
as one eritrean told the humanitarian journal irin last year : " people were traveling to israel because it was the only way , and now they 're traveling to europe because it 's the only way
" somalis , often seen as the third most numerous nationality among migrants headed to the mediterranean , face a perfect storm of crises
many reason that libyan 's chaos is an opportunity : border posts are left abandoned , the coastline unguarded
" but west african africans who have sold livestock or other possessions only to be caught or stranded can face destitution when they return home : 400 senegalese were recently repatriated from libyan by the red cross and iom
another disturbing phenomenon , according to malakooti , is the trafficking of west african women for prostitution to italy through libyan
while still a small fraction of the overall migration , the number of women smuggled for sexual exploitation in europe rose threefold in 2014 , she says
why migrants are risking their lives to reach italy a geneva - based group , the global initiative against transnational organized crime , estimated last year that about half of west african migrants pass through the town of agadez in northern niger
a migrant might pay as much as $ 300 to reach southern libyan in a truck or pick - up , according to researchers
hundreds of thousands of other migrants have already been in libyan for years , attracted to jobs as day laborers when moammar gadhafi was in power
so at least some are embarking on a journey to europe they never intended to take
malakooti believes this is a major factor in the rising numbers trying to reach europe
the recent murder of egyptian and ethiopian christians by isis 's libyan affiliate may have hastened the departure of some
now they 've given up , or the resources to accommodate them have evaporated -- and have decided to try to reach europe and start over
within libyan , the smugglers for the most part appear to be small groups or individuals rather than large networks , according to human rights organizations
' how is europe going to tackle migrant crisis those driving migrants to tripoli may have no connection with gangs at the coast
as libyan becomes more dangerous for migrants , other countries on both sides of the mediterranean are looking on anxiously
