if someone told you that your city had started a program providing clean needles to injecting drug users , would that make you want to start injecting drugs yourself ? the answer , of course , would be no. yet for decades , many have stood by the belief that such programs , known as syringe exchange or syringe services programs , promote and encourage drug use
as a result of the recent spikes in hiv and hepatitis c infections among injecting drug users in rural indiana and kentucky , the controversial topic of syringe exchange programs has come to the fore again
and this time , scientific evidence and sound public health practices prevailed as both states authorized the implementation of syringe exchange programs to help curb the spread of these two blood - borne diseases that can be spread by contaminated syringes
this is a welcome step -- an estimated 50,000 america are newly infected with hiv every year , and some 8 % are among injection drug users
dozens of studies have demonstrated conclusively how effective syringe services programs have been in the fight against hiv and hepatitis c transmission among injection drug users by reducing the reuse and sharing of dirty syringes -- without increasing drug use
for states such as new york and washington -- early adopters of these interventions -- syringe services programs have played a crucial role in driving down hiv transmission among injecting drug users
washington was the first state in the america to implement an syringe exchange when it opened a syringe services program in tacoma in 1988
in new york city -- where half of all injection drug users were hiv positive in the 1980s -- state lawmakers authorized syringe exchange in 1992 to combat the disease , deeming it a " public health necessity
syringe exchange programs not only save lives , but also save millions of dollars in hiv treatment costs
as hiv - positive injection drug users report higher levels of unemployment and homelessness , public programs such as medicaid will ultimately become responsible for the expensive treatment costs
this translates into $ 193 million in savings reaped from averted treatment costs after an estimated $ 64 million investment
in other words , every dollar spent on syringe exchange saves between $ 3 and $ 7 in hiv treatment costs alone
