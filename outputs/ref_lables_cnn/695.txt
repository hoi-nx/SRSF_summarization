police in the indian city of malegaon , in the western state of maharashtra , are requiring identity cards for an unusual group of residents : cattle
following a recent state - wide ban on the sale and consumption of beef , authorities in the city have asked residents to take a ' mugshot ' of their cattle and submit it to the police
police officials believe this is the only way to solve cow slaughter cases and enforce the law
cows are considered holy and revered by that state 's majority hindu population
the ruling came in the wake of a recent case of cow slaughter in malegaon , where two men have been charged for killing the animal and and selling its meat
maharashtra is not the only indian state to tighten its laws on cow slaughter
rajnath singh , indian 's home minister has promised that he would do all to devise a country - wide law against cow slaughter .
