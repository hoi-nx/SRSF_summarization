gorkha , nepalese the ride from kathmandu to near the epicenter of nepalese 's devastating earthquake is not for those who get easily carsick
steep slopes and small winding roads through deep river valleys greet us as we make our way to a town where nepalese and international medical teams are treating the injured , in much less than ideal circumstances
the view along the six - hour journey from the capital is deceptive
although i see numerous landslides , i am surprised that the villages we are driving through are relatively unaffected
during the entire journey , i notice only about 10 collapsed or seriously damaged houses
one of the biggest challenges rescue workers are facing in nepalese is reaching affected people in remote mountainous areas
one of them is gorkha , a district northwest of kathmandu
the town we were visiting looks intact
some houses have cracks , and i see a few collapsed brick walls
most of the shops and businesses are open
but our first stop at the district hospital brings us into the full reality of the human catastrophe
the hospital campus is overflowing with patients
the facility is simply not big enough to handle such calamity
the injured are not from the town of gorkha , which lies near the top of one of the numerous mountain ranges
they are from northern part of the district , where some 200,000 people live
to accommodate all the casualties , the hospital built a tarpaulin shelter over the parking lot
at a time of our arrival , there are about 20 patients lying on mattresses on a dusty concrete floor
the youngest is 10 , the oldest in his 70s
most of them have visible wounds : deep cuts , bruised faces , broken arms and legs or spinal injuries
all of their faces with empty looks are still expressing the terror they went through and the pain they are suffering
mita , 10 , sustained injuries to her face and leg when her house in the village of sinjung partially collapsed
her mother was injured in the tremor
the caws of crows above gorkha are frequently interrupted by sounds of helicopters
to fly to most remote places from gorkha takes about 30 minutes , five days on foot
the helicopters operated by nepalese military bring tents , tarps , blankets , food and baby supplies to most damaged areas
" they work very closely with staff of gorkha 's hospital
but here in gorkha , humanitarian teams are at full speed
swiss doctors along with their nepalese colleagues perform surgeries
we wish our hosts in gorkha the best of luck and leave for kathmandu mid-afternoon
but i learned a lot about resilience of the nepalese and about good people from around the world committed to help them
