like phone booths and typewriters , record stores are a vanishing breed -- another victim of the digital age
corporate america has largely abandoned brick - and - mortar music retailing to a scattering of independent stores , many of them in scruffy urban neighborhoods
on saturday , hundreds of music retailers will hold events to commemorate record store day , an annual celebration of , well , your neighborhood record store
many stores will host live performances , drawings , book signings , special sales of rare or autographed vinyl and other happenings
to their diehard customers , these places are more than mere stores : they are cultural institutions that celebrate music history ( the entire duran duran oeuvre , all in one place ! ) , display artifacts ( aretha franklin on vinyl ! ) , and nurture the local music scene ( hey , here 's a cd by your brother 's metal band ! )
