related : amy 's kitchen recalls more than 70,000 cases of food due to fear of listeria the first step , according to swartzberg , is to go to the fda 's website and find the official report for the recalled product you 're worried about
each report will list recalled items with their product codes , which are typically categorized by the universal product code ( the number adjacent to the barcode ) or the stock keeping unit ( a specific number that would only be valid at the store where the product is being sold )
they will also include the recalled products ' use - by dates , and the geographical areas affected
" the recall is not based on the use - by dates , though , " said swartzberg
" if the product is within the use - by date , it should still be recalled
this makes sense , because the product was contaminated prior to purchase and no matter how ' fresh ' the product is , it still may be contaminated
" in the case of this specific hummus recall , while there was no evidence that it caused any consumer illness , the product 's routine sample last month revealed the presence of listeria monocytogenes
