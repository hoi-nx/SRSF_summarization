shanghai , chinese with a well - paid job in finance and his own apartment , li lifei is living the chinese dream
the 26 - year old has his eye on a volkswagen but shanghai , like many large chinese cities , rations license plates as it looks for a solution to its gridlocked roads and polluted skies
to register for a license plate auction , prospective car buyers like li must put down a deposit in exchange for disc containing software they can use to bid online
each month there are around 10,000 license plates available
at the most recent auction on saturday , li said the final price was 80,600 yuan ( $ 13,000 ) -- around three times the price of a cheap chinese car and a third of what li plans to spend on his suv
another option would be to buy a hybrid vehicle that automatically qualifies for a license plate -- a selling point not lost on the car manufacturers showing their latest models and concepts at the shanghai auto show this week
toyota , volkswagen and volvo all launched gasoline - electric hybrids for the chinese market at the show , while chinese manufacturer byd has been an early pioneer of electric and hybrid cars
" the infrastructure ( charging stations ) for electric vehicles is not quite there yet but that 's the advantage of a hybrid -- you can have both , " said volvo ceo hakan samuelsson
but chinese drivers have n't wholeheartedly embraced the concept
even though chinese overtook the u.s. as the world 's largest car market in 2009 , sales of electric and hybrid vehicles , while increasing quickly , still lag behind the u.s. , where more than 100,000 were sold last year
few chinese have u.s. - style garages where the vehicles can be charged overnight
i thought maybe a tesla but it 's too expensive , " he said , referring to the hyper luxury electric sports car developed by elon musk that has seen weak sales in chinese
but when she returned to chinese nine years ago , she chose not to purchase a car
a recent report by consultants bain & company suggested that even though chinese 's love affair with the car began late , it may already be souring
