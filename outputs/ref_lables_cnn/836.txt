jackson gordon is no ordinary 21 - year - old
by day he is an industrial design student at university , but jackson gordon has another side to him -- a side altogether darker , tougher and more enigmatic
hanging in his workshop jackson gordon has a full suit of armor plating , cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife
jackson gordon has an alter ego  himself , batman
jackson gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay
" previously i 'd been involved with costume making ... i 'd made a version of the batsuit from nolan 's ' dark knight trilogy ' and i really liked that suit , " jackson gordon says
" i was frustrated every time i wore it , " jackson gordon explains
" the batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife , the impact of a punch or a baseball bat , but light and articulate enough to make it practical
jackson gordon therefore fired up a kickstarter campaign
" eschewing conventional materials , jackson gordon opted for a form of memory foam , built around key areas to " squish and compress , " dissipating the impact of blows
" using a two part box mold jackson gordon was able to create a " silicone jacket " of this , into which liquid polyurethane was poured , forming the final , " durable and functional " cowl
jackson gordon ( who does n't appear to be related to gotham city 's police commissioner , james gordon ) is also an expert in shaolin kung fu : he is both brains and brawn , a cross between batman and batsuit designer lucius fox from nolan 's batman trilogy
the batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty
jackson gordon has received " easily over 50 requests from people , " and not just from the cosplay community
