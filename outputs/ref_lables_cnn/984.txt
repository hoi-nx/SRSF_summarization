this is a difficult but necessary thing to say : incidents of police - involved killings and assaults on unarmed african - americans are unlikely to end soon
that 's partly because police brutality is neither new nor reflective of a " moment
this is a reality we must face if we are going to reverse course from what has become a national crisis
the peaceful protests that were followed by outbreaks of violence in baltimore this week have underscored the danger of ignoring the crisis -- as frustration and impatience with the status quo boils over
the violent response of police officers to unarmed african - americans is a decades - long phenomenon that has too often been dismissed as " race card " politics and black grievance
but this year 's spate of killings and assaults , from ferguson , missouri , to north charleston , south carolina , to most recently baltimore , are part of a deadly continuum of conduct that has created a well of resentment and anger in the african - u.s. community
so what makes now different ? the advent of cell phone cameras and social media has for the first time allowed average citizens to document police brutality routinely and to disseminate these images nationally
as a result , it is no longer possible for officials and commentators to downplay or deny the existence of police brutality against unarmed african - americans as has happened in the past
to call this ugly and unrelenting wave of police violence against unarmed african - americans a national crisis is not an exaggeration -- we are losing the confidence of a generation of young people who no longer believe in the legitimacy or credibility of our law enforcement and the justice system that underpins it
how do we face this crisis ? first , we must recognize that there are no quick fixes
the culture of policing in cities such as new york and baltimore has developed over decades
policing is a job passed down through families in which law enforcement norms and narratives are shared around the dinner table as much as in the station house
president barack obama is right when he reminds us that policing , like education , is a function of state and local government
in contrast , while the justice department provides more than $ 1 billion annually in grants to police departments across the country , those funds are provided free from obligations that awardees adopt federal standards on training , data collection or other measures with an explicit anti-racial bias focus
ultimately , the crisis we face presents an opportunity to rethink policing in this country fundamentally , including who we decide to recruit to serve
a national crisis requires a national response , and that means that federal , state and local law enforcement leaders and organizations must honestly and aggressively move to end police brutality
