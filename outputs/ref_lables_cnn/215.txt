washington chief justice john roberts is back in the spotlight
john roberts -- who shocked conservatives nearly three years ago by providing a pivotal vote to uphold obamacare -- once again faces a judicial crossroads in a historic case
the united states supreme court will hear oral arguments tuesday in a case that could decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have the constitutional right to marry
appeals courts nationwide have moved decisively toward supporting same - sex marriage , but a split at the appellate level helped propel the issue to the nation 's highest court , led by john roberts
appointed to the bench by president george w. bush , john roberts has a solid conservative record and would seem an unlikely vote to support a constitutional right to same - sex marriage
he dissented in united states v. windsor , a landmark case in which a narrowly divided court struck down a key provision of the defense of marriage act , which denied federal benefits to lawfully married same - sex couples
and he 's expressed sympathy with legal arguments that would allow same - sex marriage bans
yet both sides see the case as a legacy - making moment for the 60 - year - old chief justice , and advocates for same - sex couples hold out hope that he will emerge as their ally
" if the windsor majority votes in favor of marriage equality , the ruling will be one of the most momentous decisions of the john roberts court , " said judith e. schaeffer of the constitutional accountability center , which is advocating for same - sex marriage
" will john roberts want to be remembered as having dissented from such a historic decision ? " for some conservatives , a vote in favor of same - sex marriage in the case would be a huge disappointment
or when john roberts infuriated conservative allies by providing the crucial fifth vote to uphold obamacare on the grounds that the law is a constitutional use of the government 's taxing authority
the hope in conservative circles is that john roberts will see his legacy as ensuring that the issue of same - sex marriage gets decided by the people , not the courts
" john roberts is suggesting that concerns about the powers of states will support state laws excluding same - sex couples from marriage , " cruz said
the comments suggest he would reject an argument in the obergefell case that rested on the idea that same - sex marriage bans reflected animus against gay people
schaeffer points out that john roberts did n't join the parts of the dissents penned by justices antonin scalia , clarence thomas and samuel alito , which clearly stated a belief that state bans on same - sex marriage do n't violate the constitution
at the time , john roberts simply wrote that the court " does not have before it , and the logic of its opinion does not decide " whether states can ban same - sex marriage
the defense of marriage act decision overshadowed another 2013 case -- hollingsworth v. perry -- that could have determined whether states could ban same - sex marriage
the case concerned a challenge to california 's proposition 8 , a state constitutional amendment that barred same - sex couples from marriage
the ruling left in place a lower court decision that had invalidated proposition 8 and thus paved the way for same - sex marriage in california
and even when john roberts ' actions -- such as effectively allowing same - sex marriage to proceed in california -- seem to suggest a willingness to consider such unions nationwide , his comments along the way make it much harder to gain insight into his ultimate thinking
