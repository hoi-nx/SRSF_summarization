the terrorist group al-shabaab has claimed an attack on garissa university college in eastern kenyan , in which many people have been killed and still more taken hostage
the attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group 's activities , and a clear indicator that the security situation in east africa is deteriorating fast
somalia - based al-shabaab has been behind a string of recent attacks in kenyan , the most well - known of them being the massacre at the westgate shopping centre in nairobi in 2013
cross-border raids into kenyan by the group , however , date back to 2011
al-shabaab incursions triggered a military response by the government in nairobi , which sent troops to somalia as part of an african union mission in support of somalia 's internationally recognized government that had been under pressure from al-shabaab and other militants for several years
al-shabaab ( literally " the youth " ) split from unity of islam in 2003 and merged with another radical islamist group , the so - called islamic courts union
as their alliance obtained control of somalia 's capital mogadishu in 2006 , ethiopian , the only majority christian country in the region , took military action against the group
increasing its links with al-qaeda , al-shabaab declared its full allegiance in 2012 -- and it is not clear whether it will switch allegiances to isis
these entrenched inequalities help al-shabaab appeal to a wide variety of potential recruits , who may sympathize with and actively support the group for any number of reasons
attacking a university in northern kenyan and separating christian from muslim students epitomizes the way al-shabaab advances itself by exploiting religious , tribal and nationalist identities
but there wo n't be any lasting solution to the wider region 's security problems without a more comprehensive and concerted effort to address the deeper problems of exclusion suffered by the citizens of the countries challenged by al-shabaab
