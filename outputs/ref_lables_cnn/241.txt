last month wu was taken into custody for planning to protest on international women 's day against sexual harassment in china
since then , the china authorities have formally detained her and four other activists for " creating disturbances
the fate of the five will be revealed by april 13 , as their case reaches the legal time limit when they must either be released or " formally arrested , " which almost always leads to conviction in china 's legal system
the timing of the detentions of china 's most inventive women 's rights activists is ironic : not only did they take place on the very day that marks women 's achievements and their struggle for equality , but they also come in a year in which beijing would have won praise for its role in promoting women 's rights
it appears poised to adopt its first and long - awaited anti-domestic violence law , which is expected to get a reading before the national people 's congress standing committee this summer
this year also marks the 20th anniversary of the influential fourth world conference on women hosted in beijing , during which hillary clinton famously declared that " women 's rights are human rights
" i first met wu at a conference several years ago , at a time when there were very few women in china 's weiquan or " rights defense " movement
as women 's rights activists , wu and others fight on two fronts : against overt rights violations by the china government and against the wider gender norms that relegate women to second - class citizens
they staged small , public " performance art " protests that attracted media headlines , energized the more mainstream and academically inclined women 's rights movement , and pushed women 's rights into the national consciousness and onto the government 's agenda
many in wu and her colleagues ' generation are clear - eyed about the problems of china 's development model , and some want to address those
wu joined yirenping , a nonprofit organization that promotes social equality , whether it is between sexes or among people with and without disabilities , and later founded the women 's rights organization hangzhou women center
but even if they are released , their work promoting women 's rights will have become exponentially more difficult
