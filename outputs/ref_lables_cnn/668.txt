when moonves sits down at a restaurant in hollywood , it 's usually the waiter 's lucky night
but when he walked into craig 's in hollywood last year , those roles were reversed
this time , moonves ' waiter , salvador , was the one serving up a mouthwatering opportunity that had nothing to do with the shrimp diavolo
" moonves ' love of boxing , our love of boxing -- that gave me the confidence to say to him ' give me a chance , ' " said salvador , an actor who has appeared in " bones " and " blue bloods
' " that 's when salvador told moonves his son trained at the hollywood gym owned by roach , manny pacquiao 's trainer , and that he would put in a good word for moonves
salvador helped set up a meeting between moonves , roach and himself at scarpetta in beverly hills that he says began with a discussion about the legacy of boxing
salvador 's role ended after that dinner
with that kind of money , and a smattering of media buzz around salvador 's story , inevitable questions circulated over what , if any , reward he should get , given the epic nature of the fight
when asked to comment , manny pacquiao 's team downplayed salvador 's role
" salvador insists he is not seeking money , and a cbs spokesman confirmed his role in the initial meeting
