lausanne , switzerland a roller - coaster series of talks wrapped up thursday in lausanne as a group of world powers known as the p5 +1 reached a framework agreement with iranian over the country 's nuclear program
but the talks this week were , nevertheless , historic , particularly for the otherwise frozen u.s. - iranian relationship
but that 's not to say they were glamorous
in fact , the negotiations this week provided a modern demonstration of diplomacy at its best , but also at its most hectic
tucked amid the swiss on the shores of lake geneva , lausanne is certainly one of the more scenic places to be trapped for talks -- a sort of camp david for the rich and famous
but make no mistake : the site of these negotiations is also a gilded cage
over the course of the eight - day round of talks , negotiators , their delegations , their security details and reporters were confined primarily to the immediate area around the five - star beau-rivage palace hotel , which played host to the negotiations
the first - floor terrace even features a large - scale chess board , which served this week as an artful analogy for the game of nuclear chess going on just inside
for the negotiators , the past week was marked by a marathon run of meetings , sometimes lasting throughout the night
in an interview with cnn shortly after the framework agreement was announced , secretary of state kerry said , " i think there was a seriousness of purpose " in meetings with the iranian
" it was tough , very intense at times , sometimes emotional and confrontational
" that sentiment was echoed by iranian foreign minister zarif even as the talks were still going on
over the past 18 months since talks began , zarif said , negotiators have " developed personal respect " for one another , even though serious mistrust still exists between iranian and the western powers
media give - and - take zarif made these comments to reporters who swarmed him during an afternoon walk along the lake thursday
such ambushes were a frequent occurrence during the talks as reporters tried to supplement what little information was being circulated through official channels
reporters briefly followed chinese foreign minister wang yi as he took a morning jog shortly after his arrival in lausanne on sunday
the officials sometimes bemoaned the media circus , but they also used the attention to bolster their demands during negotiations , making statements to reporters that they hoped strengthened their footing in talks with their foreign counterparts
" people often use you guys to deliver messages to the negotiation , " a senior administration official who asked not to be named told reporters on the flight back to lausanne , " as do the iranian
different orbits more than 600 reporters were credentialed to cover the talks this week
meanwhile , the traveling press corps covering the foreign ministers were given coveted red badges , allowing them access to the hotel , where the talks took place
while these journalists had a bit more access to officials , they were usually cordoned off inside a couple of claustrophobic media rooms and barred access to most of the building , including the hotel 's reception desk , the first - floor restrooms and the two - michelin-star restaurant 's entrees , costing 200 francs or more
many journalists found refuge in the more comfortable downstairs bar , a shorter walk from the cameras and satellite trucks used around the clock by television reporters on a rolling deadline
there were " many moments ( throughout the negotiations ) when we thought we 'd call it a day , call it a night , decide we 'd gone as far as we could go , " said the official , who briefed reporters on kerry 's plane
