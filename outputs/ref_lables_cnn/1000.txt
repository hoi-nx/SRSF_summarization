it 's not going to be enough to slake the thirst of the elusive mars bunny , but scientists say new research seems to support the theory that what looks like a bone - dry red planet during the day could be dotted with tiny puddles of salty water at night
experts have long thought that a particular kind of salt detected in mars soil could pull water vapor from the the planet 's thin atmosphere into the soil at night and then keep it from freezing despite the extreme cold
researchers are n't saying they 've seen direct evidence of brine hiding out in the mars night
researchers say mars may once have had an sea as extensive as earth 's atlantic ocean , and curiosity has found evidence of ancient streambeds and a lake on the planet
but scientists say evidence of water ice at the planet 's poles and now more evidence toward the theory of widespread brines keeps them hoping they 'll find evidence that life at least once existed there
" conditions near the surface of present - day mars are hardly favorable for microbial life as we know it , " he said , " but the possibility for liquid brines on mars has wider implications for habitability and geological water - related processes
