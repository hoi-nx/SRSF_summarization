gray 's family had asked there be quiet on baltimore 's streets the day they laid him to rest
and above all , no violence
but a handful of people repeated the family 's message
they became criers in the desert against countless young people flinging rocks at police , breaking windows , looting and setting fires
the peacemakers -- clergy , gray 's family and brave residents -- placed themselves in the rioters ' way
" it 's disrespect to the family
the family was very clear -- we 've been saying it all along -- today there was absolutely no protest , no demonstration , " he said
it overshadowed the message peaceful protesters delivered on prior days -- justice for gray
the early fits of violence came in the afternoon , about the time mourners left gray 's memorial services blocks away , rev. bryant said
he did not want to see it spread to downtown baltimore , where some rioters said it would , and organized people to stand in the way

" that 's just disintegrated into just looking at baltimore and thinking that the city is the city of violence , " she said
a tall , adult man walked up to a young man who was confronting riot police
he slung an arm over his shoulder , turned him back around in the other direction and marched him away from police lines
gangs members joined community leaders and gray 's family for a press conference monday night on the stage at new shiloh baptist church , which had held gray 's funeral
the gangs have signed a peace deal and are uniting to push against police lines in protests , according to a report by the daily beast
at the end of the day , gray 's family had the last word on the violence at the press conference
" to see that it turned into all this violence and destruction , i am appalled , " said richard shipley , gray 's stepfather
" i want y'all to get justice for my son , but do n't do it like this here , " said gray 's mother gloria darden , who wore a t - shirt with her son 's photo
" i do n't think that 's for gray , " his twin sister fredericka gray said
" after their comments , gray family lawyer murphy took the microphone
