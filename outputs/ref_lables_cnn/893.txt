on tuesday , a white police officer in north charleston , south carolina , was charged with murder for shooting an unarmed black man in the back
the post and courier reported that the fbi has opened an investigation into the shooting death along with the state law enforcement division , while the south carolina attorney general is investigating possible civil rights violations
the police officer can always plant a gun on the suspect he shot to death , or like michael slager , apparently place a taser near walter scott 's body and concoct some story that his life was in danger
" we ca n't bring mr. walter scott back , but something like this today can have a bigger precedence than just what happened here with mr. walter scott
" although the black community and others have been aware for years of the problem of police brutality , through personal experience and anecdotes , the data confirm that police use of deadly force is a black and white issue
a propublica analysis of police shootings from 2010 to 2012 found that young black males are 21 times more likely to be fatally shot by the police than young white males
sixty - eight percent of people of color who are killed by police are also killed by white officers
furthermore , 10 % of police involved in fatal shootings are black , and 78 % of the people killed by black officers are black
according to cynthia lee of george washington university law school , the disproportionate representation of blacks and other people of color in police shootings is due to the role of racial stereotypes by police
racial stereotypes , lee argues , subconsciously influence an officer 's decision on whether to use deadly force , even if the police do not consciously decide to use deadly force based on race
a simple question posed to the officer by a black person could be perceived as a threat to the officer 's authority
what 's more , a washington state university study on deadly force found that participants felt more threatened in scenarios involving black suspects , suggesting participants " held subconscious biases associating blacks and threats
otherwise , the bogus narrative of the good white cop protecting himself from the menacing black thug may have prevailed
what happened in north charleston tells us the epidemic of police deadly force has not died
the taking of black lives by the police remains a crisis situation in america that must be addressed , because # blacklivesmatter
