washington isis is a problem that is " off the charts historically " and has sent the u.s. into " uncharted territory " when it comes to putting down the terror group , the obama administration 's point man in the fight recently told cnn
the comments , which brett mcgurk made in an exclusive interview , were some of the administration 's strongest to date in describing the challenge the u.s. and its allies face in battling isis
as the u.s. - led coalition has focused attention on iraqi and syria , isis has expanded its reach to libya , egypt and yemen , often with existing extremist groups pledging allegiance to the militants
brett mcgurk did not rule out expanding u.s. military action beyond iraqi and syria to combat the increasing regional threat
" the u.s. has also been stepping up efforts to involve sunni groups in the fight against isis
but brett mcgurk said that iraqi prime minister al-abadi is making progress getting sunni tribes to support a planned iraqi offensive against isis in anbar in the coming weeks
he stressed the importance of working with al-abadi , noting that the iraqi leader was in anbar last week handing out more than 1,000 ak - 47s to tribal fighters who are going to join the iraqi security forces
" but in fact , what the foreign fighters are finding in syria and iraqi is that they 're more likely to get killed in iraqi and syria , and in fact , instead of getting a slave bride as isis leaders promise them , they 're more likely to get killed by a female peshmerga fighter in the streets of kobani
