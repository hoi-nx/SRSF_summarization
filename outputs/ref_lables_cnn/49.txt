ronson 's " uptown funk ! , " featuring mars , is the longest - leading billboard of the 2010s , ruling the chart for a 13th week
it 's also just the 10th single in the billboard 's entire history to spend at least 13 weeks at no. 1
" funk , " released on rca records , passes robin thicke 's " blurred lines , " featuring t.i. and pharrell williams to take sole possession of the billboard 's longest command this decade
here 's an updated look at the hits to lead for the most weeks since the beginning of 2010 : weeks at no. 1 , title , artist , date reached no. 1 13 ( to date ) , " uptown funk ! , " ronson feat. mars , jan. 17 , 2015 12 , " blurred lines , " robin thicke feat. t.i. + pharrell williams , june 22 , 2013 10 , " happy , " pharrell williams , march 8 , 2014 10 , " we found love , " rihanna feat. calvin harris , nov. 12 , 2011 " funk " also becomes one of an elite 10 singles ever to top the billboard for at least 13 weeks , dating to the chart 's aug. 4 , 1958 launch : weeks at no. 1 , title , artist , date reached no. 1 16 , " one sweet day , " mariah carey & boyz ii men , dec. 2 , 1995 14 , " i got ta feeling , " the black eyed peas , july 11 , 2009 14 , " we belong together , " mariah carey , june 4 , 2005 14 , " candle in the wind 1997 " / " something about the way you look tonight , " elton john , oct. 11 , 1997 14 , " macarena ( bayside boys mix ) , " los del rio , aug. 3 , 1996 14 , " i 'll make love to you , " boyz ii men , aug. 27 , 1994 14 , " i will always love you , " whitney houston , nov. 28 , 1992 13 ( to date ) , " uptown funk ! , " ronson feat. mars , jan. 17 , 2015 13 , " the boy is mine , " brandy & monica , june 6 , 1998 13 , " end of the road , " boyz ii men , aug. 15 , 1992 ask billboard : will ' uptown funk ! ' be the billboard 's no. 1 song of 2015 ? with " funk " now just three weeks from potentially tying " one sweet day " for the record , and four weeks from possibly claiming it all to itself , can it rewrite billboard history ? it 's too early to forecast charts a month away , but " funk " still sports strong leads in all main billboard metrics
" funk " logs a 13th week atop the digital songs chart with 165,000 downloads sold ( down 12 percent ) in the week ending march 29 , according to nielsen music
that 's a record - tying feat : " funk ! " matches flo rida 's 2007 - 08 hit " low , " featuring t-pain , for the most weeks a title has spent at no. 1 on digital songs
it 's the first song to reach double - digit weeks at no. 1 on radio songs since " blurred lines " led for 11
ask billboard : will ' uptown funk ! ' be the billboard 's no. 1 song of 2015 ? " funk , " thus , leads the billboard and its three main component charts ( digital songs , radio songs and streaming songs ) simultaneously for a record - extending ninth week ( nonconsecutively )
perhaps helping the chances that " funk " can remain at no. 1 on the billboard , at least for another week : while it 's down by 11 percent in overall activity , the no. 2 song ( for a third week ) , maroon 5 's " sugar , " decreases by 3 percent , while sheeran 's " thinking out loud , " at no. 3 ( for a third week , after peaking at no. 2 for eight weeks ) , is off by 2 percent
could either " sugar " or " loud " rebound to challenge " funk " further on the billboard ? could another song in the top 10 topple it ? or , is it a song just building , or not even yet released , that will take over ? again , it 's too soon to tell
( at least we think one will ... ) chart highlights : taylor swift 's ' style ' hits no. 1 on adult pop songs meanwhile , " sugar " takes over at no. 1 on the subscription services - based on - demand songs chart , despite a 10 percent drop to 4.1 million streams
from the same hit movie , the weeknd 's " earned it ( fifty shades of grey ) " reaches the billboard 's top five ( 6 - 5 ) , adding top airplay gainer honors for a second week
the sultry track also takes over at no. 1 on billboard 's hot r&b / hip-hop songs chart
chart highlights : taylor swift 's ' style ' hits no. 1 on adult pop songs fetty wap 's " trap queen " rises 8 - 6 on the billboard , while spending a second week at no. 1 on hot rap songs ; taylor swift 's " style " ranks at no. 7 on the billboard for a third week after reaching no. 6 ( and , as previously reported , reaches no. 1 on the adult pop songs airplay chart ) ; rihanna , kanye west and paul mccartney 's " fourfiveseconds " drops 5 - 8 on the billboard after climbing to no. 4 ( and departs the hot r&b / hip-hop songs summit after seven weeks ) ; and flo rida climbs 10 - 9 with " g.d.f.r. , " featuring sage the gemini and lookas
one song is new to the billboard 's top 10 : la rose 's " somebody , " featuring jeremih ( 13 - 10 )
