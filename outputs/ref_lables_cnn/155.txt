the vii summit of the americas was supposed to be all about the symbolic handshake between the united states and cuban
cuban has historically been the wrench in the diplomatic machinery , with some latin american leaders threatening not to attend the summit of the americas if the united states and canada did n't agree to invite president castro
the tide changed december 17 , 2014 , when president obama and castro announced that more than five decades of cold war rivalry was ending
the much anticipated handshake between obama and castro would steal all the headlines if it was n't for cuban 's strongest ally , venezuelan
venezuelan president maduro recently accused the united states of trying to topple his government and banned former president george bush , former vice president dick cheney , and senators bob menendez and marco rubio from entering venezuelan
but perhaps most damning for the united states -- and creating the " triangle of tension " at the summit -- cuban foreign minister rodriguez has sided publicly with maduro
while the world watches for the photo - op of obama and castro , it 's unclear if more latin american diplomats will side with maduro , and for united states , the vii summit of the americas could go from " mi casa es su casa " to a walk into the lion 's den.
