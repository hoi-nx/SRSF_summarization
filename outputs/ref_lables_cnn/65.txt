c-span 's live telecast of the white house on saturday night , hosted by cecily strong of " saturday night live , " was not strong 's finest hour , though the entire affair seemed like five of c-span 's longest hours
president obama , as strong 's warm - up act , did n't hit the podium until 10:20 p.m. ( strong got her turn at 10:45
) obama , as in past years , came out strong -- a tough act to follow for any comedian
noting his lame - duck status , obama said his advisers asked him if he had a bucket list
obama , noting the night 's guest speaker , said , " on ' saturday night live , ' cecily strong impersonates cnn anchor brooke baldwin
then , to up the ante on his time at the podium , he welcomed his " anger translator " -- a recurring character played by keegan-michael key on comedy central 's " key & peele
" it was a clever surprise , and the crowd reacted with surprising enthusiasm ( i would n't have presumed most of them knew of keegan-michael key 's character or his series ) , though keegan-michael key 's jokes lost something in the translation , and did n't pack the punch of obama 's
but the bit ended with a great twist : obama himself getting so worked up about a snowball being carried into congress to denounce global warming that the president 's " anger translator " had to calm obama down instead
and then came cecily strong , with a sly opening line referring not only to her appearance as one of the few female guest speakers at the correspondents ' dinner , but to the upcoming 2016 presidential election
" from there , the crowd seemed as tough as advertised , with " oohs " often as loud as laughter , as strong went from one target to another
she came on after not only the dinner service and obama , but after scholarship awards , correspondent awards and tributes and other bits of official business
final tally : obama gets an a- , keegan-michael key a c , cecily strong a b - , and the entire telecast and event an a + for democracy -- but a d as television .
