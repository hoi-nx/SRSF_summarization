three were sentenced to death
" but it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided , and often cynical , attempt to tackle crime and terrorism
today , amnesty international releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide
much of it makes for grim reading
other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates
a sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool
the simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both
it is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough
at amnesty international , we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades
in 1945 when the united nations was founded , only eight countries had abolished the death penalty
last year , we recorded executions in 22 countries , down by almost a half from 20 years ago
this number does not include china , where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together , but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret , the true figure is impossible to determine
executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-saharan africa -- equatorial guinea , somalia and sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter
those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history
fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task , but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment
