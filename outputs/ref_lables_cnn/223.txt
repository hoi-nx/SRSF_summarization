catania , italian the boat that sank in the mediterranean over the weekend with hundreds of migrants on board may have capsized after being touched or swamped by a cargo ship that came to its aid , a united nations official said
asami , a spokeswoman for the united nations ' refugee agency , made the comments to cnn early tuesday after she and two of her colleagues had spoken to multiple survivors from the disaster who arrived in catania , italian
the account she offered differs from that provided by italian authorities on sunday
they said that as the cargo ship jacob approached late saturday , migrants on the smaller boat moved to one side , hoping to be saved , and caused the vessel to capsize
clark -- a communications executive representing osm maritime group , the company that manages the jacob -- denied that the cargo ship caused the migrant boat to capsize
he said he also believed that people on the migrant boat rushed to one side , causing many to fall off
the cargo ship was going very slowly as it approached , hardly making any waves , clark told cnn
the conflicting accounts of the chaotic events highlight the challenges faced by commercial vessels that are often called upon to help in the escalating migrant boat crisis in the mediterranean
italian authorities , who have been coordinating the rescue effort , say only 28 survivors were rescued and 24 bodies have been recovered
the cause of the shipwreck is part of italian authorities ' investigation , said salvi , catania 's public prosecutor
asami said the survivors told her and her colleagues that they were all on the highest part of the overcrowded boat , while many people were down in the lowest area
italian authorities said sunday that an unidentified bangladeshi survivor had told them that the smugglers had locked many people inside the lower levels of the vessel
two of the survivors were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in sicily on monday , according to italian police officer maria guia federico
italian police identified the two suspects through questioning survivors aboard the coast guard vessel that brought them to catania , salvi said , according to italian media
the sinking appears to be the worst among an intensifying spate of migrant boat disasters in the mediterranean to which europe governments are struggling to respond
the international organization for migration said monday that more than 1,100 people were estimated to have drowned in the waters between libya and italian just in the past week
shipping companies recently warned that europe governments are putting what they say is an unfair burden on their vessels to come to the aid of migrant boats in trouble
mogherini told cnn that the eu must fight human traffickers , strengthen europe ' duty to save lives at sea and share responsibility when it comes to the resettlement and relocation of refugees
