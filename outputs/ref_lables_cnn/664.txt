beijing amid tight security , a china court has convicted veteran journalist gao for revealing state secrets and sentenced her to seven years in prison
after a closed trial last november , the no. 3 intermediate people 's court in beijing had twice delayed handing down a verdict , giving gao 's supporters some hope that the authorities ' apparent hesitation may lead to her acquittal and release
the document revealed the party 's ideological battle plan to counter advocates of constitutional democracy , banning public discussions on topics ranging from press freedom , civil rights to judicial independence
" there is no defense against state secret charges in china , anything party or the government want to label as state secrets will be labeled and treated as such -- they can even do it retroactively , " said bequelin , the hong kong - based east asia director of amnesty
" her sentencing is in line with the very stern approach president xi jinping 's team has taken on dissent , information control and challenges to party , " he added
beijing police detained gao in late april of last year -- ahead of the sensitive 25th anniversary of the tiananmen square crackdown -- and state broadcaster cctv soon aired her " confession " on national television
she was arrested after the tiananmen square protests in 1989 and released more than a year later
