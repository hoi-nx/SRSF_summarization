kabul , afghanistan the flag is crude , handmade , but the message is clear -- allegiance to isis in afghanistan
and the timing -- with u.s. withdrawing , the taliban fractured , young men disillusioned and angry -- could not be worse
a group of fighters in afghanistan agreed to be filmed by a cnn cameraman parading their isis flags in a valley not far to the south of kabul , the khak afghan capital
they are the first images of their kind shot by western media inside afghanistan
the rise of isis is an issue that the khak afghan president , ghani , has termed a " terrible threat
" u.s. officials cnn has spoken to have voiced their concern about the potential for an isis presence
one u.s. military officer said the militants currently have limited capability but are trying to recruit disillusioned taliban in several areas around the country 's east and south
" there has been some very small numbers of recruitment that has happened , " colonel j b vowell , told cnn
" you have disaffected taliban who are losing politically and some of the younger , newer fighters are moving to that camp
it is often said that rivalry between the nascent isis presence and the taliban , who remain the big guns in afghanistan , is fierce enough to mean the isis fighters could be killed for brandishing the flag
but it is fatigue with the taliban that appears to have provided fertile ground for their rise
one of them told cnn : " we established contacts with is ( another acronym for the group ) through a friend who is in helmand ( in southern afghanistan )
he added they are currently designating a new leader , after the supposed head of isis in afghanistan , abdul rauf khadim , was reportedly killed in a drone strike earlier in the year
for months , the khak afghan government played down the threat of a looming isis presence in afghanistan , yet during his recent trip to washington , ghani struck a different tone
from the west , daesh is already sending advance guards to southern and western afghanistan to push our vulnerabilities , " he told u.s. congress in late march , using the pejorative name used to describe the militants by many isis opponents in the region
suspicions have fallen on possible nascent isis cells as the taliban have vehemently denied responsibility for the attacks
cnn spoke to local officials from five regions -- some emphasized the growing threat of the terror group , while others played it down
" nangarhar : mp esmatullah shinwari says : " according to some reports , black flags have been seen in nangarhar 's haska mina district -- and a former taliban local commander , abdul khaleq , is now claiming to be isis ' representative in that district
" wardak : mp shir wali wardak says : " i do n't think isis fighters from syria and iraq have come here to afghanistan -- but hardcore taliban members who have understood that the taliban name is dying have changed the color of their flags from white to black in order to stay alive
" ghazni : deputy governor mohammad ali ahmadi says : " there are ex-taliban fighters operating under the name of isis in ghazni province at the moment who have changed their flag from white to black
there have been armed clashes between newly - converted isis ( members ) and taliban fighters ... who should be in control of certain places
