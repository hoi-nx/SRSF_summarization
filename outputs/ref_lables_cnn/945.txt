some supervisors at the sheriff 's office were told to forge reserve deputy robert bates ' training records , and three who refused were reassigned to less desirable duties , the tulsa world newspaper reported
claims that the volunteer deputy 's records had been falsified emerged " almost immediately " from multiple sources after robert bates killed harris on april 2 , reporter dylan goforth said
robert bates claims he meant to use his taser but accidentally fired his handgun at harris instead
the newspaper 's story does not say who allegedly asked the supervisors to falsify the training records or why
but the orders apparently started years ago , before harris ' death , " back when ( robert bates ) was trying to get on as a deputy , " reporter branstetter told cnn 's " new day
" the sheriff 's office denied the allegations in the tulsa world 's report
" just keep in mind that the tulsa world reporter can not validate her sources and claims anonymity , which leaves us skeptical that her claims are unsubstantiated and deceptive , " clark wrote
brewster , an attorney who represents robert bates , said the accusations are based on an affidavit from a former sheriff 's office employee who 's now facing a first - degree murder charge
shooting casts spotlight on volunteer police programs sheriff glanz and other sheriff 's officials have repeatedly insisted robert bates was properly trained
the tulsa county sheriff 's office has released a summary of robert bates ' training courses only over the past seven years
the office rejected cnn 's request for the full training records because robert bates ' case is under investigation
branstetter said she 's run into similar obstacles when asking for the names of supervisors who 'd signed off on robert bates ' training records
" robert bates was classified as an advanced reserve deputy for the sheriff 's office
robert bates would also have needed firearms certification training
but the sheriff himself has acknowledged there is a problem with robert bates ' gun certification records -- his office ca n't find them
he said robert bates " qualified with a young lady that was a firearms instructor
" opinion : who gave this reserve cop a gun ? even before the tulsa world story , inconsistencies were apparent in robert bates ' history with the sheriff 's office
in his statement to investigators , robert bates said he " became an advanced tcso reserve deputy in 2007
that would be less than the 480 hours of field training that the tulsa world said is required to be an " advanced " reserve deputy , which robert bates claimed to be
he also said he 'd attended " numerous schools and seminars related to drug investigations and the tactical operations associated with the apprehension of suspects involved in drug trafficking , " a five - day homicide investigation school in dallas and training from arizona 's maricopa county sheriff 's office on responding to active shooters
but an arizona official told cnn bates never trained with the agency
" he did n't come to arizona , " the official from the maricopa county sheriff 's office said , " and he certainly did n't train with us
" he met every requirement , and all he did was give of himself
