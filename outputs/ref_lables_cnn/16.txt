by now , you probably have a position regarding the controversy over indiana 's religious freedom law
the issue drives a wedge because , well , the debate over religious freedom and gay rights is always heated , but also because the interpretations and motives behind the law can be questioned
as the author of the 1993 federal rfra ( rfra ) , sen. schumer is one who can offer clarity over the controversy surrounding indiana 's version of the law
schumer mocks indiana 's contention that the state law is simply a mirror of the 22 - year - old federal law
the federal law was intended to protect individual 's religious freedom from government intervention , he said
the indiana law justifies discrimination in the name of religious freedom , he contends
also , the law was envisioned to protect the religious freedoms of individuals , while the indiana law also protects private companies , schumer said
so , how can the law 's supporters claim it is basically a copy of the federal law ? if you look at the purpose of the law , the language in the federal and indiana religious freedom laws are indeed nearly indistinguishable
in short -- the government can not interfere with a person 's religious practices unless there is a compelling government interest to do so
the uproar is over that fact that the indiana law expands the reach of the religious protections to include private companies and cases where the government is not involved
other states previously passed their own version of the religious freedom law -- indiana became the 20th
the key difference in the indiana law is that it expands the instances where someone can use religious freedom as a defense
this was in new mexico , a state with a religious freedom law at the time of the dispute
the company , elane photography , refused the job because of the co-owner 's religious beliefs
the photography studio lost the case because the court ruled that it could not use the religious freedom law because the dispute was between two private parties and not a government entity
what would happen if that case happened today in indiana , with the new , expanded religious freedom law ? for sure , the case would have proceeded to trial , said holbrook , a law professor at emory university
would the outcome have been the same ? would an indiana jury side with the company that refused service to a couple because of their sexual orientation ? in a letter expressing concern about the indiana law , a group of 30 legal scholars argued that what indiana has done is expanded the scope of the law to the point that religious considerations might trump discrimination concerns
" in our expert opinion , the clear evidence ... unmistakably demonstrates that the broad language of the proposed state rfra will more likely create confusion , conflict , and a wave of litigation that will threaten the clarity of religious liberty rights in indiana while undermining the state 's ability to enforce other compelling interests , " the letter , whose signatories included many indiana law professors , stated
yes , the indiana law makes it clear that individuals and private companies can use the religious freedom law as a defense , he said
what 's clear is that indiana 's law increases the potential pool of people who can defend themselves claiming religious freedom
in the meantime , some are already hatching plans on how to test the law , including bill levin , founder of the first church of cannabis , who argued on cnn that the law should protect his right to smoke pot. much is being made of the fact that the first religious freedom law was signed by president bill clinton more than 20 years ago
but holbrook says it is no coincidence that the religious freedom laws became popular at the state level just as the gay rights and marriage equality movement made historic steps
blackman said the history of the state religious freedom laws shows that they have not turned into conduits for discrimination
according to blackman , the interpretations of the federal religious freedom law are not uniform
hobby lobby , citing the federal religious freedom law , argued that it should not have to provide contraception coverage through insurance to its employees via obamacare because it was against the owners ' beliefs
the outrage over the indiana law is that it can be used to deny services to the lgbt community on the ground of religious beliefs
some may rightfully ask , " where was the outrage before the religious freedom law ? " indiana does not have an nondiscrimination law that protects people based on sexual orientation or gender identity
in that sense , the religious freedom law is not necessary for those who want to discriminate against gays and lesbians
if new mexico had the same religious freedom law as indiana , the case would have gone to trial
but new mexico has a nondiscrimination law that protects the lgbt community , it and it would have provided a strong counter-argument to the religious freedom claim
