every week in the heart of nima , a slum in the ghana capital of accra , families congregate at a local mosque
" when the parents are praying [ downstairs ] , we are teaching the girls upstairs , " explains tech entrepreneur regina agyare , who comes here every week to teach local teens how to code
regina agyare 's first visit to see the girls -- students at education project achievers ghana -- was in january 2014
" i fell in love with them , so i decided to set up a coding club and started having regular sessions , " says regina agyare , founder of software development company soronko solutions
more importantly , continues regina agyare , it offered the opportunity to show " the community the value of educating girls
" a predominantly muslim area in a largely christian nation , nima has one of the densest populations in accra
regina agyare says life is often challenging for many local girls , with some growing up without ever leaving the community
" girls were being forced to marry early ; [ denied ] their right to go to school
" this , in part , was why regina agyare lent her support to achievers ghana
its goal is to break through social barriers and provide nima with a generation of female role models , and so the group provides school funding to help the girls shape their own future
achievers ghana met initial resistance from local conservatives , but when the mosque 's chief imam sheik hussein abdul rahman championed mohammad 's vision , few maintained their reservations
fourteen months after her first visit , regina agyare 's coding class is well established
she has set up a mentor scheme as part of " tech needs girls , " recruiting and training women at university to act as role models for her younger students in nima
" some girls had never used a computer before the classes began , but regina agyare 's even - handed approach has brought all her students up to the same standard
" she adds : " it would be great if we had some girls that decided to go on and study computer science , but really it 's about helping them reach their full potential ... and bring change to the community
