it would be easy to laugh off diesel 's prediction that his film " furious 7 " will win an oscars next year , but not for the reason you might think
" but rather than ignore it because it 's a glossy , blockbuster action film , some might argue that the movie goes against type for oscars nominated films because the cast is so diverse
" the lack of diversity was so glaring ( even with the mostly black cast of the movie " selma , " which received a nomination for best picture ) that it spurred the twitter hashtag " # oscarssowhite
the cast includes dwayne " the rock " johnson -- a samoan / black man -- black actors christopher " ludacris " bridges and tyrese gibson , hispanic performer michelle rodriguez , thai martial artist tony jaa , beninese expatriate djimon hounsou and the late paul walker , a blue - eyed , blond - haired california native
the filmmakers even went so far as to make sure casting directors in abu dhabi and dubai , where key scenes were filmed , found diverse extras
" we were mainly looking for the diverse look of the ( united arab emirates ) , " miranda davidson , owner of the casting company , told the national

ew points out that the film franchise is doing a much better job of reflecting its audience than others in hollywood
" despite the films ' cumulative worldwide gross of almost $ 2.4 billion , their racial inclusiveness remains an outlier ; american movies are still overwhelmingly white , " ew 's chris lee writes
diesel told ew the franchise has come a long way from the original 2001 film , which featured segregated gangs of racers pitted against each other
' that 's the beautiful thing about how the franchise has evolved
