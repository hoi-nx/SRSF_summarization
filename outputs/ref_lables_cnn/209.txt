was it politics or something else ? no one is sure , but the headstone of hillary clinton 's father , hugh rodham , was found tipped over this week , just a couple of days after she announced her run for the white house
" i pass here five , six times a day because i live two blocks from here and when i looked i could n't believe it , to see that it was tipped over
" mcgloin said he 's tended to the grave site at the washburn street cemetery in scranton , pennsylvania , since hugh rodham was buried there in 1993
" mcgloin believes it 's no coincidence that it happened within days of clinton announcing her second presidential bid
" and all of a sudden the headstone is tipped over , two days later , " he said
