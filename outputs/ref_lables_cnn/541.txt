geography is , in part , destiny for italian : the country will always be a bridge between east africa and europe , as the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the mediterranean so starkly shows
there is a backstory here worthy of our attention , and it has to do with italian 's colonial past
many of the refugees involved in recent disasters come from some of italian 's former colonies in north and east africa , namely eritreans ( occupied from 1890 - 1941 ) and somalis ( 1908 - 1941 )
as migrants , libyan are fewer in number , but libyan ( 1912 - 1941 ) plays a central role in the current crisis as the main departure point for italian
italian 's empire never rivaled that of the british and the french in scope and longevity , but those who lived in its possessions were no less affected
indeed , the migrants traversing the mediterranean today form part of a century - long chain of migrations , expulsions , and exiles sparked by italian 's imperial ambition and commercial interests , the post-colonial anger of african leaders , and now mass economic desperation and political strife
long after the formal end of italian colonialism , these eritreans , somalis , and libyan have inherited the histories of influence and exploitation that shaped their home countries
it also affects the treatment of african who settle in italian
this political intervention did not spell the end of italian - libyan commercial dealings , which grew out of colonial - era relations that had made libyan italian 's biggest oil supplier
since 2004 , italian and libyan have been directly connected by the greenstream natural gas pipeline , which runs below the mediterranean , on the same axis as many migrant boats
commercial concerns , and the cozy relationship of then - prime minister silvio berlusconi and gadhafi , also lay behind a historic 2008 friendship treaty between italian and libyan , which promised infrastructure and other aid to libyan worth the equivalent of $ 5 billion as compensation for the damages inflicted by italian during the decades of colonial rule
this colonial history and its long - term consequences can help us understand italian ' ambivalent reactions to the emergency on their southernmost shores
at 40 years old , italian prime minister matteo renzi is of a different generation than those who have sustained a politics of selective memory that is as dangerous in its own way for migrants as the boats now capsizing in the mediterranean
setting a new course on this issue is in italian 's interest , now more than ever .
