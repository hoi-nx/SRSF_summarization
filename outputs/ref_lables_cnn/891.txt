but to do it live on the internet ? with two hooves sticking out for several minutes in the midst of labor ? luckily , katie -- a giraffe at the dallas zoo -- is a champ
in an hour - long labor captured by 10 cameras and streamed live by animal planet , katie gave birth to a not - so - little baby ( about 6 feet tall ) early friday evening
but there were good signs , as seen on the live stream and dallas zoo 's twitter feed -- like its ears moving , its efforts to stand , and its nursing ( or at least trying to nurse ) from mom
the newcomer 's debut was a long time coming , especially when you count for katie 's 15 - month gestation period -- average for a giraffe , according to animal planet
but the giraffe definitely did have watchers in the form of fellow giraffes who saw the scene unfold from an abutting barn , one of them being katie 's bff jade
