so now the real trial is underway : what does the surviving boston marathon bomber , tsarnaev , deserve and why ? what 's he likely to get and why ? let 's start where the penalty phase starts , with the prosecution 's case
the prosecution 's emphasis : the killings involved " substantial planning and premeditation " and a betrayal of the u.s. -- the very country that gave tsarnaev shelter and citizenship
and then there 's tsarnaev 's lack of remorse -- opening day , the prosecutor 's final shot of tsarnaev locked up , giving the security camera the finger
tsarnaev may take the stand to beg for mercy , but only if he now feels or at least can fake remorse
no doubt tsarnaev regrets his present predicament , regrets the negative publicity he 's brought his friends and family and most poignantly regrets running over and killing his older brother while trying to escape
tsarnaev was the lesser of two evils , the defense will insist over and over
" so the defense will claim that tsarnaev was not fully responsible because he could not be
in 2005 , the u.s. supreme court struck down the death penalty for those younger than 18 when they killed , repeatedly quoting an article by psychologists laurence steinberg and elizabeth scott
if we can fully celebrate good character and heroic acts of our best young adults , why ca n't we fully condemn the cowardly viciousness of our worst ? what outcome would i predict in the tsarnaev case ? confronted by surviving victims and images of their dead loved ones , hearing offsetting pleas to " move on , " balancing the real suffering in the courtroom against the imagined punishment of life that awaits tsarnaev , i expect the jury will vote 10 - 2 ( or 9 - 3 ) for death
but they must be unanimous for death ; a lopsided but divided jury would result in a life sentence
worse , the historical record and headlines in the next day 's anti-death penalty news organizations will probably proclaim : " jury chooses life for the marathon bomber " -- even if overwhelmingly the people 's representatives were to vote for death as the more appropriate punishment
requiring a unanimous verdict for death gives the defense an enormous advantage -- one of many
why ? because in the end , we would much prefer that 1 or 10 or 20 convicted murderers who deserve to die instead live out their lives in the relatively nonpunitive condition of prison than one person who deserves to live be wrongly killed at the hands of the people
and yet , if we really commit ourselves to having the punishment fit the crime , if we rightly reserve the death penalty for the most heinous crimes and criminals , surely the boston marathon bomber stands among the worst of the worst .
