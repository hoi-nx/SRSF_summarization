and on cnn ireport , dozens of people have filed reports pleading for information that might help them locate their missing friends and relatives
the death toll in nepal is rising ; it has now surpassed more than 5,000
though the news is mostly heartbreaking and worrisome , there have been stories of survival , of families reconnecting with loved ones days after the disaster
the walk of survival after hearing about devastation in nepal , shadmann of bangladesh reached out to his nation 's embassy in nepal , made calls to old college contacts in south asia and posted pleas on social media to help find his younger sister tashnova
when the earthquake struck , she was getting ready for a group excursion , a canyon swing
but the worst part was the smell of rotting flesh , which permeated the air as she passed countless villages flattened by the quake
" tashnova hiked six hours through mountainous terrain toward nepal 's capital
she was able to connect with her family , nearly four days after the quake , from the airport in kathmandu while waiting for the next flight to bangladesh
she had n't showered or slept since before the quake
there was little information dr. carol pineda and her husband , macdonald , of massachusetts , were vacationing in nepal when the quake struck
he was prepared for the worst , knowing they were traveling to a himalayan base camp in nepal
he took to social media and started emailing and calling hiking groups that operated in nepal , but no one was getting back to him
but that was all the information he had , and he wanted to hear directly from his sister , so he took to twitter to see what other people were doing to track down loved ones
several strangers who were in the same location as the couple responded to his inquiries on social media , saying they were fine
" it was incredible to see people that were stranded themselves over there wanting to help me
only one phone call left parajuli , a nepal tour guide , was busy saturday morning , leading a tour group of 17 senior citizens -- nine u.s. , five canadians and three nepal -- from kathmandu to tibet
they had stopped for lunch at liping village , just near the border , when the magnitude 7.8 quake struck
thousands of miles away , in louisiana , jyotsna picked up that call
jyotsna learned from the u.s. embassy that a family had hired a private rescue team , working with the nepal army , to rescue the stranded tourists by helicopter , but the team was unable to land because of bad weather
