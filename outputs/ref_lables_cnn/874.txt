boy ? girl ? young ? old ? " the man on the phone was offering us young children with the casualness of a market trader
we 'd been put in touch with the man through a contact on the ground
we were told he was one of the men running this " unofficial " displaced camp -- one of the many that has mushroomed in the town of yola as the influx of people fleeing boko haram has grown beyond the capacity of the official camps
we 'd asked who had children available to " foster " -- a catch - all code word designed to conceal the true intent of those offering up the orphaned children
the man on the phone was the end result of those inquiries
when our colleague want to see them , he was shown a group of children and asked which one he wanted to take
the man picked up and began referring to me as " sister
" i told him we wanted to know what we 'd need to do , if we decided we did want to " foster " the children
no need for any pesky paperwork -- just a reassurance from me that the children , if i chose to take them , would " live in my heart
" if i could also then find it " in my heart " to donate to those still in the camp , then that would be " god 's work
" in spite of the harsh measures the nigeria government has put in place to punish human traffickers , by the government 's own admission , 8 million children are currently engaged in forced labor
at the camp where we finally met the man face to face , there was no attempt at subterfuge
we finally found a figure he did n't find funny -- $ 500
