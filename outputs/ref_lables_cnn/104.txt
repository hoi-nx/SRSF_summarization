after its name was booted from science books for more than a century , a new study suggests that the brontosaurus belongs to its own genera , and therefore deserves its own name
marsh first named the brontosaurus in 1879 , after he received 25 crates of bones discovered at como bluff , wyoming , according to the yale peabody museum of natural history
similar to , though not as large as the brontosaurus discovered a couple of years prior , marsh named the dinosaur , " brontosaurus , " or " thunder lizard
" brontosaurus had three sacral vertebrae in its hip region and brontosaurus had five , according to the museum 's website , so marsh gave the dinosaurs two different names
paleontologist elmer riggs concluded in 1903 that the brontosaurus was really a young brontosaurus , and therefore must go by that name , according to the museum
tschopp , a paleontologist at the nova university of lisbon , portugal , led this latest study , which took five years and included visits to 20 museums in europe and the united states to collect data
