president obama briefly met his cuban counterpart , raul castro , on friday night at a dinner for the dozens of latin american leaders convening in panama city for the summit of the americas
the two nations have barely been on speaking terms -- officially -- for more than 50 years
the meeting was so important that bernadette meehan , national security council spokesperson , issued a statement : " at the summit of the americas this evening , president obama and president raul castro greeted each other and shook hands
" cuban and the u.s. had endured a half - century of enmity , the tension worsened by the two nations being only 90 miles apart
obama spoke by phone wednesday with the cuban leader before heading to panama city
obama arrived in panama city late thursday for the conference , which in years past was tinged with animosity at cuban 's exclusion
moments after marine one , obama 's helicopter , touched down in panama city , raul castro 's plane landed on the same tarmac
during their phone call wednesday , obama and raul castro discussed the ongoing process of normalizing relations between the u.s. and cuban , according to deputy national security adviser rhodes
those run - ins will represent the highest - level talks between the u.s. and cuban since a meeting between then - vice president richard nixon and then - prime minister fidel castro in 1959
" the reason we 're here is that the president strongly believes that an approach that was focused totally on isolation , focused totally on seeking to cut off the cuban people from the u.s. had failed
in panama city , obama is expected to announce he 's removing cuban from the u.s. ' list of countries that sponsor terrorism , a major advance in building diplomatic ties between the two countries
" the overtures to cuban have not been universally popular in the u.s. ; some lawmakers were irate that obama was seeking to engage what they regard as a corrupt government
