in july of 2013 , the oldest of jesus relics stories rose again when turkish archaeologists discovered a stone chest in a 1,350 - year - old church that appeared to contain a piece of jesus ' cross
it is a piece of a cross , " said excavation team leader kã¶roälu , an art historian and archaeologist
the latest relic of the cross on which jesus had died stalled out because , as kã¶roälu later said , the box that had contained allegedly holy objects was now -- mysteriously -- empty
the latest episode of the " true cross , " a powerful identifier for the faith of more than two billion people , is symbolic of the pitfalls in the hunt for jesus relics
to say something smacks of the " true cross " can mean it 's a matter of divine certainty or of utter fraud
could fragments of the true cross of jesus really be among us today ? could fragments of a tree survive millennia ? or are they fragments of forgery that speak to our need to believe ? the true cross phenomenon begins with emperor constantine , the first roman emperor to convert to christianity
when helena traveled to jerusalem in 326 ce the city was still suffering the destruction caused by the last jewish war in 132 - 35 ce. after defeating israel , roman emperor hadrian built a pagan temple over jesus 's tomb near golgotha -- a grave insult to the new religion
the historian rufinus ( c. 340 - 410 ) reveals that in order to discern which cross was jesus ' , helena had a dying local woman brought to the site
the true cross of jesus had been revealed
" but was calvin exaggerating to support his own reforms to catholicism ? how could we ever know what the true cross was made of , or looked like , since neither the gospels -- nor the romans -- bothered to tell us ? enter science
in 1870 , french architect de fleury catalogued all known fragments of the true cross
he determined the jesus cross weighed 165 pounds , was three or four meters high , with a cross beam two meters wide
if all these bits of the cross were cobbled together , he reckoned , they would n't amount to a third of the cross on which jesus died
and based on the fragments he was allowed to examine by microscope , de fleury concluded the true cross was made of pine wood
later , four cross particles were also microscopically examined -- part of ten pieces of the true cross , accompanied by documentary proofs from byzantine emperors
these fragments came from grand european churches : santa croce in rome , notre dame in paris , and the cathedrals of pisa and florence
" today there are even more " true cross " fragments on display around the world : on mount athos , in rome , in brussels , in venice , in ghent , in paris , in spain , in serbia -- and even in boalsburg , pennsylvania , where a fragment of the true cross came along as part of the family chapel imported there and rebuilt by theodore boal for his french bride
mark goodacre , a professor at duke university 's department of religion , says that this continued emphasis on the genuineness of true cross fragments is often at the expense of the cross 's meaning
