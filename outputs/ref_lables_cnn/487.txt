when the earthquake hit , many of nepal 's most renowned pagodas in and around kathmandu crumbled into rubble - covered stumps
but the kathmandu valley 's other pagodas , stupas and shrines -- also built mostly of red brick hundreds of years ago -- suffered surprisingly little damage and remained standing next to structures which disappeared
the worst architectural losses have included the majestic shiva temple pagoda and its twin , the narayan temple pagoda , which dominated kathmandu 's main durbar square
from the late 1960s onwards , western hippy backpackers who traveled the legendary overland route to kathmandu would climb the shiva pagoda 's wide , nine - step plinth , sit in the shade under the triple - layered roofs , smoke hashish and enjoy the lofty view
the slightly shorter , triple - roofed narayan pagoda allowed vegetable sellers to display their foodstuff on the temple 's broad , five - level base
those two landmarks fronted the enclosed dwelling place of nepal 's hindu virgin goddess , or kumari , whose ornate front of bricks , statues and carved wood seem to have survived the initial quakes
on kathmandu 's outskirts the town of patan suffered terrible damage when its central durbar square lost several pagodas as structures pancaked straight down while others merely shook and cracked
several miles away from kathmandu , witnesses have been unable to immediately confirm the levels of destruction which have occurred in the lavish town of bhaktapur
there has been no news as yet on damage caused to other famous places of hindu and buddhist worship , including the hilltop swayambhunath temple on the outskirts of kathmandu
. the fate of the pashupatinath complex near kathmandu 's international airport is also not known
