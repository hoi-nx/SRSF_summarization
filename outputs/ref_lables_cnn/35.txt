he might have just won one of sport 's most prestigious events , but it was n't long before jordan spieth 's thoughts turned to his autistic sister in the glow of victory
the 21 - year - old golfer equaled tiger woods ' 1997 record winning score of 18 under par to realize his childhood ambitions of donning the green jacket on sunday as he swept through the field to become masters champion at augusta
an ice - cool display made him the second - youngest winner -- behind only woods , who was 155 days younger that year -- and only the fifth man to have led from start to finish over the tournament 's four days
" i miss her a lot , and i wish she could have been here , " jordan spieth told cnn 's don riddell in the aftermath of his triumph as he opened up about younger sibling ellie , who was not able to attend the tournament
" amid all the pressure of playing professional golf , jordan spieth 's 14 - year - old sister provides him with perspective
she 's an incredible sister , my biggest supporter
last year , jordan spieth lost the lead just before the nine - hole turn on the last day -- but he never looked like being denied this time , beating phil mickelson 's masters record of 26 birdies for good measure
" to sit with this jacket on and to be a part of the history of augusta national and the masters was something i watched slip away last year , " said jordan spieth , who described the reality of winning as " even better " than his dreams
" shown a picture of himself wearing one of the most coveted pieces of clothing in sport , jordan spieth , born in dallas , added : " putting on the jacket , it looks good
" the unassuming jordan spieth 's success brings to mind other stars whose supreme ability and self - belief saw them become major champions in the early days of their careers
in 1985 , german tennis player becker stunned wimbledon when , at the age of 17 , he defeated kevin curren to become the event 's youngest ever men 's champion -- a record that still stands today
" american player michael chang was 118 days younger than becker when he won the french open in 1989 , while swiss star martina hingis was just 16 when she triumphed at the 1997 australian open
for them , as for jordan spieth , perhaps success was meant to be from the earliest days
