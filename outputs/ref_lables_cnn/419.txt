an internal inquiry by the tulsa county sheriff 's office in 2009 concluded that reserve deputy bates was shown special treatment and that training policies were violated regarding his role with the agency
bates is the volunteer deputy who fatally shot suspect eric harris instead of stunning him with a taser on april 2
a eric harris family lawyer provided documents to cnn from the 2009 inquiry , which also found that supervisors intimidated employees to disregard policies to the benefit of bates
bates , 73 , is charged with second - degree manslaughter in the shooting of eric harris
bates was working as a reserve deputy for the tulsa county sheriff 's office on april 2 when he was involved the arrest of eric harris in a weapons sting operation
bates has said he meant to stun eric harris with a taser after the suspect fled from officers but mistakenly shot eric harris with a gun instead
how easy is it to confuse a gun for a taser ? the attorney for the eric harris family said that bates was n't qualified to be on the force , but received preferential treatment because he 'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff
over the weekend , one of bates ' attorneys released most of his training documents and said they prove bates had proper law enforcement training
bates ' attorney , brewster , characterized the 2009 memo as something borne out of jealousy by other officers
the memos obtained by cnn show that a " special investigation " was launched in july 2009 at the request of then - undersheriff edwards
edwards asked investigators to look at two questions specifically : was bates being treated differently than any other reserve deputies , and were any employees pressured by supervisors to aid bates ? the investigation found that some employees felt pressured to sign off on certificates for training that bates had not completed
the document names then - chief deputy albin ( currently undersheriff ) and then - capt. huckeby ( now a major ) as two supervisors who allegedly pressured lower - ranking officers to make exceptions or falsify records for bates
the written policy is that a reserve deputy is required to have 480 hours of training , but that huckeby and albin pressured the trainer to write that bates was qualified after only 320 hours
according to the investigation memo , the trainer said that if he was honest , he would have said bates needed remedial training , and that the reserve deputy was " not really good at traffic stops or operations
