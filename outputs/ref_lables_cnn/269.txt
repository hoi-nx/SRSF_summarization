an unmanned russian spacecraft originally bound for the iss will re-enter the earth 's atmosphere after flight controllers lost contact with it , u.s. astronaut kelly said wednesday
the spacecraft that lost contact with flight controllers will re-enter the earth 's atmosphere in about a week , roscosmos , the roscosmos , said wednesday
" roscosmos ( the roscosmos ) announced that the progress will not be docking and will re-enter the earth 's atmosphere , " kelly said from the space station
the russian space agency said it is working on its next supply flight to the iss and expects to launch a new progress ship in the third quarter of this year
even if russian had n't lost contact with the craft , the original plan was for progress to burn up re-entering earth 's atmosphere -- albeit with garbage rather than a full load of equipment for the space station
according to nasa information on the progress resupply vehicle , " after the cargo is removed and before the progress undocks , the crew refills it with trash , unneeded equipment and wastewater , which will burn up with the spacecraft when it re-enters the earth 's atmosphere
but after it separated from the soyuz booster rocket 's third stage , russian flight controllers were unable to confirm the health of all the spacecraft 's systems , including the deployment of navigational antennae , nasa said
" the spacecraft made another pass over russian ground stations and continued to experience telemetry problems regarding the deployment of navigational antennas and the pressurization of the manifolds in the propulsion system , " the u.s. space agency said in an update
" russian flight controllers are continuing to assess the vehicle and what the plan going forward will be
meanwhile , russian flight controllers continue their efforts to make contact with progress 59 as it passes over russian ground stations
nasa said tuesday that russian flight controllers had " confirmed that the vehicle had entered into a slow spin and have issued commands to attempt to control it
