jakarta an indonesia court has rejected a bid by two australian drug smugglers -- members of the " bali nine " -- to challenge their planned executions
andrew chan and myuran sukumaran are awaiting death by firing squad on indonesia 's " execution island " for their role in a failed 2005 heroin smuggling plot
a panel of three judges in the state administrative court in jakarta on monday confirmed an earlier ruling that it lacked the jurisdiction to hear challenges against president widodo 's refusal to grant clemency
one of the condemned men 's lawyers , leonard aritonang , said he was disappointed with the rulings but would respect the court 's decision
he said his team would file a further review , asking the constitutional court to explain widodo 's obligations regarding granting clemency
" australian has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair and has unsuccessfully proposed a prisoner swap with indonesia as a way of avoiding their deaths
indonesia has long taken a hard line on drug smugglers , and since assuming office in october , widodo has made it clear he intends to be tough on those found guilty of such crimes
" indonesia is in a drug emergency , so we need to have something that 's firm , " said widodo
andrew chan and myuran sukumaran have been jailed since april 2005 for a failed bid to smuggle more than 8 kilograms of heroin from bali to australian
andrew chan , 31 , was called the ringleader of the plot , while myuran sukumaran was described as andrew chan 's collaborator
opinion : why executions wo n't win indonesia 's drug war myuran sukumaran and andrew chan have become model prisoners during their time behind bars , according to fellow inmates and the jail 's chief warden
