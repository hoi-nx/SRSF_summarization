the reserve deputy who shot a suspect with his firearm rather than his stun gun , and another deputy who can be heard cursing at the suspect after he was shot , were not in their normal states of mind because of the elevated stress of apprehending the suspect , according to a tulsa , oklahoma , investigator
tulsa police sgt. clark , who has been brought in to review the case , said tulsa county reserve deputy bates , 73 , " inadvertently " shot harris after harris -- a possibly pcp - addled felon who had days prior sold methamphetamine to an undercover officer -- ran from authorities after trying to sell an illegal handgun during an undercover sting
he warned his fellow deputies he was going to use a taser on the suspect , but instead , he fired a single gunshot -- and immediately apologized , clark said , citing a recently released video
clark attributed bates ' actions to a phenomenon known as " slip and capture
the driver will press her or his left foot down when stopping abruptly , even though there 's no clutch pedal , he said
" bates announced that he was going to deploy his taser , and he pulled the trigger only once , as he was trained to do , clark said
the gun jumped out of bates ' hand because he was n't expecting recoil , clark said , and bates expressed surprise and remorse that he had shot harris
quoting lewinski again , clark said , " this is the slip and capture
... he was not conscious of this unfortunate switch until after the shot was fired
in his urgency , his concentration was focused exclusively on harris ' back , where he intended to place the taser darts
because of what 's called ' inattentional blindness , ' meaning that he was n't consciously paying attention to and registering it , he would n't have been aware that the feel of the gun was different from that of the taser
and in this case the weight of the gun and taser are nearly identical
" clark was emphatic that bates had done nothing criminally wrong and went so far as to say the reserve deputy was a victim
reserve deputy bates was a victim , a true victim of slip and capture , " he said
" there 's no other determination i could come to
but when they recorded the operation targeting harris earlier this month , cameras continued to roll as the suspect ran , and as he was fatally shot
an officer calls for a taser , but in place of an electric clicking sound , a gunshot rings out
a voice can be heard saying , " oh ! i shot him ! i 'm sorry ! " another officer screams out , " he shot him ! he shot him ! " harris , who is bleeding , calls out , too
he 's losing his breath , he says
clark defended the officer 's language , saying the deputy experienced auditory exclusion , never heard the gunshot and thought the suspect was out of breath from running
" one deputy thought he was going to have to shoot this person at the arrest site
it 's very upsetting when you think you are going to have to take someone 's life and this deputy , one of the involved deputies , was upset , " he said
they are going after a dangerous suspect that they have no idea whether or not this person is armed
" clark added , " they did not know that he was shot at this time
the officers did not know that mr. harris had been shot
shortly after the suspect is shot , the officers begin tugging harris ' hands behind his back as the video ends
harris later died at a local hospital
minutes earlier , harris had climbed into a truck cab , where an undercover officer had set up a camera on the dash to record the suspect
" what 's up ? " they greet each other cordially
someone calls , " taser ! taser ! " the gun discharges
bates , a former tulsa police officer , was placed on administrative leave after the shooting , the sheriff 's office has said
age is not really a factor in consideration for the dynamics behind slip and capture events
