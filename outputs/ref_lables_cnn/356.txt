ferguson , missouri [ breaking news update at 11:45 p.m. et ] two african - americans -- ella jones and bell -- were elected to the city council on tuesday , meaning three of the six council members are black
amid the rain , ferguson opened its polls at 6 a.m. for municipal elections that traditionally have drawn very few out to vote
this was the first city election since white police officer darren wilson shot and killed unarmed black teenager michael brown last august
since then , this st. louis suburb of 21,000 people has gone through epic upheaval with revelations of systemic discrimination against african - americans by law enforcement and the courts
there 's widespread feeling , especially in the african - u.s. community , that if the turnout is low , then all the protests , the investigations , the calls for change will have been in vain
st. louis elections officials said they had no indication that turnout in tuesday 's election would be any different than other years
" that is what our democracy is about , " said bell , a 40 - year - old lawyer and criminal justice professor who also is a part - time municipal judge in nearby velda city
that area includes canfield drive , where michael brown was killed , and the west florissant avenue business corridor that felt the brunt of the protests and the vandalism
charred , heavily damaged buildings stand as scars of ferguson 's despair and anger
both bell and smith are black , and no matter the outcome , one of them will double the african - u.s. representation on the council
even though 70 % of ferguson 's 21,000 people are black , five of the six current city council members and the mayor are white
mcclellan referred to the scathing report by the u.s. department of justice that found ferguson issued fines and traffic tickets to generate revenue for the city
" that 's not a good thing , " mcclellan said as he stood in the drizzle at a polling station , hoping to persuade voters who were still undecided
heidemann , a 67 - year - old retired airline pilot , said he voted for fletcher , a former mayor who launched the " i love ferguson " campaign last fall to raise money for mom and pop businesses that were hurt by the looting and vandalism
he said michael brown 's shooting brought a lot of bad things to light
at a church where voters from all three wards were casting ballots , he predicted a 40 - 50 % turnout
when the rain let up for a few minutes , a stream of voters trickled into the first presbyterian church in downtown ferguson to cast their votes
he said the couple moved to ferguson after he retired from the marine corps in 1995 because they felt it was a racially welcoming place
jackson echoed the thoughts of other ferguson residents who experienced something new in this election : candidates coming to their door
" fletcher , the former mayor turned city council candidate , campaigned that ferguson would benefit from his experience more than a newcomer , saying his contacts from almost three decades in politics would be an invaluable asset in getting ferguson back on its feet
