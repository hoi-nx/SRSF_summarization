in a sobering example of life imitating art , the chaos sweeping the streets of baltimore may have been partly inspired by a series of action - horror movies
baltimore police said rioting at a shopping mall and elsewhere monday afternoon started amid rumors , spread on social media , of a " purge " led by large groups of marauding high school students
the term appears to be a reference to 2013 's " the purge " and its sequel , last year 's " the purge : anarchy , " about a dystopian future america where on one day each year , all laws are suspended for a 12 - hour period and all crimes , including murder , become temporarily legal
scattered references to # purge and # thepurge began appearing in twitter and instagram posts monday about the unrest in baltimore .
