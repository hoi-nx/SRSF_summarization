if i had to describe the united states - iran relationship in one word it would be " overmatched
iran has no problem reconciling its bad and contradictory behavior while we twist ourselves into knots over our tough choices , all the while convincing ourselves that united states 's policy on the nuclear issue is on the right track
iran is n't 10 feet tall in this region , but by making the nuclear issue the be-all and end - all that is supposed to reduce iran 's power , the united states is only making teheran taller
consider the following : the united states - iran relationship is not symmetrical
iran is about to try a united states citizen and washington post reporter and we have made a judgment that even while we protest , we will keep the nuclear issue separated not just from this case but from iran 's serial abuse of human rights , including the behavior of its shia militias in iraq
if not , we 're legitimizing a bad regime and compromising united states values and interests in the process by not ensuring that all united states being held by iran come out as part of the nuclear deal
united states is alienating some of our closest allies because of the iran deal , and iran is picking up new ones and bolstering relations with old ones who are growing more dependent because they see iran 's power rising
we 're losing friends ; iran is gaining them
and in one of the cruelest ironies , iran 's way back into the global economy is as a result of the very issue that made it such a pariah : the nuclear issue
but in its zone of influence , a zone critical to the united states -- syria , iraq , the gulf of aden , yemen , lebanon -- it is expanding its influence , not contracting
indeed , it can use the threat of isis to keep the united states away from weakening their ally al-assad as well as expand its influence in iraq under the guise of fighting a battle of mutual interest
battle group naval assets to the gulf of aden notwithstanding , the united states is being outfoxed , not outgunned
do n't expect united states ships to stop those of iran
" it clearly makes sense to try to use diplomacy as a way to constrain iran 's nuclear program
one of the reasons the united states wo n't strike al-assad is for fear of emboldening isis , but the other is that we do n't want a proxy war with iran in syria
as the russians have made clear in their recent s - 300 deal , the nuclear negotiations are only making iran a more acceptable business partner
