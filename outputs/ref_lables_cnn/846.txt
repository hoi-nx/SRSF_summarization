the american military said this week it has made great progress in its effort to develop a self - steering bullet
in february , the " smart bullets " -- .50 - caliber projectiles equipped with optical sensors -- passed their most successful round of live - fire tests to date , according to the darpa , or darpa
" true to darpa 's mission , exacto has demonstrated what was once thought impossible : the continuous guidance of a small - caliber bullet to target , " said dunn , darpa program manager
fitting exacto 's guidance capabilities into a small .50 - caliber size is a major breakthrough and opens the door to what could be possible in future guided projectiles across all calibers , " dunn said
darpa says the smart bullets will also help shooters who are trying , for example , to hit targets in high winds
the goals of the exacto program are giving shooters accuracy at greater distances , engaging targets sooner and enhancing the safety of american troops , darpa said .
