when etan patz went missing in new york at age 6 , hardly anyone in united states could help but see his face at their breakfast table
his photo 's appearance on milk cartons after his may 1979 disappearance marked an era of heightened awareness of crimes against children
on friday , more than 35 years after frenzied media coverage of his case horrified parents everywhere , a new york jury will again deliberate over a possible verdict against the man charged in his killing , pedro hernandez
he confessed to police three years ago
etan patz 's parents have waited that long for justice , but some have questioned whether that is at all possible in pedro hernandez 's case
pedro hernandez told police in a taped statement that he lured patz into a basement as the boy was on his way to a bus stop in lower manhattan
police interrogated pedro hernandez for 7Â½ hours before he confessed
but in november , a new york judge ruled that pedro hernandez 's confession and his waiving of his miranda rights were legal , making the confession admissible in court
another man 's name has also hung over the patz case for years -- ramos , a convicted child molester acquainted with etan 's babysitter
a judge found ramos responsible for the boy 's death and ordered him to pay the family $ 2 million -- money the patz family has never received
since their young son 's disappearance , the patzes have worked to keep the case alive and to create awareness of missing children in the united states
in the early 1980s , etan 's photo appeared on milk cartons across the country , and news media focused in on the search for him and other missing children
