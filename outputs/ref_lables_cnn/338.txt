the powers of marvel 's all - star superheroes go a bit wobbly in " avengers : age of ultron
" faced with the daunting prospect of topping the surprise and excitement of 2012 's avengers , the third highest - grossing film of all time , writer - director joss whedon mixes some brooding down - time in with the abundant spectacle
to be sure , series junkies will get their fix from the sheer massiveness of the exploits , but at least two of the big action scenes are lackluster , while the climax and resolution could have been worked out in more complex , less rote ways , so as to further increase intrigue and anticipation for " avengers : infinity war parts 1 and 2 , " already scheduled for release in may of 2018 and 2019 , respectively
hands - on producer kevin feige and his associates have built a cinematic empire quite unprecedented in hollywood history , a veritable solar system of staggeringly profitable individual franchises unified by the overpowering collective force of the avengers
and so it is with " avengers : age of ultron , " which at moments takes a peek down some shadowy side roads but ends up mostly zooming along the main highway to deliver what the audience wants rather than something even a little bit different
picking up where last year 's " captain america : winter soldier " left off , the new film , without preamble , dives right in to show the avengers dispatching the remnants of the nasty hydra organization in a hectically and indifferently staged forest combat scene that leaves hawkeye / hawkeye ( jeremy renner ) worse for wear while also introducing two new adversaries , twins pietro and wanda ( aaron-taylor johnson and elizabeth olsen )
victory allows for some passably amusing scenes of the heroes blowing off steam : the favorite party trick of thor ( chris hemsworth ) is to challenge all comers to lift up his hammer ; natasha / black widow ( scarlett johansson ) and bruce / bruce ( mark ruffalo ) pursue a little mating dance in which her amorous interest is predicated upon his retaining his human rather than superhero form ; and stark / stark ( robert downey jr. ) and captain america / captain america ( chris evans ) take stock of the advances their old nazi nemesis strucker ( thomas kretschmann ) appears to be making in the artificial intelligence department , specifically with the most sophisticated humanoid ever devised , ultron ( voiced with marvelous robotic nuance by james spader )
what 's behind warner bros. ' risky move to release nine movies ultron is a cool and sophisticated creation ; what he lacks , of course , is a heart , which is what makes him such an imposing villain
he 's not yet entirely ready to conquer the universe but , in their first skirmish with him , the avengers are sufficiently outclassed to begin worrying
could ' star wars ' open at $ 500 million ? licking their wounds at the " safe house " of hawkeye 's farm , the avengers go into a funk
but , then , what does that matter when the automatic attendance of millions is assured ? " avengers : age of ultron " succeeds in the top priority of creating a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do , but this time the action scenes do n't always measure up and some of the characters are left in a kind of dramatic no - man 's - land
