film critic corliss , whose populist passion for all genres of movies illuminated time magazine 's coverage of cinema for 35 years , died thursday night in new york city
corliss died a week after suffering a major stroke , according to a tribute on time magazine 's website by colleague zoglin , who called him " perhaps the magazine 's most quoted writer of all time
" unlike some critics , corliss appreciated all kinds of movies -- from the arty drama of ingmar bergman to the epic fantasy of " the lord of the rings
" his all - time top 100 movies list , which he compiled with fellow time magazine critic richard schickel , contained everything from " pulp fiction " to " finding nemo " to jackie chan 's " drunken master ii. " " he savored it all : the good , the bad , the indifferent
" a graceful and prolific writer , corliss reviewed more than 1,000 movies , penned many time magazine cover stories and authored four books on film , including " mom in the movies : the iconic screen mothers you love ( and a few you love to hate ) , " published just last year
born in philadelphia , corliss moved to new york city after college and began writing film reviews for a variety of publications before joining time magazine in 1980
" it 's painful to try to find words , since corliss was such a master of them , " time magazine editor nancy gibbs wrote in a note friday to her staffers
" he is survived by his wife , mary , a noted film critic in her own right , whom he married in 1969
