it 's a warm afternoon in miami , and 35 - year - old vega has come to baptist health primary care for a physical exam
vega is one of more than 44 million americans who is taking part in a medical ritual : visiting the doctor for an annual physical exam
as long as everything checks out , caruso asks vega to return for another exam in a year
it was a positive experience for both doctor and patient , and they 're not alone ; 92 percent of americans say it is important to get an annual head - to - toe physical exam , according to a kaiser health news poll ( khn is an editorially independent program of the foundation )
and 62 percent of those polled said they went to the doctor every year for their exam
" i would argue that we should move forward with the elimination of the annual physical , " says dr. mehrotra , a primary care physician and a professor of health policy at harvard medical school
mehrotra says patients should really only go to the doctor if something is wrong , or if it 's time to have an important preventive test like a colonoscopy
" when i , as a doctor , say i do not advocate for the annual physical , i feel like i 'm attacking moms and apple pie , " mehrotra says
" but he says randomized trials going back to the 1980s just do n't support it
the society for general internal medicine even put annual physicals on a list of things doctors should avoid for healthy adults
it 's called a false positive , and it can lead to a cascade of follow - up tests that can be expensive and could even cause real harm
" i generally do n't like to frighten people and i do n't like to give them diseases they do n't have , " rothberg says
' " " the flip side of that is if you 're not feeling well , do n't keep it to yourself
do n't pretend it 's not there , " he adds
rothberg says he still has patients who always schedule an annual exam
for those patients , he skips the physical aspects of the exam and focuses instead on talking to them about their dietary and exercise habits , possible risks , age - appropriate vaccinations and any screening tests they may need
" back in miami , caruso is also well versed in the research on annual physicals , but he still believes in them
it 's an important part of developing a relationship with a patient , he says , and there have been countless times when he 's found real problems during an exam just like the one he gave to vega
