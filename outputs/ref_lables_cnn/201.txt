tokyo a crowd gathers near the entrance of tokyo 's upscale mitsukoshi department store , which traces its roots to a kimono shop in the late 17th century
fitting with the store 's history , the new greeter wears a traditional japan kimono while delivering information to the growing crowd , whose expressions vary from amusement to bewilderment
it 's hard to imagine the store 's founders in the late 1600 's could have imagined this kind of employee
that 's because the greeter is not a human -- it 's a robot
chihira is an android manufactured by toshiba , designed to look and move like a real person
it was put on temporary display at the department store
a growing number of japan businesses are testing out robots as a possible solution to the country 's shrinking workforce
japan has an aging population that has prompted serious talks about how to incorporate robots into the nation 's shrinking workforce
one group that seems willing to embrace robots are japan 's senior citizens
in a nation with a dwindling population , waning workforce , and deep resistance to immigration , it seems robots will only play a larger role in japan 's future .
