the cubans that photographer sandretto captures is a world away from the images of neon 1950s american cars and postcard - worthy white sand beaches that most visitors to the island bring back home
instead sandretto focuses on " solares , " the crumbling buildings that many cubans divide and cohabitate , often with several generations and separate families sharing one dwelling
following fidel castro 's 1959 revolution , houses and apartments were redistributed throughout cubans and the government promised that everyone would have a home in the new socialist utopia
but building did not keep pace with the population , and cubans were forced to adapt by dividing and re-dividing up homes to make room
" sandretto said she first visited cubans three years ago and was instantly hooked
gaining entrance to the maze - like solares was a constant negotiation , sandretto said , and plenty of times she was turned away
i speak spanish , which helps but not a lot because you have to speak ' cubans , ' which is another language
" her persistence allowed her to capture intimate moments of cubans resting in the sweltering heat , crowding around a communal tv or just going about life despite their disintegrating surroundings
the people in these solares are n't the fortunate cubans who have relatives visiting from miami with flat - screens and smartphones in tow
the thawing in relations could even change life in cubans 's solares
