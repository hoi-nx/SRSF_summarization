last week , california gov. brown ordered mandatory statewide restrictions on water use for the first time in the state 's history
california developed the infrastructure and system of legal rights it uses to distribute water at a time when the population was much smaller than it is today -- and when the climate was in an unusually wet phase , historically speaking
brown 's measures may be temporary , but we can hope that they 'll be a step toward a more permanent reformation of the state 's water distribution system -- one that includes large agricultural users , who are not included in the current measures , although they are the dominant consumers of california 's water
how the drought affects rest of the nation what california does now has global significance : lack of clean fresh water is a serious problem in much of the world
they also presented strong evidence that the syrian drought was in part attributable to human - induced climate change -- in itself , another physical constraint the planet places on growth
is the california drought a consequence of climate change ? a recent national oceanic and atmospheric administration report for which my colleague richard seager was lead author , argued that it is n't ( though the authors acknowledge that global warming makes the drought worse by increasing evaporation from the soil )
we know that human - induced climate change is increasing the risk that an event such as this will happen , while at the same time we ca n't strongly blame climate change for the specific event happening right now
extreme weather events make people aware that we are all vulnerable to them , and media coverage can draw attention to the scientific evidence that climate change is increasing the risks
though the role of greenhouse gases in that drought was n't clear either , the hardship nonetheless made australians much more concerned about climate change than u.s. were at the time
but being able to blame climate change for a specific extreme weather event should n't be the only thing to spur action on reducing greenhouse gases
whether we 're talking about a drought in california , a hurricane on the east coast , a flood in the midwest or a tornado outbreak on the plains , the connection of a single event to climate change is likely to be the subject of legitimate scientific controversy
the scientific case that human emissions of greenhouse gases are changing the climate , and that these changes pose serious risks to humans and other species , does n't rest on single - event attribution , but rather on the statistics of large sets of weather events
and when it comes to our getting better prepared for the degree of climate change that is inevitable , in many cases it matters even less to what extent a given weather event was human - induced vs. natural
because really extreme events are by definition rare , most places have n't seen the worst nature can deliver , even without climate change , in their recent histories
many of the measures we need to take to close that gap -- such as making california 's water distribution system less wasteful , or new york 's subways more flood - proof -- will also help to prepare us for the new climates to come
