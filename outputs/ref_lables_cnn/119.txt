that 's some rich " american pie
" the lyrics to the famed mclean song sold for $ 1.2 million tuesday morning at an auction held by christie 's
" mclean 's manuscript of ' american pie ' achieved the 3rd highest auction price for an american literary manuscript , a fitting tribute to one the foremost singer - songwriters of his generation , " christie 's 's tom lecky said in a statement
mclean has said that the opening lines were inspired by the death of buddy holly , but after that , it 's all been conjecture -- which has n't stopped a marching band 's worth of analysts from trying to parse the symbols in the 8 - minute , 33 - second opus
is the jester bob dylan ? the football game vietnam ? the " girl who sang the blues " janis joplin ? ( one thing 's certain : buddy holly 's plane was not named " american pie
" ) " over the years i 've dealt with all these stupid questions of ' who 's that ? ' and ' who 's that ? ' " mclean said
the song hit no. 1 in early 1972 , despite its length
it includes lines that did n't make the final version as well as extensive notes -- all of which should be revealing , mclean said
