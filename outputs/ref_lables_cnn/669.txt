if there was ever any doubt that the obama administration 's clean power plan is an energy policy plan , not a carbon reduction plan , all you have to do is look at how they treat nuclear energy
nuclear is our largest source of carbon - free energy , generating over 60 % of our carbon - free electricity
surely president obama 's climate plan , allegedly aimed at reducing the u.s. ' overall carbon emissions , would revitalize the nuclear industry , lead to increased plant construction and help meet aggressive carbon reduction targets
james hansen , the former head of nasa 's goddard institute for space studies , said in 2013 that " continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity 's ability to avoid dangerous climate change
" yet wednesday , the white house will celebrate earth day and promote its work to fend off climate change , while strategically ignoring its largest tool to cut carbon emissions -- nuclear energy -- as well as the warning of one of the administration 's favorite climate scientists
despite the fact that nuclear power is carbon - free , the obama administration 's energy policy plan is biased against it
this bias is created by how epa credits nuclear power in its models of both current emissions and plan implementation
using epa 's own data , the graduate students showed that epa 's energy policy plan creates incentives for states to shut down nuclear power plants and replace them with natural gas combined cycle plants
where did this policy shift come from ? at a recent hearing in the environment and public works committee , mary nichols , chairman of the california air resources board , told congress that epa looked at california 's california global warming solutions act when developing its so - called clean power plan and that epa 's plan adopts the same policy choices -- limited credit for either nuclear or hydropower -- both of which are carbon - free
thus , epa is assuming legislative powers and is making policy choices that favor some forms of carbon - free energy over others
even though existing nuclear plants generate carbon - free electricity , the executive order does not allow agencies to take credit for emission reduction from nuclear energy unless it is energy from small modular reactors
but the clean power plan and the president 's recent executive order demonstrate that the obama administration is neither serious about reducing carbon emissions nor pursuing an all - of - the - above energy strategy
