mercedes driver and f1 championship leader hamilton stole pole position for sunday 's chinese grand prix from teammate and fierce rival rosberg in dramatic fashion
hamilton took first place on the front row on the last lap , beating rosberg by a slim four hundredths of a second margin
frenemies the two former friends have enjoyed , or rather endured , a heated rivalry since falling out last season and rosberg 's annoyance at hamilton 's last ditch success was obvious
the german appeared upset as he left his car and refused to shake hamilton 's hand
" i do n't actually mind him having more ( poles ) , " a nonplussed hamilton told afp after the session
" " i am frustrated " in the post qualifying press conference rosberg appeared more magnanimous , but still shocked by hamilton 's last minute burst of speed
" kimi raikkonen will join his teammate vettel on the second row and will be looking for a repeat of ferrari 's performance in malaysia , which shocked mercedes and hamilton in particular
