the number of new hiv infections in a rural indiana county has grown , according to the cdc
the institute is working with state health leaders to control the " severe outbreak , " which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called opana
the outbreak has been ongoing since mid-december
as of friday , 142 people have tested positive for hiv , with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results , all in rural scott county and jackson counties
this is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people
the cdc and state health leaders held a news conference friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from iv drug use , especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources
scott county , the epicenter of the outbreak , has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease , but the doctor is not an hiv specialist , the department of health said
since the rampant hiv outbreak was first noticed in mid-december , the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources
indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in march
in the 1980s , doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new hiv infections among iv drug users , and that figure has been down 90 % nationally , he said
indiana gov. mike pence also signed a 30 - day executive order that allows for a needle exchange
" many family members , across generations , live in the same house and will use the drugs together as " a community activity , " duwve said
health leaders worry about the spread of hiv and other diseases such as hepatitis c around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown
" the situation in indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down , " mermin said
