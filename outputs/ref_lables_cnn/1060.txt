after years of making the case that the education of athletes is paramount , the ncaa now says it has no legal responsibility to make sure education is actually delivered
on its website , the ncaa prominently states , " it 's our commitment -- and our responsibility -- to give young people opportunities to learn , play and succeed
" but the ncaa is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former unc athletes
the lawsuit claimed the students did n't get an education because they were caught up in the largest known academic fraud scandal in ncaa history
in its response , the ncaa says it has no legal responsibility " to ensure the academic integrity of the courses offered to student - athletes at its member institutions
" even with pages of online information about academic standards , and even though the ncaa has established a system of academic eligibility and accountability that it boasts of regularly , ncaa attorneys wrote in this court filing that " the ncaa did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of the education of student - athletes , " and " the ncaa does not have ' direct , day - to - day , operational control ' " over member institutions like unc
" the ncaa referred calls for comment to an online statement , which read in part : the ncaa believes that the lawsuit misunderstands the ncaa 's role with respect to its member schools and ignores the myriad steps the ncaa has taken to assist student - athletes in being equipped to excel both in the classroom and on the playing field
" this case is troubling for a number of reasons , not the least of which is that the law does not and has never required the ncaa to ensure that every student - athlete is actually taking full advantage of the academic and athletic opportunities provided to them , " said donald remy , ncaa chief legal officer
willingham , the unc whistleblower turned ncaa critic , has for years said that athletes across the country are accepted to colleges even though they 're academically underprepared and then pushed into classes where little work is required
" why do we go through the trouble of compliance if we ca n't legitimize that the courses are real and the education is real anyway ? it makes no sense , " said willingham , who recently wrote a book about the unc scandal called " cheated
" the ncaa 's claim that it 's hands - off when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years , not just in the rhetoric on its website , but in speeches by its president , mark emmert , and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuits over paying athletes
in response , the ncaa said that what sets college sports apart from pros is education : consistent with " its commitment to amateurism , member institutions conduct their athletics programs for students who choose to participate in intercollegiate athletics as a part of their educational experience and in accordance with ncaa bylaws
" attorney michael hausfeld , who represented both o'bannon and now the unc athletes , said this : " this startling inconsistency is unfortunately all too symptomatic of the ncaa 's shifting rhetoric and faltering commitment to its college athletes
" unc , which was also sued , has admitted to the fraud , but also asked for a judge to throw out the case , saying the athletes waited too long -- seven years -- to sue and the " educational malpractice " theory does n't apply
in fact , in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of a player who died in 2011 , the ncaa wrote : " the ncaa denies that it has a legal duty to protect student - athletes
