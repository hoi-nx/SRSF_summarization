kim is 89 now , and is going blind and deaf
the nightmares from five years as a sex slave of the japanese army , from 1940 onwards , are still crystal clear
kim is determined to share her story with anyone who will listen , until she 's no longer physically able
before i die , " kim says
kim was a 14 - year - old girl when the japanese came to her village in south korea
" if we did n't go , we 'd be considered traitors , " instead of going to a sewing factory , kim says she ended up in japanese military brothels in half a dozen countries
kim describes seemingly endless days of soldiers lined up outside the brothel , called a " comfort station
" kim estimates each japanese soldier took around three minutes
kim says it was dehumanizing , exhausting , and often excruciating
kim believes the years of physical abuse took a permanent toll on her body
" when i started , the japanese military would often beat me because i was n't submissive , " kim says
" kim is part of an ngo called the " korean council for the women drafted for military sexual slavery by japanese , " which is fighting for an apology
some japanese prime ministers have personally apologized in the past , but the ngo director believes that it 's not nearly enough
kim 's story matches testimony from other so - called " comfort women
" in washington , dc , as japanese prime minister abe conducts a state visit to the u.s. , former korean sex slave lee yong - soo makes a tearful plea to him , demanding an official apology for japanese 's sexual enslavement of an estimated 200,000 comfort women , mostly korean and chinese
they fear his government is trying to whitewash the past , to appease conservatives who feel comfort women were paid prostitutes , not victims of official military policy
" when it comes to the comfort women sex slave system , it is pretty much unique to japanese
but in the japanese case it was large scale , and state - sponsored , essentially , " says nakano , a professor of political science at tokyo 's sophia university
nakano points out that , since abe first came to office his government has succeeded in removing references to " comfort women " from many japanese school textbooks
it 's part of what critics call japanese 's track record of glossing over its war crimes
and in a way , the japanese government risks a second rape by discrediting their testimonies and treating ( their experiences ) as if they were lies , " nakano says
" " they feel there 's some sort of a plot by other asian countries to sully the japanese name to their advantage
" with abe 's historic visit to the u.s. just months before the 70th anniversary of the end of world war two , kim wants president obama to pressure his key asian ally to do more to acknowledge history
