after more than nine years of traveling through the solar system , nasa 's new horizons spacecraft has sent back its first color image of pluto
the initial picture released on tuesday shows a couple of orange - tinged blobs : pluto and its largest moon , charon
but the probe will soon be beaming back much sharper images and a wealth of other information about pluto 's remote , unexplored corner of the solar system
discovered in 1930 , pluto was once considered to be the smallest planet in the solar system
at 3.6 billion miles out in the solar system , it 's about 40 times as far from the sun as earth is
by discovering more about pluto and its moons , new horizons will shed light on a little - known third zone of the solar system , beyond the rocky planets and the gas giants
