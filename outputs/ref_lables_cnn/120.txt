a 110 - day cat - and - mouse chase spanning from antarctica waters to the coast of west africa had an unlikely end when the crew of an alleged poaching vessel were rescued by conservationists pursuing them
environmentalist group sea shepherd had been tailing the thunder -- subject of an interpol " purple notice " for suspected fraud and fisheries - related crimes -- since its ship the bob barker encountered it in the southern ocean several months ago
" we were literally a few hundred meters away ; they said the ship was sinking and they were abandoning the thunder , " said sea shepherd spokesman burling
" bob barker captain sea shepherd said the crew rescued from the ship had been handed over to the sao tome coastguard early tuesday
" we obviously want to see the captain of the thunder prosecuted for his offenses , " he told cnn by phone from the bob barker , at sea to the west of sao tome
hammarstedt said he believed the thunder was deliberately sunk to destroy physical evidence of illegal fishing
" i 'm 100 % confident that the captain of the thunder destroyed his own ship , " he said
more surprising was the reaction of the captain of the thunder as his ship went under , he claimed
" when the vessel went completely under the water , the captain of the thunder , who was in a life raft at the time , started cheering and applauding , which was very unusual behavior for a skipper who had just lost his ship , " he said
the pursuit of the thunder began after the bob barker encountered the vessel off the coast of antarctica , said burling
he claimed the vessel was found with its nets in the water , illegally catching patagonian toothfish
the thunder dropped its nets and left the scene ; a second sea shepherd vessel that was brought in to retrieve the net found about $ 3 million of toothfish catch in about 72km of illegal gillnet , he claimed
meanwhile the bob barker , supported by a second sea shepherd vessel , pursued the thunder all the way to the gulf of guinea
during that time , burling claimed , the bob barker narrowly avoided being rammed by the fishing vessel , while its smaller boats were struck with grappling hooks
