the stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of siberia
the fires were started in southeastern siberia , by farmers burning grass in their fields
however , the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds
the winds carried the smoke from siberia across the pacific ocean and brought it to the pacific northwest
the reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens , blues , yellows and purples , komo-tv said
as the smoke starts to dissipate , air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue .
