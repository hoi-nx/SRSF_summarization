recently , kennedy was in sacramento , california , to campaign against senate bill 227 , which makes it harder for parents to opt out of vaccinations
in his remarks at an anti-vaccination movie screening , he decided to compare " vaccine - induced " autism to the holocaust
he said , " they get the shot , that night they have a fever of a hundred and three , they go to sleep , and three months later their brain is gone , " kennedy said
" a few days later , he apologized to people who were outraged on behalf of the memory of the holocaust
in a statement , kennedy said , " i want to apologize to all whom i offended by my use of the word to describe the autism epidemic
" kennedy has apologized for the wrong things
first and foremost , vaccines do not cause autism
second , he seems to think people with autism are " gone , " their lives " destroyed " and their families " shattered
people with autism are not missing or destroyed
kennedy 's rhetoric is a problem , even beyond the fraudulent basis for his claims about vaccines
people who believe autism is an environmental disease try to cure kids with quack treatments like giving them bleach - based enemas
ne'eman , president of the autistic self-advocacy network , wrote , " kennedy , who has engaged with autism only to spread lies , misinformation and dehumanizing rhetoric , has never meaningfully engaged in efforts to improve the lives of autistic americans
not only is kennedy perpetuating a discredited theory , but he 's also suggesting that it 's better to let your children get preventable and sometimes fatal diseases than risk becoming autistic
" as children , sequenzia and frost might well have been just the kinds of people labeled as " gone , " by kennedy
" i wish kennedy realized how much his apology demeaned people with intellectual disabilities , even as he defended the sacred status of the holocaust
there is , though , one story from the holocaust that he might do well to consider
kennedy owes a lot of people another apology .
