prison life wo n't be pretty for aaron hernandez , the former nfl player and convicted murderer sentenced to life without parole
after correction officers evaluate him , he will be shipped to massachusetts ' flagship maximum - security prison , one of the most high - tech jails in the united states with no history of breakouts : the souza-baranowski correctional center in shirley , about 40 miles outside downtown boston
it 's called souza , for short , and it 's the state 's newest prison , opened in 1998 , with a matrix of 366 cameras recording live 24 hours a day and a microwave detection perimeter with taut wire
that 's the maximum - security facility , " department of corrections spokesman duarte said
legal advocates for inmates describe souza as sterile and violent at once
one stubborn problem is that opiates are smuggled to inmates , the legal advocates said
" it 's very shiny and clean looking and very sterile , " said leslie walker , executive director of prisoners ' legal services of massachusetts , who has been visiting the souza prison about every six weeks for the past 15 years and serves indigent prisoners there
" officials said aaron hernandez , 25 , is being processed at the maximum - security massachusetts correctional institution-cedar junction in walpole , just a handful of miles from gillette stadium , where he once played tight end for the new england patriots under a five - year $ 40 million contract
the prison system has yet to determine where to initially place aaron hernandez in souza : solitary confinement ; the less harsh but restricted block ; the general population ; a privileged section known as the " lifers block , " for those serving a life sentence ; or the " kitchen block , " for those who work in the prison kitchen
" at this point in time , we will figure out where he belongs in the population once the processing of aaron hernandez is complete , " duarte said
" aaron hernandez was sent immediately for processing after wednesday 's sentencing and jury conviction , duarte said
a news outlet helicopter followed aaron hernandez 's transfer to mci cedar junction
prison officials will be concerned about aaron hernandez 's safety and whether any enemies , gangs or headline - seeking inmates will try to hurt aaron hernandez , who will become souza 's most famous resident
" the good news is that the superintendent of souza-baranowski is very smart and thorough and a decent human being , who i 'm sure will do everything he can to keep mr. aaron hernandez safe , " walker added
because of his celebrity , aaron hernandez may find himself signing autographs for other inmates and even guards , said levine , a former federal inmate who spent 10 years in high - and minimum - security prisons
in the long run , however , it may not matter much in what section of the prison aaron hernandez does his time
about 90 % of the inmates in the maximum - security prison are locked in their cells for 19 hours a day , said walker , the legal advocate
souza has slightly larger cells than most other massachusetts prisons , but not by much , walker said
" there 's very little to do , " walker said of inmate life
