ever had a headache so big , you felt like drilling a hole in your head to let the pain out ? in neolithic times trepanation -- or drilling a hole into the skull -- was thought to be a cure for everything from epilepsy to migraines
obsidian -- a type of volcanic glass -- can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels
when you consider that most household razor blades are 300 - 600 angstroms , obsidian can still cut it with the sharpest materials nano - technology can produce
even today , a small number of surgeons are using an ancient technology to carry out fine incisions that they say heal with minimal scarring
dr. lee green , professor and chair of the department of family medicine at the university of alberta , says he routinely uses obsidian blades
" he explained that steel scalpels at a microscopic level have a rough cutting edge that tears into tissue , a function of the crystals that make up the metal
obsidian , meanwhile , cleaves into a fine and continuous edge when properly cut
dr. green said he once helped documentary makers produce a program on surgical technology in ancient egyptian , setting up a blind test on the cutting power of obsidian
" under the microscope you could see the obsidian scalpel had divided individual cells in half , and next to it the steel scalpel incision looked like it had been made by a chainsaw
" in germany , the manufacturer fine science tools produces obsidian scalpels which can be used in situations where the patient may have an allergy to steel or metal
" for studies where trace metals from ordinary scalpel blades can not be tolerated , these very special obsidian scalpels may provide the answer , " the company says
but there has been little academic research into the efficacy of obsidian blades compared to steel scalpels , and they do have disadvantages : obsidian scalpels are not fda ( fda ) approved , and they are extremely brittle and prone to breaking if lateral forces are applied -- meaning they are unlikely to ever be in widespread use
