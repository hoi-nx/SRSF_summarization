the listeria outbreak that prompted blue bell to recall their entire product line dates to 2010 , according to the cdc
the cdc recommends consumers do not eat any blue bell brand products
three people in kansas have died in the past year and 10 people in four states have fallen ill from the bacteria believed to have come from blue bell products , the cdc said tuesday
one person became sick in arizona , five in kansas , one in oklahoma and three in texas , the cdc said
people first became sick in january 2010 , the cdc said
the agency connected patients from 2010 - 2015 to the current outbreak through comparisons to a database of bacteria dna
the origin of the strain is still unknown , but " the fact that it was the same strain over the last five years suggests it could have lurked somewhere in the factory the whole time , " said dr. tauxe , deputy director of the cdc division of foodborne , waterborne and environmental diseases
tauxe said there may be more people sickened by listeria than the cdc knows about
the " rough estimate " is one more case exists for every case the cdc hears about , he said
" if tomorrow someone found another completely different pattern from ( blue bell ) ice cream products , we 'd be looking to see if there were related cases to that as well
" blue bell decided to yank all its products after tests showed some half - gallon containers of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream contained listeria
" this means blue bell has now had several positive tests for listeria in different places and plants , " the company said in a written statement
listeria : what is it , how do you get it , and what 's the risk ? listeria did n't get into ice cream through the milk because blue bell uses pasteurized milk , dewaal , director of food safety for center for science in the public interest , told cnn on tuesday
" dewaal said the listeria probably was n't linked to blue bell in 2010 because one case would n't spark a full investigation
the kansas department of health and environment said three people in the state died from listeria there over the past year , possibly due to blue bell products
four of them drank milkshakes at the hospital made with blue bell ice cream , the cdc said
it 's not clear whether the fifth patient at the kansas hospital had also consumed blue bell ice cream
tests of those listeria strains " were nearly identical to listeria strains isolated from ice cream produced at the blue bell ' oklahoma facility , " the cdc said
in march , blue bell recalled 3 - ounce cups of chocolate , vanilla and strawberry ice cream after a test found listeria in one of the cups in kansas
blue bell ceo and president kruse promised to make sure all products are safe before they go back on sale
" we are heartbroken about this situation and apologize to all of our loyal blue bell fans and customers
