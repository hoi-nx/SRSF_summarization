kathmandu , nepal we came on a commercial flight to kathmandu
whether they did is unclear
but there 's no way to get out , really
there were torrential rainstorms for a couple of hours , and with the strong aftershock a couple of hours ago , no one wants to go inside
fallen : nepal 's historic landmarks driving through the city , there 's not a huge amount of visible damage
there 's some damage to houses and buildings , but it 's not as visual as the haiti earthquake ( of 2010 )
the tents are covered , but water is seeping in from streets puddled with water , especially around the edges of the tent
so people are outside in the rain with no shelter
it 's visually stark , with people in the streets
it 's colder than usual this time of year
when it 's almost may , it 's usually much hotter
there 's very little power in the city -- no power to speak of , no drinking water
for the residents , it 's really bad
you occasionally see a cart with food or a few bottles of drinking water , but for the most part , nothing is being sold in the city
i do n't think they 're very concerned about looting , and there 's no military in the streets , but they will have to get water and food in the city soon
no one 's sure what it 's like at the epicenter
we have n't been able to corroborate this , but the people we 're talking to here say there 's damage to the villages outside kathmandu -- thousands of houses damaged to the north , closer to the epicenter
