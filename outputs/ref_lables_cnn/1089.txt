it was n't until her 20s that fethiye cetin discovered her armenian ancestry
her grandmother , 90 years old at the time , told cetin that her real name was heranus
like many other survivors of 1915 , heranus assimilated and kept her identity hidden
in a crowded reception before a memorial concert in istanbul this week , people rushed to greet fethiye cetin
a strong , soft - spoken woman now in her 60s , cetin is a prominent lawyer who represented armenian - turkey journalist dink
dink was a strong proponent of reconciliation between turkey and armenian who was tried for " insulting turkishness
the shocking discovery of her true heritage would change cetin 's life
cetin was in law school when her grandmother revealed her secret and painful memories of her armenian roots
the 1915 forced deportations and massacres were not taught in turkey 's schools
" there was a huge silence " cetin said
" cetin felt rebellion welling up inside her
" armenian and the armenian diaspora have been doing exactly that and demanding that the " great catastrophe " be recognized as genocide by turkey and the world
armenian president serzh sargysan said earlier this year that " impunity paved a path to holocaust and genocides in rwanda , cambodia and darfur
the turkey has always rejected the term " genocide
turkey argues that wartime conditions , famine and internal conflicts led to the death of millions of ottomans , including armenian subjects
but it 's only in the last decade that public dialogue in turkey began
turkey president erdogan offered turkey 's condolences last year to the descendants of the armenian who lost their lives
but pope pope francis ' use of the word " genocide " and the european parliament 's resolution last week angered turkey leaders
" a century on , cetin says the dynamism surrounding the 100th anniversary excites her , bringing together artists , musicians , scholars and intellectuals as well as turkey 's citizens of all ethnicities and armenian from across the world
if the government were to acknowledge 1915 as a genocide , it would speed up the reconciliation and healing process , she says
" still cetin remains hopeful that turkey will accept its moral obligation towards history and its people
