" what was once the gateway to an ancient mayan city , built circa 700 ad and mysteriously abandoned four centuries later , stands before him
one such explorer , part indiana jones , part magellan , is slovenian archaeologist ivan å prajc
he has been the first to see ancient pyramids , 30 meters high , that he spotted in aerial photographs from his office among the baroque mitteleuropean cobbled streets of ljubljana , slovenian , some 10,000 kilometers away
what does it feel like to find a lost city ? " it 's a victory , " says ivan å prajc , " especially when the efforts are long
" since 1996 , he and his team have discovered more than 80 ancient mayan cities in the jungles of mexico , few of which the modern world had known before
but how can an entire city , which once may have been home to tens of thousands , simply vanish ? ivan å prajc explains that the region in which he has found such riches had gone unexplored because it 's so inaccessible : " it 's so hard to get there
" when a primal jungle is allowed to grow rampant for centuries , it can indeed swallow entire cities
but just why so many settlements were simply abandoned , long before the arrival of the spanish conquistadors , remains a mystery to which these long lost sites may provide an answer
" ninety - nine percent of settlements in the central and southern lowlands of the yucatan peninsula were abandoned in a matter of 200 years
by 1000 ad , practically everything was abandoned
that was the situation when the spaniards came
but not so in the northern section of the peninsula and the guatemala highlands , where there was no rupture until the arrival of the spaniards
" so what happened in that enormous area that led to this mass evacuation ? " nobody knows the exact sequence of events , but it was definitely a combination of droughts , climate change , ( and ) overpopulation , but other things must have come as consequences : devastating raids and wars among the mayan states , which resembled the constantly battling ancient greek city - states
it was a sort of globalized mayan world
" to learn more would require extensive , time - consuming surveys of each site , which is a different sort of fieldwork than ivan å prajc likes to practice
as ivan å prajc likes to say , " we can survive without computers , but not without machetes
