just about now , north korea 's enigmatic ruler was expected to be preparing to emerge from his fortified country for a visit to moscow to join celebrations next week marking the 70th anniversary of the end of world war ii in europe
the trip was highly anticipated
after all , this was to have been kim 's first official international trip since he came to power in 2011 following his father 's death , and it would have provided a fascinating opportunity for the world to get a closer look at a young leader and a regime still largely shrouded in mystery
but this week , russia announced that the trip had been canceled , with kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov saying thursday that moscow was informed via diplomatic channels that the trip would not happen
" what could have changed kim 's mind ? it is practically impossible to answer the question with absolute certainty , but a possible explanation is that kim may not be feeling completely secure in his position
true , kim runs one of the most brutally repressive regimes on earth
perhaps with the potential threats in mind , kim feels the need to reassert his authority and keep his eye on the centers of power
in 2013 , kim shocked the country and stunned outside observers when he ordered the killing of his uncle , jang , who had stood by his side from the day his father died
jang had mentored and guided the young kim as he took the reins , but the once - powerful jang was arrested by soldiers during a politburo meeting who dragged him away in a chilling scene broadcast on national television
" and just this week , and only a day before the russia announced kim 's canceled travel plans , a south korea lawmaker revealed that south korea 's national intelligence service had pieced together information suggesting that so far this year , kim has ordered the execution of 15 senior government officials
kim -- who was still in his 20s when he took power and holds a host of titles , including supreme commander of the korean people 's army -- still finds it necessary to remind everyone at home that he is the one in charge
all this suggests that gauging the state of mind of the north korea leader is no easy task
but if kim raises the alarm about threats from the outside , we will know he is likely feeling insecure at home and may be trying to boost internal support
