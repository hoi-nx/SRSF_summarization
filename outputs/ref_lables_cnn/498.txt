she could stand on a strand of human hair , with room to spare
the microscopic polymer statue by south african sculptor jonty hurwitz , entitled trust , measured just 1/100th of a centimeter and had been called the " smallest sculpture ever made
while she was being photographed through an electron microscope -- the only way to view the minute creation -- trust vanished , with only a smudged fingerprint left behind by her photographer as a clue
after an hour long search , jonty hurwitz and the photographer gave in : " it was horror
i remember saying to him : ' you just destroyed or lost the smallest human form that was ever created in history , ' said jonty hurwitz to cnn ones to watch
" but was it , really ? jonty hurwitz is an entrepreneur - turned - artist who has applied the same tech wizardry to sculpture that he put into coding a finance site valued at over $ 500 million
the 45 - year - old 's " nano - sculptures " are made from a mysterious resin -- " a big scientific secret " , says jonty hurwitz -- and created through a process called " two - photon lithography
" jonty hurwitz works with a team of nanotechnology engineers at karlsruhe university , who focus beams of ultraviolet light to " zap " solid the liquid resin , one 3d at a time
the " nano " project is just one of jonty hurwitz ' science - inspired sculptural experiments
jonty hurwitz , who first made his name as the uk - based co-founder of controversial " payday " loans business wonga , says he makes visual art with a team , as in traditionally collaborative art forms , such as cinema
" jonty hurwitz makes no secret of his desire to bring together contemporary science and art -- delighting in the fact that his nano - scale and 3d printed pieces depend on cutting edge technology , and would have been unimaginable just 10 years ago
" there 's also another side -- what jonty hurwitz calls " the traditional side of the geeky art world " -- accusing him of being just an engineer rather than an artist
invisible to the naked eye , how can we trust this sculpture ever existed beyond the computer screen ? for jonty hurwitz , this mystery gets right to the heart of nano - scale 's appeal : " you 've got this ' emperor 's new clothes ' element to this end of the scale spectrum , because you look at these nano - sculptures and there 's nothing there , there 's an element of me going : ' this sculpture ... believe me , it 's there
