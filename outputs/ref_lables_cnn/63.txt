washington judge jeffrey sutton does n't have a lot of company on the appeals courts these days
sutton , who sits on the 6th u.s. circuit court of appeals in cincinnati , penned the only recent appellate court decision to uphold state bans on same - sex marriage
and it provides important insight into the legal arguments that could be made before the court by states seeking to uphold bans at a time when the national sentiment is quickly shifting in favor of same - sex marriage
" it 's an ideal piece of judicial craftsmanship , " said ryan t. anderson of the heritage foundation , who believes that state bans on same - sex marriage are constitutional
" critics call the opinion an outlier and do n't believe it will carry much weight , considering the number of courts that have overturned same - sex marriage bans in the nearly two years since the supreme court struck down the core of the federal defense of marriage act
" judge sutton 's opinion stands alone , " said davidson , legal director of lambda legal , a gay rights advocacy group
here are the central arguments from his opinion that states seeking to uphold their same - sex marriage bans are expected to echo on tuesday
it is " dangerous and demeaning , " sutton wrote , to the citizenry to assume that only judges " can fairly understand " the arguments for and against same - sex marriage
" it 's an argument made to enforce the idea that there is no fundamental right to marriage for same - sex couples in the constitution
" he said that the same - sex marriage bans rationally advance a legitimate government policy
sutton pushes back on any suggestion that those who oppose same - sex marriage have negative feelings about gay and lesbian couples
" schaerr , a washington appellate lawyer who help to defend utah 's ban on same - sex marriage , calls sutton 's opinion a road map for whoever might write an opinion supporting state bans
but attached to sutton 's opinion was a harsh dissent from a third member of the three - judge panel that heard the case in the 6th circuit
her harshest language was for sutton 's premise that the decision should be left to the democratic process
