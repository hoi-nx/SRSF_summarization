massachusetts is hosting two of the highest - profile court trials in recent memory -- those of former new england patriots aaron hernandez and boston bombing suspect dzhokhar tsarnaev
both lengthy trials are coming to a close
in louisville , kentucky , sen. rand paul made the not - so - surprising announcement that he will run for president , while in chicago , voters will head to the polls in a very surprising runoff between mayor rahm emanuel and challenger garcia
and in ferguson , missouri , the shadow of michael brown and the protests over his shooting by officer darren wilson will loom large over the city 's elections
here 's a breakdown of what to expect today and how we got here : dzhokhar tsarnaev , who 's accused of detonating a bomb at the 2013 boston marathon along with his now - deceased brother , faces the stiffest of penalties -- life in prison or the death penalty -- if he 's found guilty on any of 17 capital counts against him , including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism
the 13th juror : what defense ? on monday , survivors and victims ' families wept and dzhokhar tsarnaev fidgeted at a defense table as jurors heard a prosecutor allege that the 21 - year - old " brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets
it took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that aaron hernandez killed semi-pro player lloyd , yet on monday , aaron hernandez 's defense team wrapped up its witnesses in less than a day
jurors in fall river , massachusetts , will be asked to decide if aaron hernandez is culpable in the shooting death of lloyd , whose body was found in a massachusetts industrial park in the summer of 2013
much of the evidence against aaron hernandez is circumstantial , and among the facts the jury will be asked to take into consideration are new england patriots owner robert kraft 's testimony , the testimony of aaron hernandez 's fiancee , some grainy footage from aaron hernandez 's home security system and a footprint left by a nike air jordan shoe
aaron hernandez known for swagger , even in court ok , sure , no one was floored when the kentucky senator announced his bid for the oval office , but of course it was news when he made it official tuesday
