london the pentagon released a map this week showing coalition forces have taken back 25 - 30 % of iraq territory seized by isis
the map , above , shows gains in key central and northern areas of iraq where the terror group was previously the dominant force
the gains made in the fight against the terror group by iraq security forces and coalition air power certainly look impressive -- although as the u.s. pentagon acknowledges it 's a dynamic conflict and territory can change hands depending on " daily fluctuations in the battle lines
" so , how exactly should we read this information ? what does it say about the wider fight against isis ? cnn asked ashraf , a counterinsurgency specialist and consulting fellow at the royal united services institute to give us a steer on what this new data tells us about the fight against isis in iraq
cnn : so , is the tide turning in iraq -- is the coalition winning ? ashraf : when it comes to insurgencies it 's always problematic to think about the tide turning in terms of territorial gains because insurgencies by their very nature are extremely good at adapting to change
the one difference between isis and insurgencies in general is that isis declared itself a state , a caliphate once had territory so any loss is very strategic loss of prestige and image for them
there are losses but most of the losses are around the edges of their territory and what that means is a very conventional push forward by the iraq forces
the capability you need ( for this kind of warfare ) is much more high - tech than the capabilities the iraq have
those capabilities are available in the region -- jordanians , egyptians and other forces have helicopters and aircraft -- and it 's very interesting that the middle eastern nations have not developed an effective coalition to target isis which is an existential threat
but where it counts they are not standing and fighting .
