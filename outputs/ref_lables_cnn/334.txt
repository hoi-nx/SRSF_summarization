there 's the traditional , time - tested way , where new doctors graduate from medical school and then pass a series of national exams while training for years as resident physicians
then there 's the approach being forged in florida and arizona : getting elected to a state legislature
lawmakers in those states are too often donning the white coats to orchestrate medical practice
in 2011 , florida enacted the firearm owners ' privacy act , which threatens prosecution and loss of licensure for any physicians who dare ask their patients about gun ownership and gun safety
does anyone really believe i should n't talk about gun safety in these cases ? it 's a good thing i do n't practice in florida
florida 's gun censorship law was dragged into court soon after the governor signed it , and while a three - judge appeals panel upheld the law last summer , doctors can still ask about guns while the full 11th circuit court of appeals decides whether it will take up the case , a decision that could come down any day , the president of the florida chapter of the american academy of pediatrics , dr. tommy schechtman , told me
in arizona , another assault on physician free speech is scheduled to go into effect this summer
but legislators slid in a last - minute provision mandating that physicians who prescribe the abortion pill ru-486 tell patients the pill is reversible
any doctor is certainly within his or her rights to review the limited information available about the san diego regimen and decide whether to discuss it with patients , but actually requiring physicians to make claims most believe to be untrue and unsafe means the legislators are overstepping their bounds and interfering with the patient - doctor relationship
why are physicians putting up with a professional assault the american bar association would never permit ? dr. ilana addis , chairwoman of the arizona chapter of the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists , told me the amendment was added shortly before she was scheduled to testify about the bill before the arizona house
the florida medical association did n't provide me with details about whether it has a lobbying effort against the gun law , and the arizona medical association told me in a statement that " ama 's policy is to take no position on abortion
the massachusetts medical society ( mss ) tried to utilize that power recently when it decided to dedicate " doctor 's day " to the issue of physician free speech , highlighting the threat posed by florida 's gun law in particular
arkansas enacted a law similar to arizona just days later
it did file a friend - of - the - court brief as part of the florida legal challenge , but at this writing has n't weighed in on arizona
now that the ama has won the age - old " doc fix " battle , ending automatic medicare payment cuts to doctors , perhaps it will consider assigning some of its $ 18 million lobbying team to stand in for lackluster state affiliates who 've abdicated their responsibility to vigorously defend the medical profession
i hope murthy will see beyond the bluster of abortion and gun politics and zero in on a key issue affecting public health -- free and unfettered communication between patients and doctors .
