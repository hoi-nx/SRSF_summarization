hong kong when she was growing up , mui , wanted to be a fashion model -- not an unusual aspiration for a young girl
but mui suffers from a rare genetic condition that leaves the skin on her face and body red raw and open to infection
she was born with harlequin ichthyosis , which means her skin is extremely thick , dry and flaky -- resembling fish scales
mui 's struggle to come to terms with her condition and other people 's reactions to it has , at times , left her on the brink of suicide
but , now 22 , she refuses to let it get in the way of her life -- she has a full - time job , plays sport and is embarking on a career as public speaker -- educating and inspiring others about the challenges of looking " visibly different
" after she was abandoned at birth , long - time hong kong expats tina and rog thomas began fostering mui , when she was just one and a half years old
" we wanted to give her a family life in the time she had , " says tina
however , mui began to thrive in a loving family environment and tina and rog thomas formally adopted mui when she was three years old
together they gradually learned how to manage her skin condition
but while mui 's unusual appearance made little difference during her early years , that changed when she started secondary school
" the worst episode lasted for 10 months and only stopped after police became involved and found the bully -- someone whom mui thought was her friend
mui left school with no qualifications
" i still wish i had got a very hard kick up the backside from the teachers when i was n't doing work , " says mui
since leaving school , mui has found a full - time job working with people with special needs and at weekends can be found running around a rugby pitch with a whistle -- she 's a referee for kids ' matches
he thinks public speaking will help mui come to terms with her condition but he 's also wary that she could be portrayed as a " modern freak show
in person , mui comes across as articulate , poised and confident -- something her mom says comes out of spending so much time with adults while growing up -- and it 's easy to see how she could command an audience of hundreds
