several of the world 's worst terrorist groups , like isis and al-shabaab , aim to create societies governed by strict , distorted versions of sharia law
for example , most victims of isis are fellow muslims who refuse to go along with the isis worldview and ruthless tactics
still , there 's ample evidence that christians have been targeted
the latest came friday , when an italian prosecutor revealed that a network of pakistan associated with al qaeda talked about attacking the vatican back in march 2010
besides getting medical help , ghlam was arrested after authorities found four kalashnikov guns , a revolver , ammunition , police armbands and more in his car and residence , paris prosecutor molins said on wednesday
they also turned up " documents in arabic mentioning al qaeda and isis " and correspondence with someone in syria " asking him to target a church
" prime minister manuel valls later went to a church in the paris suburb of villejuif , one of the at least two such christian places of worship that ghlam allegedly targeted
isis has turned its beheadings of hostages into horror shows , producing propaganda videos seemingly aimed at producing the maximum amount of terror
what set the one from april apart were the number of people killed and that they were christians from ethiopian
ethiopian 's government said monday that 30 of its citizens were among two groups of prisoners shown being beheaded in libyan in a video released a day earlier , according to the ethiopian news agency
" the same video brazenly claims that isis has been merciful to christians in iraqi -- by giving them the choice of paying a fine if they refuse to convert to islam
" the islamic state has offered the christian community this many times and set a deadline for this , " this speaker says , using the name isis calls itself
" everyone at kenya 's university college suffered in some way when a handful of al-shabaab gunmen stormed the campus early this month
" this tactic of separating non-muslims from muslims mirrors what al-shabaab attackers did in december at a quarry in the kenya village of kormey , where at least 36 were killed , according to the kenya red cross
one of al-shabaab 's explicit aims is to turn somalis , its home base , into a fundamentalist islam state , according to the council of foreign relations
after the the kenya university attack , which left nearly 150 people dead , jama , garissa 's regional governor , dismissed al-shabaab 's claims that it only kills non-muslims as " a tricky way of doing business
" " the fallacy and satanic mindset of al-shabaab is that , in somalis , they kill muslims and somalis , " jama said , claiming the group 's militants are " bent on nothing but destruction
sadly , the shock of the mass killings of the ethiopian christians in april may have been dulled simply because of a nearly identical atrocity a few weeks before
isis released a five - minute video in february showing the mass murder of coptic christians from egyptian
produced by the islamic state 's propaganda wing al-hayat media , the video shows black - clad jihadists standing behind their victims on a libyan beach
news of this mass beheading emerged weeks after 21 egyptian christians were kidnapped in two incidents in the libyan coastal city of sirte
the isis video shows the beheading of around a dozen men , though egyptian officials say all 21 kidnapped christians were killed
egyptian 's government responded with airstrikes on 10 targets used for training and storage in isis ' libyan stronghold of derna , according to egyptian foreign minister sameh shoukry
" avenging egyptian blood and punishing criminals and murderers is our right and duty , " the egyptian military said in a statement that was broadcast on state television
now the assyrian are battling isis for survival in their native syria and iraqi
even those not in captivity face dire threats , given isis 's well - established reputation of offering little to no mercy to christians
isis is n't the only reason for this drop , but it certainly is a big one
isis has inflicted pain and suffering well beyond qaraqosh , though , like its capture and control of mosul , iraqi 's second - largest city
" arabo , a chaldean - american leader and spokesman for the group ending genocide in iraqi , claims that iraqi christian children have been beheaded , mothers raped and fathers killed by isis militants in recent months
