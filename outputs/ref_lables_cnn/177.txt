a grand jury in dallas , texas , has decided not to indict two officers in the fatal shooting of harrison , a schizophrenic man whose mother had called police for help getting him to the hospital
the grand jury 's decision not to indict means officers rogers and hutchins wo n't face criminal prosecution in the case
but the officers are still facing a wrongful death lawsuit from harrison 's family
the incident occurred in june , and harrison 's family filed a lawsuit in november
one of the two officers called to the scene tells harrison to drop the tool , a command the officers repeat at least four times as harrison 's mom screams , " jay ! jay ! jay ! " within five seconds of that first command , the 39 - year - old schizophrenic man is shot five times -- including twice in the back as he crashes headlong into the home 's garage door , just a few feet from his mother
video from one officer 's body camera fades to black as harrison 's mother wails , " oh , they killed my son ! oh , they killed my son ! " the officers continue to tell harrison to drop the weapon
the suit also claims the officers violated harrison 's civil rights
