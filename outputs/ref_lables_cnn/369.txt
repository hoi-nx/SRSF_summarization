lampedusa , italian the cramped galley of the ship is filled with the smell of fresh garlic frying in olive oil
cortese , a tall , thin , sunburned 27 - year veteran of italian 's guardia di finanza ( finance police ) is waxing eloquent on his favorite subject : food
how i was smuggled into europe -- and why it was worth it we boarded the finance police 's ship , the calabrese , in lampedusa harbor earlier in the evening
the calabrese regularly patrols the mediterranean off lampedusa , which is italian 's southernmost territory and just 70 miles , or just over 110 kilometers , from the tunisian coast
a few years ago , the calabrese was on the look out for " contrabandisti , " smugglers trafficking in cigarettes and drugs
but in recent years , its 12 - man crew has joined italian 's effort to rescue migrants coming from africa and the middle east
we see some italian fishing boats the crew knew by sight
shortly after sunset , the calabrese 's captain , busonera , begins calling out quick orders to his men as we approach a small boat
busonera peers intently at the boat , which appears to be a fishing vessel , then shrugs
" if it were low in the water , we 'd know it was full of people , but this boat is riding high
it 's a routine evening for the calabrese , and that is just fine with the crew
he and most of his shipmates took part in the rescue effort on october 3 , 2013 , after a ship with hundreds of migrants had gone down off lampedusa
more than 350 people died in that disaster
the crew of the calabrese was able to rescue four of the survivors
why migrants are risking their lives to reach italian cortese and idone stress that as fathers , there is nothing worse than having to see the bodies of dead children
out in the mediterranean , with no land in sight , you realize just how vast it is
it contrasts starkly with conditions migrants have recounted to us of the rickety boats and unseaworthy rubber dinghies they use to try to cross the mediterranean
and unless a ship like the calabrese comes to their rescue , death at sea is a definite possibility .
