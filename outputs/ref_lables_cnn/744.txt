blue bell ice cream has temporarily shut down one of its manufacturing plants over the discovery of listeria contamination in a serving of ice cream originating from that plant
public health officials warned consumers friday not to eat any blue bell - branded products made at the company 's broken arrow , oklahoma , plant
that includes 3 - ounce servings of blue bell ice cream from this plant that went to institutions in containers marked with the letters o , p , q , r , s or t behind the coding date
the warning by the cdc does not affect other blue bell ice cream , including other 3 - ounce servings , not made at the plant
it is the third time blue bell has taken action in light of a listeria outbreak at a kansas hospital that served the company 's ice cream
listeria monocytogenes was recently found in a cup of ice cream recovered from the hospital
the cup contaminated with the bacteria was produced at the broken arrow plant in april 2014 , blue bell said
none of this means the ice cream is the source of either spate of the infections
in early march , in light of the kansas listeria outbreak , blue bell recalled a group of products made at a plant in texas
five people were infected and three died in the past year in kansas from listeria that might be linked to blue bell products , according to the cdc
at least four of them had consumed milkshakes made with blue bell ice cream before developing the infection
in a statement on its website , blue bell said " this recall in no way includes blue bell ice cream half gallons , pints , quarts , 3 gallons or other 3 oz. cups
