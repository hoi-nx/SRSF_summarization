vidarbha , india yogita is expecting a baby soon
he committed suicide early in the pregnancy
" he was in so much debt , " 25 - year - old yogita said of her late husband
" it 's a familiar story in families across india 's cotton production belt , where , a cotton lobbyist group claims , one cotton farmer commits suicide every eight hours
" we get reports of two to three farmer suicides every day , " said tiwari , leader of the farmers advocacy group , vjas ( vjas )
vidarbha , in the eastern region of the state of maharashtra , is known as the epicenter of the suicide crisis
according to vjas data , some 2,900 farmers from the area have taken their lives since 2013 ; more than 500 have died since the start of this year
there are a number of reasons for the hopelessness among vidarbha farmers
but they 've also had to contend with the flipside : a plentiful harvest in 2014 drove prices down while production costs rose , leaving many farmers either lacking income or burdened with debt from loans taken out to help keep them afloat
the record surplus of cotton in the global market pushed down prices hurting farmers , particularly in vidarbha , which is becoming increasingly reliant on cotton
he said in the past year , cotton prices had halved
the costs of pesticides , fertilizers and seeds are increasing but the cotton price is falling down
" he points out the dismal condition of debt - ridden farmers like himself in vidarbha , many of whom are forced to take out loans or give up farming
tiwari , from the farmers advocacy group , said many farmers in vidarbha had lost hope that the situation would improve
how many more farmers need to commit suicide before the government steps in to find a solution to this problem ? " more than 50 % of india 's population is involved in the agricultural and allied sector , which contributes 18 % of the country 's gdp
government data shows 11,772 farmers committed suicide in 2013 across india
earlier this month , prime minister modi raised the amount of compensation paid for damaged crops , and lowered the threshold for farmers to claim payouts
however , that failed to appease farmers who are angry about the government 's land acquisition bill , which critics say makes it easier for the government to seize farmers ' land
on sunday , thousands of farmers gathered in delhi at a rally led by opposition congress party to protest against the bill
he said modi 's push to open bank accounts for every indian household , neglected to address the major concern in farming households of falling incomes
he says , for a start , the government should guarantee a better market price for cotton and waive farmers ' overdue debt
divisional commissioner of the vidarbha , rajurkar said the state government is aware of the situation and is planning to roll out relief programs to help local cotton farmers
