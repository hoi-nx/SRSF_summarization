juarez , mexico , was once known as the murder capital of the world
back in 2010 , at the height of cartel violence , the city averaged 8.5 killings per day
but five years later , local officials say the city is much safer , and plans are underway to lure foreign tourists and investors back to juarez
this month the city launched the tourism campaign " juarez is waiting for you
u.s. rep. o'rourke of texas was one of those on a leg of the juarez tour
" as a region , el paso and juarez represent 20 % of all u.s. - mexico trade
juarez was at one time the deadliest city in the world
many were helplessly caught in the cartel violence
it was n't that long ago , o'rourke says , that he thought twice about crossing the bridge into juarez
" ( now ) i travel to juarez regularly to have lunch or meet people or just to go
" a spokesman for the chihuahua state attorney general 's office told cnn that at one point , there were days when juarez had more than 20 killings
more than 3,000 people were killed in the city just four years ago , but so far this year there have been 89 killings , according to castaneda -- a dramatic decrease in the violence
another factor that may have helped : the turf war between the juarez and sinaloa cartels essentially ended , with the sinaloa cartel claiming victory in the battle for the trafficking route in juarez
o'rourke argues that the el paso - juarez border is " safer than it 's ever been
" he cites the " 30 million lawful crosses from el paso into juarez " last year as a symbolic step
" for juarez to be considered a safe city , there 's a long way to go , " says meza , executive director for plan estrategico de juarez , an independent organization that works to improve the city 's quality of life
but we 're still very sick , " meza told cnn from his office in juarez
we 're still working out the corruption in the city
" with more than 40 % of juarez living below the poverty line , according to plan estrategico de juarez , the future of the city will depend on " the people 's participation in public matters
u.s. companies delphi , honeywell , flextronics and lear are among those that ramped up hiring and investment in juarez over the last year
that hiring would have been hard to imagine four years ago
but with the average salary at $ 20 per week for local workers in the maquiladores , or factories , along the u.s. - mexico border in juarez , meza says more needs to be done
americans who , before the violence , came to juarez for bargain shopping have not returned in the numbers seen before the spike in violence
longtime residents of juarez and neighboring el paso may be reluctant to say the wounds of the violent past have altogether healed
" for someone who grew up on the border and for someone who spent half of his life crossing the border on a weekly basis , it 's encouraging to be crossing back to juarez without that sort of hesitation or worry that something might happen
he says the threat of violence is " still a little bit concerning , " though that has n't stopped him in recent weeks from going to juarez to meet friends for dinner and drinks
