eighteen minutes into the show , and shortly after midnight , a gunman opened fire on the audience
twelve people were killed and 70 were injured
on monday , shooting suspect james holmes goes on trial for 165 counts , including murder and attempted murder charges
he has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity
it 's a moment the survivors and those who lost loved ones have waited for anxiously
it 's a moment that will be a painful next step toward healing and one that will no doubt bring back a flood of painful memories
ahead of the trial , cnn spoke with several people whose lives were changed because of the shooting
they will attend at least part of the trial
o'farrill made a last - minute decision to go to the movies with a friend
o'farrill was shot multiple times and collapsed as he tried to escape
veronica was the youngest to die in the theater
tom and caren teves lost their son , alex , who was in the theater with his girlfriend
when the shooting began , alex shielded his girlfriend , saving her life and absorbing the bullets that would take his
rebecca did n't make it out alive
here , in their own words , is a glimpse at what these people are experiencing 2Â½ years after the shooting and as the trial begins
o'farrill : " i do n't think the shooting has defined me as a person
" bailey : " i would say that the theater shooting is life - changing , but i do n't think it defines me
because i could n't do the same thing i did before
i just was n't that person anymore
... " i do n't think anybody who was in that theater that night will ever be the same
but he certainly has n't promised us that ... we 'll live to see another one
" caren teves : " it does n't get any easier
it 's something that 's been on my heart since the shooting happened
and i hope to meet him and just tell him in person , ' look , you know , you tried to kill me but i do n't hate you , and i forgive you
' " bailey : " no , i do n't forgive him
he took so many people 's lives , and he hurt so many other people that were n't even in the theater
he hurt families and friends and just everybody in aurora , honestly
in this case , i have n't had anyone ask for forgiveness
i really do n't even think about him that much at this point ... i just did n't want to carry that bag of rocks on my back anymore
" o'farrill : " the trial starting , i think , will kind of stir things up
talking to my counselor about it and praying on it daily , and understanding that , again , i ca n't control how it all unfolds , you know
i do n't think it 's hit me
i do n't think i realize what i 'm going into
" tom teves : " it does n't bring these emotions to the surface again for us
and it just races in your head , if you let it , you know ? so part of the coping skills is you just do n't let it
" bailey : " so , like , i do n't think that if he does get the death penalty , then , i 'll , i do n't know how to word this
i wo n't be happy because that 's another person 's life
