true or false , mercury is : 1 ) the planet closest to the sun in our solar system 2 ) so hot that water could n't possibly exist there 3 ) something used in old - style glass thermometers 4 ) a planet you do n't think about very often answers : true , false , true ( but not what we 're talking about in this story ) and i 'm guessing no. 4 is true too
if you flunked the test , it might be because mercury ( the planet ) suffers from bad ( or very little ) press
mercury orbits about 35,983,125 miles from the sun. compare that to earth -- we 're about 93 million miles from the sun. mercury 's closeness to the sun makes it hard to see except at dawn and twilight
venus , on the other hand , the planet between earth and mercury , appears to be the brightest planet in the sky
pilot sends plane into dive after mistaking venus for oncoming plane but back to mercury
the messenger ( an acronym for messenger ) is about to crash onto mercury
the probe was launched in 2004 and traveled more than six and a half years before it started orbiting mercury on march 18 , 2011
now , messenger is running out of fuel and messenger says it will hit the planet 's surface at 8,750 mph ( 3.91 kilometers per second ) around april 30
you wo n't be able to see it hit because messenger will crash on the side of mercury facing away from earth
one of messenger 's big findings : it sent back data indicating that ice in mercury 's shadowed polar regions , if spread over an area the size of washington , would be more than two miles thick , messenger said
so the messenger mission is ending , but scientists say they 'll be busy for years studying data from the probe
