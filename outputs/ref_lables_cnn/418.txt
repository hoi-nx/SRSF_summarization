indiana 's controversial religious freedom law has been in hot water lately
after a firestorm of backlash and protests , gov. mike pence said on tuesday that the state will " fix " the rfra , or rfra , so it will not discriminate against gays and lesbians
mike pence is making the right call
not all people who dislike the law hate religion , and not all people who like the law want to discriminate against the lgbt community
the unbelievably easy way to fix indiana 's rfra is to add one small amendment , one easy line codifying that discrimination against the lgbt community is harmful , and that there is a compelling governmental interest in eliminating that harm
sometimes , a law seems to impose only modest burdens on the people it affects , but in practice it actually severely burdens the religious practices of a few
because indiana does not have a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation , the bill as drafted might allow people who were so inclined to discriminate , and simply assert that they could do so based on a religious belief
whether or not lawmakers think so , it certainly seems relevant to the general public that this bill was passed with important national decisions about marriage equality on the horizon and right after the ruling in baskin v. bogans that indiana 's same - sex marriage ban was unconstitutional
writing for the seventh circuit panel in 2014 , judge posner 's rationale in the case of baskin v. bogan provides the obvious answer for how to fix the rfra deficiency without changing what it is that it defends
courts have long held that a religious exemption can not be granted if it allows you to shift the harm to a third party , and -- as posner explained so simply -- discrimination is harmful
a few simple words have the potential to completely change the conversation , send an important message about the value of equality , and make indiana into a shining beacon of cooperation : the real " crossroads of america
