they were huddled in the back of a tugboat
their coats and jackets , still wet , were piled up in a huge container behind them
the 117 migrants , mostly from africa , arrived in the port of augusta , sicily , around 1p.m
the two boats they had been in were barely seaworthy , the tug 's montenegrin captain told me
we had flown to sicily from rome following news that as many as 400 migrants had been lost at sea
this small group in augusta were among nearly 10,000 migrants who have arrived on italy shores since the weekend , according to the italy coast guard
with the onset of spring and calmer seas , it appears that the flow of migrants is not relenting
as they filed off the boat , representatives of the italy red cross did a quick visual inspection , checking for fever , scabies , any sign of illness
an egyptian translator working for the italy police told me they had information that a large group of syria were gathered in a tripoli warehouse , and were expected to make the journey to italy in the coming days
it seems that all the victims of the multiple tragedies and woes of africa and the middle east -- grinding poverty , war and the rise of isis -- are washing up on the shores of italy
the small group of migrants in augusta has been taken in by the italy authorities
they 've been fed , clothed , received medical treatment , and will be taken to migrant camp in northern italy
most will then try move further north , to countries like france , belgium , the netherlands and the uk , where economic opportunities are better than in austerity - wracked italy
others will stay in italy , trying to eke out a living in the twilight economy as street vendors and beggars
and as they settle in , somehow or other , more and more will come to italy 's shores .
