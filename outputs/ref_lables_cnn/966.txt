i 've been in disaster management long enough to know that there is really no one right way to mark the anniversary of a tragic event
as the boston marathon runners begin and , hopefully , finish their exhausting run monday , the lingering memories of the 2013 marathon blasts will be seen and felt in all sorts of ways
sometimes it takes years to determine what in fact occurred and to write a narrative that reflects a multitude of voices and opinions
as a former homeland security adviser for massachusetts , i was intimately involved with the marathon planning ; as a commentator for cnn , i saw the story evolve during that week
some of these lessons learned are informed by the luxury of time and hindsight , others by various after - action reports and assessments , and others by the trial of tsarnaev , in which a jury found him guilty of multiple counts
on tuesday , the trial 's sentencing phase will begin , determining whether he will receive the death penalty
even if this argument were valid in some context -- where terrorists were picked up on battlegrounds abroad and evidence against them might be difficult to obtain -- the boston marathon trial made clear that the system does work
what was amazing about a trial filled with so much emotion is that it was relatively unemotional
recent reports about the shootout in watertown that friday night in 2013 show a disorganized and often unnecessarily dangerous response during the manhunt
it is truly remarkable there were not more significant friendly fire casualties beyond the wounding of massachusetts transit police officer richard donohue as more and more police officials came to the town and failed to fall into place in what should ideally be a very delineated command structure
we have a notion of " boston strong " coming from the attacks and the city 's response
i have come to believe that what united us as a city was based on the competency of the response
it is worth remembering that not a single person of the hundreds who were transported to hospitals died ; the three fatalities occurred at the bombing site only
one part of the response that does n't get enough mention is the focus on family unification immediately after the attacks
family members of runners often did n't know where their loved ones were on the marathon route
crisis planning must continue to focus on the one aspect that will matter most to those in a disaster : is my family ok ? obviously , there is so much more to learn
could the bombing have been avoided ? what would have happened if the fbi had shared information it had on the tsarnaev family with local police ? what if family and friends had alerted authorities to the growing radicalization of the brothers ? it 's " woulda , coulda , shoulda " but still essential
one of the reasons it is crucial to go back and draw these lessons is n't simply for blame , but to get better for the next time
and maybe the best way to remember today is to commit to a constant willingness to learn from this tragedy in all the years ahead .
