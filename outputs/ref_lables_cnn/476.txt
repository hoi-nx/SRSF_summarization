the items are crafts and artifacts made by japanese-americans confined to world war ii internment camps
a grass - roots campaign of a change.org petition , a facebook page , and mediation by " star trek " actor takei has resulted in rago arts and auction center agreeing to pull the items from the sale
" there is an essential discussion to be had about the sale of historical items that are a legacy of man 's inhumanity to man
" takei , who with his family spent time in one of the camps , thanked people for working to stop the sale
during world war ii , about 117,000 people of japanese descent were forced to live in 10 internment camps
two - thirds of the people who were ordered there were native born americans citizens , according to the national archives
cnn affiliate kgo reported the items were given to historian eaton , who opposed internment camps
miriam tucker , a partner with the auction house , said it had hoped the items would go to someone who cared about their historical meaning
" for us , there could be no better resolution than for a suitable museum , foundation or members of the japanese - americans community with the means to preserve this collection to come forward and secure it for education , display and research , " she said
kgo reported the people it talked to would like items returned to family members if possible and any other artifacts put in an exhibition
" once the dust settles from this auction weekend ( 1,200 lots in three days ) we will work with a small group of people from the japanese - americans community who have identified themselves through this process as generous , informed , voices of reason , " he wrote
