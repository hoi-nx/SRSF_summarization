bangkok thailand has lifted martial law , replacing it with it a controversial new security order granting sweeping powers to the ruling military junta
critics have expressed alarm at the move , with human rights watch 's asia director adams saying it marked the country 's " deepening descent into dictatorship
" martial law was lifted wednesday when the thailand king bhumibol adulyadej approved a request from prime minister general prayuth to proceed
prayuth -- head of the ncpo ( ncpo ) junta -- immediately invoked article 44 of the country 's interim constitution " to curb acts deemed harmful to national peace and stability
" " thailand 's friends abroad should not be fooled by this obvious sleight of hand by the junta leader to replace martial law with a constitutional provision that effectively provides unlimited and unaccountable powers , " adams said in a statement
sunai phasuk , human rights watch 's senior researcher on thailand , told cnn the move would see prayuth " become a strongman with ultimate power in his hands to wield as he wishes
" normally i would warmly welcome the lifting of martial law -- and indeed strongly advocated for it to be lifted in thailand , " the high commissioner said
" but i am alarmed at the decision to replace martial law with something even more draconian , which bestows unlimited powers on the current prime minister without any judicial oversight at all
" martial law was imposed shortly before thailand 's military seized power last may , ousting the democratically - elected government of shinawatra after months of sometimes violent street protests
thailand political scholar and coup opponent pavin told cnn that the move from martial law to the new security order amounted to " pouring the same wine into a new bottle
everyone knows in thailand they had to abolish the martial law because of international pressure
" but article 44 is a lot worse than the martial law because it gives total power to the ncpo
