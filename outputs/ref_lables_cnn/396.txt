i will always remember when things turned
i was 12 years old , and my younger sister and i were with our parents attending a peaceful demonstration in downtown miami near the courthouse
we were there to protest the acquittal of four police officers in the beating death of unarmed motorcyclist mcduffie
i had learned the word " acquittal " just that day
it meant they would n't be held responsible
community leaders were gathered at the front , speaking to a crowd that was in shock and full of anger and despair
the trial had been covered extensively , and nobody could believe that the fatal beating -- with the extent of the physical wounds to mcduffie 's head and body -- could be justified or excused
i started to hear rumblings coming from around the perimeter of the immediate crowd
that was miami 35 years ago , but it could just as easily have been baltimore this week
the miami riots of 1980 were the first major " race riots " since the wave of riots spread across the nation in the 1960s
then the rev. king was assassinated , and baltimore and 125 other cities erupted in flames
that was true in miami in 1980 after the acquittal of the police officers
and now we have baltimore 2015 , with the death of suspect freddie gray in police custody
my parents were leaders and participants in the nonviolent civil rights movement , and they raised me to understand that youths were the key to the movement
juxtapose decades - old images of youths being hosed down by police during nonviolent demonstrations in birmingham and selma with tuesday 's images of baltimore youths throwing rocks at police , and you wonder what has happened
as a 12 - year - old girl in miami , i did n't understand how people could injure and even kill others and destroy their neighborhoods , and risk going to jail , by rioting
i was also afraid that such senseless violence could only derail the legitimate causes of the african-american - african-american community , causes historically advanced by nonviolent civil disobedience and through legislative channels
... " his administration convened the kerner commission to examine the 1965 - 68 riots , and its findings were that racism had led to joblessness , poverty , a lack of political power , unfair housing , police brutality and inferior schools
maybe the baltimore youths involved in the riots felt the way one youth did in watts in 1965
" when i learned that baltimore high school students planned a purge based on the movie " the purge , " in which people were legally absolved for their anarchistic crimes , it suddenly made sense
they thought they would be absolved -- a word not much different from the word " acquitted " i learned the day of the miami riots
but the rev. jamal bryant got it right when he said he would open his empowerment temple ame church in baltimore to youths who would not be in school so he could teach them the power of nonviolence to change society
that power was evident after the shooting of michael brown in ferguson , missouri , and the decision not to indict the officer who killed him
the riots in baltimore have rightfully been quashed , but the voices of nonviolent protesters continue to be heard .
