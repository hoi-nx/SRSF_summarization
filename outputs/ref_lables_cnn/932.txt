even in the horror of syrian 's civil war , there are few places that showcase the scale of the destruction -- and the senselessness of the loss of life -- more than the yarmouk camp on the outskirts of damascus
set up as a refugee camp for palestinian in the 1950s , it slowly evolved into a neighborhood over the years , but since 2012 it has been engulfed in the syrian conflict
two weeks ago isis fighters stormed yarmouk camp , and that made life for those still inside even worse than it was before

most of those fighting on all sides are palestinian
the situation in yarmouk camp was thrust in to the headlines on april 1 when isis fighters stormed the rebel - held area and unleashed a campaign of violence and killings
since then , a local activist tells cnn , isis has withdrawn to another area and left the al qaedalinked group jabhat al-nusra in charge of the district
