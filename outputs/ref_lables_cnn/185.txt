in 2001 , the taliban wiped out 1700 years of history in a matter of seconds , by blowing up ancient buddha statues in central afghanistan with dynamite
they proceeded to do so after an attempt at bringing down the 175 - foot tall sculptures with anti-aircraft artillery had failed
sadly , the event was just the first in a series of atrocities that have robbed the world of some of its most prized cultural heritage
but historical architecture is also under threat from calamities which might well escape our control , such as earthquakes and climate change
now cyark , a non-profit company founded by an iraqi - born engineer , is using groundbreaking laser scanning to ensure that -- at the very least -- incredibly accurate digital versions of the world 's treasures will stay with us forever
kacyra was born in mosul , iraqi , in 1940
he founded cyark , a company that specializes in digital preservation of threatened ancient and historical architecture , in 2003
" since then , kacyra has been doing exactly that : in a 2011 ted talk he explained his quest to preserve our " collective treasure " , and he has a plan to scan 500 world heritage sites in five years
the idea is not just to protect endangered structures , but to offer free educational access to the digital recreations of important monuments via the web
cyark had mapped them a year earlier , and that could lead to the reconstruction of what was lost
" i 'm constantly looking at what 's happening in iraqi and syria
" to scan the surroundings , cyark uses a portable , eye - safe laser device based on a technology called lidar -- a portmanteau of the words light and radar
" in other words , " we gave the world a 3d laser scanner that has revolutionized how reality is captured
" although its focus is in providing open access to cultural heritage , cyark is also attracting interest for alternative uses of the technology
" before founding cyark , kacyra had developed a similar technology called cyrax , which he then subsequently sold
