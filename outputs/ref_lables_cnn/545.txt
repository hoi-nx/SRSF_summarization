" like you , i was a target of militants who did not want girls to go to school , " she writes in the letter
in the letter , she calls on the nigeria government and the international community to do more to rescue the girls
nigeria recently held an election
on april 14 , 2014 , islamists with boko haram kidnapped the girls , prompting an international campaign for their safe return , which used the hashtag # bringbackourgirls
on monday , unicef announced a new campaign for the 800,000 children who have been displaced in northeast nigeria , using the hashtag # bringbackourchildhood
malala yousafzai is admired globally as a figure standing for peace
she has spoken with cnn about the nigeria abductions previously
malala yousafzai : global symbol , but still just a kid here is the full letter : to my brave sisters , the kidnapped schoolgirls of chibok , on this first anniversary of your captivity , i write to you with a message of solidarity , love and hope
today and every day , we call on the nigeria authorities and the international community to do more to bring you home
like you , i was a target of militants who did not want girls to go to school
now we speak out on behalf of all girls about the right to get a proper education
last july , i spent my 17th birthday in nigeria with some of your parents and five of your classmates who escaped the kidnapping
i met nigeria president jonathan and urged him to work harder for your freedom
still , in my opinion , nigeria leaders and the international community have not done enough to help you
nigeria forces are re-gaining territory and protecting more schools
nigeria 's newly - elected president , muhammadu buhari , has vowed to make securing your freedom a top priority and promised his government will not tolerate violence against women and girls
