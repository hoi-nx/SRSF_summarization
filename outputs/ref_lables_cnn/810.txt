this is week two of an ongoing series : a catholic this week covers the genesis , chapters 1 - 11
the first step was choosing a bible
as i mentioned in the first installment of this series , i 'm a lifelong catholic who finally plans to read the bible from cover to cover
the bible i 'm reading is " the deluxe catholic bible , " published in 1986 by world bible publishing
how did i not know this ? the first chapter is the seven days story with god creating the earth
in the second chapter the earth is again created and man is formed out of clay
it struck me that the whole first two chapters have everything to do with the earth and man 's place in it , a struggle that we can relate to even now
my greatest surprise , though , came when i read about seth
seth ? who ? i started asking people if they had remembered the story of seth
turns out , seth is the forgotten son of adam who is born after abel kills abel
adam fathered seth at 130 years old
yes , we are getting into the part of the bible with fantastical life spans that allow for the transition from the stories of adam to abraham
unfortunately , we do n't learn much more about seth
did you know that eve is the first person named in the bible ? ( i expected adam , but he is called " man " in the first references
) moving on , we have these tales about the " sons of heaven " seeing earth 's beautiful women and taking them as wives
maybe that 's why i do n't ever recall hearing this passage read at mass. with that in mind , i read about noah , descendent of seth , with a different perspective , too
" never again will i doom the earth because of man , since the desires of man are evil from the start
... " that phrase reminded me of my dad 's favorite saying , " to err is human but to forgive is divine , " which comes from a pope , but not a catholic holy man
