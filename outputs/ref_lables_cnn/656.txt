the world 's leading showjumping and dressage horses have reached vegas for this week 's world cup
the man who arranged their travel says , for horses , it 's business class all the way
" there are two horses per box , " explains tim dutta , who oversaw the loading of more than $ 150 million in equine talent onto a qatar airways flight at schiphol airport 's schiphol airport earlier this month
" we pay attention to each horse 's little idiosyncrasies and requirements -- do they like wet hay , or not ? do we use sea salt to encourage them to drink ? " i like the horses to have some quiet time too , they need that
the flights are over and they 're in vegas to work
the venue is the thomas & mack center , a stone 's throw from the vegas , which had the distinction of being opened by frank sinatra and diana ross in 1983
organizers believe more than 80,000 fans will attend this week 's event , which boasts an $ 8 million budget
expect elvis presley beaming down from the jumbotron ; chefs from the bellagio serving vip guests who paid upwards of $ 1,500 a ticket ; and tennis legend steffi graf presenting the trophies
in the past , that was not your usual showjumping and dressage atmosphere -- but that 's something the sport is trying to change
hosting world - class horsesport in vegas is a way to raise its profile in the u.s.
this year , a " selfie booth " will let fans crowd in with leading riders for awkward photos on their phones -- and there will be quite some choice of riders
vegas is so in love with horses , organizers are already planning a bid to bring the event back in 2019 .
