one summer a few years ago , frances bean cobain worked as an intern in the new york offices of rolling stone
frances bean cobain -- the daughter of montage of heck singer - guitarist cobain and an executive producer of the new hbo documentary on his life , " cobain : montage of heck " -- was " a 15 - year - old goth kid , so stoked , " she recalls with a laugh during a recent interview for the cover story in our new issue
she remembers providing research assistance on a cover about the jonas brothers -- and working in a cubicle across from a wall with a giant painting of cobain
" yeah , " frances bean cobain says with a grin and mock - exasperation , " looking at my dad every day
" ( preview the cover story and listen to a previously unheard cobain song here
) that is one of many stories and revelations that come out over almost three hours late one afternoon in early march , as frances bean cobain , now 22 and a visual artist , speaks publicly for the first time about her father ; life after his death ; her complex relationship with her mother , courtney love ; and the new film , written , directed and produced by morgen
" cobain got to the point where he eventually had to sacrifice every bit of who he was to his art , because the world demanded it of him , " frances bean cobain says bluntly at one point
" rolling stone : listen to a previously unheard cobain song but " in reality , if he had lived , " she goes on , " i would have had a dad
how would you describe " montage of heck " ? it 's emotional journalism
it 's the closest thing to having cobain tell his own story in his own words -- by his own aesthetic , his own perception of the world
when morgen and i first met , i was very specific about what i wanted to see , how i wanted cobain to be represented
i told him , " i do n't want the mythology of cobain or the romanticism
" even though cobain died in the most horrific way possible , there is this mythology and romanticism that surrounds him , because he 's 27 forever
cobain has gotten to icon status because he will never age
rolling stone : 17 young innovators shaking up the music industry there is , with any great artist , a little manic - ness and insanity
do you remember the first time you heard a montage of heck record -- and knowing that was your father ? i 've talked to sean lennon about this
but for him , the records were a road into understanding his father after he was gone
i do n't really like montage of heck that much [ grins ]
it 's a stripped - down version of cobain 's perception of himself -- of himself on drugs , off drugs , feeling inadequate to be titled the voice of a generation
rolling stone : elton john , michael stipe defend transgender prisoners ' rights the irony is that he wrote it before montage of heck made nevermind
did you feel awkward as a teenager , not being that interested in the music cobain made ? no. i would have felt more awkward if i 'd been a fan
if cobain had just been another guy who abandoned his family in the most awful way possible
after the first screening i attended , there was a guy who said " montage of heck " was a very interesting film about people he did n't like
rolling stone : a guide to cobain 's cinematic legacy i found it interesting that the way morgen told cobain 's story did n't evoke any sympathy for that viewer -- that cobain 's art did not resonate with him
for me , the film provided a lot more factual information about my father -- not just tall tales that were misconstrued , misremembered , rehashed , retold 10 different ways
it was factual evidence of who my father was as a child , as a teenager , as a man , as a husband , as an artist
and they had what i call the " k. c. jeebies , " which is when they see me , they see cobain
dave said , " she is so much like cobain
i was sitting in a chair , chain - smoking , looking down like this [ affects total boredom ]
and they went , " you are doing exactly what your father would have done
it was a cool experience , like having a montage of heck reunion minus one
what do you want to do next , now that this film is coming out ? in being one of the executive producers , you 're stepping into the public at almost the same age your father was when he made montage of heck 's first album
oddly enough , being 22 , it 's the first year a fire has been lit under my ass -- not because of the documentary , just personally
