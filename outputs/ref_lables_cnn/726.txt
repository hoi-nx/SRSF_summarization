and her book on iraq became required reading for many military leaders trying to understand the country
her 1992 book " passion and politics : the turbulent world of the arabs " helped bridge gaps in understanding between arabs and americans , critics wrote
mackey wrote for the people she knew , in a layman 's language that was rooted in her training as a high school history teacher
" scholars may be put off by mackey 's occasionally florid , bombastic language , but her work is a sound analysis and a sympathetic yet balanced effort to explain arabs perspectives to americans , " elizabeth r. hayford wrote in library journal
for her book on iran , mackey was three times able to win permission to travel through the country unaccompanied , allowing her to paint an intimate portrait of a country going through extraordinary change
her 2002 book " the reckoning -- iraq and the legacy of saddam hussein " portended some of the outcomes of the war in iraq -- but also drew some sharp criticism
" if war prevails , we shall beget a greater disorder in the persian gulf , " mackey wrote in the book
" we will be sucked into the resentments of the arabs world , the hostilities of the iraqi , and the challenge of nation building in what has become an intensely tribal society at the core of americans vital interests in the oil - rich persian gulf
" the crowds in baghdad and basra ( like the crowds in kabul that greeted their liberators with kites and music ) may yet embarrass mackey and the countless naive people who see things her way , " ajami wrote for the new york times ' sunday book review cover story in 2002
her book on iraq was published one year before the americans - led invasion of the country in 2003
" in a perfect world , shia , sunni , and kurd , followed by a company of other minorities , would walk into the iraq as a liberated people united by common suffering , " mackey wrote
" she said those calling for an invasion of iraq " can not ignore the threats to americans security that could come with saddam hussein 's demise
" " with americans troops on the ground and no governing authority capable of taking charge , the americans faces the real possibility of a secular version of militant islam , " mackey said
" in 2004 the americans military actually flew mackey to iraq to teach commanders from the army 's 1st infantry division while the war was still raging
