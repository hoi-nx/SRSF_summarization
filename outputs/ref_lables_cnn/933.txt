i would have done anything to get to europe
it was worth the risk , the bad treatment and the fear , hard as that may be to believe
simply put , i have a better life now than i did before
but my journey across the mediterranean , like those of thousands of other migrants , was n't easy
i 'm syrian , and returning to syrian was n't an option -- going back means you either have to kill or be killed
but syrian do n't need visas to get into turkey , so turkey it was
i arrived in the country in december with an old dream in my mind : reaching europe
while in istanbul , i discovered many facebook pages about illegal smuggling from turkey to italy by sea
i met a syrian guy in a hotel in mersin who had already paid money to one smuggler and was planning to depart within a few days
he told me his smuggler was a decent man with a great reputation
but why would n't they be ? it 's a long - term business , and the syrian conflict is n't ending anytime soon
we spoke about terms of payment and agreed on a fee of $ 6,500
when i reached italy the money would be released to the smuggler -- or , if i changed my mind , i 'd be able to get some of it back
" be ready all day , every day for the next few days , because you might receive the call to go , " the smuggler told me
one evening a few days later , i got the call and my journey began
it was just as the smuggler described
on the fourth day we started our journey with a mix of excitement and fear -- fear that this madness often ends in tragedy , ends with us as numbers piled on top of all the other unfortunate , nameless numbers who never made it to the other side
but there was no going back -- it 's a one - way ticket
luckily , before long , a cypriot coast guard ship arrived to rescue us and deport us back to turkey
turkey authorities fingerprinted and released us within a few hours
when they asked me what i planned to do , i told them i would do it again tomorrow if i could -- another journey through a sea where no prayer works , where no one is bigger than nature , where you can feel so small , no matter how big your dreams are
so i called the smuggler the same night i was released , and said i wanted to get on the next ship out
it took five days to get everyone on board the ship -- 391 of us in total , refugees from cities all over syrian
seven days in , despite the poor conditions , everything was going well and we were nearing the island - dotted seas near greece
on the eleventh day , 200 miles off the coast of southern italy our guides began to alert italy authorities to our presence
why migrants head to mediterranean they took us to catania , on sicily , where we finally reached land a day later
when we arrived , the first thing the italy authorities did was look after the urgent medical cases
they took us to a refugee camp and the only thing anyone talked about was being fingerprinted
" later that night a moroccan - italy man told us not to worry : " they will not fingerprint you
twelve days after it began , our journey to europe was over
i spent two days in sicily before making my way first to milan with two syrian guys who had become friends
