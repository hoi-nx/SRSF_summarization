have you ever found the creative inspiration you were seeking at the most unexpected time , or thought you were having that long - awaited problem - solving epiphany just as you nodded off to sleep ? according to neuroscientists john kounios and mark beeman , there 's a reason for that
their book , " the eureka factor " , explores the influences at work behind that much sought - after " aha ! " moment
research suggests that in trying to conjure up inspiration , most of us end up suppressing it
the book explains how to clear out mental junk , in order to make way for pivotal revelations
dr. john kounios explained : " insights involve unusual connections
cognitive psychologists call these ' remote associations '
they are processed mostly in the brain 's right hemisphere
insights occur when a subconscious remote association suddenly pops into awareness
this is accompanied by a burst of activity in the brain 's right temporal lobe
" " we wrote " the eureka factor " to help people understand how creative insight works in the brain so they can use various strategies harmoniously without having them cross-circuit each other , " said john kounios
" for example , there is evidence that imagining the future helps to put someone in an insightful state
however , if a person imagines a specific future that makes them anxious , then insightfulness could decrease because anxiety is a creativity killer
" " that said , a positive mood and a broad , expansive spread of attention are a couple of key features of the insightful state , " he added
following are some of the tips they suggest for unleashing your creative potential -- both at home and at work
