on october 31 , 2014 , the italy government announced the end of " mare nostrum " -- a naval mission that rescued would - be migrants in peril as they tried to cross the mediterranean to seek security and a new life in europe
in the operation 's year - long existence , the italian navy and coastguard had rescued an estimated 100,000 people
but it proved expensive and politically contentious , and europe was not prepared to help italy shoulder the burden of the crisis
without europe support , the italy government cut back the naval assets dedicated to rescuing migrants
mare nostrum , which had been launched after some 600 people died when two migrant ships sank in 2013 , was replaced by the more modest " triton , " under the auspices of the european union 's border agency , frontex
triton has about one - third of the funding of mare nostrum , with just six ships and patrol boats , two planes and one helicopter
at its inception , klaus rosler , operations director for frontex , said " triton is not a replacement for mare nostrum
it argues that search and rescue operations in international waters are " an unintended ' pull factor , ' encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths
similarly , the opposition northern league in italy opposed mare nostrum , accusing it of enticing migrants
italy -- the europe state whose territory is closest to libyan -- has borne the brunt of the task of picking up , sheltering and providing food and medical help to the illegal migrants
in 2014 , 170,000 migrants arrived in italy by sea
italy ships have picked up about 11,000 migrants in the past week alone
italy prime minister matteo renzi has said the mediterranean is a sea , not a cemetery
" italy has also led calls for an international peacekeeping issue to help restore stability in libyan , not least in an effort to tackle the flow of migrants , many of whom set out from around misrata and other ports in the west of the country
junker said the current budget of frontex - some 90 million euros ( $ 97 million ) - was " a good start but does not yet equal the task of protecting europe 's common borders
" that money has to cover all frontex 's roles -- and it 's not only the italy coast that is being targeted by migrants
according to the un 's refugee agency , 219,000 refugees and migrants crossed the mediterranean last year
