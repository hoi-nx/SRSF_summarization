tuesday , april 14 , is equal pay day
here 's the announcement presidential candidate hillary clinton should make : " today in america , women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar men earn
and the gap is even greater for women of color
and so , i 'm announcing that if elected president , i will take a 23 % pay cut , equivalent to the current gender wage gap , to stand in solidarity with working women in america
" april 14 was n't just chosen at random as equal pay day
it 's based on a calculation : for women to make the same amount of money that men made in 2014 , they 'd have to work until april 14 , 2015
merely closing the gender wage gap would pull half of working single moms out of poverty
and at a time where republicans are still , bizarrely , trumpeting more tax breaks for business and the rich to stimulate the economy , closing the pay gap would put money in the pockets of working people who would actually spend and stimulate real growth
the new women warriors : reviving the fight for equal rights so here 's the perfect opportunity for hillary clinton to put her money where her mouth is , literally
opinion : the myth of equal pay day with her video , clinton has signaled a clear desire to ground herself and her candidacy in the soil of populism
because what clinton would be reminding us is that across america , the aggregate salaries of all working women is 23 % less than the aggregate salaries of all men
78 cents on the dollar : the facts about the gender wage gap thanks to the hacked sony emails , we saw that even top female stars and executives in hollywood are paid less than their male counterparts
what more powerful message could the potential first female president send than literally signifying that nationwide inequity in her own salary ? clinton would n't just be saying she stands with the working women of america , she 'd be showing it
is it offensive to suggest that the first female commander in chief should be paid 23 % less than her male predecessors for doing exactly the same work ? yes
and that 's the point -- to use her status to highlight the offensive gender wage gap and what clinton , as president , would do to fix it
map : where the gender pay gap is the widest clinton did an arguably brilliant thing in her campaign launch , framing her video and presidential bid as not about her but the america people
in fact , clinton did n't even appear in the video until the very end -- it was all about middle - class americans , working hard , trying to get by and get ahead
