ali addeh refugee camp , djibouti henol and mebratu emerge from their current home , a modest structure with plastic sheeting serving as its roof , carrying the " master folder
" one of the most important documents on the camp , it 's a record of each eritrean 's name and their case -- whether they 've been granted refugee status , whether they 've had their resettlement interview , whether they 've attempted the journey to europe by sea , and whether they 've survived it
in the past few days , news -- from the network of friends and family across the world -- came in that 20 new dots needed to be scratched in -- for the 20 friends who 'd drowned off the shores of italy
for 25 years , ali addeh refugee camp has been a holding point for those fleeing into djibouti , which borders eritrean , ethiopia and somalia in the horn of africa
across the ethiopia border , through to sudan and then up and across into libya -- from where the migrant ships operated by human traffickers set sail at high tide
they 'd grown up together -- even made the risky journey to djibouti together
it was the first time they 'd been separated in years
eritrean is ranked as one of the most repressive countries in the world , with an aging dictator enforcing a brutal regime of forced conscription to the army that rights groups believe is a cover for mass exploitation
elected by the country 's national assembly in 1993 , isaias afewerki runs what is essentially a one - party state
back in djibouti we find a man who is willing to speak , as long as we obscure his identity
with his face in shadow he haltingly tells us that the last time he saw his father was 20 years ago -- the night his mother was killed trying to stop the men who came to take him away
as soon as he was old enough , he says he made his first attempt at crossing into djibouti
he understands why others have pinned their hopes on people smugglers and leaky vessels
" people risk their lives , " he says , " for a better life
" people come to djibouti and look at someone like me who 's been waiting so long and think there is no hope
