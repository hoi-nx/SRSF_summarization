last month 's so - so jobs numbers confirm the challenges our economy still faces
and unemployment may still be at 5.5 % , but there is wide concern among labor experts and economists that too much job growth is in part - time low - income work
low - wage workers have been the hardest hit since the onset of the financial crisis , and low - wage jobs remain a fixture of the new economy
nearly 60 % of the people in american 's workforce are paid hourly and work part - time
most part - time employees are doing low - wage work
but there is a simple step we can take to improve the conditions of low - wage workers today
congress should help low - wage workers gain access to predictable work schedules
here is how this issue works : american 's major fast - food chains , retailers and department stores use " just - in - time " scheduling to maximize profit , which in turn creates unstable and stressful work environments for low - wage workers
this type of scheduling has increased dramatically because of sophisticated software that ties staffing to expected customer traffic
algorithms , built on sales and economic data , provide real - time information for managers to make personnel adjustments
not surprisingly , such haphazard scheduling wreaks havoc with low - wage workers
hourly low - income workers endure significantly greater fluctuations in their hours and less predictability in how much they earn than full - time employees
a university of chicago study found that 41 % of early career hourly workers and 47 % who work part - time received a week or less of notice of their work schedules
women comprise over two - thirds of the nearly 20 million workers in low - wage jobs like home health care , fast food work , and cash services
similarly , a large proportion of minorities work low - wage jobs
child care is the primary casualty of just - in - time scheduling
unions , for example , have provided little protection against just - in - time scheduling because of their nascent role in the service economy
washington ignores the problem because congressional republicans have shown little interest in the plight of low - wage workers
last summer , the schedules that work act was introduced in congress
according to the national women 's law center , the bill would provide workers the right to request and receive predictable work schedules , receive compensation for sudden scheduling changes , and not fear retaliation if they request scheduling accommodations from their boss
conversely , just - in - time scheduling increases worker turnover and hurts worker satisfaction
our leaders have the unique responsibility to protect american and attend to the critical economic challenges of our time
