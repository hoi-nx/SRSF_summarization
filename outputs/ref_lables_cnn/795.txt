marine life seen swimming in unusual places
water temperatures warmer than they should be
no snow where there should be feet of it
some scientists are saying " the blob " could be playing a factor
but if you 're a salmon fisherman in washington or a california resident hoping to see the end of the drought , the blob could become an enemy of top concern
a university of washington climate scientist and his associates have been studying the blob -- a huge area of unusually warm water in the pacific -- for months
" in the fall of 2013 and early 2014 we started to notice a big , almost circular mass of water that just did n't cool off as much as it usually did , so by spring of 2014 it was warmer than we had ever seen it for that time of year , " said bond , who works at the joint institute for the study of the atmosphere and ocean in seattle , washington
bond , who gave the blob its name , said it was 1,000 miles long , 1,000 miles wide and 100 yards deep in 2014 -- and it has grown this year
waters in the blob have been warmer by about 5.5 degrees , a significant rise
a recent set of studies published in geophysical research letters by bond 's group points to a high - pressure ridge over the west coast that has calmed ocean waters for two winters
according to new scientist magazine , some marine species are exploring the warmer waters , leading some fish to migrate hundreds of miles from their normal habitats
and he was worried about the adult pacific salmon that normally feed on tiny crustaceans and other food sources that are not around in the same numbers off the coast of the pacific northwest
it appears that food has moved to cooler waters
" we have been seeing emaciated or dehydrated sea lions show up on beaches , " justin greenman , assistant stranding coordinator for noaa on the west coast , told cnn
for the past few years , that persistent ridge of high pressure has kept the west coast dry and warm , exacerbating the drought in california , oregon and washington
this year it hit an all - time low at 1.4 inches of water content in the snow , just 5 % of the annual average
( pdf ) gov. jerry brown , in announcing water restrictions the same day , stood on a patch of dry , brown grass in the sierra nevada mountains that is usually blanketed by up to 5 feet of snow
with warmer air in california , areas at higher elevations that usually see snow have seen rain instead
there are some that think it might be a pacific decadal oscillation , a long - lasting el nino - like pattern in the pacific
