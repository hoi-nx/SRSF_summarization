the third blood moon in a four - part series was the shortest eclipse of the bunch , but still a sweet treat for early risers in north america
the moon slipped fully into earth 's shadow at 4:58 a.m. pt ( 7:58 a.m. et ) saturday , starting a total lunar eclipse for nearly five minutes -- what nasa says will be the shortest such eclipse of the century
the celestial body took on a burnt - orange tint in the minutes before , during and after the total eclipse , giving the moon the appearance that earns total eclipses the " blood moon " nickname
watchers in the eastern half of north america caught only a partial eclipse -- and in some places , an orange one -- before the moon set below the horizon
people from the u.s. west coast to australia were able to catch the total eclipse
parts of south america , india , china and russia were able to see at least parts of the event , but it was n't visible in greenland , iceland , europe , africa or the middle east
