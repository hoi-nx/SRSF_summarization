just before writing this column , i reached into the depths of my wallet , and in between the pilot licenses , i slid out a postage stamp - size certificate issued by the faa
the online course verifies that i am knowledgeable to fly a plane under visual flight rules into the most highly restricted u.s. airspace in the country
although a " no - fly zone " over the white house has long existed , the sfra airspace was developed to protect the washington area further after the 9/11 terrorist attacks
the size of the sfra airspace is designed to be large enough to give our defense forces enough time to determine if a threat exists from an aircraft entering it , an opportunity to identify the threat , and if necessary , to divert or eliminate it
at the 30 - mile radius , all aircraft must file a flight plan that identifies itself to air traffic control via a specific four - digit transponder code ( a transponder is an electronic communication device that identifies a specific airplane on an air traffic controller 's display screen to indicate authorization for the flight )
as a matter of standard procedure , flights using an instrument flight rule flight plan have specific clearances with specific transponder codes , so the authorization for transit through the sfra airspace is already built into the system
why do i carry the certificate as an airline pilot ? i have had occasion to fly my own little airplane through the airspace on a visual flight rule flight plan
pilot who landed gyrocopter blogged about why noncompliance with the airspace requirements , or worse , no communication at all , carries some serious federal penalties , which could include the suspension or revocation of your pilot license
so how does a flying machine that looks like a sophisticated lawn chair with helicopter blades invade such highly restricted airspace , as happened wednesday , when a postal carrier from florida landed a single - person aircraft on capitol grounds ? well , i 'm making an assumption based on the video footage , but it appears that this aircraft is classified by the faa as a gyrocopter
it also appears that this particular gyrocopter may weigh just under 255 pounds , which classifies it as an ultralight aircraft in faa parlance
lawmaker looking into gyrocopter landing as pilot goes to court a facility tracking the movement of this particular gyrocopter on radar would witness a speed probably attainable by the average canadian goose
