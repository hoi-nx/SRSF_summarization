on april 20 , 2010 , a final cement seal of an oil well in the gulf failed , causing what has been called the worst environmental disaster in u.s. history and taking the lives of 11 rig workers
the federal government estimated 4.2 million barrels of oil spilled into the gulf , but bp argued in court that it was much lower
a judge ruled bp was responsible for the release of 3.1 million barrels
imagining daddy : a rig worker 's daughter and her dreams there were dire predictions of what would follow
scientists continue to study environmental impacts , but five years after the spill , the long - term negative effects remain unclear and are , in many cases , highly disputed
bp , the company that caused the spill , is eager to point out it appears the gulf is healing itself
bp 's vice president of communications , morrell , said there is no doubt birds , fish , turtles , sub-sea vegetation and even sediment species were all affected in the immediate aftermath of the spill
" " and there is no data that suggests there are any long - term population - level impacts to any species
" while bp 's assessment has not been disproven , the government suggests it 's too soon to make long - term conclusions about the rebounding health of the gulf
shortly after bp released its own five - year report that concluded the gulf has largely recovered , the trustees of the natural resource damage assessment called bp 's report " inappropriate as well as premature
" one government official familiar with the trustee 's assessment accused bp of having " cherry - picked " positive results while ignoring others , something bp denies
most long - term scientific studies on environmental disasters take longer than the five years that have passed
studies suggest the diseases dolphins suffer from in places like barataria bay , louisiana , could be caused by oil exposure , but direct links to the 2010 macondo well spill have not been proven
while aerial surveys taken in 2010 suggest tens of thousands of sea turtles were exposed to oil in coastal waters , government agencies are still gathering data and have not concluded if the spill will have long - term effects on sea turtle populations
but perhaps the greatest unknown is what , if anything , millions of gallons of oil on the deep seafloor are doing to the overall environment of the gulf itself
her research and other studies show bp 's oil is scattered in patches across more than 1,200 square miles of the seafloor
bp does n't accept the results of joye 's work
and according to bp 's morrell , the oil and residue that remains is no longer harmful
ocean conservationist cousteau witnessed much of the spill 's aftermath in 2010 , but when he returned to the gulf to dive near an oil rig last month , he was astonished by the abundance of amberjacks , hammerhead sharks and other marine life he saw
