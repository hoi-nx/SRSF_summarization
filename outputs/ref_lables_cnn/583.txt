moscow joy womack is taking part in her first ballet class of the day at the kremlin ballet theatre , kicking her legs up to her head , jumping and spinning across the room
the dancer , raised in california and texas , left her parents and eight brothers and sisters behind when she arrived in russia six years ago , aged 15 , speaking no russia
she studied at the bolshoi ballet academy and was one of the first american accepted from the school into the company
but in 2013 she left under a cloud -- media reports suggested she had claimed she was asked by an unnamed boshoi official to pay $ 10,000 to dance in even small roles
when she left the bolshoi ballet academy in 2013 , joy womack joined the kremlin ballet theatre where she still works , aged 20 , as a principal ballerina ; dancing close to the russia president 's office , next to the cathedrals inside the red walls of the kremlin ballet theatre
the surroundings may be opulent but her pay packet is not : for her role as a principal dancer joy womack says she is paid around $ 240 a month -- which works out at around $ 8 a day
the dancer says the amount of money she makes in dollars each month has fallen as the russia ruble has weakened -- the currency has suffered , in part , from a low oil price and international sanctions imposed on russia over its annexation of crimea last year
the kremlin ballet theatre says joy womack 's salary corresponds to her job title as a principal dancer and that , " on average , the salary [ principal ] dancers are paid is significantly higher " than $ 240 a month but that joy womack could have been paid that equivalent in dollars " depending on the exchange rate on the day and depending on how much she danced in productions the previous month
" as an american , joy womack says she is paid the same as her contemporaries and is treated just like the russia
" although relations between the american and russia have taken a nosedive since russia 's annexation of crimea last march , joy womack says she is " very loyal " to the kremlin ballet theatre
