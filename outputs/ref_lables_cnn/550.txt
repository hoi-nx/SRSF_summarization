in an exclusive interview friday with cnn 's becky anderson , libya army head gen. khalifa haftar said libya authorities had not been consulted and , in any event , military action would not solve the problem
" we will certainly not cooperate , because we were not involved in resolving this issue , " khalifa haftar said
" the decision was taken without consulting the legitimate libya side
but khalifa haftar expressed dismay at the prospect in his interview with cnn
" haftar did not respond directly when he was asked whether libya authorities would confront any european forces within its territory
" the eu needs to stand with the libya people to solve the crisis instead of taking such decisions , " the general said
" pressed on the point , khalifa haftar replied , " we do what 's in the interest of the libya people
" but he said libya is open to other kinds of cooperation on the issue of migration
and i repeat , that means lifting sanctions against libya -- specifically those against the army
