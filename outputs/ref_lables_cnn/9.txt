the arizona police officer who intentionally slammed his car into an armed suspect previously faced an excessive force lawsuit in new york , according to court documents
officer rapiejko was with the nypd from 2003 to 2006
two years after he left , he was one of the defendants in a suit filed by a man who alleged that rapiejko pointed a gun and threatened to shoot him and handcuffed and choked him in front of his family during a 2005 arrest
the lawsuit said colon had parked his car and gotten out when rapiejko , with his gun aimed at colon , ordered him back into the car
colon and the city settled the suit for $ 20,000
the settlement said the defendants were not admitting to any wrongdoing rapiejko had resigned voluntarily in 2006 , and there is no indication of any disciplinary action against him from the nypd , a senior law enforcement official told cnn
the nypd has said that it will not release further details about rapiejko
rapiejko 's actions in marana , arizona , in which he drove his patrol car into a man who had fired a rifle in the air minutes earlier and before that had pointed the gun at another officer , have stirred debate about what type of force police should have used
marana police chief rozema was asked wednesday on cnn 's " new day " whether police were fortunate that valencia did n't die
video from rapiejko 's camera shows the officer 's vehicle running into valencia , with the windshield smashing as the car hits the wall
police in marana justified rapiejko 's actions
" and then we 're answering some completely different questions : ' why did n't you act sooner ? ... this guy had a gun ... why did n't you stop this guy before he shot my wife , before he shot my husband , before he shot my child ? ' " valencia 's attorney , cohen-metzger , told cnn on tuesday that " it is miraculous that my client is n't dead
