irbil , iraq isis claimed it controlled part of iraq 's largest oil refinery sunday , posting images online that purported to show the storming of the facility , fierce clashes and plumes of smoke rising above the contested site
by sunday , isis said its fighters were inside the refinery and controlled several buildings , but iraq government security officials denied that claim and insisted iraq forces remain in full control
it would n't be the first time that militants and iraq forces have battled over the refinery , a key strategic resource that has long been a lucrative target because the facility refines much of the fuel used by iraq domestically
