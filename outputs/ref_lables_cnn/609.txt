would a taste of the finest switzerland chocolate make you happy ? or soaking in the warm icelandic springs ? perhaps the great jazz and rock music scene in danish is for you ? it 's not just the fun activities that make locals and travelers to those countries happy , according to the third world happiness report , released by the sustainable development solutions network for the united nations on april 23
people who live in the happiest countries have longer life expectancies and more social support , experience more generosity , have more freedom to make life choices , have lower perceptions of corruption and have a higher gross domestic product per capita , the report shows
the tiny country of bhutan , a very happy country famous for measuring the " gross national happiness " of its people , gets the credit for focusing world attention on happiness : its prime minister proposed the idea of a world happiness day to the united nations in 2011
recognizing " happiness and well - being as universal goals and aspirations in the lives of human beings around the world , " the u.n. general assembly declared march 20 as world happiness day in 2012
this officially designated happy date marked its fourth year last month
through the happiness report , the sustainable development solutions network hopes to encourage governments at every level to measure and improve their people 's happiness
" there is no single key to happiness , " said jeffrey sachs , the network 's director and an economics professor at columbia university
" all of these countries do well in several ways
being rich ? that 's good , but it 's only a modest part of the story
trusting society , having a government that ranks on low in corruption , a society where people are generous and volunteering -- all of these are important for happiness
" even if you do n't live in one of the 10 happiest countries in the world , a visit to these happy places will give you a taste of what the locals enjoy every day
here are the top 10 happiest places on earth , according to the world happiness report
