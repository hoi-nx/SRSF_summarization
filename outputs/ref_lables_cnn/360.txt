on the surface , the mix - up seems incomprehensible : how can a volunteer sheriff 's deputy accidentally fire a handgun instead of a taser , killing a man ? that 's apparently what happened in tulsa , oklahoma , when a 73 - year - old reserve deputy , robert bates , killed harris
robert bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead
i 'm sorry , " robert bates said in a video of the shooting
in a well - publicized 2009 case , a bay area rapid transit police officer fired his gun instead of his taser , killing 22 - year - old oscar grant in oakland , california
the former officer , oscar grant , testified that he had meant to use his taser but drew his gun instead
so how easy -- or hard -- is it to draw and fire a handgun mistakenly instead of a taser ? here are some factors to consider : law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer 's dominant side of the body , and the taser should be placed on the nondominant side
so if an officer is left - handed , the gun should be on the left side
robert bates ' attorney said his client is left - handed
" i shoot long guns left handed and handguns right handed , " robert bates said in a written statement to investigators
after robert bates announced at the scene he was going to use his taser , he " used his nondominant hand , and it was the gun , " said brewster , robert bates ' attorney
" he said that he saw the laser sight on the shoulder , assumed it was the taser , " brewster said
" both the gun and the taser have a laser sight , and he just made a mistake
in his statement to investigators , robert bates said he had grabbed a " pepper ball launcher " to try to slow or stop harris , who was running away
robert bates did not say explicitly where the taser was on his body
robert bates is now charged with second - degree manslaughter
deputy who shot harris turns himself in robert bates was carrying his personal gun , a smith & wesson .357 five - shot revolver , and a taser , he said in his statement to investigators
attorneys representing the harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices
" an attorney for the harris family said the " slip and capture " theory has n't held up in court
tuttle , vice president for strategic communications at taser , noted some of those differences to cnn : a gun is heavier
and its training suggests that officers shout aloud , " taser ! taser ! taser ! " as they prepare to deploy it
