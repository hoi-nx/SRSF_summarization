the new study highlights the areas in washington , oregon and california that would require more time to successfully evacuate for higher ground in the case of the next natural disaster
also in danger are 486 public venues , 440 dependent care facilities and 2,314 businesses with a ' significant customer presence '
and some communities can increase their chance of survival simply by walking faster
according to the analysis , 21,562 residents , more than 50 percent of which live in washington , would not have time to evade the tsunami 's waves if they were walking on foot at 2.2 mph
and 90 per cent of the 20,000 people who live in the two communities most at - risk , aberdeen and hoquiam in washington , could reach safety by just walking at a normal pace
but there are the coastal towns who would n't have the time to evacuate on foot , no matter how fast they walk or run , according to the analysis , conducted by the us geological survey , the university of colorado , boulder and california state university , sacramento
according to wood , these specific communities need to instead work toward designing and constructing tsunami evacuation structures so that reaching higher ground is n't necessary
