the ibrox board last week launched a probe into claims mike ashley âs firm had taken ownership of intellectual property , including the club âs famous crests
however , they are satisfied the position stems solely from the security attached to the loan from sports direct , accepted by the former regime in january
â although the trademarks are registered in sports direct âs name , the position is not as alarming as it may first appear
â confusion over ownership arose last week when it was noticed on a government intellectual property site that they appeared to be the possessions of sports direct but this was as a consequence of the loan facility entered into by the previous board
in return for the loan , sports direct took security over all rangers assets â but not ibrox â including intellectual property owned by the club
