in 84 days from november 2013 to january 2014 , the area around azle , texas , shook with 27 magnitude two or greater earthquakes
now scientists believe these earthquakes were the result of high - pressure injection of drilling wastewater into the ground
in this image red squares are injector locations ; pink arrows , approximate location of two large brine production wells that are located both near the faults and near reported earthquakes swarms the oil and gas industry uses injection wells to get rid of wastewater , which can have chemicals , heavy metals , salt and radioactive material
the scientists determined this based on where and when the earthquakes happened ; computer models that track pressure changes ; and company data from nearby wells
' this adds to other studies that linked injecting wastewater from energy wells to a tremendous jump in earthquakes in oklahoma and southern kansas
the map shows inferred faults ( dashed ) at the top of the blenburger formation , injection wells ( red squares ) , two production wells ( api 36734045 and 36734139 ) with significant brine production near the faults ( pink arrows ) and earthquake epicentres ( coloured circles ) recorded by the temporary seismic network ( triangles ) in these areas , there have been more than 950 magnitude 2 or higher quakes so far this year , according to the usgs
earlier today , the oklahoma geological society said it is ' very likely ' that most of the earthquakes that have shaken the state in recent years have been triggered by the subsurface injection of wastewater from oil and natural gas drilling operations
the fluid pressure in the pores and fractures of the rocks is called the ' pore pressure
' the pore pressure acts against the weight of the rock and the forces holding the rock together
if the pore pressures are low - especially compared to the forces holding the rock together - then only the imbalance of natural in situ earth stresses will cause an occasional earthquake
injecting fluids into the subsurface is one way of increasing the pore pressure and causing faults and fractures to ' fail ' more easily

azle sits atop the large underground barrett shale natural gas formation
' the texas railroad commission , the state 's oil and gas regulator , hired its first seismologist last year to investigate potential links between quakes and fracking after azle residents asked the agency to halt oil and gas activities
