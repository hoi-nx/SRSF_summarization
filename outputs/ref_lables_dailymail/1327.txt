global warming has n't happened as fast as expected , according to a new study based on 1,000 years of temperature records
the research claims that natural variability in surface temperatures over the course of a decade can account for increases and dips in warming rates
but it adds that these so - called ' climate wiggles ' could also , in the future , cause our planet to warm up much faster than anticipated
the latest study , however , says this climate model may be wrong the study compared its results to the most severe emissions scenarios outlined by the ipcc ( ipcc )
' the duke university - led study says that variability is caused by interactions between the ocean and atmosphere , and other natural factors
they claim these ' wiggles ' can slow or speed the rate of warming from decade to decade , and exaggerate or offset the effects of increases in greenhouse gas concentrations
summary of projected changes in crop yields in a previous ipcc report
because ' climate wiggles ' were not accounted for , the duke university researchers say the report may have been an over-interpretation of short - term temperature trends the research , uses observed data , rather than the more commonly used climate models , to estimate decade - to - decade variability
' at any given time , we could start warming at a faster rate if greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere increase without any offsetting changes in aerosol concentrations or natural variability , ' said li , assistant professor of climate at duke university , who conducted the study with brown
the team examined whether climate models , such as those used by the ipcc , accurately account for natural chaotic variability that can occur in the rate of global warming
to test these , created a new statistical model based on reconstructed empirical records of surface temperatures over the last 1,000 years
' by comparing our model against theirs , we found that climate models largely get the ' big picture ' right but seem to underestimate the magnitude of natural decade - to - decade climate wiggles , ' brown said
' ' statistically , it 's pretty unlikely that an 11 - year hiatus in warming , like the one we saw at the start of this century , would occur if the underlying human - caused warming was progressing at a rate as fast as the most severe ipcc projections , ' brown said
