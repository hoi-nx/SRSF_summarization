' there 's no cafetiere and there 's no corkscrew ! ' listening to my husband dominic 's rant minutes into our family eurocamp adventure i was reminded that i 'm not married to bear grylls
but his gripes were soon drowned out by the whoops of delight from our two young boys as they bounced on the beds â¦ ' bunk beds ! in a tent ! ' - their tiny heads about to explode in excitement
a full - blown corkscrew crisis was quickly averted as we befriended our better - equipped neighbours and , once the wine was flowing , we were able to take in our surroundings
jake and seb for their cave adventure it 's not advertised as ' glamping ' but with big duvets and brass beds , eurocamp 's safari tents are more luxurious than an average stay under canvas
we visited l'ardã©choise site in the stunning ardã¨che region in south central france at the end of august
about an hour - and - half 's drive from the beaches of the south and montpellier airport , it 's known as the gastronomic centre of france
l'ardã©choise is a quiet , well - established , family friendly site nestled on the banks of the picturesque ardã¨che river
for us , entertaining our boys jake , six , and seb , four , is the number one priority on holiday - that and escaping the chaos that is our life in london
this site is a five - star park - at the top end of what 's on offer in france
with four pools and a camp ' animateur ' organising activities for little ones , it did n't disappoint
the big hit for our boys was the pool complex - it included a waterfall and ' rapids ' section that kept them amused for hours
the other attraction was other children 's toys , and we spent a great deal of our time returning them to our neighbours ' tents to preserve community relations and other parents ' sanity
the region is famous for having the world 's oldest cave paintings at chauvet-pont - d'arc for me , getting away from work does n't mean switching off from the news entirely , and with wi - fi availa - ble across the site and daily english papers , i kept up to date from the comfort of my sunlounger
there were some jokers on site who referred to our area as the un enclave , due to the beige ' refugee camp ' appearance of our tents
kayaking on the ardã¨che is the number one tourist attraction ( lower age limit seven )
this region is also famous for the world 's oldest cave paintings at chauvet-pont-d'arc and there are hundreds of underground grottos
with four pools and a camp ' animateur ' organising activities for little ones , the park did n't disappoint the campsite has immaculate facilities and feels safe and relaxed so it 's perfect for families at the end of a long day 's sightseeing a surprisingly good restaurant on site made life easy on the days we did n't fancy cooking
we met many families at l'ardã©choise who had returned from previous years
