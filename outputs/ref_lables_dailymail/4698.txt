in a study they found that the reverberation of sound helps us locate the distance of , for example , a car passing round a bend or a person nearby the research was conducted by scientists from the university of connecticut and published in the journal of neuroscience
they said that echoes and fluctuations in volume are the cues we use to figure out the distance between us and the source of a noise
the researchers suspected that the effect echoes had on volume - or amplitude modulation - could be key in our ability to perceive a sound 's distance from us
when the rabbit heard the simulated sounds , certain types of ic neurons fired more when the sound was closer - when there was a bigger difference between the sound 's maximum and minimum volume
the farther away the source of a sound is from a listener , meanwhile , the more echoes there are , and the more limited the changes in volume become
the researchers say that the effect echoes have on volume - or amplitude modulation - could be key in our ability to perceive a sound 's distance from us
without amplitude modulation , for example in an anechoic ( echo - free ) room , pictured , a person ca n't tell how far away a noise is from them the results suggest that , as a sound gets further away , our brains are able to work out the differences in its maximum and minimum volume - and thus its distance
' reverberation is usually considered a bad thing , ' detrimental to hearing clearly , said dr shigeyuki kuwada , co-author on the university of connecticut study
