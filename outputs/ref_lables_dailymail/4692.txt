when high - energy electrons and ions from the sun hit earth âs upper atmosphere , they can excite atoms and create fantastic colours - which we see on the ground as auroras
and now a study has claimed that we could create our own auroras , by firing a particle accelerator into the sky from space
the intriguing research says that a beam fired from the machine would create artificial auroras â and it could even create lightning in the atmosphere
scientists in california have described how to create artificial auroras on earth
they said a particle accelerator could be sent 185 miles ( 300km ) up into space ( illustration of a satellite in orbit shown )
it would then fire high - energy beams back at earth 's atmosphere the study , published in the journal of geophysical research , was picked up by zastrow from eos
the accelerator would be located in space , 185 miles ( 300km ) above the ground , and would fire back towards earth 's atmosphere
there are two types of auroras on earth - the aurora borealis in the northern hemisphere , known as the northern lights , and the southern lights in the southern hemisphere , known as the southern lights
auroras occur when highly charged electrons from the solar wind collide with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen in the earth 's atmosphere at altitudes from 20 to 200 miles ( 32 to 320km ) above the planet âs surface
â as they descend into the earth âs atmosphere , some of the electrons would strike atmospheric molecules , producing visible aurora - like emission

it was established to analyse the ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and investigate the development of ionospheric enhancement technology the station regularly uses a tool called the haarp ( iri ) , a high - power radio frequency transmitter facility operating in the high frequency band
