scientists have discovered an achilles â heel of prostate cancer that could lead to better treatment for many men diagnosed with the disease british scientists have discovered an â achilles â heel â in prostate cancer which could lead to better treatments
the disease claims almost 11,000 lives a year in the british , with most deaths occurring after it spreads around the body
the latest study gets to the root of this spread , and could mean better outcomes for the 42,000 men a year diagnosed with the illness
scientists funded by cancer research uk studied samples taken from tumours in the prostate and around the body in ten affected men
these cells are the â root â of the cancer and for a treatment to work , they should be destroyed
they could then be given drugs to wipe them out , with each patient âs treatment tailored to the genetic flaw at the root of their cancer
lead study author professor ros eeles , from the institute of cancer research in london , said : â we gained a much broader view of prostate cancer by studying both the original cancer and the cells that had spread to other parts of the body
â samples were taken from tumours in the prostate and around the body in ten men with the disease ( pictured )
