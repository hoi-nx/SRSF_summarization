modern humans have been blamed for killing off the neanderthals by out competing them , breeding with them and even outright murdering them
but new research suggests it may actually have been infectious diseases carried by our modern ancestors as they migrated out of africa that finished them off
scientists studying the latest genetic , fossil and archaeological evidence claim that neanderthals suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today
but anthropologists from cambridge university and oxford brookes university say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of neanderthals
it has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern - day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient neanderthals
neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred , meaning europe now have roughly two per cent neanderthals dna
other researchers have suggested that humans outside africa are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes because they interbred with neanderthals
they speculate that pathogens like heliocbacter pylori , the bacteria that causes stomach ulcers , were brought to europe by modern humans from africa and may have infected neanderthals , who would have been unable to fight off these new diseases
however , neandethals may have also helped modern humans by passing on slivers of immunity against some diseases to our ancestors when they interbred
' the findings add to a growing body of evidence that neanderthals were not as different from modern humans as was originally thought
the new study suggests that neanderthals also suffered from many of the same afflictions and complaints that modern humans experience
dr underdown and his colleague dr charlotte houldcroft , a researcher in infectious diseases at cambridge university and university college london , analysed recent genetic studies on neanderthals and other early humans
infectious bacteria like those that cause tuberculosis , shown above , may have been common in neanderthals most evidence from the fossil record suggest that neanderthals tended to suffer traumatic injuries as a result of their hunter gatherer lifestyle , but there are also signs of inflammation and infection
their study , which is published on the open source database biorxiv , contradicts the common view that infectious diseases only really became a problem for humans in the holocene about 11,000 years ago when humans began living in dense settlements and farming livestock
genetic sequencing of neanderthals and denisovan - another early human ancestor - dna has shown that modern humans have inherited a number of genes from these extinct species
