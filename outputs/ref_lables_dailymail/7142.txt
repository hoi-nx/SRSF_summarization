rant : video shows this woman launching into a fiery spray about islamic , bringing up beheadings and the marriage of children while berating a muslim woman for wearing a black headscarf ms stacey eden , who recorded a snippet of the conversation , fired back at the woman in defence of the muslim couple ( above ) : ' have some respect ... what 's that got to do with this poor lady ? ' a police spokeswoman contacted daily mail australia on thursday to say they would ' definitely encourage ' witnesses of the middle - aged woman 's offensive public transport tirade to come forward
in her recording of the incident , ms stacey eden is heard fuming : ' she wears it ( her hijab ) for herself , ok ! ' ' she wears it because she wants to be modest with her body , not because of people like you who are going to sit there and disrespect her
' ms stacey eden said she became really upset after the woman allegedly branded ' all muslim isis supporters ' and insulted the woman 's husband and headscarf
ms stacey eden was not having a bar of it
ms stacey eden then instructed the woman to be silent
' ms stacey eden recorded a short snippet of the incident - not the whole alleged tirade - on her phone , ending with the passenger telling her to ' breathe '
ms stacey eden told daily mail australia the couple alighted the train at sydney international airport ' i missed my stop because i wanted to stay on and make sure they were ok , ' said ms stacey eden , who was on her way home to mascot ' i missed my stop because i wanted to stay on and make sure they were ok , ' said ms stacey eden , who was on her way home to mascot

the group 's founder , mariam , told daily mail australia incidents of abuse against muslim women were becoming increasingly common
mariam ( pictured ) , a lawyer and public advocate for the rights of muslim , says incidents such as these are increasingly common ' i 'm very conscious of ensuring that i have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure i will be able to record incidents should i either be the victim in an incident ( or a witness ) ' mariam has been the target of racist attacks herself ' it was a fully crowded train but nobody said anything
as for ms stacey eden , she told daily mail australia she was already overwhelmed by positive comments she had received online , having posted the video just yesterday
overwhelming response : ms stacey eden has been bombarded with positive comments since the video appeared online ' i hope some day when you need help and are boxed in a corner someone as bright as you is there to support you just like you did for those poor souls
