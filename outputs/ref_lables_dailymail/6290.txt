new york in the height of summer with children
but take your crew 90 minutes north of the big apple to mohonk mountain house in the heart of the hudson valley and you âll not regret it for a second
the hotel is a faux - gothic victorian castle and may look too faux to european eyes , but the lake , gardens and trails are a vast adventure playground for all ages
a world away : the faux - gothic victorian castle hotel mohonk mountain house enjoys a spectacular location perfect : felix found the hotel , lake , gardens and trails to be an adventure playground for his young family one afternoon , we check our two girls into the kids â club and climb up the labyrinth trail ( one of eight epic scrambles ) to lookout tower on the high bluff above the lake
we use the club as a drop - in once or twice a day , using our free time to explore the 5,000 acres of hotel grounds and the surrounding preserve
water water everywhere : the hotel sits on the banks of lake mohonk in new york state 's hudson valley another afternoon , we check in to the spa ; another morning , we ride eagle ridge on horseback as turkey vultures , red - tailed hawks and bald eagles soar overhead
high on the cliff above is the granary restaurant , a wonderful open - air grill that serves lunch and lobster cook - outs
splash : guests of the hotel can enjoy a day on the lake in canoes , one of many available outdoor activities the hotel began life as a ten - room drinking inn
then , 145 years ago , two quaker twins , quaker twins albert and alfred smiley , fell in love with its setting and bought it to use as a teetotal retreat for the great and good
