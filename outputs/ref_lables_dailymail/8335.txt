the victims of a horrific medical experiment run by the us in guatemala that deliberately infected individuals with syphilis in order to test drugs and study the disease are now suing johns hopkins university
the lawsuit , which has 750 plantiffs and includes victims and their families , is seeking $ 1billion , claiming that officials from hopkins approved the study at the time and even helped to plan and monitor it as it ran from 1945 to 1956
the few victims who are still alive were almost all children when they were unknowingly infected , and many among them were orphans
in the aftermath of the experiment , some of the individuals died of syphilis , with open sores covering their bodies , while those who did survive claim they passed the disease down to their children , ending up with babies that were born blind , severely handicapped , and , in at least one case , without a brain
in addition to orphans , soldiers , prisoners , mental patients and prostitutes were also sought out for the study
prostitutes in particular , who would be injected with the disease and then sent to sleep with prisoners

one was born without a brain , while another was born with syphilis which was left untreated , and is now severely handicapped
another woman , victoria , was born blind , which she believes to be a result of her father having been infected with the disease and , again , not having been treated when she was born with syphilis
federico mesa , like marta orellana , is one of the few original patients still alive
he was a solider at the time he was first infected , and acknowledges that he infected his wife and others with the disease
he was injected with the disease he claims and subjected to numerous tests , and never once told what any of them were for
