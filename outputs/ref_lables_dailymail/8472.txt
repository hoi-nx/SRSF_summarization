a farmer has lost a nine - year legal battle to save the dream home he built without planning permission and hid behind hay bales for four years
robert fidler , 66 , secretly constructed the mock - tudor castle complete with battlements and cannons and lived there with his family from 2002
he unveiled it officially in 2006 when he thought he would be able to exploit a legal loophole that prevents enforcement action against a structure if no objections have been made for at least four years
now , after numerous court appearances costing tens of thousands of pounds , communities and local government secretary eric pickles has finally ruled the four - bedroom home on green belt land at honeycrocks farm in salfords , surrey â worth well in excess of Â£ 1million if sold on the open market - must be pulled down within 90 days
there was no farmhouse , however , so from 2000 he began building the house around two grain silos at a cost of Â£ 50,000
the 66 - year - old used dozens of hay bales , blue tarpaulin and tyres to hide the house ( above ) from 2002 to 2006 mr robert fidler , pictured ( above ) outside the house , compared the situation to an artist being made to destroy a piece of work mr robert fidler and his wife , linda , went to such lengths to hoodwink locals and the authorities that they kept their son harry , now 14 , off playschool on the day his class were due to paint scenes of their homes
everyone else has to abide by planning laws , so why should nât they ? â reigate and banstead borough council served an enforcement notice requiring it be razed to the ground , claiming the four - year period after which the building would be allowed to stay was void as no one had been able to see it
mr robert fidler , who has five children from a previous marriage , appealed to the planning inspectorate which found in favour of the council because the property had not been â substantially complete â for the four years required
mr robert fidler and his wife , linda ( above ) , went to such lengths to hoodwink locals and the authorities that they kept their son harry , now 14 , off playschool on the day his class were due to paint scenes of their homes the four - bedroom house , complete with chandeliers , would be worth well in excess of Â£ 1million if sold on the open market - but it must be pulled down within 90 days features include weathered brick and stone , carved wooden pillars and beams , and a stained - glass dome above the stairwell this was a reference to the bales and tarpaulins that had been used to conceal it , meaning the project had effectively continued after 2002
