two base jumpers who broke their backs and were told they may never walk again after they fell 500ft have started jumping again
carey , 23 , and jay rawe , 25 , plummeted onto a riverbank when their parachutes tangled at the perrine bridge , idaho , and were left badly injured
but a year later , after intensive recovery , both men have returned to the sport they love - and mr carey has even retraced his steps to successfully jump from the bridge

the jump on march 24 last year was being recorded by spectators and they watched as the pair spiraled to the beach below
both suffered fractures to the spine - and mr carey was told he might not walk again
mr jay rawe suffered fractures to his spine after he plummeted 500ft to a river bank when the fall went wrong ' because of what happened to jay rawe and me i 've accepted death as a possibility - but i ca n't dream of a life without doing what i love
' mr carey , of fort wayne , indiana , has no memory of the fall but mr jay rawe remembers it clearly
as mr carey jumped off the ledge of the bridge , mr jay rawe ( left , top ) got his foot stuck on the railings , the pair then began to tumble towards the river bank 500ft below ( right ) without their parachutes opening properly as they fell mr jay rawe got stuck in mr carey 's parachute ( left ) and the pair got closer to the ground ( right ) by standers saw mr jay rawe trying to untangle himself from the parachute ( left ) and mr carey a crumpled heap ( right ) after the pair spiraled at speed towards the ground below the base jumping site ' the sound was significantly different from any other base jump and i remember thinking how i needed to get out of that position
' mr carey was recovering in hospital weeks after the fall and said moving his legs caused him immense pain both men had to undergo emergency 10 - hour surgery for injuries to their backs , mr jay rawe 's is shown he suffered fractures and damage to his vertebrae and a sprained right ankle in which the ligament was completely ' torn off the bone '
mr carey 's injuries were more serious
mr carey had to have a thumbnail - sized piece of bone removed from his spinal cord and mr jay rawe had some of his vertebrae fused with titanium
while mr jay rawe , from florida , battled back onto his feet within a few weeks mr carey faced the prospect of never walking again
after months of rehabilitation mr carey started to improve and became determined to get walking again the base jumper was left in a wheelchair and began undergoing painful therapy to learn to walk again after seven months in a wheelchair mr carey was able to walk again , having trained in his high school pool he spent three months in a back brace and seven months in a wheelchair , taking every opportunity to workout in his high - school swimming pool to strengthen his body
