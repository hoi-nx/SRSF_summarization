last week , a handful of british tech fanatics took delivery of the first highly sought - after apple watches
but it âs only one example of a new generation of watches designed to do far more than just tell the time
and while these smartwatches might sound as if they âre just for tech - savvy geeks , whether you âre a fitness fanatic , want to track your sleep and calorie intake or simply like the idea of checking your emails on your wrist , there âs a watch that could make your life easier
best for beginners pebble watch , from Â£ 99 , getpebble.com the pebble was one of the earliest smartwatches , and since it launched in 2013 , more than a million have been sold
it âs easy to see why
it keeps things basic â there are no buttons or whizzy features and you ca nât make calls or browse the internet ( you have a phone and computer for that )
instead , once connected wirelessly to your phone , you can see who is calling , texting or emailing , without having to get your phone out â though you will need your phone to reply
the battery charge lasts longer than other smartwatches â up to seven days â partly because it uses a low - energy screen ( similar to a kindle ) that is readable in daylight )
best for fitness fanatics basis peak , Â£ 169 , amazon.co.uk marketed as the â ultimate fitness and sleep tracker â , the basis peak incorporates what you âd expect of a fitness watch â water resistance , up to four days battery charge life and a movement sensor â but it has much more besides
best phone - free solution samsung gear s , Â£ 329 , samsung.com this is the watch that is so smart you can ditch your phone
it comes with a slot for a sim card so it does nât need to piggy - back off another device and â like the apple watch â has a choice of straps and a face that can be customised
rather than being a smartwatch , it âs a smartstrap that can be ordered to fit almost any watch
