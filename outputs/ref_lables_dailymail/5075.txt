taxpayers are having to find Â£ 11billion a year to top up the wages of millions of people working in supermarkets and other low paid jobs
the total amount of benefits paid to staff at some companies exceeds what the firms pay in corporation tax , according to the study by citizens uk
critics have accused supermarkets of relying on benefits to ensure their staff earn enough to put food on the table without them having to raise wages the charity is campaigning for the adoption of the living wage - Â£ 9.15 an hour in london and Â£ 7.85 for the rest of the uk - across both the public and private sector
the charity âs report complains : â the public subsidy enables profitable businesses to get away with paying low wages
â its report says tesco , asda and sainsbury âs posted combined profits of Â£ 3.9bn last year , but between them cost the taxpayer more than Â£ 750m in benefits paid to their staff
asda spent Â£ 150m in tax but its 120,000 low - paid workers received Â£ 221m in benefits
morrisons â tax bill was Â£ 62m while its 83,000 low - paid workers received Â£ 190m in benefits and sainsbury âs paid Â£ 180m in tax , almost exactly as much as its low - paid staff received from the public purse
of all the profitable companies examined by the charity , next had the highest average subsidy of Â£ 2,087 per head given its high proportion of young employees who are typically paid just above the minimum wage of Â£ 6.70 an hour
paul regan , chairman of citizens uk , said : â the major retailers post profits and pay tax , but the treasury has to step in and often pays out more than it gets in to help those workers for whom work does not pay
â he called on the next government to show leadership â by implementing the living wage into all public sector commissioning â
â all of the main political parties support the living wage
however , the former labour cabinet minister alan milburn , chairman of the social mobility and child poverty commission , said it could take 10 years to make the living wage a reality
we will need a 10 - year transition period to become a living wage country
â charles cotton , of the chartered institute of personnel and development , warned wage rises will hit employment , saying : â if employees were nât getting subsidies , would firms employ as many people or would they cut back ? â supermarkets said they paid above the minimum wage of Â£ 6.50 an hour for those aged over 21 , regularly reviewed pay and gave employees benefits such as staff discounts
the british retail consortium said pay and benefits packages equated to an average of about Â£ 8.40 an hour and the industry had paid Â£ 19.5bn in â core business taxes â last year
