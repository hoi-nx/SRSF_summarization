concerns are growing over russian ships that have docked in a once - secret naval base in the arctic
military leaders in norway are nervous about its powerful neighbour 's presence on its ' strategically important ' coastline following a spike in tensions between russian and nato nations
some experts have criticised the shutting down of olavsvern naval base - a huge complex buried in mountainous terrain near the town of tromsoe - which has been closed since 2009
but fears have once again peaked after three russian ships spent the entire winter docked deep within the mountain hideaway which was once a heavily guarded military facility
show of strength : norway 's military leaders are growing concerned after three russian warships spent the winter docked inside a closed naval base ( file photo ) deep inside the country 's mountainous terrain aggression : in february , raf planes intercepted two russian bombers ( file photo ) which had flown into irish territory and forced a passenger jet to divert its course force : and late last year , the russian navy anti-submarine ship severomorsk ( file photo ) and three other russian ships had to be escorted out of the britain channel it was originally shut because the country 's leaders thought the threat from moscow was reduced , despite its massive northern fleet which is base in the nearby kola peninsula
norway 's former vice admiral said shutting down the base was ' pure madness ' while other critics say their submarines now have to travel hundreds of extra miles to protect the region
this is far from the first time russian has flexed its military muscles in other countries ' territory

' the armed forces put the base - which cost over Â£ 390million to construct - up for sale on norway 's version of ebay
it was eventually bought for just Â£ 3.5million by a norway businessmen and was rented out to russian research vessels which were reportedly linked to the country 's state - owned energy giant gazprom
a former second in command for the norway military said : ' russian is a country where the state has a say over all commercial or semi-state business
' jan reksten believes the sale of olavsvern was ' a double loss ' as ' norway 's armed forces lost an important base and now there are russian vessels docked there ' .
