a teen club volleyball player and her family are suing after they said her coaches spiked her playing time and her league blocked a transfer to another club
audrey dimitrew , 16 , of virginia accepted a spot on the under - 16 chantilly juniors in november believing she would get playing time , but was told by coaches she did not have the skills to compete with her team
the sophomore at woodgrove high school and her family sued the chesapeake region volleyball association on march 10 after they said she was accepted to another club but was denied the transfer from her league
audrey dimitrew was then told by her coach that she could transfer to another club in the league if she wanted or she could be a practice player for the team
after several appeals to the league were denied , the family filed suit
' it was n't about playing time , it was about playing
audrey dimitrew was offered a spot on another club , nv premier , but the league said she could not transfer
her mother said the dispute is not about playing time but about ' playing ' claiming her daughter ' wants to play ' the league 's handbook says players are ordinarily forbidden to transfer teams but can switch if they show a ' verifiable hardship condition exists
' ' should chrva allow players the ability to move teams when they are unhappy with the amount of playtime they are receiving , we would be overwhelmed with requests to change teams , ' a league official wrote in a january 26 letter to audrey dimitrew 's parents
audrey dimitrew might miss the opportunity to play this season as there is only one tournament remaining in the club season , but if nv premier does well she might be eligible for other tournaments ( audrey dimitrew pictured above with her family ) the stakes can include scholarships for players and an advantage in college admissions
two years ago , a philadelphia father filed a lawsuit against his son 's high school track coach for $ 40 million after the teen was cut from the team
