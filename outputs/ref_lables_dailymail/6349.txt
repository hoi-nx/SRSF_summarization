brook could have had the blockbuster fight he craves against amir khan instead of treading water against frankie gavin , if only his promoter had minded his words
so says amir khan 's father shah as his son gets ready to finally confirm the over-criticised chris algieri as his opponent in new york on the same night when brook will be defending his world welterweight title against frankie gavin at london 's o2 arena on may 20 promoter eddie hearn ( centre ) stands behind brook ( left ) and frankie gavin at the o2 arena amir khan celebrates his victory over devon alexander at the mgm grand in las vegas strip last year shah khan , who also supervises affairs , says : ' brook could have had his chance against amir khan right now if eddie hearn had toned it down
' if he carries on like that the brook fight will not take place
for amir khan it 's more about the big fights and his status in boxing
' amir khan 's told brook he will be happy to box him in the next year but eddie hearn 's jeopardising that
it 's eddie hearn putting the words in his mouth
' initially , eddie hearn 's provocative manoeuvres came as a surprise to the rival camp
khan snr says : ' eddie hearn will talk reasonably in the negotiating room
' eddie hearn ( centre ) speaks during a press conference to announce the fight between brook and frankie gavin amir khan ( right ) poses for a photo alongside father shah ( centre ) and brother haroon in sheffield in 2013 the khans see a telling parable with the way witter 's critical harassment of ricky offended the hitman
' yet brook is a fight amir khan would have been more than happy to have
brook has done ok but we sense that as soon as he comes up against a fighter of amir khan 's elite level he will be found out
' if what is being described as the biggest domestic fight in waiting is to become reality , it is over to you mr eddie hearn

and amir khan says : ' frankie gavin has n't done anything to compare with that
amir khan was criticised , also , for allegedly declining the ibf offer of a final eliminator against tim bradley for brook 's belt
khan snr says : ' we could n't really see the point of an eliminator a fight which brook is so desperate to have
andre ward , still ranked by many among the top five pound - for - pound boxers in the world despite 17 months out of the ring , sees paul smith as the ideal warm - up opponent , possibly before a rematch with carl froch
paul smith ( right ) throws a punch towards arthur abraham during their title fight in berlin in february hunter , california - based trainer of both andre ward and amir khan , says : ' paul smith is who we want and i 'm told it 's a done deal
' the wba have ordered their two super-middle world champions â andre ward ' super , ' carl froch ' regular ' â to meet in a unification fight
carl froch declared willingness if andre ward returns the compliment by travelling to the uk , having won their first meeting in the us
andre ward said he would make the away trip but only as far as london , not to nottingham where carl froch has long desired to box on his hometown city ground
