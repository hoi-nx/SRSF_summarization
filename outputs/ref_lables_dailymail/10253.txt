a new york city doorman says he 's been fired for being too good at his job
ralph body , up until march 29 , manned the front desk of the luxury 27 on 27th building in long island city , queens
the 41 - year - old told the post he ' gave his life ' for his wealthy tenants and would go out of his way to do any personal tasks they asked -- all while keeping a cheerful smile on his face
but that willingness to go above and beyond for tenants -- by taking care of pets and watering plants , among other chores -- did n't sit well with the 2 - year - old building 's management , body says
too nice ? queens doorman ralph body was a smiling fixture in the lobby of the luxury 27 on 27th building in long island city , but was fired for , according to him , being too nice when body insisted he only did what was asked of him , he says his employers with heatherwood communities said it did n't matter
' most tenants , especially those who have lived in the building since it opened , can attest to ralph body 's kindness and eagerness to make people feel safe and welcome , ' the petition reads
most tenants in body 's corner blame the building management and not the staffing company for the concierge 's termination
