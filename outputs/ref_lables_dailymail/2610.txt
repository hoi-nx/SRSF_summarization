robbie neilson insists the likes of captain danny wilson will only leave hearts if he is satisfied it 's right for the club
as sportsmail revealed this week , celtic have placed former rangers on a list of potential summer recruits
speaking ahead of sunday 's championship clash with the ibrox club , robbie neilson admitted external interest in his promoted players is inevitable
hearts manager robbie neilson will not sell his players unless it is the right move for the club echoing the view of owner ann budge , however , the tynecastle coach says departures will only happen on his say - so if the price is right
' if you do really well in the championship and the players excel then there is going to be interest , ' admitted robbie neilson
' there has been interest in a lot of my players and we have a few boys out of contract , who we are negotiating with at the moment
' i would like to try to keep my best players but there is a realisation that bigger clubs can come in and take them
hearts have already secured promotion to the premiership under robbie neilson 's stewardship ' if teams come in with an offer that is acceptable to us , then i 'll expect to lose them
if someone leaves the club then it will be on terms that are acceptable to the club and the player
with a shrug of resignation , robbie neilson added : ' people talk about how comments from other managers can unsettle you
' big clubs talk , but i would like to think the majority of players have enjoyed their season here and would like to have a good crack at the top league
' owner ann budge has set robbie neilson and his players the target of a top - six finish in the top flight next season robbie neilson , alongside director of football craig levein , is more focused on bringing new players into hearts than losing the ones he has
' it is a case of getting things ironed out , really , ' continued robbie neilson
' with six games of the championship season to go and promotion already secured , robbie neilson already knows his targets for his second season as a manager
captain danny wilson has been linked with celtic , but wo n't be sold unless it is the right move for hearts accepting the challenge , robbie neilson said : ' that is a target and life is all about setting yourself targets
to be honest , a top - six finish for a club like hearts - if they had not been in the championship - would be the bare minimum which should be acceptable
hearts players were shocked to be saddled with a triple training session this week despite securing their promotion goal with something to spare
the former rangers defender ( right , pictured against his former club ) could join celtic in the summer unbeaten away from home this season , robbie neilson wants that record to continue at ibrox , where his side laid down a marker on the first day of the season
' ironically , a third victory of the season over a rangers side showing signs of improvement under stuart mccall would benefit arch city rivals hibernian the most
of the view hearts must win games for themselves rather than others , however , robbie neilson insisted : ' we do n't owe that to any other teams - we owe it to ourselves and the fans , for our own personal pride
