vets are urging the public to get their dogs checked out for ticks , which can spread potentially fatal diseases to humans
their warning comes after a survey found almost half of dog owners did not know that ticks can transmit deadly diseases to both humans and other dogs
over half , 54 per cent , also confessed they did not know that lyme disease , a potentially fatal illness caught from tick bites , affects their pets as well as themselves
vets are urging the public to get their dogs checked out for ticks , which can spread potentially fatal diseases - such as lyme disease - to humans at the other extreme , symptoms may be so mild that someone who 's been bitten by an infected tick may experience only flu - like symptoms
ticks , which flourish in long grass or undergrowth , typically attach to deer but can also be found on foxes , badgers , mice , birds as well as domestic pets - responsible for carrying the ticks into urban areas - and humans
areas of undergrowth ( including parks and gardens - as well as woodland and open country ) are most likely to harbour ticks as they drop off their original hosts then climb to a point where they can latch on to other passing wildlife
with the forecast of increasingly damp winters and hotter summers - ideal conditions for the ticks to thrive - as well as growth in deer numbers , the concern is that the incidence of lyme disease will rise further
lyme disease , or lyme disease , is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks
ticks that carry the bacteria responsible for lyme disease which can infect humans many people with early - stage lyme disease develop a distinctive circular rash at the site of the tick bite , usually around 3 to 30 days after being bitten
more serious symptoms may develop several weeks , months or even years later if lyme disease is left untreated or is not treated early on
this is known as post-infectious lyme disease
concerned vets across the uk are now urging people to get their dogs checked out for the pests
professor richard wall , from the university of bristol , will be part of a team studying the ticks , and says their numbers have soared in the last 10 years
' in britain the distribution of ticks is estimated to have expanded in the last 10 years by 17 per cent and the abundance of ticks to have increased at 73 per cent of locations surveyed
' public health england estimates the number of new lyme disease cases each year at around 3,000 , while charities say the figure is closer to 15,000
lyme disease is caused by a bite from an infected tick
symptoms in dogs include lameness , lethargy and fever , which , if left untreated , can lead to more serious conditions such as kidney disease and heart failure
throughout spring and early summer when ticks are most actives , vets taking part in big tick project , will be giving dogs visiting their practice a tick check
the big tick project is being launched by tv presenter chris packham who wants to raise awareness of the risks and symptoms associated with lyme disease the project is being launched by tv presenter chris packham and aims to raise awareness of the risks and symptoms associated with the tick - borne disease
' if like me , you love your dogs , you 'll want the best advice and treatment to help reduce the risks associated with ticks and tick - borne disease
