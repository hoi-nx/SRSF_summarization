toro , 66 , worked as a mid-level member of the medellin cartel in the 1980s when a confrontation with his boss caused him to flee from colombia fearing for his life
toro came to the us and eventually began working for the dea as an informant after providing information about a number of his former bosses and associates
he was n't paid for work , but was told he would be rewarded with us citizenship
that has not happened and toro is now technically living in the us illegally after declining health forced him to retire , according to the florida center for investigative reporting
he said : ' if i am sent back to colombia , i would be dead within the first four hours
' information provided by toro aided in the prosecution of ex-panamanian dictator manuel noriega ( seen 1990 ) his fears sound reasonable considering his work aided in the prosecution of cocaine overlord carlos lehder and former panamanian dictator manuel noriega
' one of toro 's former colleagues recently gave him $ 5,000 for an operation after the dea declined to help toro remains in limbo while trying to get a green card or a passport , and he ca n't collect social security benefits until he secures one of those documents
