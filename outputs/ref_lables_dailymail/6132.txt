blogger : lisa is the author of canadian expat mom when canada expat lisa webb first sent her vegetable - phobic three - year - old to school in france , she feared her daughter would starve during the day
the former assistant elementary school principal , who moved to france in 2009 , was shocked to find rã´ti de boeuf and cordon bleu de dinde on the menu for toddlers - dishes she was used to eating in fancy restaurants with her husband
but when offered the chance to sit in on her eldest daughter 's lunch breaks for one week , she witnessed tots using ' grown - up knives and forks ' and eating everything put in front of them
in 2009 , lisa and her husband made the move to france and she began working as a substitute teacher in paris
writing in her blog - canadian expat mom - the 34 - year - old said : ' i âll never forget dreading the fact that i was on lunchtime supervision because i saw that fish was on the menu that day
' fast forward five years to 2014 , and lisa had her own daughter to get ready for her first day at school
at three years old , she enjoyed a healthy continental diet but refused to eat vegetables
three - course meal : lisa webb was nervous about sending her vegetable - phobic child to a school where pupils eat what they are served ' initially i think that we did give her everything , we eat very healthily as a family , ' lisa explained
' she ate everything but vegetables - foie gras , saucisson , lapin ( rabbit )
at home i stopped offering her broccoli because i did n't like wasting food
was julia child working in the kitchen ? how were they serving this to three - year - olds ? did they have a magic wand to get these kids to eat this very grown up list of food ? ' whenever i would come across the ladies that worked in the lunchroom , i would stare in disbelief as they would tell me what a good eater my daughter was
yet , she was nât coming home hungry , so she must have been eating something
' ' there âs no plastic cutlery or non-breakable plates , ' lisa wrote
' the kids are served their meal at the table , not buffet style ' when the opportunity arose to spend a week in the canteen at lunchtime , where there is a constantly changing menu of salads , seasonal vegetables , meats and fish , the mum - of - two jumped at the chance
' this is france after all , where the gastronomic meal is protected as a unesco intangible world heritage item
' when the opportunity arose to spend a week in the canteen at lunchtime the mum - of - two jumped at the chance the meal at the french state school costs parents just â¬ 2.60 ( Â£ 1.90 ) each day
' my daughter eats a lot more and it was a good eye - opener for me to see what she will eat
' lisa , who is writing a book about life in france , added : ' my eyes have been opened and i am amazed by the what the french public school system does daily at noon
