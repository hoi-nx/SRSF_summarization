the manchester derby is now one of the biggest match - ups in world football
but just how manchester is the clash between manchester city and united ? sportsmail takes a look at everything local between the two giants
sergio aguero and manchester city travel to old trafford to face united on sunday afternoon owners you will not find many united fans who pine for the days when martin edwards , son of a salford butcher , ruled the roost at old trafford
likewise , there will not be many manchester city supporters who look back fondly on the chaotic era of hometown former tv salesman and combover king peter swailes , who often came across as out of tune with reality ( if you get a chance watch the hilariously belief - defying manchester city ! documentary on youtube ) , as he went through manager after manager after manager
peter swailes was local , but not many manchester city fans want to be reminded of his chairmanship not many united fans pine for the days when martin edwards , son of a salford butcher , ruled the roost sheikh mansour might not be local but is a hugely popular figure at manchester city after bankrolling the club avram ( left ) and glazer have proved divisive figures at united since their family bought the club at old trafford , there remains a resentment for those upstairs
however , you do get the sense that both louis van gaal and manuel pellegrini do their best to familairise themselves with their environment
louis van gaal has tried to immerse himself in the local culture after taking over as manager last summer van gaal has leaned on assistant boss ryan giggs for tips around the city during his stint in charge manuel pellegrini has been keen to familiarise himself with manchester over the last two years manager manuel pellegrini with chairman khaldoon al mubarak ( left ) over in abu dhabi last may van gaal , who originally stationed himself at a city centre hotel , frequented many of the city 's finest eating establishments and knows his way around town
while you wo n't see manuel pellegrini supping a pint of mild next to the bronze statue of ls lowry in city centre backstreet boozer sam 's chop house , the chilean has also been quick to immerse himself in local culture
kidd ( right , at crystal palace on monday ) is manchester through and through kidd is more manc than happy mondays dancer bez drinking a can of boddingtons in the rain unless tyler blackett makes a comeback for united there wo n't be any local lads in the two xis aside from the local lad , the only things missing from carrington are a windmill and some tulips with dutch quintet frans hoek , albert stuivenberg , marcel bout , jos van dijk and max reckers key players
however , when sir ferguson arrived at old trafford he was disgusted to learn that manchester city scooped the cream of manchester 's talent and quickly ( and successfully ) set about putting that right
sir ferguson was disgusted that manchester city 's youth academy was more profitable on arrival at united along with ferguson , eric harrison ( left ) brought through the class of 92 , to include ryan giggs , nicky butt , david beckham , gary neville , phil neville , paul scholes and terry cooke wayne rooney was only born 30 miles down the road but he may as well be from another planet as far as many from this neck of the woods are concerned
united like to remind us of their 659m global followers while manchester city , according to a recent club - commissioned report , have a fanbase that is rapidly expanding across the planet
outside old trafford , street vendors will attempt to flog half - and - half scarves
manchester city fans are derided by their rivals for the amount of ' empty seats ' at the etihad stadium regardless , nowhere will victory be celebrated with as much vigour and defeat taken with as much bitterness as in manchester
while manchester city fans may serenade their hosts with ' you 're the pride of singapore ' and united supporters respond in kind with jibes about empty seats at ' the council house ' both know that this is a city divided by football loyalties .
