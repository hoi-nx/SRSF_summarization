bennett , 33 , from swindon , says the tattoos , which were done when she was 24 , have turned her into a jobless recluse
' until they are removed , i wo nât be able to find a job and will be stuck on benefits , ' says miss bennett , who resigned from her last role because she felt ' left out ' by colleagues , and is now hoping someone will step forward and offer to pay for her to have laser removal
benefits : bennett , 33 , from swindon , says she ca n't get a job because of her six facial tattoos â i ca nât afford to have it done but i âm absolutely desperate to get rid of them , ' says miss bennett , who claims she has applied for 40 jobs in the last year but without success
' i âve applied for 40 jobs in the last year alone
â tough : she says she has applied for more than 40 jobs but has had no success because of her 18 tattoos embarrassed : her six facial tattoos have left her embarrassed and as a result , she suffers from depression removal : she says she wants a well - wisher to pay for laser treatment - and will have to stay on benefits until then her handouts , which total Â£ 14,000 a year , include an employment and support allowance of Â£ 360 a fortnight and housing benefit of Â£ 400 - a - month
she also gets sick money because she suffers from depression , the result , she says , of tattoo - related comfort eating that has caused her go up three dress sizes from a 12 to an 18
another great upset is caused by being unable to find a boyfriend , which miss bennett says is also down to the inkings
â in an ironic twist , the 33 - year - old , who has 18 tattoos in total , says she got her first one as a means of boosting her confidence , which had been knocked by school bullies
