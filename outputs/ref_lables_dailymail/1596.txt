a greedy mother who told a 13 - year - old volunteer to ' f * * * off ' was evicted from a family easter egg hunt after she took more than her fair share of chocolate treats
the woman in her mid- to late 30s , who is believed to have had two or three children participating , was at melbourne âs greatest ever easter egg hunt , which was run by zaidee 's rainbow foundation at caulfield racecourse on saturday
she was escorted out of the racecourse , in melbourne 's south - east , when she became ' irate ' after a young volunteer at the hunt asked her to stop taking so many easter eggs
the aim of the hunt is to raise awareness of organ and tissue donation , while raising money for zaidee 's rainbow foundation
she was told by a 13 - year - old volunteer she was taking too many eggs and she told the young person to ' f * * * off ' the woman kept denying she was smuggling eggs into additional plastic bags she had brought in ' parents are the toughest ones to control
' it was not the first time parents took more than their fair share - which is a $ 5 bucket full - but this is the first time organisers have had to kick someone out the egg hunt looks to raise money for zaidee 's rainbow foundation , which helps bring awareness of tissue and organ donation to the forefront it was started by zaidee turner 's father , allan , who wanted to honour his seven - year - old daughter who was an organ donor when she died mr turner said it was a shame this woman had acted in this way as she was at a family event , which he had started in the honour of his daughter , zaidee , who died of a brain anuerysm when she seven years old
he said zaidee 's rainbow foundation tried to raise awareness of organ and tissue donation
zaidee ( not pictured ) died of a brain aneurysm in 2004 and she has been remembered through the hunt mr turner said parents were often the most difficult to control at these hunts as they were scrambling to get as many eggs as possible organisers have had to stop parents bringing prams because they were using them to smuggle out eggs ' we try to [ do events ] left of field for organ and tissue donation , ' he said
