it perfectly illustrates his work ethic and his obsession with guarding against complacency but even he must know that right now no - one is further from the chop than the 44 - year - old coach who took atletico madrid to the title last season and leads them into the champions league quarter - final against real madrid on tuesday night
simeone shows off his playing skills as he prepare atletico madrid for their champions league clash simeone talks to his squad ahead of real madrid 's visit on tuesday night in the quarter final first leg sporting directors from manchester to milan were watching his situation carefully and the new four year contract with the option of a fifth season appears to have ended his chances of arriving in italy or england this summer
back home in real madrid the atletico madrid supporters were delirious at the news
the argentinian manager has imposed his incredible work ethic on his players since joining atletico madrid simeone has turned atletico madrid around since joining in december 2011 , and recently extended his deal his atletico madrid team - mates were stagnating under coach manzano and had just been knocked out of the european super cup by a third division side , albacete
without costa , who was at first loaned out to rayo vallecano , simeone âs atletico madrid won the europa league and the european super cup
costa returned to help them win the copa del rey and the league as well as making last season âs champions league final
that final in lisbon seemed to put real back on top in the spanish capital but simeone âs noisy neighbours have refused to pipe - down
in the two - legged spanish super cup at the start of the season atletico madrid drew 1 - 1 in the bernabeu and beat real madrid 1 - 0 in the vicente calderon
saul scores a brilliant bicycle kick during the 4 - 0 win over real madrid at the vicente calderon earlier this season ronaldo and gareth bale were unable to do anything to prevent atletico madrid 's dominance in february and when the two teams were drawn against each other in the copa del rey atletico madrid won the first leg 2 - 0 and then drew the second
worse was to come for real madrid in the champions league in february when they lost the away fixture 4 - 0
atletico madrid players had told anyone who would listen throughout last season that while they did nât give themselves much of a chance in la liga up against the stronger squads of real madrid and barcelona , they did fancy themselves in the champions league â â we can beat anyone over two legs â was the message and that still stands
ronaldo scored the fourth goal in real madrid 's win over their rivals in last year 's champions league final simeone 's players watch on after losing out in lisbon , but are determined to bounce back this year he put through his own net at the weekend in the league typifying that faltering league form and will probably make way for mandzukic tuesday
former bayern munich striker mandzukic ( behind ) is set to start alongside antoine griezmann mandzukic has patched up his relationship with simeone and will play ahead of fernando torres on tuesday tuesday night may well be as much about keeping a clean sheet as scoring
ronaldo returns the scene of real madrid âs biggest crime this season â that 4 - 0 defeat in the league on the day he celebrated his 30th birthday
tuesday night is a chance for real madrid to avenge that defeat , but it â s also another chance for simeone to show once again that in the spanish capital he is the boss .
