nasa claims we 'll find aliens in the next 10 to 20 years â and now the agency is revving up its efforts to track them down
and it says that amateur astronomers could help with its ' unprecedented ' search for et by accessing research data online
nasa has set up a website for the public called planet hunters which allows anyone to search the data gathered by kepler , which launched six years ago
scientists are also developing new ways to confirm the habitability of these worlds and search for biosignatures , or signs of life
during a talk last month , nasa said humanity will encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade
' i believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years , ' said stofan , chief scientist for nasa , ( pictured ) at a washington panel discussion by applying a ' system science ' approach , the team hopes to understand an alien planet 's biology interacts with the atmosphere , geology , oceans , and interior of a planet
the announcement comes just weeks after nasa 's top scientist predicted we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them
alien hunters from the university of berkeley , california and stanford are tasked with answering the question : ' what are the properties of exoplanetary systems , as they relate to their formation , evolution , and potential to harbour life ? ' they will combine astronomical observations of exoplanets and forming planetary systems with powerful computer simulations and cutting - edge microscopic studies of meteorites
the team centered at nasa 's goddard institute for space studies will investigate habitability on a more local scale
the team from yale university in new haven , connecticut , will design new spectrometers - optical instruments that measure the spectrum of light - with the stability to reach earth - detecting precision for nearby stars
' i believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years , ' stofan , chief scientist for nasa , said
nasa associate administrator john grunsfeld said he is excited about seeing what form life beyond earth may take
in their hunt for alien life , astronomers have so far focused on looking for earth - like planets around smaller , cooler suns
now astronomers claim that such exoplanets actually rotate around their stars , and spin at such a speed that they exhibit a day - night cycle similar to earth â increasing the chance of finding alien life
planets with potential oceans could have a climate that is much more similar to earth 's than previously expected , ' said jã©rã©my leconte , a postdoctoral fellow at the canadian institute for theoretical astrophysics ( cita ) at the university of toronto
' ' once we get beyond mars , which formed from the same stuff as earth , the likelihood that life is similar to what we find on this planet is very low , ' he said
he claimed that we will find life within the next 20 years - with a high chance it will be outside our solar system
nasa next mars rover , scheduled to launch in 2020 , will search for signs of past life and bring samples for a possible return to earth for analysis
nasa also hopes to land astronauts on mars in the 2030s , which stofan says is crucial key to the search for mars life
' so i have a bias that it 's eventually going to take humans on the surface of mars â field geologists , astrobiologists , chemists â actually out there looking for that good evidence of life that we can bring back to earth for all the scientists to argue about
