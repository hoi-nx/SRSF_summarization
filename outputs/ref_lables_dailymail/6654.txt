armenia is a country in eurasia 's south caucasus region famous for its mountainous landscapes and rich history ... but mainly , right now at least , for the fact kim kardashian and her posse are there
kim kardashian , her husband kanye west , their daughter north and kim kardashian 's sister khloe arrived in the capital yerevan on wednesday to a rock star welcome and over eight days are checking out a plethora of local landmarks
the visit is their first to the country their late father , robert , fled for america and both kim kardashian and khloe have expressed their excitement at the chance to explore his homeland
kim kardashian is in armenia with her husband kanye west and their daughter north on an eight - day visit to the country of her dad 's birth the celebrity visitors are in the capital yerevan , a culturally rich city where the opera house ( centre ) is among its most notable landmarks the opera house is a must - visit place in the armenian capital where local music and dance performances are highly regarded kim kardashian , kanye west and khloe kardashian are staying at the armenia yerevan which is on republic square , formerly lenin square republic square is a tourist attraction in itself , with its combination of soviet - era architecture and neo-classical official buildings and from what lonely planet says of the city , it 's made for the icons of modern - day entertainment
' while it 's the undeniable cultural , economic and political heart of the nation , yerevan can at times feel like a city on permanent holiday , ' lonely planet 's introduction to its guide of the city
' sounds familiar ... while there , the kardashian-west crew are staying in the capital 's finest digs , the armenia yerevan , which frames republic square at the heart of the city , and have the burliest of bodyguards and police in tow as they take in the sights
but what would we , the mere mortals not of reality tv fame , see and do if we followed in their footsteps ? yerevan 's zvartnots international airport is well connected to major centres throughout europe although cheaper flights ( upwards of Â£ 300 during summer and less in colder months ) from london require a transfer somewhere like moscow , kiev or vienna
a smartphone view of the katoghiken church in the unesco world heritage - listed geghard , where kim kardashian , kanye west and north visited the monastery is a medieval set of structures which have in part been carved out of the mountain and date back to the fourth century documenting every moment : camera crews followed the family as they took a tour of historical sites outside the geghard of geghard women sell the same traditional sweet bread that was offered to kim kardashian on their arrival in armenia the hotel is well chosen by their people as it 's right in the middle of this relatively easy to get around city , where the majority of main sights are free
while kanye west 's hip - hop may not be the preferred genre of the nation - fans appear to be more interested in the stars of keeping up with the kardashians - the city is n't short on culture with a disproportionately large amount of theatres , galleries and clubs for its size , with plenty of live music to be found
their minders say the timing has nothing to do with it , but the kardashians ' arrival comes as the nation counts down to the 100th anniversary of the armenian genocide on april 24 which honours up 1.5 million people were killed by the ottomans between 1915 and 1917
the cascades is the main part of the cafesjian museum , found in the centre of yerevan , which features an array of modern armenian art khachkars , an armenian cross stone , are common features of medieval christian art found in the cascades the sculture park features works from botero and other internationally - recognised artists and a stellar view of the city this statue at the cascades represents russian - born architect alexander tamanian , whose greatest work was planning modern yerevan among the major sights on the kim kardashian 's itinerary is yerevan 's extensive armenian genocide museum-institute http along with the national archives where they hope to see documents relating to their ancestors
the party has already visited yerevan 's armenia statue , a large representation of a women holding a big sword that is said to be the female personification of the country and proved quite an inspiration for the sisters
a visit to their father 's home city of gyumri would find a smaller version of the statue minus the collection of decommissioned tanks , rocket launchers and other military items
' the mother armenia statue symbolizes peace through strength , ' khloe wrote on instagram
similar breads are found sold by locals at the unesco world heritage - listed geghard of geghard , a medieval set of structures which have in part been carved out of the mountain where where kim kardashian and kanye west have taken north
