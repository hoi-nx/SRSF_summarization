an italian doctor has vowed to confound his medical doubters by proving that he can conduct the world 's first head transplant - in less than an hour
surgeon canavero , who has no problem with anyone branding him dr frankenstein , also has not got any qualms with wealthy tycoons using the procedure to get a young body in their quest for eternal life
he confirmed that he hopes to operate on his first patient , a russian with a rare genetic muscle wasting disease , and said he will carry out the procedure in china if he is banned from doing so in the eu or former soviet union
pictured here is boris karolv playing dr frankenstein 's monster in the 1931 film potentially he accepts he could be jailed for conducting such an operation in a country where it does not have approval
' it 's not a problem
if europe and russian say " no " , the surgery will be done in china , ' he said
' i 'm ready for that
i 've been studying china for a few years
' you should understand that it 's not simply a medical procedure
this surgery has a political meaning
' but critics say dr canavero 's plans are a fantasy
arthur caplan , the director of medical ethics at new york university 's langone medical centre , has described dr canavero as ' nuts '
and dr hunt batjer , president elect of the american association for neurological surgeons , has said : ' i would not wish this on anyone
' nevertheless severely disabled valery spiridonov , 30 , a sufferer of werdnig-hoffman disease , has volunteered to be a guinea pig , knowing the risks
' this risks appear huge but dr canavero insists it would take him less than an hour to put valery spiridonov 's head on the body of a donor body
' we will have an hour to ' switch ' the head to a different body
' valery 's head will be detached from his body and transferred to another one in a matter of seconds , and the brain 's blood flow will start in about 15 minutes
dr canavero giving a presentation on his plans
he claims he has been ' studying china for the past few years ' in case he has to perform the operation in china should europe and russian say no ' i will be explaining all the technical peculiarities on june 12 in annapolis at an international neurosurgeons ' conference
nonetheless , you have slackers who meaninglessly stroll around the pitch and are paid $ 20 - 30 million a year
' asked if such surgery could be used for ' elderly billionaires to get a young body ' , he claimed he had interest from tycoons seeking to extend their lives
' you bet - there are a few funds working on prolonging life expectancy , and they are well - funded
in 1970 dr robert white transplanted the head of one monkey onto the body of another , as shown in this diagram
if mr valery spiridonov 's head were to be successfully transplanted his jugular vein and spinal cords would have to be similarly fused with those of his new donor body dr canavero has said his new body swap technique could help paralysed people such as christopher reeve ' i am prepared for any nicknames , because it sounds cool and will help to sell more newspapers
' when bill gates or itskov ( a russian millionaire supporting the research in artificial intelligence ) fund my project , i 'll come to the cameras with the receipt and say , " this person supported my initiative "
' he claims a senior catholic figure has said he sees no objections to the surgery , he said , adding : ' in asia and china , the religious authorities also have n't shown any discontent about that
dr canavero , who currently undertakes experimental surgery near turin , said that he had had ' many ' offers to be his guinea pig in such surgery
' in his remarkable interview with mailonline , the would - be patient explained that he had agreed to the surgery because ' i do n't really have many choices
itskov , a russian millionaire who supports research in artificial intelligence
dr canavero says he 'd love to ' come to the cameras ' with a receipt to show he had enlisted mr itskov 's support ' if i do n't try this chance my fate will be very sad
' the idea to transplant not only organs but the head has been studied for a long time even by russian specialists
' i contacted professor canavero two years ago after reading about his works
of course he has never done anything like this and we have to think carefully all the possible risks
' he denied his pledge to be a guinea pig is a stunt , and insisted he goes into it with his eyes open
severely physically handicapped , he made clear : ' i do understand the risks of such surgery
they also understand all the risks , and even if they think that it 's too dangerous , they still support me in my decision
