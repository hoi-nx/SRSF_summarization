in an unprecedented move , russia has cancelled the release of a hollywood thriller set in the stalin era - claiming it distorts history and would air as the country celebrates its victory over nazi germany
the film , ' child 44 ' , starring tom hardy , vincent cassel and gary oldman , tells the story of a serial killer who targets children in the stalin era
' films such as ' child 44 ' should not go out in our country on mass release , earning money from our cinema audiences , not in the year of the 70th anniversary of victory , not ever , ' culture minister medinsky wrote on the ministry 's website
the culture ministry accused the film of ' distortion of historical facts and the idiosyncratic treatment of events before , during and after ' the war
the film is set in 1952 , a year before stalin 's death , and features a maverick investigator seeking a serial killer , while hindered by official attitudes that such murders are not possible in the soviet
culture minister medinsky ( pictured ) condemned the film for its depiction of the horrors of the stalin regime ' you realise murder is strictly a capitalist disease , ' french star vincent cassel hisses in a thick russia accent in the film 's english-language trailer
earlier this year the outspoken culture minister voiced his dislike of russia art - house film ' leviathan , ' despite its landmark victory at the golden globes and oscar nomination , complaining it was full of ' existentialist hopelessness
