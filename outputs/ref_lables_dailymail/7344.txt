perched on a hotel sofa barely inches from glynis , i am trying , as covertly as possible , to scrutinise her rather lovely face
it âs difficult to believe that in the next few months , the actress â remembered by many as the glacially beautiful half of itv âs 1980s detective duo dempsey and makepeace â will be collecting her bus pass
from where i âm sitting , she looks barely a day over 40
â i do nât judge anyone for doing it â people have to do what âs right for them
â it âs hard to argue with that sentiment
for the past two years , under the tutelage of nutritional therapist fleur borrelli , glynis has changed what and how she eats â and in the process , she says , transformed her health and her figure
she tore up her rulebook too : out went breakfast â instead she has just two large meals a day
out , too , went wholegrains and she even stopped sipping water in the day , something she once swore by to stay hydrated and stave off hunger
so convinced is she that what fleur borrelli taught her is the key to long - lasting health and wellbeing that she has co-written a book with her , the in-sync diet , in which she shares their discoveries , backed up , she says , by credible new research
â i had no idea that when i met fleur borrelli i would drop a stone in weight and a dress size , gain lean muscle , and have vastly improved energy levels , all while turning upside down the things i previously believed in , â glynis says
â but that âs what has happened and it âs why i wanted to share it with a wider audience
â the actress ( pictured with co-star michael brandon ) is remembered by many as the glacially beautiful half of itv âs 1980s detective duo dempsey and makepeace ironically , glynis once thought herself the last person to need a lifestyle reboot
always fit , she went organic in her late 20s at a time when it was barely heard of
â glynis , married to her dempsey and makepeace co-star michael brandon , has enjoyed a busy career in theatre and tv , but two years ago started to develop unexplained joint pain and was advised by her osteopath to see fleur borrelli
â first to face scrutiny was glynis âs fondness for wholegrains
â aging well : glynis , pictured left in her 30s , will be celebrate turning 60 soon , but she looks barely a day over 40 it meant a gluten - free diet â not easy for a self - confessed â breadaholic â
glynis ate little and often in the belief it kept her blood sugar levels regulated
but fleur borrelli told her that cutting out breakfast altogether and eating two large meals a day was a better way of regulating her metabolism
then came what glynis drank
â i was one of those people who walked around clutching a water bottle and sipping at it throughout the day , â she says
it âs far better to drink a large glass of water when you âre thirsty
â glynis tore up her rulebook too : out went breakfast and she even stopped sipping water in the day , something she once swore by to stay hydrated and stave off hunger initially cynical , glynis says she was amazed by how easy it was to adapt
â and , glynis insists , she is less likely to scrutinise herself
â the in-sync diet , by glynis and fleur borrelli , is published by autharium on friday
the actress follows a gluten - free diet , with food like pasta jettisoned , replaced by protein and vegetables why hydration is key by barney calman , health editor we should all drink at least two litres of water a day â about eight glasses
dehydration can be fatal , and in the case of the elderly , sick children or those with other health problems , a watchful eye should be kept on water intake
