adam rooney is determined to prevent a season of outstanding personal achievement from ending with a sting its tail
the prospect of watching celtic celebrate title glory inside pittodrie would , he admits , be a painful experience to bear
should the current eight - point gap between the teams remain intact , then ronny deila âs side will have the chance to clinch a fourth successive scottish premiership crown when they head to the north - east on may 10
aberdeen striker adam rooney does not want to see celtic win the league on their patch on may 11 rooney , though , expects aberdeen to be fully motivated to prevent a green - and - white party from getting underway
â if they are going to win it they are going to win it , â said the 27 - year - old striker , who on thursday made the shortlist for player of the year

i thought he was brilliant in the scottish cup semi-final against celtic last sunday
the irishman âs 27 goals this season have been a crucial component in the red results machine and even led aberdeen legend willie miller to claim he was up with joe harper and duncan shearer in terms of the finest aberdeen strikers of recent decades
rooney scored the winning goal for aberdeen against dundee united last saturday â he must have been drunk when he said that ! â laughed a self - effacing rooney
â i was nât aware until you told me that i âd only be the sixth player in aberdeen â s history to do it - so thanks for the pressure ! but it would obviously be a great accolade to get
