the nut that frequently appears in the bible as a symbol of fruitfulness and promise has been dubbed â the devil âs nut â , pinpointed as the chief culprit in an eco-disaster that is developing in california
although it âs tempting to blame all those irresponsible california filling their huge swimming pools and watering their lawns with abandon , domestic water consumption is dwarfed by that of agriculture
bone dry : a california farmer is pictured surveying his drought - hit land in san luis obispo county the state has long been one of the world âs biggest producers of fruit and vegetables â for profit - hungry farmers , its year - round sunshine more than outweighs the obvious drawback that it hardly ever rains there
california farmers have been allowed to hog dwindling supplies of water , digging ever - deeper bore holes to keep the rest of us stocked up with all - year - round peaches , sweet peppers and pistachios
the trouble is , global demand for the nut is soaring â as customers from david cameron to millions of middle - class chinese develop a passion for almond - based foods
attracted by the huge profits being made from a crop that is hardly cheap , california farmers now satisfy 84 per cent of the world âs almond demand
worth Â£ 3.8 billion in 2013 , almonds have become california âs second biggest agricultural commodity after milk , as demand has exploded by 1,000 per cent in a decade
the problem is that almonds guzzle water on a monumental scale
it has been calculated that it takes 1.1 gallons of water to grow a single almond
dry days : homes with swimming pools are seen in the palm springs area , california , as the state enters its fourth year of severe drought since almond trees cover almost a million acres of california ( about the size of cornwall ) â many of them on previously virgin hillsides or in areas with little or no rain â that âs a lot of h2o being sucked up to satisfy our almond craving
in total , almonds are annually consuming 1.07 trillion gallons of water in the state â a fifth more than the entire indoor water usage of all 39 million california
all of which is slightly problematic , given that two - thirds of california is classified as being in â extreme drought â , as the region suffers its driest conditions for 1,200 years
because farmers have to irrigate almond trees continuously , they are using groundwater â the underground water that feeds aquifers and theoretically provides the state âs emergency reserves
so is the state of california , birthplace of sixties â hippy values , rushing to root up almond groves and rescue its corner of the planet ? quite the opposite
a recent government survey found that 77 per cent of california almond farmers plan to plant more trees
unlike cows ' milk , almond milk â which is made from ground nuts and water â has no cholesterol or lactose , and being a plant food , it is often consumed by vegans , vegetarians , and others forgoing dairy california has been bingeing on water for decades , building homes in arid areas that should nât be inhabited â as their owners discover when they are engulfed in bushfires
america has vast amounts of rich agricultural land in god - forsaken states like iowa , but california has a mediterranean climate that âs ideal for high - profit crops like almonds
if california wo nât save themselves , an obvious solution is for everyone else to stop buying their almonds
uk almond milk sales are soaring at a rate of 70 - 80 per cent a year as shoppers opt for a dairy - free alternative that they believe is healthier for your heart and the perfect solution to the growing prevalence of lactose intolerance
but do the pm and his trendy friends know it takes 23 gallons of water to produce a glass of almond milk ? the prime minister is said to splash almond milk on his breakfast cereal and in his tea
and it almost certainly comes from california nutrition experts see the almond as meeting an increasing demand for a natural , low - calorie and high - protein food that tastes more pleasant than that old health shop stalwart , soya
but if there âs a smell in the air in california , it is the stench of greed â as america âs most self - indulgent state pours away its fast - vanishing water to feed a global obsession with a humble nut .
