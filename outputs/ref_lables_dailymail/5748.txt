when instagram users try to search for the aubergine , or eggplant , emoji hashtag no posts appear - even if there are posts tagged in this way last night instagram rolled out its latest update that lets users create and search for hashtags using emoji
but it appears not all emoji hashtags are created equal
when people try to search for the aubergine , or eggplant , emoji using a hashtag on the app , no posts appear - even though there are posts that have been tagged with it
and it is believe to be because the emoji is commonly used to represent male genitalia and may be attached to images containing nudity
emoji hashtags were released as part of instagram 's latest app update , which also added three new filters and a redesigned love button
hashtags can now be used with single emoji , multiple emoji or can be combined with text in post , comments , captions and when using the explore tab
instagram told mailonline it is not commenting on the eggplant anomaly
but , given that the emoji could potentially be tagged onto images that contain nudity , it is likely the app is restricting its use under its community guidelines
instagram 's guidelines explain : ' we know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature , but for a variety of reasons we do nât allow nudity on instagram
in terms of the needle , many images posted using this hashtag include tattoos and giving blood following yesterday 's update , instagram users can post , explore other people 's photos and interact with captions using emoji
emoji are popular in the instagram community , with nearly half of instagram captions ( pictured on rosie huntington-whiteley 's page ) already featuring the small pictures but she also noted that despite issuing an apparent blanket ban on searching for the aubergine emoji , searches for emojis such as the gun and a needle and syringe are allowed
however , if an image was to be posted of a person using drugs or guns in an illegal way instagram would remove it
they use twice as many so - called ' raunchy humour emoji ' , including the banana , eggplant , peach , cherries and cancer astrological symbol than average ( pictured ) this would rely on either the image being reported by a fellow member or instagram seeing the image itself
subsequently , this suggests it will potentially allow images of illegal activity to appear in search , when tagged in this way , and act on it retrospectively but wo n't allow images of nudity to appear in the search results at all
following the launch of the new feature , instagram told mailonline : ' over the past few years , emoji have become part of a universal visual language
' from today , on instagram emoji will now work within hashtags , so you can add them to your posts , search for them on the explore page , and tap on them in captions
' emoji are popular in the instagram community , with nearly half of instagram captions already featuring the small pictures
the most popular emoji on instagram is the crying with laughter face , followed by the face with love hearts for eyes and blowing a kiss emoji
other popular emoji are the ok hand gesture , two hearts , clapping hands , another crying with laughter face , thumbs up , smiley face and kiss mark ( pictured left to right ) instagram also unveiled three new filters
