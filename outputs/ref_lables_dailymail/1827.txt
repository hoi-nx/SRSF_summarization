on first glance they appear to simply be bland , bleach - white seashells , but when viewed under ultraviolet light they are transformed
scientists have used a new technique to reconstrcut the colourful patterns on 28 fossilised cone snail shells that are up to 6.6 million years old
the fossilised cone snail shells have bleached over time , like the one labelled a , but under ultraviolet light traces of pigment still in the shells are revealed , labelled b , allowing their colours to be reconstrcuted ( c ) instead of being a simple white colour , they were infact covered in streaks of orange , purple , blue and even large pokadots
the scientists now believe the cone snail shells , which come from the northern dominican republic , include 13 entirely new species
dr hendricks , a paleontologist at the san jose state university who led the research , said that the lack of colouration in many fosisilised cone snail shells made them difficult to identify
he said : ' original coloration patterns â if not the actual colors themselves â sometimes become visible when fossil shells are illuminated with ultraviolet light , which causes formerly pigmented regions of the shell to fluoresce
' dr hendricks used the ultraviolet technique to examine a range of fossilised shells that were discovered in the cibao valley of the northern dominican republic
there are around 700 species of cone snail still living in tropical seas worldwide and around 1,000 species have been found in the fossil record
this image shows three of the fossil shells studied by the scientists as they currently appear without colour scientists used uv light to reveal tiny traces of the pigment left in the shell and the patterns they once had however , identifying these can often be tricky as over time the bright pigments in the shells fade
exposing them to ultraviolet light causes any remaining organic matter in the shells - like pigment - to fluoresce
dr hendricks , whose work is published in the journal public library of science one , compared the cone snail shells he examined with the patterns of those of modern caribbean cone snails
uv light allowed scientists to peer back millions of years to reconstruct shell patterns and colours as above dr hendricks said : ' this approach â combined with the exceptional neogene fossil record of the dominican republic , as well as other regional fossil deposits â has the potential to provide a detailed understanding of the evolutionary and biogeographic development of the modern western atlantic cone snail fauna
