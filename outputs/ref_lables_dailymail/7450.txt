google wallet says it has changed its policy when storing users ' funds as they will now be federally - insured for those who use google wallet , their money just became safer with federal - level insurance
google confirmed to yahoo finance in a statement that its current policy changed - meaning the company will store the balances for users of the mobile transfer service ( similar to paypal and venmo ) in multiple federally - insured banking institutions
this is good news for people who place large amounts of money in their wallet balance because the federal deposit insurance corporation insures funds for banking institutions up to $ 250,000
currently , google 's user agreement says funds are not protected by the federal deposit insurance corporation
however , a google spokesperson told yahoo finance that the current policy has changed
as a non-banking institution , google wallet , along with paypal and venmo , is not legally required to be federally insured
but with the new change to its policy , funds in wallet balance are protected if anything were to happen to the company like bankruptcy
for example , for those who use mobile payment services where funds are not federal deposit insurance corporation insured , if a company files for bankruptcy , the user would become their creditor and would be required to go through bankruptcy court to get their money back
