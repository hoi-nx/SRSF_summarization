in a week where people have been highlighting the lack of young english talent in the premier league , it âs good to see three youngsters playing in my old position have really caught the eye this season
calum chambers , eric dier and john stones have all enjoyed excellent premier league campaigns
defence is not the easiest area for a young player to make an impression â managers can be reluctant to trust youth in a position of responsibility â but these three have done just that
chambers and stones are still 20 and eric dier is 21 , but there are no signs of fear in their games
arsenal defender calum chambers ( left ) has impressed in his first season at the club everton defender john stones ( right ) puts in a challenge against liverpool striker daniel sturridge tottenham defender eric dier ( left ) has grown in stature as the season has progressed at white hart lane in a way , we should nât really be surprised
i first saw eric dier playing for the england and he still looked raw
i felt his body type made him ideally suited to centre half and he has made that position his own at tottenham
eric dier ( left ) stood up strongly against chelsea striker diego costa in the capital one cup final at wembley stones has moved across from right back into the centre of defence for everton and has flourished his rise has been quite spectacular
he has gone from a promising squad player to a first - team regular alongside jan vertonghen
the best central defenders demand so much from those around them and if that mentality is drilled into him , eric dier could improve tottenham âs rather soft underbelly
stones has spent time at right back but now finds himself at the heart of the everton defence
with chambers , i never doubted he was going to the right club , but i did wonder how many games he would play at arsenal
with lots of competition for places , he has a real fight on his hands but he has already made 35 appearances this season
chambers ( right ) has played at right back , centre - back and midfield for arsenal during the season england manager roy hodgson could be tempted to field the trio in a back three for the three lions in one on ones , sometimes he does nât look set
all three have taken huge steps forward this season , and with england using two centre - back partnerships in the last two games , those positions could be up for grabs
