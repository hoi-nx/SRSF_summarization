like any mother with an eight - month - old baby , today show host savannah guthrie is ready and willing to try any top parenting tricks which will help her precious baby girl vale drift off
' all smiles : savannah guthrie 's eight - month - old daughter vale giggled with glee when her mom tried to get her to sleep using tissue paper savannah , who had the experiment filmed by the today show cameras , showed a clip of baby vale ready for bed in a light blue onesie printed with pink birds â but as soon as she started caressing her daughter 's face with the tissue , the infant broke out into a wide smile
last month , nathan dailo , a father from sydney , posted a video to his youtube channel demonstrating how he gets his three - month - old son seth to fall asleep in just 42 seconds with a single piece of white tissue paper
the clip of his son drifting off has since received more than 1.7 million views , with one mom commenting on wednesday that the trick worked for her baby five times already
full of energy : the 43 - year - old watched as her daughter grabbed at the white tissue paper she was using to try and calm her down before bed looking confused : vale , who wore light blue onesie with pink birds , stared at her mom , who was trying to get her ready for bed although the tip did n't quite work on savannah 's smiley daughter , she noted that vale ' really loved it '
' in february , savannah threw an impromptu party for her daughter live on air in celebration of baby vale âs six - month birthday
