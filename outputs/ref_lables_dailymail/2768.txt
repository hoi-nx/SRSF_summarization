mark one up for the future of golf over its past and present as 21 - year - old jordan spieth took the first - day honours with a stunning opening round of 64 on a spectacular day of scoring at the sun - baked 79th masters
for much of the day it looked as if he might have to share top billing with 34 - year - old justin rose and 45 - year - old ernie els , as the englishman and the south african posted scores of 67 to tie charley hoffman , an american representative of the rank and file
last man out jason day would join them in the evening shadows
but by then jordan spieth had separated himself from the field to become the youngest first - round leader in masters history with a fabulous run of six birdies in seven holes before adding a wonderful flourish at the 18th , where he brushed in a 25 - foot birdie putt
runner - up on his debut last year , he now owns a three - shot lead going into day two
jordan spieth sinks his birdie put on the 18th at augusta to take a three - shot lead into the second round justin rose made the early running with an impressive five - under - par 67 rose consoles gunn yang after the amateur finished his round on 13 over most of the favoured names left augusta national feeling reasonably content , as rory mcilroy and defending champion bubba watson shot 71 , while dustin johnson and masters specialist mickelson opened with rounds of 70
jordan spieth has barely been off a leader - board all year and there was no chance of him being off this one during this round where he hit flagsticks , holed putts from everywhere and enjoyed the requisite amount of fortune as well as a wayward drive at the 13th bounced off the georgia pines into the middle of the fairway
at that moment anything seemed possible â even a 62 , thereby setting a new standard for scoring in the 155 - year history of majors
naturally , jordan spieth was not about to get greedy
a packed crowd watch rose on the 10th green during the first round rose and charley hoffman ( above ) made the early running at augusta with a 67 south african ernie els rolled back the years with a superb 67 on thursday rose in full bloom on day one is a sight as familiar as the glorious azaleas
that year he went on to hold the 36 - hole lead as well , while in 2007 he was lying tied second going into the final round , eventually finishing tied fifth
â ernie els used his ball - striking skills to get out of trouble on the 17th hole during the first round rory mcilroy appeared relaxed as he walked down the ninth fairway with mickelson , right , rory mcilroy recovered from a shaky start to finish the first round on one - under - par rose was nât the only englishman to prosper , as in - form paul shot 69
after greg norman , ernie els might be the great hard - luck story when it comes to fabulous players who never quite got it done here
ernie els is still trying , at 45 , and what a joy to see one of the great ball - strikers roll back a decade or two rather than the years to post his five - under score
two clunked chip shots at the third and sixth also betrayed a level of tension that illustrated fully the momentous nature of the achievement he is trying to complete in shooting for the career grand slam
american jordan spieth celebrates with his caddie michael greller on the 18th defending champion bubba watson struggled to find his rhythm in opening round tiger woods feels the heat with the world no 111 struggling to get under par during the opening round tiger woods reacts to a poor chip shot on the third hole as the pressure begins to tell there were also two encouraging moments during that front nine , however , when he turned what would have been double bogeys in the past into mere bogeys
at the sixth , his mis - hit chip came back down the steep slope but he did nât panic
