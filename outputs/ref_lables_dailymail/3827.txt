the idea of a device that constantly keeps an eye on your home and can tell you which electrical devices are running at any one time , may sound appealing when it comes to saving energy and money
now there âs a device called neurio that claims to make any ' ordinary home smart â and even tells you when you 've accidently left lights on
the $ 250 ( Â£ 168 ) device recognises the electronic signature of different devices - such as kettles and washing machines - allowing users to keep an eye on their energy consumption and even control appliances through their phone

â its website says : â using a wi-fi power sensor and a cloud service with some smart pattern detection algorithms , neurio monitors your home 's electricity to figure out what your appliances are up to - without the need to install sensors on every device
â neurio feeds information about energy consumption of the devices it âs recognised back to an app , where users can make decisions about how to save power and money by turning gadgets off , for instance

it measures both differential voltage and current signals every split second and these signals are used to calculate power and energy consumption
when the algorithms detect that a device has been turned on or off , or a user returning home , they notify the neurio app and services such as ifttt which allows devices to be controlled from smartphones
