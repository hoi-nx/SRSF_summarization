a gipsy group who exploited human rights laws to stay in their illegal camp for more than five years have won another legal battle to stay - in a fight that has cost taxpayers Â£ 200,000
the 78 irish travellers , who hail from just four families , had refused to budge despite facing three different courts , a planning inquiry and a council
and locals in hardhorn , lancashire , accused the group of trashing their leafy village - and branded them the ' neighbours from hell '
a gipsy group who exploited human rights laws to stay in their illegal camp for more than five years have won another legal battle to stay the group claimed the eviction ' violated ' the human rights of the 39 children living on the site in 60 caravans last october , the camp , which had flouted planning rules , appeared to have lost its case after the travellers were told to move out by the court of appeal
but despite being given four months to leave the site without the chance to appeal , the group used a loophole to take their case to the supreme court
they claimed the eviction ' violated ' the human rights of the 39 children living on the site in 60 caravans
the supreme court later rejected pleas for the group to be allowed the right of appeal under a ' point of law of general public importance
' the travellers really have been the neighbours from hell
' the camp ( pictured ) appeared to have lost its case after the travellers were told to move out by the court of appeal last year a village spokesman added : ' after five years five months the travellers site have fought every decision , we believe that they have used legal aid to fight the secretary of state and fylde bc. ' the question what we would like to know is how these people qualified for legal aid ? using taxpayers ' money to fight the taxpayer ! ' he added the decision to hold a judicial review on the grounds presented is ' totally wrong '
the travellers then set up camp after sneaking in during the the dead night in what neighbours described as a ' military - style operation ' and after council offices had closed for the weekend the group of around 30 adults and 40 children , from irish and scottish families , immediately began work laying foundations under outdoor spot lights
locals in hardhorn , lancashire ( pictured above ) accused the camp 's ( pictured nearby ) occupants of trashing their leafy village but in 2010 , a county court judge then told the authorities to ' use their best endeavours ' to help the travellers get a post code for the land from the post office
fylde council refused the group retrospective planning permission and issued an enforcement notice instead demanding that they move off the site
the group were initially given until july last year to quit - but just days before the council 's deadline for the travellers to move , miss collins lodged an appeal which further delayed the eviction
arguing the enforcement notices were ' unlawful ' , she said the eviction would force her and her extended family on to the roadside , which will have a major impact on the children living on the site
she added that the children 's human rights were ' violated ' as eviction would affect their health and educational prospects .
