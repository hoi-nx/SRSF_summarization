the average woman will spend an eye - watering Â£ 18,000 on products for her face in her lifetime , but may be throwing those hard earned pennies down the drain by applying them incorrectly
indeed , many women make common mistakes every single day that could lead to their skin ageing faster
femail called on the best dermatologists in the business to shed some light on the classic mistakes women make and to share their vital tips for ensuring you 're getting the most from your skincare regime
' apply creams in the correct order another simple way to make your products work harder ( particularly if you 've spent a small fortune on them ) is applying them in the right order
indeed , products with a thinner consistency - such as serum - should always be applied before thick face creams
products with a thinner consistency - such as serum - should always be applied before thick face creams those creams with heavier consistencies can actually stop the lighter ones from penetrating the skin and doing the job they 've been designed to do - practically making them redundant
never sleep with your hair down this is a common mistake copious amounts of women make - but one that can easily be rectified
by sleeping with your hair and fringe down , the oils from your locks ( not to mention the greasy hairspray and serums you 've used in the day ) are kept well away from your face
not everyone needs a toner cleanse , tone and moisturise is a mantra for millions of women , sold by the beauty industry as a sure - fire way to fresh , glowing skin
but while the benefits of cleansing and moisturising are obvious , part of the routine is simply habit for many women - and few question its benefits : toning
toning is meant to remove the last traces of dirt and grime , leaving skin dewy and pores closed
but many women who religiously apply this classic skincare product do n't realise toners can include harsh ingredients such as alcohol , which can dry out even the most oily skin , and parabens , which have been shown to induce allergic reactions
dr bunting believes that even if your toner does n't harm your skin , its place in your beauty regime may be redundant
the skin on the face is at its healthiest when it is slightly acidic
' all that would seem to make toner a must , but if you have relatively normal skin , exfoliate regularly , and use a cleanser that does not strip your skin of its natural moisture , you should be able to maintain a healthy ph level
' by sleeping with your hair and fringe down , the oils from your locks ( not to mention the greasy hairspray and serums you 've used in the day ) are kept well away from your face do n't over-cleanse while the key to acne - free skin is squeaky clean skin , you can do more harm than good by over washing your face
you can also over exfoliate by buffing away too much of your top skin layer , which serves as a protective barrier against environmental toxins and sun damage - both of which accelerate the ageing process
dr. geoff genesky , kiehl âs head of laboratory , emphasises that consumers should also be careful to follow product instructions very carefully , especially when using products that have anti-ageing benefits but that can be a bit harsh to the skin 's outermost layers
