it is the product of one man who collected for nearly 30 years
he was obsessed with tipu - he published pieces and loaned items to major exhibitions
these items are not just arms and armour but far more than that - they 're works of art. storming of seringapatam under general baird and death of tipu , may 4 , 1799 , in the mysore war
tipu was shot and killed in the onslaught duke of wellington was a 30 - year - old army general when he led troops to mysore in the late 18th century
then a young duke of wellington , he earned his stripes and learned skills fighting tipu , nicknamed the tiger of mysore , that would later prove vital in defeating french dictator napolean on the battlefields of battle of waterloo
his elder brother wellesley , the british governor general , had waged war against the sultan after a spy intercepted a letter from napolean proposing an alliance
it was to be the fourth war between the brits and the southern indian kingdom of mysore in just over 30 years
duke of wellington led the british army into tipu 's stronghold of seringapatam , the capital of mysore , on april 5 1799 with the military planning and precision that came to be his strongest attributes
more than two decades letter wellesley , by then the duke of wellington , used the same skills he had learned against tipu to crush napolean at the battle of waterloo
' it would be fair to say duke of wellington learned the skills he later displayed at the battle of waterloo fighting against tipu , although tipu gave the brits a good run for their money
' many of the pieces have 200 - year provenances in the british
' some were personal weapons of tipu 's - one such is a huge gun with a crouching tiger carved into the butt which was gifted to lord cornwallis after the fall of seringapatam
