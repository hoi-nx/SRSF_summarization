a 4,000 - year - old tree thought to be britain 's oldest living organism may be dying according to its custodian
its central trunk is hollow with six smaller ones branching off - possible due to disease - and locals fear it is on its way out due to wilting branches and falling leaves
the 4,000 - year - old tree is ' looking extremely sick , ' according to a warden at the church in ashbrittle , somerset churchwarden charles doble said : ' the tree is supposed to be the oldest living thing in england and was already fairly mature when stonehenge was being built
' but it 's looking extremely sick at the moment and i 'm worried whether the rural church or the yew will die first
' but tree expert dr owen johnson said the yew , in the village 10 miles west of taunton , could just be going through a bad patch
