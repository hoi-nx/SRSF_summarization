england 's premier bowler anderson suffered a frustrating day in his bid to become his country 's all - time leading wicket taker in his 100th test appearance in antigua
but pace attack colleague chris jordan believes the anderson family celebration party is ' just around the corner ' as west indies fell to 155 for four in response to england 's first - innings total of 399
anderson , watched by his parents , wife , two daughters and agent and needing four wickets to overtake the great sir ian botham 's haul of 383 , claimed only one early victim in west indies opener devon smith in his 13 overs , which went for 24 runs and eight maidens
anderson moved to within two wickets of sir ian botham 's record of 383 test wickets anderson could only take the one wicket on day two of the first test in antigua but even the england back - room staff were surprised that anderson bowled just four overs in the last session of play with team - mates jordan , stuart broad and tredwell sharing the other wickets to fall
chris jordan took a stunning slip catch off tredwell to dismiss west indies vice-captain brathwaite , who claimed after play that he thought anderson ' looked tired '
but chris jordan said : ' anderson got us off and running with the first wicket and the rest of us tried to back that up , which i thought we did pretty well
chris jordan jumps for joy after taking the wicket of darren bravo on the second afternoon jordan appeals for an lbw against west indian batsman brathwaite , but it was unsuccessful ' the stat is obviously there but i do n't think anderson or any of us are going about our cricket or thinking about things differently
' ironically , no 11 anderson and chris jordan were the pick of the lower - order england batsman in a last - wicket partnership of 38 as the west indies bowling attack , inspired by a talk from bowling coach sir curtly ambrose , captured the last five wickets for 58
