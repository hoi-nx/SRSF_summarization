they may look like inventions straight out of a sci - fi film , but this collection of designs were very much real and developed in a top - secret british war lab more than 70 years ago
ministry of defence 1 , also known as â churchill 's toyshop â , was a weapons laboratory set up in 1939 by winston churchill - a firm believer in the importance of science and technology in warfare
he encouraged his scientists to trial even the most absurd of inventions - many of which never made it beyond the drawing board - but some were so successful that they played a vital role in ending world war two
the panjandrum : a giant wheel covered in rockets the atlantic was a series of robust fortifications built after 1942 by the nazis to defend against an anticipated allied invasion
winston churchill was born in blenheim palace into the blue - blooded dynasty of the dukes of marlborough
it posed a significant obstacle for allies , and so a potential solution to create a breach large enough to allow a vehicle through was dreamed up by one of churchill âs military think - tanks
the panjandrum was an unlikely - looking weapon , made up of two large wooden cartwheels with a ton of explosives sandwiched between them inside the axle

the time pencil : a hidden detonator with sights on the fuhrer otherwise known as â pencil detonators â or officially as â switch , number 10 , delay â , these were pencil - shaped timed fuses with a vial of corrosive copper chloride at one end
one of these detonators was used in the 20 july plot of 1944 , in the briefcase - bomb attempt to kill hitler
the limpet mine : like a sea mine , but with a man attached the idea of using a human torpedo to attach explosive charges had been around since the end of world war one
divers would carry the limpet mines underwater and attach them to ships , causing devastating damage when they exploded
seven japanese ships were sunk or disabled by allied commandos alone , using limpet mines in singapore harbour , 1943
winston churchill âs ' human torpedo ' used the most powerful magnet in the world at the time to attach around 4.5lbs ( two kilograms ) of explosive to an enemy ship , capable of punching a large hole in the hull you can read more about winston churchill 's ' mad science ' in issue 22 of all about history 4
plus , the invention of long - range aircraft fuel tanks and the use of airfields in the azores made it redundant
geoffrey pyke 's radical idea was to build huge flotillas carved out of icebergs that could house aircraft and provide a runway - although they never came into being 5
its handle contained a five - second fuse and a safety pin that , upon being pulled , released the metal casing and exposed the adhesive
artificial harbours : a pop - up invasion aid to bring the tanks ashore â mulberries â , or artificial harbours as they were otherwise known , were portable , temporary harbours designed specifically in world war two to help the allies unload the heavy cargoes associated with a large - scale invasion
in the years leading up to the d - day landings , it had become apparent that any attempt to land en masse on the atlantic coastline of western europe would require the use of the french harbours
â mulberries â ( one pictured ) , or artificial harbours as they were otherwise known , were portable , temporary harbours designed specifically in world war two to help the allies unload the heavy cargoes associated with a large - scale invasion 7
the piat : a one - man artillery barrage ( when it hit anything ) by the middle of world war two enemy tanks had become increasingly well armoured , to the point that they were impenetrable to the outdated infantry grenade launchers
