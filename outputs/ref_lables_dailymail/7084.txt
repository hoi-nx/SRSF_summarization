troubling questions : lord janner controversially escaped prosecution for a string of child abuse allegations because the cps said alzheimer âs has left him unfit to face trial a former dpp has said lawyers involved in the decision not to charge janner with child abuse in 2007 failed to pass new evidence to him
lord macdonald qc , who was dpp between 2003 and 2008 , said that instead of consulting with headquarters in london , cps lawyers in leicestershire decided fresh evidence against janner was not worth pursuing through the courts
that decision meant janner , now 86 , was able to escape prosecution for eight years until the cps controversially announced earlier this week that he is now unfit to stand trial due to alzheimer 's
speaking to the guardian , lord macdonald said : ' it is a matter of great regret that i was never informed of the existence of this case in 2007

lord macdonald qc , director of public prosecutions from 2003 to 2008 , said the decision not to prosecute janner in 2007 was made by local cps lawyers , and new evidence was not passed to him probes : janner , left in 1974 , served as an mp for decades and was investigated in 1991 , 2002 and 2007 she went on to say that â mistakes were made â , and commissioned retired high court judge , sir richard henriques , to launch an inquiry

â claims that janner was not fit to stand trial have been undermined by another case where a sex offender with dementia was brought to court
massingham , 77 , was deemed not fit to stand trial on historic child abuse allegations because of his mental health but he was charged with 12 offences
peter saunders , of the national association for people abused in childhood , said the case proved what the authorities could have done over janner
in serious cases where a judge rules a suspect is not fit to stand trial a jury can hear the evidence in the suspect âs absence and decide if the individual committed the crimes .
