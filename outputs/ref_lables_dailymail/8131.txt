a pre-med student in new york city is taking microscopic images of diseases and other biological structures and turning them into prints for her innovative new athletic apparel and accessories line
lizzie cochran , a student at columbia university , has launched a kickstarter campaign to fund her upcoming fashion line epidemia esigns, , which she came up with after spending days upon days staring at cells through microscopes in her biology classes , and then spotting an article on epidemics that displayed images of deadly diseases from recent history
' the one that jumped out at me was the flu of 1918 virus , ' lizzie cochran told today
in her design work , lizzie cochran also began to see the potential for changing perceptions of infectious diseases , as well as the relatively apathy towards them that results in the preventable deaths of 1.5 million children per year simply because they have n't been vaccinated
the brains of the outfit : pre-med student lizzie cochran came up with the idea for the fashion line after studying biology under a microscope giving ' cell phone ' a whole new meaning : team epidemia will offer phone cases with eye catching patterns from microscopic images including that of heart tissue , chicken pox and polio from the petri dish to the yoga pant : epidemia legging , s like the pair featuring a lung x-ray design pictured , will initially be priced at around $ 75 ' frankly , it 's unacceptable , ' lizzie cochran told today
' with this idea in mind , lizzie cochran is promising to send 15 per cent of the profits to funding projects aimed at limiting the impact of preventable diseases such as polio , rubella and hepatitis , as well as expanding medical care access around the globe
team epidemia : based on the strength of her idea , lizzie cochran has enlisted a new vp of retail , taylor newby ( third from right ) , and several friends as models for the project showing off their muscles : the kickstarter campaign to produce the clothing for the public has nearly reached its goal of $ 15,000 the first group of designs lined up will be called ' she 's got it ' will have the theme of beauty in a woman 's body and will feature images of brain , nerve , heart and epithelial ( stomach )
