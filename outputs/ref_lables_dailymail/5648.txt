an exotic animal owner from ohio is campaigning for his bear and big cats to be returned after they were seized by the state in january
in total , six tigers , a bear , a lion , a cougar , a black leopard and a liger ( part lion , part tiger ) were taken from kenny hetrick 's stony ridge farm after it was found he did not have the correct permit and cages were ' unsafe '
authorities have also started cracking down on the owners of wild creatures following an incident in 2011 where a man in eastern ohio released 56 exotic animals - including lions and tigers - then killed himself
apparently kenny hetrick has been heartbroken by the clampdown on his farm and the 72 - year - old widower is now fighting to overturn the seizure , backed by neighbors who insist his menagerie does n't pose a threat
' he 's lost without them , ' said josh large , who lives four houses away
' kenny hetrick allowed anyone to visit at no charge , getting by with help from volunteers and donations of cash , as well as of deer and horse meat to feed his animals
flashback : in total six tigers , a bear , a lion , a cougar , a black leopard and a liger were taken from kenny hetrick 's farm after it was found he did not have the correct permit - here he is seen in 2014 with his pet bear however , the 2011 incident mentioned earlier pushed ohio to tighten regulations on ' private zoos '
owners are now required to have sturdy cages , background checks and insurance before receiving an annual permit
' i know i did n't have everything done , but i thought they 'd work with me , ' said kenny hetrick , who acknowledged before his animals were taken that he could n't afford everything the state wanted
state officials in january rejected his application for a permit , which includes a $ 1,000 fee , saying it submitted was too late
they also said state inspectors who visited the sanctuary outside toledo last november discovered the tigers could stand on their housing and get dangerously near the top of their cages
the inspection noted there were unsecured padlocks and chains and not enough fencing around an enclosure holding a tiger and black leopard
' empty : a sign affixed to a cage at tiger ridge exotics in stony ridge , ohio , indicates that it is the home of cody the bear - cody and 10 other exotic animals were seized by the state in january lonesome : only chief the wolf was n't seized because it does n't fall under the exotic animal law the ohio department of agriculture has a duty to protect the public 's safety , spokeswoman erica hawkins said
kenny hetrick is appealing the department 's rejection of his permit application and a hearing is scheduled for next week , but the fight will probably continue in court no matter what a state panel decides
until then , the ten animals - a lion named leo that had been in failing health was euthanized by the state last week - will remain a two - hour drive away outside columbus , in a high - security building operated by the state
' source : toledo news now supporters of kenny hetrick believe the animals - only the wolf was n't seized because it does n't fall under the exotic animal law - have been mistreated and will not survive long outside their home
state officials insist they are fine
kenny hetrick does n't have formal training with wild animals , but he has been around them about 60 years , since he was a ten - year - old volunteer cleaning cages at a zoo in tarpon springs , florida
erica crawford , who has been visiting kenny hetrick 's animals since she was a little girl and now brings her children , said she appreciates the uniqueness of the place
