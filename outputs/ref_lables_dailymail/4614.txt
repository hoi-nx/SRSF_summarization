a leading hospital has slashed cases of a deadly infection that can kill newborn babies â by defying national guidelines to offer all pregnant women a simple screening test
government officials have repeatedly insisted there is no evidence to support universal screening for group b strep , known as group b strep
this is despite the fact it is carried by one in four women and infects as many as 400 newborns in the british every year
current guidelines only recommend testing women deemed to be ' at risk '
she was just three days old but a programme which offered screening to all expectant women at northwick park hospital in london resulted in not a single case of the bacteria spreading to infants among those who were tested and subsequently treated with antibiotics
the only recorded cases during the 12 - month programme affected babies of women who had not agreed to be tested
crucially , clinicians noted that half of the women who tested positive for group b strep would not have been classified as ' at risk ' under the current guidelines â so their babies would not have been protected
it concluded that not all women who test positive for group b strep will go on to develop the infection or pass it on to their babies , so blanket screening would mean pregnant women would be unnecessarily given antibiotics , which carry their own risks to the foetus
in premature babies an increased risk of cerebral palsy has been associated with use of some antibiotics in labour
yet these results confound the decision , prompting calls for the government to introduce universal testing for pregnant women during standard ante - natal appointments , as is the case in germany , france and the us
a programme which offered screening to all expectant women at northwick park hospital in london resulted in not a single case of the bacteria spreading to infants among those who were tested jane plumb , chief executive of the charity group b strep support , said : ' the risk - based strategy has failed to reduce the rate of group b strep infection , and these findings contradict the party line that the risks of screening every woman would outweigh the benefits
' our work shows that group b strep screening of all expectant mothers can work and is likely to be more effective than the current risk based approach
' dr richard nicholl , consultant neonatal paediatrician at london north west healthcare nhs trust , said he had seen more than 100 babies with group b strep in 20 years
' since we began our comprehensive screening programme , i have not seen a new case in the babies of the mothers we have screened
group b strep is the most common cause of infection in newborn babies in the british
