a tory councillor with a history of odd behaviour was told to put down his knife and fork after being caught tucking into a roast duck dinner during a council meeting
bucknell , 58 , was enjoying his meal in the council chamber when a labour rival , blackwell , spotted him and alerted other councillors
taking a stand : bucknell is no stranger to odd behaviour
in 2013 he slept in his car at the tory party conference
he now says he wants a rule change so he can eat a roast dinner at council meetings the mayor , who was chairing the meeting of camden council in north london , reminded the hungry councillor that eating was banned in the chamber
but the angry diner claims he was unaware eating there was forbidden and said he now aims to campaign for a rule change
telling off : mayor of camden council , lazzaro pietragnoli , had to tell mr bucknell to stop eating when he first noticed him eating , mr blackwell told his fellow councillors : ' it appears that one of our tory colleagues is consuming a full sunday roast dinner in the council chamber
mr bucknell , who has been a councillor for more than ten years and represents belsize , hampstead , told the evening standard : ' i never knew there was a ban on eating in the chamber
he previously found fame when he slept in his volvo car to save on hotel bills during the tory in september 2013
mr bucknell said at the time it was to make a stand against what he called ' ridiculous prices '
