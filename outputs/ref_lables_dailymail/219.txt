in a book stã©phane charbonnier , known as charb , finished just two days before being murdered by jihadist gunmen he argued that left - leaning intellectuals who denounced the cartoons in the satirical magazine were â ridiculous demagogues â for doing so
in the short book , extracts of which are to be published today in weekly magazine l'obs , he writes : â the suggestion that you can laugh at everything , except certain aspects of islam , because muslims are much more susceptible than the rest of the population , what is that , if not discrimination ? in a book stã©phane charbonnier ( pictured ) , known as charb , finished just two days before being mowed down by jihadist gunmen he argued that left - leaning intellectuals who denounced the cartoons in the satirical magazine were â ridiculous demagogues â journalists hold placards reading ' i am je suis charlie ' as they hold a minute of silence on january 7 following the attack by gunmen in the offices of charlie hebdo â it 's time to finish with this disgusting paternalism of the white , left - wing bourgeois intellectual seeking to prove himself among the â poor unfortunate undereducated â
â the book , lettre ouverte aux escrocs de l'islamophobie qui font le jeu des racistes ( open letter to the fraudsters of islamophobia who play into racists ' hands ) , which may well rock the ' je suis charlie ' solidarity over the massacre , argues that some intellectuals who condemned the drawings were merely attention - seekers
â charb asks why islamophobia , which technically means â fear of islam â , is being used by activists , media and politicians to denounce hatred of muslims and wonders why â islamophobia â is not used instead , or simply â racism â
he argues that â a lot of those who campaign against islamophobia do n't actually do it to defend muslims as individuals , but to defend prophet mohammad 's religion â
â the problem is not the koran or the bible - sleep - inducing , incoherent and badly written novels - but the faithful who read the koran or the bible like you read assembly instructions for ikea shelves , â he writes
he blames the media for helping popularise the term â islamophobia â because â any scandal that contains the word islam in its title sells
chillingly , he refers to al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula 's inspire magazine which in 2013 published a list of 11 people accused of â crimes against islam â and wanted â dead or alive â
â i find my name , badly spelled but accompanied by a photo where you can recognise my alarmed face â -- a picture he said was taken when the offices of the magazine were burnt down in 2011 shortly after a special edition was published under the title charia hebdo
