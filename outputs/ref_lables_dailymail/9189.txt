' but it is not the main issue
the main issue is we have too many people allowed to come here which is pushing down people 's wages
' in his speech mr ed miliband insisted that there was an ' epidemic of exploitation '
' and it is in these low skill , insecure workplaces where migrant labour is often concentrated
' too often this anything - goes economy damages the interests of the working people of the country
people who live in the most appalling , cramped conditions , sleeping 20 to a house ; people who are paid well below the minimum wage ; people who have their wages stolen
