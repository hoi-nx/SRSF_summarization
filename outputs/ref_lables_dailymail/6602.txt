and it 's not just brits that are starting to make excited estimations , the frenzy has reached us where there are more than a few guesses about royal baby particulars
in the uk , charlotte , alice and alexandra are the leading names , with charlotte scooping the lead with 13 per cent
us instead favour distinctively prominent royal names , with the top three being diana at 19 per cent , and elizabeth and victoria tying at 12 per cent in terms of popularity
both brits and us agree on james , richard and arthur as their favourite top three boy names , with james scooping the lead , at 27 per cent in the uk and 15 per cent in the us , in terms of popularity
us have picked diana and elizabeth as their favourite names if the royal baby is in fact a girl
the popularity of these names could have stemmed from prominent names of other royals , including the diana ( pictured left ) and elizabeth ( pictured right ) and it 's not only immediate particulars about the unborn baby 's life being discussed ; people were also keen to throw in their two cents about the most suitable roles for the child 's later life
both were in agreement that in the future , baby number two should focus on acting as a good role model for young people
a poll by yougov revealed that both brits and us want royal baby number two to be a girl ( picture posed by model ) according to a new survey by the usc , us are five times less interested in the new royal baby than they were with george
