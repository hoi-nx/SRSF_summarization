the queensland government has called a government decision to deport a single - mother and her son ' cold and heartless '
townsville nurse sevilla and her son , tyrone , will be forced out of the country within 28 days , after ms sevilla 's appeal to the immigration department was unsuccessful
the single - mum initially had her visa application rejected because her son 's autism would be a ' burden on the australia health system ' , according to the immigration department
queensland disabilities minister coralee o'rourke called it a ' cold , heartless decision ' by the federal government
' most visas for australia require applicants to meet the health requirements set out in australia migration law , ' the spokeswoman said
' the health requirements are an objective assessment to determine whether the care of an individual during their stay in australia would likely result in significant costs on the australia community
' ms sevilla , a single mum and nurse in the queensland town of townsville , has lived in australia with her son since 2007
she says it is the only place he knows , and he only knows english maria sevilla has lived in australia since 2007 , when she arrived in the queensland town of townsville - a single mother wanting to become a nurse , in the hope of finding a better life for herself and for her baby
ms maria sevilla told daily mail australia the new life in australia ' changed everything ' for her and her son , and she was able to fulfill her ' dream ' of working as a nurse
it was not possible for ms sevilla to work as a nurse in the philippines , where she said university is only possible for ' well - off families '
ms sevilla also rejected claims her son will be a burden on the country
' all of it could be taken away because the government thinks that children with autism are going to be more of a cost to australia society than a benefit â but that 's just not true , ' she said
ms sevilla has made a petition and is appealing the decision to send herself and her son back to the philippines - a place where she has no family and no network of support
' ms sevilla 's application for a skilled-region visa subclass 489 has been rejected by the department of immigration and border protection due to tyrone 's autism
tyrone is a ' very cheeky , happy little boy ' who is thriving at his specialised school in townsville before appealing the decision , ms sevilla said she had received heartwarming support from many australia
' i have received so many messages from mums of children with autism ; it 's very prevalent in australia , ' ms sevilla said ' as a mother of a child with autism , i know it is n't a disease you have to cure , but one you have to manage
' ms sevilla is sad , not angry , that the immigration department does not understand autism , and says that her son deserves a chance due to tyrone 's autism , even minor changes to their routines troubles him , meaning having their deportation would cause enormous issues for the little boy
ms sevilla says there is no support for them in tyrone , compared to australia , where her beloved mother , brother , sister - in - law , aunty , uncle and cousins live
