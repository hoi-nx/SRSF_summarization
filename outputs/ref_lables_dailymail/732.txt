esa âs rosetta spacecraft has captured stunning images of a dust jet erupting from comet 67p churyumov-gerasimenko
the jet may have been caused by a wave of heat reaching ice trapped under the surface , causing an explosion of material
but it is unusual , because so far such activity has only been spotted on the day - side of the comet - not the night , like this
the jet is unusual because it is erupting from the dark underside of the comet , whereas such activity had only been seen on the day side so far
credit : esa the two images , released yesterday , were taken by the osiris camera on the rosetta spacecraft from a distance of 47 miles ( 75km ) , according to esa
but it âs not clear if this caused the jet - or an explosion of material caused by ice sublimating ( turning from solid to gas ) underground
two minutes later though , in the second image , a spectacular new jet emerges from the dark side , hurling dust into space at 26ft ( eight metres ) per second
â this was a chance discovery , â said osiris principal investigator dr holger sierks from the mps ( mps ) in germany
â it is possible that the first rays of sunlight hit some cliffs or outcrops that remained hidden to rosetta due to the orbital position at the time , â said osiris scientist dr vincent , also from the mps
the rosetta probe , which carried the philae lander lander , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of earth and mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko
rosetta , meanwhile , is continuing to orbit and study the comet

â rosetta is continuing to study comet 67p ahead of its closest approach to the sun in august
