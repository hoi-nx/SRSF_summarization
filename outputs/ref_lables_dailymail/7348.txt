the three - and - a - half minute video , titled â never letting him book a hotel again â , offers a glimpse into every traveller âs nightmare â dirty rooms , antiquated or broken amenities and a swimming pool no one would dare to enter
with scenes reminiscent of the inbetweeners films , the video was created by patrick miller and his friend , damien , who stayed at the family - run hotel last week when they travelled to the mediterranean island for a friend âs wedding
patrick miller , from cambridge , ' swims ' in the shallow end of the pool , which does n't have any water the deep end of the swimming pool at the hotel was filled with green sludge , dead insects and debris patrick miller , a self - employed personal trainer , created the amusing video with friend damien rigden patrick miller said in the video , which has thousands of views on facebook and youtube , that he allowed damien to book the room , and they thought they would be staying at a four - star hotel for three nights
â patrick miller 's friend , damien , stands under an outdoor shower , which no longer works , near the swimming pool this screen grab from the pair 's video shows the hot tub filled with stagnant water and dead flies the pair explored the hotel , including bathrooms with exposed pipes or missing toilets , in the video it shows the pair looking annoyed during a flight delay at the airport before they were â squashed â on the plane with very little legroom
things got worse at the hotel , where they found an unstaffed and empty bar , and a disgusting scene inside the outdoor swimming pool
patrick miller stands in uncut , waist - high grass on the grounds of the ' four - star ' hotel in cyprus the lads ' hotel room overlooked a dirty car park , where a lorry was abandoned , and a busy road the camera then pans to show him â swimming â on the floor of the shallow end of the pool , which has no water
it then pans even further to the deep end , which is filled with green sludge , dead insects and debris
they find the same problems when patrick miller checks out the hot tub
â later scenes show a tennis court without the net strung up , an outdoor shower that does nât work , a depressing hotel room view of a dirt car park with an abandoned lorry , paint peeling off the walls , and lights that do nât work or fittings that are missing altogether
at one point in the video patrick miller stands on the dilapidated tennis court with no nets strung up the hotel 's grounds were a fiasco , with overgrown grass and trees and dead flowers the grounds are a fiasco , with overgrown waist - high grass and trees , dead flowers and downed tree branches
the pair stayed at the hotel while they attended a friend 's wedding on the mediterranean island patrick miller said the staff were friendly but they spoke very little english , ' so it was a struggle ' to communicate ' our room was n't too bad , the sheets were clean and there was hot water , but when we looked in another bathroom there was n't even a toilet
