the indictments come on the same day that child - welfare workers across ohio are promoting awareness and prevention of child abuse and in the wake of a high - profile cincinnati case involving a 3 - month - old infant 's decapitation

last week , andrea bradley âs sister , townsend , told the station wcpo that the 28 - year - old mother of eight tortured her daughter
investigators say glenara 's parents dropped her from 6 feet about ground , and her mother then tried to close up her head wound at home with a needle and thread andrea bradley allegedly told detectives during questioning that she had whipped the toddler with a belt and failed to seek medical help for her after glenara was dropped on her head
