campaign to protect rural england president sir andrew motion , who is demanding a national clean - up council chiefs were condemned last night after claiming it was too dangerous to collect the roadside litter blighting uk
winchester council in hampshire said its annual clean - up of roads around the city had been hit by new health and safety executive rules designed to protect litter - pickers from traffic
but the health and safety executive denied tightening rules â and said councils were â over-interpreting â legislation
last night , former poet laureate sir andrew motion , now president of the campaign to protect rural england , accused town hall bosses and the highways agency of ruining the countryside by failing to remove rubbish
â although laws to fine people who throw litter from vehicles were now in place , their implementation had been delayed by â shameful time - wasting â , sir andrew motion said
â winchester council insisted that the health and safety executive had â clarified â last june that litter - picking was covered by the same code of practice that governs employees involved in highway maintenance â requiring a wider separation than was previously the case between workers and passing traffic .
