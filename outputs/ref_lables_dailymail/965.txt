it was meant to be the story of anderson breaking the england wicket - taking record and bowling england to victory in his 100th test but eventually this became the tall tale of a new west indian star
the perfect english script was ruined here on friday night by the giant figure of holder who repelled everything that anderson and co could hurl at him to make his maiden england century at no 8 and earn his side a deserved draw
anderson had finally taken his 384th wicket in test cricket when west indies captain denesh ramdin edged him to his great friend alastair cook at slip
what a mixture of emotions for anderson and england , who have been left in no doubts by graves that they have to win this three - england series against a side the new ecb chairman condemned as â mediocre
â they failed at the first attempt in what became close to a carbon - copy of the last england played in antigua six years ago when west indies held on for a draw with nine wickets down after england had set them a vast target
anderson has had ups and downs since claiming zimbabwe âs mark vermeulen as his first tests victim 12 years ago at lord âs but now he had finally overtaken sir ian botham as the most prolific bowler in england âs england history
in the stands were anderson âs parents michael and catherine and his wife daniella who , together with his young daughters lola and ruby , had travelled here for his 100th test and the excited expectation of an england record
anderson races away to celebrate after he claimed his record - breaking 384th wicket anderson is mobbed by his england team - mates after he broke sir ian botham 's long - standing record the celebrations were short lived , however , as england had to settle for a draw in the first test anderson is congratulated by ian botham as he leaves the field following the day 's action in antigua ian botham has a word with anderson following his bowling feat at the sir vivian richards stadium ian botham took 383 wickets in 102 tests between 1977 and 1992 but has relinquished that record to anderson holder gets a pat on the back following his superb batting display on day five against england denesh ramdin provided stubborn resistance as england chased a precious seventh wicket on friday after dismissing denesh ramdin , anderson celebrates his 384th england wicket to break ian botham 's record andersons ' parents and his wife daniella ( centre ) applaud from the stands following his seismic wicket previous holder of the record ian botham applauds anderson from the commentary box the england team form a huddle prior to the fifth day of the first test against west indies on friday devon smith made a bright start on friday sending a ball to the offside past england skipper alastair cook but devon smith would soon the be the first man to fall as he was caught out by tredwell 's delivery marlon samuels was the next west indies batsman to be dismissed at the hands of anderson holder leaves the field of play following his superb performance on day five against alastair cook 's side 1
brian statham 252 yet any thoughts england had of celebrating both anderson âs record and what would have been a priceless win were denied by a 6ft 7in 23 - year - old who provides genuine hope for the future of decaying caribbean cricket
holder is first and foremost a fast bowler but he has already been made one - day captain by west indies and now they can regard him , as sir viv richards believes , a genuine all - rounder who can lead his maligned side forward
anderson celebrates after equalling sir ian botham 's record of 383 test wickets root appeals for the wicket of chanderpaul after his delivery hit the batsman 's front pad root and his england team - mates celebrate following chanderpaul 's lbw dismissal anderson become england 's record test wicket - taker with his 384th scalp against the west indies , surpassing sir ian botham 's mark
awesome ! ! ' - sir ian botham ' congrats to the dingle @ jimmy9 england and lancashire best ever ! ! ' - andrew flintoff ' booooooooooom ' - kevin pietersen ' brilliant work by @ jimmy9 to surpass sir ian botham as our leading england bowler
@ burnleyofficial fans salute a fellow claret ' - alastair campbell ' anderson - take a bow ! congratulations ! # well done ' - jason gillespie ' huge congrats on your well deserved record @ jimmy9 ' - phil tufnell ' huge congratulations to @ jimmy9 on becoming england 's leading test wicket taker
' - alec stewart yet after devon smith and jermaine blackwood , who became the only casualty between lunch and tea , had thrown their wickets away with two of the worst shots any side seeking a draw can ever have played in test cricket , holder stepped forward to save the day
first the barbadian shared a stand of 105 with his england captain denesh ramdin that ate up 32 priceless overs and then when anderson had claimed his historic victim in ramdin , kemar roach joined his giant team - mate to clinch a draw
alastair cook âs declaration came at the right time , giving his side 130 overs to bowl west indies out and leaving them with very little chance of victory
