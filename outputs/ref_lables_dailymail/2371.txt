chatting happily and smiling during a peaceful walk in the grounds of their scottish country home , they could be any long - married couple enjoying a stroll
but this is the prince and the duchess of cornwall and the intimate shot marks not 40 years of marriage but 10
the couple , who married a decade ago at the windsor , are spending their anniversary privately at birkhall in deeside
the new image , which is the work of top photographer oliver dann , was taken in the run - up to last month 's visit to the u.s but was released by clarence house today
in it , charles wears a country coat made from inveravon estate tweed and a matching hat by lock & co , while camilla sports a hat by the same firm and a coat by moncler
charles and camilla finally married following a relationship spanning 35 years in a relatively quiet civil ceremony at the windsor on the 9th april 2005
despite fears that the couple would be booed - camilla was reportedly so nervous that she had to be dragged out of bed - the ceremony went off without a hitch
since then , the duchess of cornwall as she is now known , has become an integral part of the royal family - and would be cheerfully accepted as charles ' queen by 50 per cent of britons
that marks a significant turnaround from the duchess ' earliest days as a royal , with camilla following charles ' lead and often appearing nervous in front of photographers
but her enthusiastic championing of causes ranging from osteoporosis to sexual abuse survivors has not gone unnoticed and her relationship with the queen is now said to be close
happy : the pair are all smiles as they arrive at the britons ambassador 's residence in washington last month cheers ! charles and camilla pictured enjoying a dram during a visit to birkhall last summer ' but slowly , slowly she has become much more involved in royal life and taken on an awful lot of charitable causes
' in 2013 , camilla made her first ever appearance at the state opening of parliament wearing a glamorous champagne silk and lace bruce oldfield gown
close : prince william and the duchess of cornwall share a joke during last september 's invictus games support : the queen shares a carriage with camilla during the diamond jubilee celebrations in 2012 one is amused : camilla laughs with prince harry and the duchess of cornwall during the diamond jubilee similarly styled : the duchess of cornwall ' dress sense has also evolved over the last 10 years and is much like her daughter - in - law 's the duchess has also carried out joint engagements with the queen and in november hosted a reception on behalf of the monarch for the commonwealth essay competition
during the diamond jubilee in 2012 , the queen and camilla sat side - by - side in the ornate 1902 state landau - a step that would have been inconceivable a decade earlier
but it was camilla , not charles who was seated next to the queen
on charles and camilla 's seventh wedding anniversary in 2012 , the queen made the duchess of cornwall a gcvo ( gcvo ) - a personal seal of approval from the monarch
' i do n't think that the queen has ever had any personal animosity to camilla
in the eighties and nineties when charles and diana were at each other 's throats , camilla was seen to be the cause and it threatened to destabilise the monarchy , ' says ms junor
once the public were going to accept camilla , the queen was able to accept her publicly
happily married : charles has cut an increasingly relaxed figure since his marriage close : the duchess has always known how to make charles laugh and he ' adores her ' in return royal duties : with half of britons supporting the idea , it is increasingly likely that camilla will become queen a decade later , half of all britons say she should become queen when charles takes the throne according to a poll by yougov
when the prince was put on the spot and asked if camilla would be his queen in an interview in november 2010 , he replied : ' that 's , that 's , we 'll see , wo n't we ? that could be
' ' i think there 's still a hard core of people out there who want nothing to do with camilla and think she 's the devil incarnate but the vast majority think she 's a good thing , ' adds ms junor
' born camilla on the 17th july 1947 , the duchess of cornwall 's 67 years have undoubtedly been interesting ones
in the late 1960s , camilla met the man who was to become her first husband , cavalry officer parker-bowles , with the couple dating off and on for several years - with mr parker-bowles striking up a relationship with princess anne at one point
camilla , meanwhile , had struck up a relationship with prince charles , who was first introduced to her sometime in 1971
when the couple split following an overseas posting for charles in 1973 , camilla reconciled with parker-bowles and the couple announced their engagement and married the same year
but it was her continuing relationship with prince charles that would come to define her , with the former couple remaining close friends even after both had married other people
royal acceptance soon followed with the queen making camilla part of the golden jubilee celebrations in 2002
a year later , the duchess moved into clarence house and on the 10th february 2005 , charles and camilla 's engagement was announced
the couple married just under two months later in windsor , with camilla taking the title of the duchess of cornwall .
