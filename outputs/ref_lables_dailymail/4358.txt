hadas from eritrea , africa , talks about her experience of being circumcised says she does n't blame her mother for taking her to have the procedure when she was just a baby
hadas ( not her real name to protect her identity ) , who now lives in the uk , had ' the cut ' in eritrea , where circumcision for girls is widely practiced , when she was just a few months old
she said : ' in my culture , it is believed that when the vagina is cut , the desire to have sex is cut as well and that sex is only something a woman does with her husband to have children
' ' most people in eritrea think that if a girl is cut , she will grow up to be a good girl ; that she will not bring shame on her family and she will marry well
' if a girl is not cut , they think she will grow up to be a " slut " - a girl who thinks about sex and will not be satisfied by one man
' hadas ' story reveals how entrenched the culture of fgm is eritrea , which borders sudan and ethiopia , where the barbaric practice - the partial or total removal of external female genitalia for non-medical reasons - is even said to prevent women growing up to be clumsy
hadas was too young to remember her ordeal and only found out the truth by hearing her parents arguing - as her father had not wanted her to be subjected to it
hadas said : ' in my culture there is a belief that if a girl is clumsy , she had not been cut
people from my country , even believe this here in the uk
' now in her early 20s , hadas only recently came to realise that fgm is not the norm for all women and has found support as she deals with its consequences from children 's charity the nspcc
hadas first came into contact with the nspcc in the uk following a horrific ordeal where she was brought to the uk by sex traffickers
she revealed : ' i was separated from my family after problems started in my country and i was trafficked to the uk by men who raped me
' hassan hafez , a barber from egypt , mimics the way he used to perform female genital mutilation thanks to being a victim of fgm , hadas worries about her future and whether she will be able to have children
' the nspcc believe 23,000 girls under 15 could be at risk of fgm in england and wales even though it became a criminal offence in the uk in 1985
in 2003 it also became a criminal offence for uk nationals or permanent uk residents to take their child abroad to have female genital mutilation
the charity is working to stop fgm - which they believe is a form of child abuse - and ask professionals who worry a child is at risk to contact them on the number below
cupcakes designed to look like vaginas were baked for the international day of zero tolerance to fgm in exeter in february , 2014 those who have suffered as a result of fgm can also call the number for help and support
nspcc head of child protection operations john cameron said : ' we know from contacts to our fgm helpline that there is a major problem in some uk communities where children are subjected to this appalling abuse
' we would urge anyone who has a concern or needs advice to contact the nspcc âs fgm helpline on 0800 028 3550 or email fgmhelp@nspcc.org.uk - it does n't matter if you 're uncertain , we 're here to talk things through and you may in turn stop a child from being subjected to this barbaric practice
