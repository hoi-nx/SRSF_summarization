sturgeon today warned miliband that time is running out on her offer to help lock the tories out of power
the snp leader has said she is prepared to work with labour to put mr miliband in no.10 , even if david cameron 's conservatives win more seats
ms sturgeon was today swamped with requests for selfies in the wake of her triumph in last week 's live tv debate , as polls suggest a surge in support for the snp will cost labour a majority on may 7
ms sturgeon has refused to work with the conservatives under any circumstances , but has held out the possibility of putting mr miliband into power
labour leader miliband is forecast to lose dozens of seats to the snp after a sharp drop in support in scotland however , today ms sturgeon made clear he patience is wearing thin , and called on mr miliband to respond to her offer
she claimed that every day that passes risks fuelling the impression that mr miliband would rather see the tory return to government than work with the snp
addressing supporters in livingston , ms sturgeon insisted the snp is not seeking any uk ministerial posts
ms sturgeon said : ' even if the tories are the largest party , i have said we will vote to stop the tory government getting off the ground , ' she said
' i have asked miliband to confirm that labour will do likewise
' i hope to hear him give that commitment before too much more time elapses because as long as he fails to give that commitment he leaves lingering the suspicion that labour would rather see the tories get back into power than work with the snp
' now , i 've ruled out any kind of arrangement with the tories , but i have also said to labour , very directly , if there is an anti-tory majority in the house of commons , then even if the tories are the biggest party , if labour and the snp work together we can stop a tory government getting off the ground
' if we have an anti-tory majority , will he work with the snp rather than allow david cameron back into downing street ?
