when lyth scratched around for 22 in a championship match against nottinghamshire in 2008 , swann branded him a â walking wicket â
â lyth , one of six yorkshire players in the england squad that left heathrow on thursday for three tests in the caribbean , hit back in that match seven years ago with a second - innings of 132
yorkshire 's lyth fields during day three of the champion county match against the mcc now he finds himself competing with jonathan trott to be alastair cook âs opening partner at the first test in antigua on april 13
it has been quite a rise
â the story of lyth âs ascent , from a talented but inconsistent left - hander to the ballast behind yorkshire âs charge to the championship last season is one of grit , nous and no little skill
yorkshire âs sports psychologist scott hartley came up with the idea of harnessing lyth âs love of golf â his handicap is eight â to get him holing one short putt after another
â there âs no skill in sinking a two - foot putt , â said lyth
lyth set about 2014 with renewed focus
â lyth plays a shot while batting for yorkshire against the mcc at the sheik zayed stadium last month at a time when england âs test batsmen have lost the knack of scoring the â daddy hundreds â once espoused by former batting coach graham gooch , lyth âs remorselessness caught the selectors â eye
â one of my things is that i âve never got enough runs , â said lyth
â lyth âs dedication has been evident for years
his mum christine would drive him from game to game in his teenage years , and he spent two seasons trialling as a midfielder with manchester city before deciding to throw in his lot with cricket ( his brother ashley played for leicester and scarborough )
lyth bowls during day three of the champion county match against the mcc as the home summer got under way with six university fixtures across the country , it was easy to forget that the first - class season actually began late last month in the middle east
and , in the now annual fixture in abu dhabi between mcc and the champion county , lyth made 113 and 46 not out as yorkshire won by nine wickets
watching on was alastair cook , who will have a big say in whether he walks out to bat in antigua with lyth or jonathan trott , ready to play again after leaving the ashes tour in november 2013 because of a stress - related condition
lyth is suitably complimentary about a player with 49 test caps to his name and an average pushing 47
