it 's the worst storm to hit the new south wales coast in a decade , but what everyone in the region wants to know is why no warning was given that it was going to be this bad
climate specialist white from weatherwatch australia confirmed that severe weather warnings were issued by the bureau of meteorology on sunday
' the storm was forecast to form between port macquarie and newcastle - that âs as about as accurate as they could have predicted
but it turned out to hit closer to newcastle than port macquarie , ' mr white told daily mail australia
this one formed in the worst possible spot , which was just north of newcastle
it then covered 150km south from newcastle to wollongong where a third of australia âs population live
powerful winds on monday night and tuesday morning also brought down scaffolding ( right ) in edgecliff , in sydney 's eastern suburbs a chart from the bureau of meteorology shows the forecast for wind speed across new south wales on tuesday night the hunter was one of the worst - hit areas in new south wales and this car in the town of blacksmiths got the brunt of the weather ' so it was always going to be very destructive
it âs not like it hit a few small fishing villages like a storm did on the south coast a few weeks ago
' mr white also explained that those trying to forecast the weather had an even more difficult job now as there was not as much resources for them to call on and get the specific information they need
' we do nât send up as many weather balloons any more , because of budget cuts so it âll affect what can be forecast
weather balloons can now only be used in a limited number of places because of budget cuts , so there âs not as many going up every day which means we do nât get the same data as before from the upper atmosphere
normally it âs 12 hours of severe weather and then it eases off
but this severe weather is lasting from 24 to 36 hours
' emergency services admitted on tuesday they were shocked by the severity of the storm and that their teams were overwhelmed by a weather system that changed very rapidly
asked on abc âs 7.30 programme if warning systems had failed , nsw state emergency services deputy commissioner pearce said : ' the weather system did change very rapidly
' this was an east coast low initially which are always historically very severe weather system however they come in and they go very quickly , this did n't

the stormy weather system , formed in the tasman sea , has n't hit new south wales this strong since 2007 and is expected to be one of the longest lasting ever
â they normally move away after 12 hours but this one is going to stick around for 24 - 36 hours , which is unusually long for an east coast low
state emergency services deputy commissioner pearce told the abc on tuesday the police and nsw fire and rescue had been called in to help the ses on the 2400 call - outs they 've received so far , with many more expected in daylight when people can see the damage around their homes
the bureau of meteorology has been issued for sydney closed waters , the hunter coast , sydney coast , illawarra coast , batemans coast and eden coast the ses had responded to about 15 jobs on monday morning , mainly in sydney metro area â if it is to the north of newcastle the max effect occurs all the way down to wollongong , which is in the vicinity of the nation where most people live so it causes the most damage
