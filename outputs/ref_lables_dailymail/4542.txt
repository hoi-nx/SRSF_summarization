a shocking new video appearing to show at least 30 christians being beheaded and shot by isis in libya has been released
the 29 - minute video , titled ' until it came to them - clear evidence ' , shows dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive , thought to be in the south and the west of the country
at least 16 men , described by islamic state as the ' followers of the cross from the enemy ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church ' , are lined up and shot in a desert area while 12 others are filmed being forced to walk down a beach before being beheaded
this follows another video in february of the beheading of a group of 21 coptic christians on the beach in libya , though that terrain was rockier than the one shown in the latest film
it raises fears that isis is consolidating its presence on the ' doorstep of europe ' , as libya is just a few hundred miles from the coast of italy

the victims inland are forced to kneel as militants dressed in combats and green masks stand behind them holding rifles
a masked fighter in black then brandishes a pistol as he vows to kill christians if they do not convert
in an apparent reference to ethiopia 's attacks on neighbouring somalia , whose population is almost entirely muslim , he says : ' muslim blood shed under the hands of your religions is not cheap
' the footage , which was released on websites and social media accounts officially linked to isis , also cuts to christians in syria explaining how they were given the choice of converting to islam or paying a ' special tax '
at the end it switches between the two sets of captives - thought to be mainly migrant workers - with one group shot dead at point - blank range and the others beheaded on the beach
the men - wearing guantanamo - style orange jumpsuits - are held at the neck and forced to kneel by fighters in combats with balaclavas covering their faces the men , thought to be migrant works , are described by islamic state in the video as the ' followers of the cross from the enemy ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church ' the footage also shows around 12 men being shot in a desert area , believed to be in the south of the country , by militants wearing green balaclavas and combats a masked fighter in black ( right ) brandishing a pistol vows to kill christians if they do not convert , saying : ' muslim blood shed under the hands of your religions is not cheap
the video bore the official logo of the is media arm al-furqan and resembled previous footage released by the extremist group the militant in black - who is completely covered apart from his eyes - remains flanked by two people holding guns throughout the clip ethiopia is a predominantly muslim country with the religion being introduced in the country the 4th century , making it one of the oldest muslim states in the world

he added that ethiopia , which does not have an embassy in libya , would help repatriate ethiopians if they wanted to leave
' ethiopia 's options to retaliate remain slim , given its distance from libya
however , ethiopian ambassador to egyptian edrees said his country could partner with cairo to strike the militants
' it comes just two months after the extremist group in libya beheaded 21 captured egyptian christians on a beach ( above ) the latest video mirrored a film released in february showing militants beheading 21 captured egyptian christians on a libya beach ( pictured above ) , which immediately drew egyptian airstrikes on the group 's suspected positions in libya frederic wehrey , a senior associate for the middle east at the carnegie endowment for international peace , said : ' the islamic state in libya is still focused on this consolidation phase of announcing its presence through these very high - profile executions
