in game of thrones , the secret to forging super-light and strong valyrian steel swords was said to have been lost with the doom of valyria
by studying the composition of modern steel , welding techniques and assessing all the characteristics of valyrian steel , he concludes it is n't a steel at all , but instead is a metal matrix composite
ned stark , played in the hbo adaptation of the books by sean bean , had a valyrian sword called ice ( pictured ) the findings and conclusions were made by materials scientist consell in the latest reactions video for washington - based american chemical society
according to martin 's books , valyrian steel is a form of metal forged when the valyrian freehold governed essos , and covered more than half the known world
a lot of the empire 's military strength came from its ability to forge valyrian steel , renowned in the fictional kingdoms as being incredibly sharp , light , strong , super heat - resistant and dark in colour with a very distinct ripple patterns

it was reportedly forged using westerosi magic and the secret to forging it was said to have been lost with the doom of valyria in the latest reactions video for the american chemical society , materials scientist consell ( pictured ) studied which materials could create a similar sword
steel is an alloy made mostly of iron , but also includes around 2 % of carbon according to martin 's books , valyrian steel is a form of metal forged when the valyrian freehold governed essos and covered more than half the known world
a lot of the military strength came from having valyrian steel weapons , renowned in the fictional kingdoms as being incredibly sharp , light , strong , super heat resistant and dark in colour with a very distinct ripple patterns
a dagger used by an assassin in an attempt to kill bran stark was also made from valyrian steel and had been lost in a bet by petyr baelish to tyrion lannister

' the characteristics of valyrian steel can give us a lot of clues as to its composition , ' continued mr consell
' mr consell first looked into whether spring steel could be a contender for a modern , real - life version of valyrian steel
air hardened steel uses a ' cocktail of elements ' but as mr consell added , valyrian âs colour , pattern and weight make this option unlikely he first looks into whether spring steel could be a contender for a modern , real - life version of valyrian steel
as an alternative , mr consell suggests valyrian steel is nât steel at all
instead , the ' best possible match ' might be a metal matrix composite
this is a modern super material with a metallic framework embedded with ceramics , and one of these could provide all of the extreme characteristics needed for valyrian steel he said itanium silicon carbide might be the ' perfect fit ' because it has the strength , weight and colour needed for valyrian steel

' it has the strength , weight and colour needed for valyrian steel and if the matrix was nât perfectly consistent , it might have swirls of grey running through the blade
' there is also the opinion that valyrian is similar to damascus steel
