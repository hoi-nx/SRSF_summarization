last weekend , after a sunny day in the borders , i posted this picture of myself on twitter with the caption â just met nicola sturgeon lookalike out canvassing ! â i admit , it was nât a particularly funny joke , but i had no idea of the outrage my light - hearted comment would provoke from the devoted followers of scotland âs first minister and the leader of the snp
i was called ugly , vile , â someone who deserves to die â , and one wit even â hoped i would catch malaria â
all the pollsters agree that the snp is destined to win the vast majority of the seats ( up to 50 ) scotland in the general election , crushing the tories and trouncing labour
could this surge of nationalism mean that scotland is in danger of becoming another north korea , a land where the â dear leader â is sacrosanct , a figure on a pedestal , to be worshipped and admired â but never criticised ? at the weekend , one commentator announced that â scotland has fallen in love with nicola sturgeon â she is adored â
indeed last night ms nicola sturgeon was as feisty as ever in the leaders â debate
janet street-porter said she had no idea of the outrage her ' light - hearted comment ' would provoke from nicola sturgeon 's ( pictured ) supporters so how has nicola sturgeon become teflon woman , a person so perfect that a mere joke about her appearance means ( according to her fans ) i can no longer be considered a feminist ? according to her followers , i am a traitor to my sex , a woman less attractive than red rum , a sub-human who should be neutered
sadly , some snp supporters combine commendable patriotism with a deep - seated distrust of the england â not just the posh people from down here , but anyone born in the â wrong â country
we went to inordinate lengths to present a scrupulously balanced film â but when it was transmitted , because i was born in england ( and am actually half - welsh ) i was attacked in the scottish press , on twitter and other social media for having the audacity to host a programme about â their â country
some snp members are so consumed with themselves that all they want is people to agree with them , and sod everyone else
dubbed the tartan taliban and the cyber nats , fanatical snp followers use social media to â troll â opponents , and anyone daring to criticise their leader
when robinson announced a few weeks ago that he had a cancerous tumour on his lung , the cyber nats went straight on twitter with comments such as â a bit of chemotherapy would do the biased beeb man good â
in similar vein , after a daily mail writer published a profile of nicola sturgeon in these pages recently , he was attacked relentlessly online , and called a nazi , racist scum , a vile bigot , a misogynist , and told to f * * * off back to england
many of those abusing him had a blue nationalist â 45 â logo on their twitter feed , to represent the percentage who voted for independence last year
so what of the woman these people idolise as some great political saviour unlike any other figure in uk today ? janet street-porter ( right ) asks how nicola sturgeon ( left ) has become ' a person so perfect that a mere joke about her appearance means ( according to her fans ) i can no longer be considered a feminist ? ' consider the facts : ms nicola sturgeon , just like ed miliband , has spent her whole life ( apart from a brief period working as a solicitor ) entirely engrossed in politics
her husband and her former boyfriends and most of her friends all work for the snp
yet it is ed miliband , not nicola sturgeon , who gets derided for being â weird â and having not experienced the real world
nicola sturgeon , however , based her sums on an oil boom that has failed to materialise , which has deprived the scotland economy of billions of pounds of expected revenue
yes , i admire nicola sturgeon âs tenacity , and i applaud any woman who rises to the top in her chosen profession
does that make her any different to ed miliband , with his much - criticised relationships with the trade unions , or david cameron with his cronies in big business ? voters in england can do nothing to stop the nicola sturgeon bandwagon gaining momentum â snp membership has tripled in the past year , and it âs now the third - largest political party in the uk
but worrying questions remain about some of her followers
