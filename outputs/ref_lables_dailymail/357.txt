benik afobe âs first - half finish kept wolves slim dreams of promotion alive and helped push 10 - man wigan to the brink of relegation after a tense clash at the dw stadium
benik afobe popped up unmarked early on to bundle home and the result leaves wigan on the verge of dropping into english football âs third - tier after a dreadful season
to make matters worse , the latics will have to face brentford next weekend without star man james mcclean who received his marching orders in injury - time for a second bookable offence

afobe races past wigan 's gaetan bong as the visitors kept their hopes of promotion alive wigan defender emmerson boyce drops to his knees as the former fa cup winners head towards the drop caldwell , the former wigan captain parachuted into the managerial hotseat following mackay âs sacking earlier this month , again called for the club âs fans to meet and greet his squad at the players â carpark before the match to let them know how much survival meant
a bakary sako free - kick from the edge of the box was brilliantly met by afobe who could not miss from three yards out as wigan âs defence stood and watched
as news filtered around the dw stadium that derby were losing at millwall , and that wolves were just a point outside the top - six as a consequence , jackett âs side looked to press home their advantage against a wigan side that played attractively without any real penetration
after the break , wigan again began fresher as they knew they had 45 minutes to realistically save their season and although james mcclean , pennant and bo-kyung tried to link up and break down wolves , they again lacked any real cutting edge
wigan 's james perch and wigan 's marc-antoine fortune head off dejected after the final whistle wigan supporters begin to come to terms with the fact that relegation is out of their hands however , it was the same at both ends with dicko and bakary sako both having little say in the game and although benik afobe did find the back of the net after 57 minutes , his handball in the build - up was spotted by the referee who disallowed the effort
with half an hour to go , wolves should have been 2 - 0 up but wigan had keeper carson to thank for blocking dicko as he ran through on goal
