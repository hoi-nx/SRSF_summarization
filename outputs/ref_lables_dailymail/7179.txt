ex-new england patriots player hernandez had access to a black glock pistol , had a distrustful nature and often described his friends as ungrateful , a former friend testified at hernandez 's murder trial on wednesday
bradley told bristol county superior court justice garsh he would be able to testify that hernandez had access to the type of pistol he is accused of using to murder semipro football player lloyd , but not about a separate 2013 incident in which bradley contends hernandez shot him in the face
lloyd was found shot dead in june 2013 in an industrial park near hernandez 's home in north attleborough , massachusetts
' the murder weapon in the case has not been recovered , but prosecutors have said it was a black glock pistol
bradley told the judge he was hernandez 's marijuana dealer before they became friends , and described the football star as a ' chain smoker ' who bought the drug in quantities of up to 4 ounces at a time
' according to a civil lawsuit filed by bradley last year , the friendship came to an end during a late night dispute in february 2013 , when he claims hernandez shot him in the face , causing him to lose his right eye
bradley will be allowed to tell jurors he saw someone hand hernandez a black glock ( similar to the one above ) in a miami hotel prosecutors have contended the february incident is relevant to the lloyd murder since it shows that hernandez had no trouble shooting his friends
meanwhile , hernandez âs lawyer james sultan has implied he only plans on calling one witness when they begin their case on monday .
