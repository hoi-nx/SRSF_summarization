the avengers have battled to save earth from an alien invasion , the evil loki and now , in the latest movie , face off against the killing machine ultron
they do this , of course , with the help of numerous superpowers - including iron man âs suit , super-healing abilities and captain america âs indestructible shield
it looks at the composition of iron man 's suit - said to be a gold - titanium alloy in one of the movies - and captain america 's shield
the video also explains the science behind super-healing abilities in a video for reactions , the american chemical society took a look at the science of marvel 's avengers
it begins looking at iron man , better known as iron man when he dons his iron suit of armour
his original suit , made only of iron , would have weighed around 70kg ( 150lbs ) according to the american chemical society - not very comfortable or easy to move around in
â that suit would probably weigh around 160kg ( 350lbs ) , which might work for the hulk but not for iron man , â said the narrator
â there may also be some graphite reinforced with carbon fibre , which can take a lot of heat - useful if iron man does nât want to singe his feet using those rocket boots
â iron man , better known as iron man when he dons his iron suit of armour and played by robert downey jnr ( pictured ) , made his original suit out of iron
he later upgrades it to a gold - titanium alloy , but according to the american chemical society that would be heavy and uncomfortable - perhaps better for the hulk than iron man himself none of this would work , though , without iron man âs own portable nuclear power station - the arc reactor
source : how it works issue 72 , ' real - life superpowers ' iron man 's suit is powered by his famous arc reactor , but in iron man 2 , we learn that its palladium fuel source is slowly killing him
so instead , iron man creates a new element - and this might not be as far - fetched as it seems as it follows somewhat similar principles to those taking place at cern iron man is nât the only one with super-human abilities , though
both captain america and black widow have super strength , quick reflexes - and , most interestingly - the ability to heal quickly
both captain america ( left ) and black widow ( right ) have super strength and quick reflexes , while and - most interestingly - the ability to heal quickly
of course , you have to suspend disbelief just a bit to assume this is possible - but perhaps the avengers have more of a root in science than you thought .
