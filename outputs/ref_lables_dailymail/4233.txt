nasa has spotted an exoplanet 13,000 light - years away , making it one of the most distant planets ever found
the planet is half as massive as jupiter and could help astronomers gain a better understanding of the distribution of planets in the milky way
astronomers have spotted one of the most distant planets ever found
most of the planets we know about are around 10 - 100 times closer the planet was discovered using a technique known as microlensing
astronomers are using these blips to find and characterise planets tens of thousands of light - years away in the central bulge of our galaxy , where star crossings are more common
most of the planets we know about are around 10 - 100 times closer than ogle-2014-blg-0124 , claims yee of the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics
' we do n't know if planets are more common in our galaxy 's central bulge or the disk of the galaxy , which is why these observations are so important , ' she added
the discovery demonstrates that spitzer - from its unique perch in space - can be used to help solve the puzzle of how planets are spread out in our galaxy
the planet was discovered using a technique known as microlensing
astronomers are using these blips to find and characterise planets tens of thousands of light - years away in the central bulge of our galaxy , where star crossings are more common
the microlensing technique as a whole has yielded about 30 planet discoveries so far , with the farthest residing about 25,000 light - years away
' microlensing experiments are already detecting planets from the solar neighborhood to almost the center of the milky way , ' said co-author andrew gould of the ohio state university , columbus
the planet was dicovered via microlensing which happens when one star passes in front of another , and its gravity acts as a lens to magnify the more distant star 's light microlensing complements other planet - hunting tools , such as the kepler mission , which has found more than 1,000 planets closer to home
of the 30 planets discovered with microlensing so far , roughly half can not be pinned down to a precise location
that 's farther from earth than earth is from our sun. when spitzer watches a microlensing event simultaneously with a telescope on earth , it sees the star brighten at a different time , due to the large distance between the two telescopes and their unique vantage points
' now we can use these single lenses to do statistics on planets as a whole and learn about their distribution in the galaxy
