the apple is officially going on sale today - but none of its stores will have them in stock apple launches its first smartwatch today - but anyone turning up to buy one in the high street will be disappointed
for although the apple is officially going on sale , none of its stores will have them in stock
instead , consumers willing to shell out between Â£ 299 to Â£ 13,500 - for the gold edition - have to pre-order the watches online and wait for their arrival until june
usually , apple launches generate long queues outside stores
but city analysts believe the company feared the queues might be embarrassingly small and so opted to launch the watch with more of a whisper than a bang
in fact , despite the high price and some skepticism that consumers are keen to adopt a new generation of wearable technology , pre-orders have far exceeded expectations
analysts believe apple is sitting on some two million pre-orders and that sales could top 20 million this year
the launch of the watch into stores is being handled by apple retail chief , angela ahrendts , who is very familiar with the world of designer labels
she told apple staff via video message earlier this week that the decision to make the watch only available through online orders is because demand has exceeded supply
' the official apple uk website states anyone ordering the new watch can expect a delivery date in june , however some might get them before
' the biggest problem apple looks to be facing , is not if people will buy one , it 's whether they are going to be happy to wait until they can get one , ' he said
will findlater , editor - in - chief of gadget magazine stuff , said : ' in many ways the apple is the ultimate gadget
Â£ 300 or more is a lot to pay for a first - generation device , especially as apple will learn a lot about making it better once it 's in the market
' that means the second or third - generation apple is probably the wiser buy
