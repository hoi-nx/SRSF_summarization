banned : aden gould , 21 , was told he could not return to sainsbury 's after he opened some speakers there mr aden gould , who has learning difficulties and is unemployed , went into the sainsbury 's branch in stoke-on-trent and opened two boxes containing Â£ 25 speakers
staff took him into the manager 's office and forced him to empty his bag , but he was cleared of shoplifting
mr aden gould later received a pair of letters saying that he was banned from all 1,200 sainsbury 's stores across the country , and had to pay Â£ 150 in compensation
' i was walking out of the shop when the security guard grabbed me and took me into the manager 's office
' reversal : sainsbury 's has now revoked the ban which was imposed at its stoke-on-trent store , pictured his mother petra added : ' aden gould was shaking uncontrollably when he got home and when he got the letter saying he was banned i went straight down there
' in its letter to aden , sainsbury 's stated : ' the invitation to enter and shop at all sainsbury 's stores is permanently withdrawn due to the incident on april 15
a spokesman said that the Â£ 150 fee , which has now been waived , was a standard charge to make up for the fact that the speakers which mr aden gould opened can no longer be sold
