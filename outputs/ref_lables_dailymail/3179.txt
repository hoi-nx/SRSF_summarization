' the art detective is no stranger to high profile cases â having been central to the recovery of a Â£ 1billion nazi - looted hoard found in a squalid munich flat in 2012

he is representing the heirs of art dealer rosenberg in their bid to recover matisse 's 1921 femme assise ( left ) which was found in a squalid munich apartment along with this marc chagall painting ( right ) ' the painting was found covered by a layer of grime
there was a milky white film on it as it had been sitting flat , unstretched amongst rotting food , ' said mr christopher marinello
the museum announced that it would accept the immense trove of art amassed by a nazi - era art dealer , but would ensure any looted art was returned to the rightful owners
in the past two decades , mr christopher marinello has tracked down Â£ 250million worth of stolen art including priceless works by picasso , renoir and matisse
the founder of art examines evidence relating to matisse 's le jardin with head curator lars bystrom he tracked down nine paintings including les paysans by marc chagall ( pictured ) stolen from an la mansion one of his most recent cases saw him recover el greco 's 1944 ' portrait of a gentleman ' , which was seized from priester 's collection by the gestapo in vienna
last month mr christopher marinello also tracked down two sculptures which were stolen with weeks of each other from hirschl and adler gallery in new york 32 years ago
another of his most high - profile successes was the recovery of matisse 's le jardin after it was stolen from the museum of modern art in stockholm by a burglar armed with a sledgehammer
more than 1,400 artworks were found in a squalid munich flat owned by cornelius gurlitt , the son of nazi art dealer hildebrand criminals are both nemeses and friends to the detective and if you spot him sitting in a starbucks , the chances are he 's about to sit down with an art thief
' i 've met with a criminal who 's been holding onto some very valuable artwork for over 30 years several times at a cafe in paris , ' said mr christopher marinello
' before he became the public face of the company , he used to work undercover and once set up a sting operation to catch a man trying to illegally obtain a van gogh picture worth Â£ 2million
' finding the missing art in the first place is a major undertaking as mr christopher marinello and his team often locate stolen works before law enforcement
to do this , they have developed art claim , the world 's most technologically advanced database for stolen , looted and missing works of art , antiquity and cultural property
anyone who has a theft whether it 's a museum or holocaust victim should report the theft , then we search art fairs , online sellers , and auction catalogues
the publicity alone can be hugely damaging to a high net - worth collector
' mr christopher marinello believes art theft is on the rise and said it is now the third highest - grossing criminal trade , behind guns and drugs
' but hollywood - style art heists with james bond - style equipment and elaborate getaways are not the only way that priceless works disappear
' art is stolen in every way imaginable , but it is not always a well thought - out endeavor
once an artwork is on our database - as this one is - we will be searching art markets all over the world for it
