since herman melville penned his novel moby dick more than 150 years ago , scientists have been fascinated by the remarkable attributes of the sperm whale and its kin - the smaller pygmy and dwarf whales
now , fossils from an extinct pygmy sperm whale that died seven million years ago , have shed new light on the evolution of modern day whales
the remains , which were discovered in panama , indicate that the organ involved in sound generation and echolocation got smaller throughout the whale âs evolution
fossils from an extinct pygmy sperm whale that died seven million years ago have shed new light on the evolution of modern day whales
while many whales , dolphins and porpoises have a long fossil record , enabling scientists to understand their evolution , there is limited evidence of sperm whales and smaller pygmy and dwarf whales , which are capable of navigating the ocean deep underwater
now an international team of scientists , led by the natural history museum of los angeles county has discovered a new species of extinct pygmy sperm whale , called nanokogia , which clarifies key aspects of the evolution of these animals
this is the evolutionary tree of sperm whales showing links between extinct and living species , and when the spermaceti organ changed shape the remains , which were discovered in panama , indicate that the bone involved in sound generation and echolocation got smaller throughout the evolution of the sperm whale
in contrast modern sperm whales ( a stock image is shown ) are much larger than their extinct relatives the sperm whale is the largest of the toothed whales and the largest toothed predator
it 's only one of three living species in the sperm whale family , along with the pygmy sperm whale and dwarf sperm whale
the sperm whale 's clicking vocalisation - a form of echolocation and communication - can be as loud as 230 decibels underwater , making it the loudest sound produced by any animal
