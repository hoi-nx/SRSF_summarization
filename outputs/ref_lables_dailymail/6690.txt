for most people a hangover will have them reaching for the painkillers and greasy breakfast , but those living in ancient egypt had a rather different approach
historians have discovered a 1,900 - year - old hangover cure written on an ancient egypt papyrus
written in greek , one of the medical recipes offers advice for how to tackle a ' drunken headache ' - with the leaves of a shrub called alexandrian chamaedaphne , or sometimes alexandrian laurel
the text recommends stringing the leaves of the evergreen plant , also called ruscus racemosus , together and possibly wearing it around the neck
this papyrus was found in oxyrhynchus , egypt , and contains a medical ' recipe ' for treating a hangover while the text recommends this as a way of relieving headaches brought on by alcohol , it is not known if it had any effect
the treatment was discovered as part of an ongoing effort to translate the oxyrhynchus papyrus - more than 500,000 documents found in an ancient rubbish tip at the egypt town of oxyrhynchus , about 100 miles south of cairo
oxyrhynchus lies south west of cairo and is considered to be one of the most important archaeological sites in egypt
it has yielded a huge collection of papyrus texts from the ptolemaic and roman periods of egypt history and among them are fragments of plays and the gospel of thomas
the city was built around a system of canals and inhabitants dumped their rubbish at nearby sand hills , including lots of written material as oxyrhynchus was governed bureaucratically by the greeks and the romans
the hangover treatment was one of 24 new medical texts that are the latest to be translated - the 101st volume of translations to be published
among the documents , researchers at the university of oxford and university college london have found 11 copies of known medical texts by galen and hippocrates alongside the new medical texts
they also found four documents that appeared to be doctors notes

these images of some of the medical papyrus found at oxyrhynchus contain descriptions for treating eye conditions , fever and haemorrhoids with surgery it is thought the hangover cure may have been necessary as many ancient societies drank wine rather than water , which was unsanitised
the newly translated medical texts also include recipes for helping to halt the spread of ulcers , others for treating hemorrhoids , toothache , gangrene and a dozen for treating eye conditions
the documents were found at the ancient town of oxyrhynchus , in egypt around 100miles ( 160km ) form cairo ' one of the fragments contains a detailed description of the surgical procedure for removing haemorrhoids , though the author emphasises that in operating on the patient one of the haemorrhoids must be left untouched
' this papyrus is an example of texts discoverd at oxyrhynchus and features euclid 's elements of geometry ancient egypt would did not have modern hangover cures and used strings of leaves instead , according to new translations of 1,900 year old texts found at oxyrhynchus in egypt
it contains more than 800 treatments for eye problems to digestive disorders texts found on the site of deir el-medina identify a workman on the crew designated as the ' swnw ' , or physician
