airline rivals ryanair and aer lingus have locked horns once again on twitter
ryanair , run by michael o'leary , shared a photo of two of its staff by an advertising banner in terminal 2 , along with the words : ' low fares have come to @ dublinairport at last
' ryanair took to twitter for a cheeky promotional photo in terminal 2 in dublin - where aer lingus fly out from in response to ryanair 's post , aer lingus had a dig at where ryanair fly their passengers out too ryanair flies out of terminal 1 at dublin , whereas aer lingus flies from terminal 2 , so it was clear the tweet was a joke at its rival 's expense
ireland 's national airline tweeted : ' fly from dublinairport at @ dublinairport to central locations across europe
' the words appear to be a reaction to terminal 1 - based ryanair often using smaller and former military bases throughout europe , often away from the central point of the destination city
ryanair have been accused by rivals aer lingus of getting their customers ' nearly ' to central locations this is n't the first time the two have taken to twitter to engage in some light - hearted banter
aer lingus took to twitter to point out that ryanair had used an aer lingus plane on some of its promotional material aer lingus â attempt to publicly embarrass ryanair did nât sit well with its low - cost rival
ryanair , in typical fashion , responded to aer lingus ' post as only they would the uk court of appeal is set to rule ryanair âs 29.82 per cent stake in aer lingus
