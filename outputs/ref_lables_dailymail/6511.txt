marouane fellaini has emerged as an force to be reckoned with in united 's midfield of late jamie carragher believes jose mourinho will bring kurt zouma into his midfield to neutralise marouane fellaini jamie carragher and neville agreed that jose mourinho would have a special plan to stop united 's run of form jamie carragher and neville were speaking as part of monday night football ahead of liverpool vs newcastle united but with united on such good form , having won their last six league games , jose mourinho will need to find a way to put a stop to louis van gaal 's team and jamie carragher and neville see marouane fellaini as the main target
jamie carragher sees the special one retreating into his shell with a midfield incorporating kurt zouma , matic and ramires as they look to deny marouane fellaini and the rest of united 's midfield that they have thrived in
his record is fantastic , ' jamie carragher said marouane fellaini could be targeted by jose mourinho in midfield as he looks to find a way of stopping united on saturday cahill , terry and kurt zouma ( l-r ) could all be involved from the start in the game at stamford bridge kurt zouma has emerged as an emergency option for chelsea when they need strength in the midfield area ' i think there 's a case for bringing kurt zouma into midfield , maybe get him on marouane fellaini , because matic is left - footed and he wo n't want to put him on the right side of central midfield
( jose mourinho will ) play kurt zouma as more like a third centre back , but slightly ahead of ( neville ) cahill and ( terry ) terry just to look after marouane fellaini
' jose mourinho will not want to give united space and that means that he will set up to stop them , says jamie carragher ramires was also picked out as a potential player to be used in midfield , with willian missing out neville agreed , and went as far as to say that jose mourinho would focus on ' destruction ' before hoping to win by taking advantage of set - pieces or the skill of hazard in his analysis on monday night football
the former united captain also made it clear that while he expects jose mourinho to have a plan for the game , he does not see his charges winning their next three games against united , arsenal and leicester city to take the premier league title at the earliest possible opportunity
neville commented on how jose mourinho would be focused on ' destruction ' , having kurt zouma ' sacrificing himself ' ' i think kurt zouma coming in is a good point , it will be alongside matic in midfield
