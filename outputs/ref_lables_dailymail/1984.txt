dutch football made a killing in the stock market this week
yet its rise was not because psv won their first eredivisie title since 2008 , ending ajax 's four - year reign
it was down to memphis depay , who scored his 20th goal of the season to confirm their 22nd championship in holland
yet jim lawlor , their chief scout , had been doing his homework long before depay reached the total which louis van gaal holds in such high regard
psv 's memphis depay celebrates with the trophy after securing the eredivisie championship depay ( left ) and psv team - mate georginio wijnaldum ( right ) celebrate with the eredivisie trophy psv manager phillip cocu ( left ) and top goalscorer depay ( right ) clinched the title with three games to spare 20 â memphis depay ( winger ) 19 â luuk de jong ( striker ) 16 â michiel kramer ( striker ) 14 â michael de leeuw ( striker ) 14 â mark uth ( striker ) the manager announced in february he lacked a striker who could score 20 goals
if a 21 - year - old can do it from the wing in 27 appearances , albeit in holland rather than england , is that not worth a Â£ 25million investment ? manchester united think so , and they are not alone
from ' official talks ' with liverpool , to ' discussions ' with paris saint-germain , to a not - so - secret meeting in manchester
he is the eredivisie 's top goalscorer , without even being psv 's main forward
yet not many people had heard of depay , particularly before the world cup , so why the sudden case of rubbing hands together ? how depay could look for manchester united should he make his Â£ 25m move to old trafford this summer depay pictured in action during psv 's title - winning victory against heerenveen last weekend at home depay is the eredivisie 's top goalscorer with 20 , without even being psv 's main forward in their attack depay was understood to have held a meeting in manchester as he nears his Â£ 25m move with louis van gaal first , his background
as a four - year - old , his parents separated
raised by his mother in the southern dutch town of moordrecht , he grew up in ' a small village where there is not much to do ' , so says gigi , a childhood friend of depay 's
yet the man handed his holland debut just 18 months ago by van gaal remains relatively unknown
as a player , depay can be used as a makeshift forward , and has been likened to cristiano ronaldo by psv manager phillip cocu and ajax great ronald de boer
a left winger who cuts inside with a powerful right foot â not unlike his counterpart and compatriot arjen robben
five of his 20 goals were from dead - ball situations â his latest against heerenveen seven days ago , when psv were crowned champions with three games to spare
nobody in eredivisie completed more dribbles ( 101 ) last season , and he created the second-most chances ( 87 ) , too
depay has ' dream chaser ' tattooed across his chest , and ' successful ' inked on the inside of his lower lip depay celebrates with his holland team - mate arjen robben during the world cup in brazilian memphis , a right - footed left - winger , celebrates with his counterpart arjen robben , a left - footed right - winger it is exactly what manchester united need , given they have created fewer chances ( 332 ) than queens park rangers ( 342 ) and tottenham hotspur ( 352 ) this season
called up , the then - 20 - year - old 's goal against australia made him the youngest dutch scorer in the history of the world cup , taking over from boudewijn zenden at france ' 98
that was depay 's first goal in brazilian , before his second against chile â the same total england 's squad managed as a collective in group d. when holland used a 4 - 3 - 3 formation , he got the nod to join arjen robben and robin van persie in a three - pronged attack
compare depay to manchester united 's other forwards â wayne rooney , van persie , radamel falcao and james wilson â and he blitzes the averages of the rest
how depay could look for manchester united ( left ) and the winger playing last week for psv ( right ) old trafford forwards wayne rooney ( from left to right ) , robin van persie , radamel falcao and james wilson and yet , he is not the complete package
depay would n't be the first to leave psv for the premier league , or manchester united for that matter ruud van nistelrooy ( left ) joined manchester united from psv , while mateja kezman ( right ) joined chelsea three years after one psv great arrived , another followed
