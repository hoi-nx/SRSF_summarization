a small ' hot spot ' in the u.s. southwest is responsible for producing the largest concentration of the greenhouse gas methane seen over the united states - and is the subject of a major new investigation to find out why
the hot spot , near the four corners intersection of arizona , colorado , new mexico and utah , covers only about 2,500 square miles ( 6,500 square kilometers ) , or half the size of connecticut
the hot spot , near the four corners intersection of arizona , colorado , new mexico and utah , covers only about 2,500 square miles
to calculate the emissions rate that would be required to produce the observed concentration of methane in the air , the authors performed high - resolution regional simulations using a chemical transport model , which simulates how weather moves and changes airborne chemical compounds
researchers from several institutions are now in the four corners region of the u.s. southwest with a suite of airborne and ground - based instruments , aiming to uncover reasons for a mysterious methane ' hot spot ' detected from space
last fall , researchers including frankenberg reported that a small region around the four corners intersection of arizona , colorado , new mexico and utah had the highest concentration of methane over background levels of any part of the united states
an instrument on a european space agency satellite measuring greenhouse gases showed a persistent atmospheric hot spot in the area between 2003 and 2009
the satellite observations were not detailed enough to reveal the actual sources of the methane in the four corners
researchers from cires , noaa 's earth systems research laboratory and michigan are conducting a field campaign called topdown ( twin otter and natural gas emissions ) 2015 , bringing airborne and ground - based instruments to investigate possible sources of the methane hot spot
shiprock , new mexico , is in the four corners region where an atmospheric methane " hot spot " can be seen from space
researchers are currently in the area , trying to uncover the reasons for the hot spot
hotspot of total column methane anomalies centered over the four corners region from 2003 to 2009 , when a satellite - based methane - measuring instrument was operational
the april study will focus on verifying the hotspot and determining the methane sources producing the exceptionally elevated methane concentrations
the research team also includes scientists from the institute of arctic and alpine research at the university of colorado , boulder ; the united states bureau of land management ; and the state of new mexico
is this the cause ? the four corners coal - fired power plant , near farmington , is one of the targets nasa wants to investigate as a possible cause of the methane in each of the seven years studied from 2003 - 2009 , the area released about 0.59 million metric tons of methane into the atmosphere
the atmospheric hot spot persisted throughout the study period
the study 's lead author , kort of the university of michigan , ann arbor , noted the study period predates the widespread use of hydraulic fracturing , known as fracking , near the hot spot
this indicates the methane emissions should not be attributed to fracking but instead to leaks in natural gas production and processing equipment in new mexico 's san juan basin , which is the most active coalbed methane production area in the country
the borders of utah , colorado , new mexico , and arizona intersect at four corners , west of the confluence of the mancos and san juan rivers
after the united states energy crisis of the 1970s , techniques were invented to extract the methane from the coal and use it for fuel
by 2012 , coalbed methane supplied about 8 percent of all natural gas in the united states
