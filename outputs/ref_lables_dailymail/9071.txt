a man stuck by a serious bowel infection has been cured after undergoing a faecal transplant , with stools donated by his daughter
barnes shed three stone as he battled the life - threatening condition clostridium difficile , suffering bouts of diarrhoea
it was then that specialists suggested a faecal transplant
barnes , 57 , from stockton , has been cured of the severe bowel infection clostridium difficile after undergoing a faecal transplant
his daughter debbie , left , acted as donor ' i 'd never heard of it before , ' said mr barnes
and when gastroenterologist wells raised the issue of finding a suitable donor , mr barnes ' daughter debbie stepped in
mr barnes , from stockton , was then admitted to the university hospital of north tees
the solution was then transplanted into mr barnes ' gut via an endoscope - a long , thin , flexible tube that has a light source and a video camera at one end
' dr wells , said : ' faecal transplantation does n't sound very appealing but it 's a very effective remedy in patients like barnes
' dr wells said there had been a significant reduction in the number of c - diff cases in the trust over the past few years but it was reassuring to know that faecal transplant was now an option to treat the condition
in another study , the infection came back in around one in 50 patients between 29 days and four years after faecal transplant
