featuring two carefully painted female models , it is a clever piece of sculpture designed to create an amazing illusion
it is the work of italian artist johannes stoetter
johannes stoetter daubed water - based body paint on the naked models to create the multicoloured effect , then intertwined them to form the shape of a chameleon
to complete the deception , the models rested on a bench painted to match their skin and held the green branch in the air beneath them
johannes stoetter can take weeks to plan one of his pieces and hours to paint it
camouflage job : a few finishing touches are applied to the two naked models to complete the transformation ' there are different difficulties on different levels as in every work , but i think that my passion and love to my work is so big , that i figure out a way to deal with difficulties
unlike the real thing , johannes stoetter 's models ca n't change their colour â unless he gets his paintbrush out .
