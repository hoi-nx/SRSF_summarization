an alabama inmate who spent nearly 30 years on death row will go free on friday after prosecutors told a court there is not enough evidence to link him to the 1985 murders he was convicted of committing
the district attorney 's office told the judge wednesday that their forensic experts could n't determine if six crime scene bullets â which were the crux of the evidence against hinton at an expected retrial â came from a gun investigators took from his home
hinton was convicted of two 1985 murders that occurred during robberies of fast - food restaurants near birmingham
could n't match the bullets : hinton , pictured this week , spent nearly 30 years on alabama 's death row but will be freed friday morning after prosecutors told a judge they wo n't re-try him for two slayings all smiles : hinton hugs his family members after learning he will walk free after spending 30 years behind bars the u.s. supreme court last year sent hinton 's case back for a potential new trial , which prompted a re-examination of the evidence
we 've believed that this should have happened , ' said stevenson , hinton 's attorney and director of the alabama - based equal justice initiative
at his initial trial , state experts testified that the four bullets fired during the robberies , and another two from a similar robbery - shooting at a quincy 's restaurant in bessemer , had all been fired from a revolver found at hinton 's home
going free : former death row inmate hinton , pictured in an undated older mugshot and an undated more recent mugshot , will go free on friday after being imprisoned for 30 years the supreme court last year ruled that hinton had ' constitutionally deficient ' representation at his initial trial
hinton 's defense lawyer wrongly thought he had only $ 1,000 to hire a ballistics expert to try to rebut the prosecution evidence , according the court opinion
' he was a poor person who was convicted because he did n't have the money to prove his innocence at trial
new beginning : hinton , pictured this week , had improper representation 30 years ago because he was poor , said his attorney the experts were unable to tie hinton 's gun to the bullets used at the crime scene
' bowers said that the experts who examined the gun did not find enough evidence to prove hinton 's involvement
' due to insufficient corresponding individual microscopic characteristics , all three experts found that they could not conclusively determine that any of the six bullets were or were not fired through the same firearm or that they were fired through the firearm recovered from ( hinton 's home ) , ' the motion continues
' the only potential evidence that has ever been available to the state to prove that the defendant committed the murders of john davidson and thomas wayne vason depends upon an absolute , conclusive determination that the bullets recovered from their bodies were in fact fired through the barrel of the firearm taken from the ( hinton 's ) home , ' the motionsays
