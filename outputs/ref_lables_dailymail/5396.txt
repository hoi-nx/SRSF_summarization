it was due to be a routine mission to examine the depths of the gulf of mexico
however , researchers were stunned when their underwater robosub had an unexpected encounter almost 2,000 feet under the ocean
rather than the deep sea squid and corals they expected to see , a giant sperm whale swam to inspect their sub - causing gasps and shouts of ' holy cow ' from the sub 's operators
adult males reach 16 - 20 meters ( 50 - 65 feet ) in length , although most are less than 18 meters ( 60 ft )
females are much smaller than males , reaching only 11 meters ( 36 feet ) on average
the sperm whale 's life is based on sound
sperm whales are listed as an endangered species under the united states endangered species act
' at 598 meters ( 1,962 ft ) below the gulf of mexico off the coast of louisiana , rov hercules encountered a magnificent sperm whale , ' ' the whale circled several times and gave our cameras the chance to capture some incredible footage of this beautiful creature
' encounters between sperm whales and rov 's are quite rare
' according to biologists we 've consulted , the animal on the video is likely a juvenile , especially if it 's a male , ' they say
' general consensus among the experts who have examined the video is that it is a male , though the video of the underside of the whale is grainy so it is difficult to know with 100 % certainty
' it was difficult to tell the actual size of the whale , the team say , but the rov is 6 feet wide in the front
' the whale can be seen inspecting the robosub in the video the researchers were piloting the hercules sub when the encounter occured
