you get the impression around englishman cricket at the moment that people have a bit of a downer on broad
i have heard the comment â how much longer before broad comes under pressure for his place ? â from a few people in recent times
there should always be scrutiny on england players â places , i have no problem with that , but we have to be careful we do not get confused between broad the bowler and broad the batsman
broad ( right ) was dismissed for a duck in england 's first innings against west indies in antigua broad will always give you something different even though he can overdo it at times , and has always had the ability to get something out of a flat pitch
i still like the fact that he can turn into the enforcer , as he did before lunch on day three , and that he âs a clever bowler , as he showed on the second day when he rolled his fingers down the side of the ball and dismissed marlon samuels with a leg - cutter
broad and james anderson are an outstanding combination , taking 526 wickets between them in the 70 tests they have played together â a record that has seen them stand comparison with the partnership of sir ian botham and bob willis
the 28 - year - old has seen his place in the side questioned , but he still produces with the ball broad celebrates the wicket of denesh ramdin on day three of the first test against west indies in antigua and they complement each other as we saw again on wednesday when it was flat and there was nât much happening for james anderson
so this downer that i am sensing among the englishman cricket public clearly comes from the complete demise of broad the batsman
broad admitted he had nightmares about being struck in the face by india 's varun aaron last summer broad can expect to face a barrage of short deliveries from the likes of mitchell johnson in the ashes broad scoring a century against pakistan in 2010 you can imagine what the aussies felt when they heard an englishman saying he was having nightmares about the short ball
the result is that broad has become a bit gun - shy , he stays leg - side of the ball and tries to play a shot every delivery
broad will have to solve the problem himself and look at team - mates who have overcome adversity in their career like james anderson and ian bell
we described broad as an â all - rounder â in a graphic on sky the other day and immediately got some tweets querying that
broad âs batting woes must not affect his bowling as england need him at his best
