howe 's two adult stepchildren are said to be considering suing the former olympic athlete turned reality television star following her death
mrs howe was driving a white lexus , which jenner 's cadillac escalade rear - ended on a segment of the pacific coast highway in malibu , california , on february 7
according to tmz , the two step - children are said to have ' lawyered up ' , because they are the only people who could launch a wrongful death suit
mrs howe 's husband robert died in 2003 , and it is understood she has no other close living blood relatives
no charges ? : sources close to the investigation believe mr bruce wo n't be prosecuted for manslaughter court case : however , mrs howe 's stepchildren could still sue for wrongful death proof : sources told tmz that one of the step - children had been asked to find pictures of the pair together police sources say he is unlikely to be prosecuted by the sheriff because he was n't drinking , speeding or texting at the time of the fatal crash
however , that still leaves the possibility of a wrongful death suit
