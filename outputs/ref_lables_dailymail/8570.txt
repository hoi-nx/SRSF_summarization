a century ago german forces were gathering at army headquarters in tielt , some 30 miles ( 50km ) behind the front line , for a momentous discussion
on tuesday the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons will hold a commemorative meeting close to the fields , pictured in december 2014 three ww1 german soldiers stand and sit at their planning desks at an office in tielt , belgium
they were bent on breaking the stalemate of trench warfare and all options were open some soldiers , pictured in their office in tielt , argued deploying more troops would achieve a bigger breakthrough than using gas fritz haber , a chemical expert and future winner of the nobel prize in chemistry , preached for more gas for more shock and awe
chief of general staff erich von falkenhayn decided they would use the gas the next day or not at all
across the line lamour 's french forces said there was nothing to report
had they been able to peer a bit further across no - man 's land they would have seen how german troops had dug in , under cover of night , more than 5,000 gas cylinders with tubes pointing their way
the next morning , german trenches were filled with soldiers ready to pounce once the gas had cleared

once the gas cleared , the soldiers jumped out and made more progress than they had in months
' even the german troops and certainly the german generals were completely astonished
' but after april 22 , the surprise factor evaporated and the stalemate endured
peshmerga forces discovered ' 20 gas canisters ' loaded on the back of a truck involved in a suicide bomb attack in iraq on january 23 , officials said
memorial stones commemorate those who lost their lives as a result of the first gas attacks

' it seems pretty certain we shall retaliate , ' he wrote to his parents one week after the initial german attack
' the first use by allied forces came in september , when the british unleashed poison gas on the german at the battle of loos
rival armies ultimately launched 146 gas attacks in belgium , which covered only a small patch of the western front
the german used about 150 tons of gas in their first attack and around 68,000 tons in total
the last gas attack came just three days before the armistice of november 11 , 1918
historians estimate that more than 1million soldiers were exposed to gas â and 90,000 killed
