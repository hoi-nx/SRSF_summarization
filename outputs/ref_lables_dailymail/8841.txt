the dog named stains had its coat trimmed to resemble a lion when its owners sent it to the groomers
according to the dog âs owner , stains is a sheep - herding breed and his thick coat , which is best suited for colder climates , had become uncomfortable in the recent sunshine
the dog 's owner looks down and laughs while filming his pet stains , but initially it is hard to see why it was at this point that its owner decided that what the dog really needed was a new look and opted to have half its coat shaved
capturing his artistic vision on camera , stains â owner laughs hysterically while videoing his pet sitting alongside two other dogs at home
