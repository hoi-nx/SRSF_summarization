cordula schacht - whose own father hjalmar schacht was hitler 's minister of economics - is representing goebbels ' estate in the case against random house and its imprint sidler
the dispute comes after peter longerich , a leading authority on the holocaust and germany , drew on the diaries for a biography called goebbels , which was published in germany in 2010
rainer dresen , general counsel of random house germany , believes this case carries an important principal and that paying such money would be immoral
' mr rainer dresen was astonished when hjalmar schacht first demanded money after contacting the publisher as a representative of goebbels ' heirs
mr rainer dresen has suggested to hjalmar schacht in court that royalties could be paid if she were to donate them subsequently to a holocaust charity

responsibility for the literary part of goebbels ' estate was transferred to hjalmar schacht by franã§ois genoud , a swiss businessman with germany sympathies and a friend of hjalmar schacht 's father
he poisoned their six children before he and his wife took their own lives mr hjalmar schacht was minister of economics in hitler 's national socialist government from 1934 to 1937 and was president of germany 's leading financial institution , the reichsbank
mr rainer dresen said : ' [ he ] helped hitler finance his preparation of war
mr rainer dresen believes that other publishers have paid for the use of goebbels 's diaries in the past
' mr peter longerich spoke of the censorship implications of this case : ' if you accept that hjalmar schacht controls the rights to goebbels ' diaries , then â theoretically - you give this person the right to control research
' part of random house 's legal argument centres on the copyright ownership because the diaries were going to be published posthumously by hitler 's own publisher
