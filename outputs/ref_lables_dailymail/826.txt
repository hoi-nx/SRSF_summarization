an experiment on the iss will investigate whether plants are able to use a sixth sense while in space - a sense of gravity
in the weightless environment of the space station , researchers will monitor how plants grow in a particular direction without a noticeable gravitational pull
the results could help farmers on earth get a higher crop yield - and may also help future astronauts grow plants on missions beyond earth orbit to the moon and mars
an experiment on the iss will investigate whether plants are able to use a sixth sense while in space - a sense of gravity
funded by esa , the greenhouses will contain combined life - support systems which use recycled urine to manufacture fertiliser , helping to grow vegetables for a lunar and mars environment
small dishes will hold seedlings , and astronauts on the station will watch how they are able to grow inside the japanese kibo module
it should be noted that there is still gravity on the iss but , owing to its orbit around earth , things on the station are in a constant state of free - fall , simulating a zero - gravity environment
the results could help farmers on earth get a higher crop yield - and may also help future astronauts grow plants on missions beyond earth orbit to the moon and mars ( illustration shown ) in particular , scientists think particles in plant cells that store and process starch for energy - amyloplast - may form in the direction of gravitational pull
these culture dishes hold seedlings and the growing medium for the plant gravity sensing investigation , which were used during astronaut training at the japan aerospace exploration agency âs tsukuba space center in march 2014 the gravity sensor of the plant could be regulated to account for the different gravity on another planet - such as mars , where it is a third of earth âs
â we may design plants that respond to gravity vector changes more efficiently than wild ones , â said dr hitoshi tatsumi from the nagoya university in japanese , who is running the experiment
