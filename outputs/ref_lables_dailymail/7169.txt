jenson button could do no more than ' look at the positives ' in the wake of another frustrating day at the wheel of his faltering mclaren
after stopping on track in each of the practice sessions on friday due to technical issues , jenson button made it a hat - trick in qualifying for the bahrain grand prix
after just three corners of the bahrain , the 35 - year - old ground to a halt with what the team believe to be another electrical issue
jenson button was given a lift back to the pits on a motorcycle by a marshal after his engine failure in first practice on friday , the engine in jenson button 's car cut out at the first corner of his opening quick lap due to an electrical failure , and then come fp2 a sensor issue forced him to pull over
the latest glitch , however , means jenson button will start the race 20th and last - his lowest grid slot since the 2008 canadian grand prix , when he was driving for current power - unit suppliers honda
in contrast , and on the upside , team - mate fernando alonso managed to get a mclaren into q2 for the first time this season and will start 14th
describing his emotions , jenson button said : ' we 're racing drivers and you want to drive your racing car as fast as you can
jenson button jumps out of his mclaren after failing to complete the qualifying session in bahrain ' i was quite happy with it
fernando alonso managed to get a mclaren into q2 for the first time this season ' ( on saturday ) we were 14th fastest , so ( on sunday ) if nothing happens we will be 14th fastest in the race probably
