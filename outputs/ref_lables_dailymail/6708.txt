from location tagging to unmonitored comments to blatant sexual harassment , a new video streaming app has all the ingredients to become a parent 's latest nightmare
periscope , twitter 's new iphone app which allows users to broadcast live video and audio online , launched a week ago today and early adapters have already discovered potentially hair - raising issues with the much talked - about technology , which claims on its website that it is ' the closest thing to teleportation '
despite the initial hype surrounding the launch of the app , which is being touted as a revolutionary new way to share news , there are already a concerning number of users , particularly women , reporting that they have been sexually harassed , or trolled , while using the technology
streaming revolution : periscope , an iphone app that allows users to broadcast live video and audio to the internet , launched last thursday warning : app developer justin esgar is warning parents about the app 's various ' land mines ' and insists that they need to monitor their child 's use of it ( stock image ) justin esgar , app developer of the app goodnight , told daily mail online that because periscope ' allows users to share even more of their intimate lives with each other than ever before ' , there are ' apparent dangers ' that users have to consider before accessing it
emma , sex and relationships editor at cosmopolitan.com , noted that the app is already crawling with men who are using the anonymity afforded to them by the app 's settings in order to sexually harass women - including one of her female friends
while neither of them were speaking in an even remotely sexual manor , the lude comments continued to pour in and included phrases such as : ' show boobs ' , ' age ? ' and ' i would soooo swipe right on both [ sic ] ! ' one particularly creepy user asked : ' do you get out of the shower to pee ? ' according to periscope 's community guidelines , the app prohibits ' pornographic or overtly sexual content ' as well as ' explicitly graphic content or media that is intended to incite violent , illegal or dangerous activities '
the app 's policies are , unsurprisingly , similar to twitter , which is currently testing out a ' quality filter ' that monitors and removes threats and offensive language out of users notifications feeds
but the recent reports of harassment and bullying have sparked concern among parents of many of the children and teenagers who currently have access to the app â raising questions about whether it is truly safe for young people to be using it , given that they could potentially be opening themselves up to all manner of abuse , be it of a violent , or sexual , nature
thankfully , periscope disabled the zooming feature on the map as a part of its first system update , but the app still enables locations
special features : the app , which is owned by twitter , allows users to follow certain people ( l ) and scroll through a ' watch ' feed of live videos ( r ) mr justin esgar noted : ' periscope requires not only your camera and microphone , but access to your location [ if you want to broadcast video ]
' periscope does enable users to hide their location once they begin broadcasting - but many users admit they did n't think to disable the feature before starting their video stream
while testing the app , mr justin esgar said he watched kevin jonas and his daughter ride bicycles , a german man drinking , comedian jim gaffigan getting his hair washed and an office learning about periscope
and while periscope has provided guidelines for content , mr justin esgar noted that there does n't seem to be any ' curation on the app either ' - essentially allowing users to show whatever they want
clearly , this opens a lot of potential land mines for parents to now have to try and control
