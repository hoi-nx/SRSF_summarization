hughes has revealed how he came within a heartbeat of stepping down from his job at inverness as the josh meekings controversy went into overdrive this week
the inverness boss says he felt so repulsed by the gut - wrenching predicament being endured by his young defender - before he was dramatically cleared - that he was ready to walk away from his post and the games he loves , just weeks before an historic scottish cup date
keen cyclist hughes set off on a lonely bike ride after hearing josh meekings had been cited for the handball missed by officials in the semi-final against celtic , and admits his head was in a spin over an affair that has dominated the back - page headlines since last sunday
inverness defender josh meekings will be allowed to appear in scottish cup final after his ban was dismissed only messages of support awaiting him on his return from footballing friends brought him back from the brink of quitting
hughes , who lives in the black isle just north of inverness , said : â i came in here this morning after a day off
i turned my phone off and was away myself , away out on the bike with plenty of thinking time : a great freedom of mind
â i was that sick of what has been going on in scottish football i was seriously contemplating my own future
i âm serious when i say that
â the calls and texts came in from all over the place , from some of the highest levels across the game
josh meekings was not sent off and no penalty was given as inverness went on to beat celtic 3 - 2 after extra-time â they were saying : â you need to lead from the front , you need to fight it
and , if that was how i was feeling , how was the boy josh meekings feeling ? it should never have come to this
â josh meekings was cleared to play in the final by the panel yesterday , but hughes insists this â unprecedented â sfa wrangle must be the catalyst for change in scottish football âs governance
although those who sit on the panel are drawn from many walks of life , ranging from former players and coaches to ex-refs and members of the legal profession , hughes said he wants â real football people â drafted in instead of the â suits â he claims lack understanding of the nuances and spirit of the professional game
and he seemed to point a thinly - veiled finger of accusation at sfa chief executive stewart regan by alleging that compliance officer tony mcglennan was a mere â patsy â in the process
overwhelmed by a huge upswell of support for josh meekings , he said : â no disrespect to those sitting on [ the judicial panel ] , but you need football guys and that âs where it âs flawed
i âm talking about playing the game , managing the game , coaching the game
josh meekings âs case was unprecedented
â they are making a football decision and i want football people
here we were talking about a young player âs chance of playing in a scottish cup final
i âd be more confident with football people because they know the game
â hughes , who accepted josh meekings would have warranted a red card had the ref spotted the offence , refused to point a finger of blame at former club celtic for the letter of complaint they wrote to the sfa in the aftermath
â celtic keep getting flung into it , but i came in here this morning and all kristine , our receptionist , says to me is that the phone had never stopped ringing with celtic supporters wishing josh meekings all the best and hoping he plays in the final
â i believe that comes right from the top at celtic
â i have to be the voice of inverness
