but this crumpet - like rock is in fact one of saturn 's outer moons , measuring 255 by 161 miles ( 410 by 260km )
the floating bath sponge : this image shows one of saturn 's outer moons , measuring 255 by 161 miles ( 410 by 260km )
its odd , almost ' bubbly ' appearance , can be attributed to it having a very low density for its size , according to nasa
scientists believe around 40 per cent of the moon is empty space
it appears that hyperion 's surface becomes electrostatically charged as it is bathed in charged particles
its odd , almost ' bubbly ' appearance , can be attributed to it having a very low density for its size ' the large difference in potential between the surface and the spacecraft resulted in a flow of electrons being accelerated from hyperion toward cassini
its odd , almost ' bubbly ' appearance , can be attributed to it having a very low density for its size
scientists think that this moon is mostly made up of water ice , with small amounts of rock , and around 40 per cent of it is empty space
during the flyby , cassini got more than it bargained for as hyperion unleashed a burst of charged particles towards the spacecraft , effectively delivering a giant 200 - volt electric shock ( artist 's impression pictured )
