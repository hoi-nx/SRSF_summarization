raheem sterling shakes hands with liverpool boss rodgers during training on thursday the two were at melwood alongside the rest of the liverpool squad in preparation for clash with arsenal rodgers remains confident that raheem sterling will stay and the situation will be resolved in the summer raheem sterling is quite within his rights to get the best possible deal he can for himself , according to keane but even so , it prompted keane to explain to me â for a column i was ghosting at the time - why a footballer should â always look after no 1 â

liverpool striker daniel sturridge ( right ) is believed to be earning around Â£ 150,000 a week steven gerrard trains at melwood as he keeps fit during his period of suspension for liverpool but liverpool do not have the financial muscle of a city or a chelsea and that could yet result in them losing raheem sterling
only recently ian ayre , the liverpool chief executive , explained the club âs strategy and a move towards more performance - related contracts
â raheem sterling scored his first goal for england during their 4 - 0 win over lithuania last friday the 20 - year - old liverpool forward uploaded this picture to instagram from inside his home clearly , not everyone is happy
