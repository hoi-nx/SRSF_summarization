european human rights judges have delivered a boost to home secretary theresa may âs campaign to kick illegal immigrants and foreign criminals out of the country
eight judges of the european court of human rights found that russia was justified in deporting a 45 - year - old man for breaking immigration laws even though he went to live there more than 20 years ago and has a russia wife and son
but the strasbourg court said that the russia authorities had not breached any human rights rules when they deported him in 2011
boost : mrs may is hoping to be able to stop illegal immigrants and foreign criminals dodging deportation or delaying it by claiming their right to a family life the european judges â whose rulings are supposed to be followed by 47 countries including russia â heard that georgia - born robert muradeli had gone to russia in 1992 , had married in the city of penza in 1994 and had a son in 1995
lawyers for russia argued that it was necessary to deport him to ensure immigration laws were obeyed
the strasbourg ruling said that by breaking immigration rules robert muradeli had â demonstrated consistent disregard of the laws , regulations and public order of the host country â
