farage faced claims of a â cover - up â last night for censoring a poll that suggests he is on course for a humiliating personal defeat in the general election farage faced claims of a â cover - up â last night for censoring a poll that suggests he is on course for a humiliating personal defeat in the general election
the secret ukip - commissioned poll , leaked to the mail on sunday , shows that farage has fallen behind his conservative opponent in the kent seat he is contesting
if the poll is accurate , it could end farage âs political career as he has vowed to resign as ukip leader if he fails to win south thanet
the comres poll was commissioned last month by multimillionaire businessman and former conservative arron banks , who defected to ukip last year and gave the party Â£ 1million
ukip hoped the thanet poll would echo an earlier one showing farage heading for a famous victory , and they planned to use it to whip up more support
it showed conservative candidate mackinlay , a former ukip activist , on 30 points , one ahead of farage , with labour only one behind
farage was so alarmed he gave orders for the findings to be hushed up to avoid causing panic in ukip ranks â and encouraging his rivals
but yesterday , a spokesman finally admitted it had buried the survey , claiming the results were â unreliable â and that it was a â rogue poll â
the poll showed conservative candidate mackinlay ( left ) , a former ukip activist , on 30 points , one ahead of farage
if the censored poll is accurate , farage may not be one of them , and that will leave ukip in search of a new leader

a ukip spokesman said the comres poll âs headline figures greatly understated farage âs support because it included people who were not likely to vote and who tended to lean towards the traditional parties
â the poll shows that among those likely to vote , farage is seven points ahead of both the conservatives and labour in south thanet
â a conservative spokesman said : â the fact that ukip commissioned this poll but then tried to cover it up when they did nât like the results shows their true colours
