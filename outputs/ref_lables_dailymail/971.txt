alan gordon scored a first - half winner for la galaxy as they got over their nightmare start to the season against sounders to move off the foot of the western conference in mls
robbie keane and clint dempsey were both left out of their sides through injury but despite the absence of their irish designated player - who was sat in the stands alongside david beckham , the la galaxy were able to find just their second win of a difficult campaign so far
marshall gets to the ball ahead of la galaxy striker alan gordon , who scored the opening goal la galaxy ( 4 - 5 - 1 ) : penedo ; gargan ( meyer 86 mins ) , omar gonzalez , de la garza , robbie rogers ; ishizaki , garcia , husidic ( villarreal 83 ) , juninho , zardes ; alan gordon
both sides started strongly , but it was the sounders ' lamar neagle had the first chance of the game after nine minutes , flicking on from a cross that was tipped over the crossbar by jaime pendeo
lamar neagle again saw a header blocked by the keeper after 21 minutes and though it was the visitors with the best of the early chances , one minute later the la galaxy were ahead
the swiss goalkeeper scrambled to re-adjust but was beaten to it by alan gordon who could hardly miss and duly put the la galaxy into the lead
lamar neagle had a third chance on the stroke of half - time but could n't find the net having exploded through the la galaxy defence only to place his shot too close to penedo who saved easily , diving to his right
and so alan gordon 's strike proved enough as la galaxy claimed just their second win of the 2015 mls season .
