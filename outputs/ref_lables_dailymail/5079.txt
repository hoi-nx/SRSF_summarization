an impoverished father has revealed that he plans to sell his own kidney to fund life - saving treatment for his three morbidly - obese children
sisters rameshbhai nandwana , five , and anisha , three , and their 18 - month - old brother harsh , are among the world 's heaviest young children
weighing 5st 5lbs ( 34kg ) , 7st 8lbs ( 48kg ) and 2st 5lbs ( 15kg ) respectively , the food they eat in a week is enough to feed two families in a month
now their father rameshbhai nandwana , 34 , of gurjarat , india , is planning to sell his kidney to earn the money needed to see top specialists
after that i am again in the kitchen preparing more food
they demand food all the time and cry and scream if they âre not fed. i am always in the kitchen cooking for them
â the couple have one older daughter , bhavika , six , who weighs an average 2st 7lbs ( 16kg ) , and do not know why their other three children are so big
mr rameshbhai nandwana said : â when yogita was born she was extremely weak and weighed just 1.5kg ( 3.3lbs )
family : rameshbhai nandwana ( left ) , 34 , and ben ( back right ) , 30 , are the parents of yogita ( front left ) , anisha ( front right ) , harsh ( front centre ) and six - year - old bhavika ( rear centre ) , their other daughter - who weighs an average 2st 7lbs
they all live together in gujarat , india â our third daughter anisha also gained weight in similar fashion and by her first birthday she was 15kg
â but we only realised they were suffering from a disorder when our son harsh was born as he too gained weight quickly during his first year
â mr rameshbhai nandwana earns just rs 3000 ( Â£ 35 ) a month - but usually has sufficient money to buy enough food to fulfil the large appetite of his children
â i work in fields , dig wells , and do whatever menial job i can find to earn money
' and i âm constantly worried about finding the money to feed my continually hungry children
â despite his paltry income , mr rameshbhai nandwana spends about rs 10,000 ( Â£ 110 ) a month on food for his children and said he ' can not leave them starving ' diet : yogita and anisha eat eight chapatis , 4lbs of rice , three bowls of broth , six packets of crisps , five packs of biscuits and 12 bananas daily mother of four : ben , 30 , tries to lift her five - year - old daughter yogita 6am five bananas one litre of milk six wheat chapatis one bowl of vegetable broth 10am five wheat chapatis one bowl of yoghurt one bowl of vegetable broth 12.30pm millet chapatti - made of 3.3lbs millet flour two bananas one bowl of vegetables four packets of crisps 3pm millet breads rice - 3lbs with vegetables 5pm 1 litre cold drink ( coca cola or pepsi ) six packets of crisps five packs of biscuits five bananas 8pm six wheat chapatis one litre of milk buttermilk ( 1.5 litres ) two big bowls of vegetables he added : â if i do nât have the money , i borrow it from my brothers and friends
but i make sure i feed my children when they need
â the father has spent rs 50,000 ( Â£ 540 ) on seeing doctors and treatment over the last three years â without any improvement in his children âs condition
â miss ben can not pick up her children so she has to watch them roll around when her husband is at work - or use a trolley to pull them around
hard - working : anisha hugs her father rameshbhai , with harsh
mr rameshbhai nandwana spends about rs 10,000 ( Â£ 110 ) a month on food for his children ' they are usually restricted to the same place for the whole day and because of that , they can not go to school
parents of children with the condition usually have to restrict their diet and lock up all food instead , a team of healthcare professionals will help teach parents to manage any problems the child has , such as overeating
children usually want to eat frequently , so it is important that most of the food they eat is low in calories , and that access to sweets and fatty foods is restricted
they should also search the child âs room for hidden foods , forbid them to leave the house unsupervised , or play with other children who are eating food , in case they try to steal it
most adults with prader-willi syndrome are unable to live fully independent lives , such as having a full - time job and living in their own home
