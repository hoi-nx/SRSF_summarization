the disgraced espn sports reporter has been suspended for a week after footage emerged of her telling single mother - of - three gina : ' i 'm on tv and you 're in a f --- ing trailer , honey
' but just a month earlier she used similar language to berate an arkansas attorney and women 's rights campaigner on twitter
sparkman , who tweets with the handle @ cupcakesarenice , remarked to her followers that she felt uneasy about the way female sports reporters are sexualized on screen
her observation infuriated mchenry in a fight that ended with the reporter raging : ' you sound really bitter
if you work as hard as you say you do , you would n't bash more successful ppl on twitter

it started when sparkman wrote to her followers : ' i wish there were more women in sports broadcasting that are n't completely sexualized
although they did not tag mchenry in the tweet , the 28 - year - old reporter found it and began berating sparkman

what 's wrong w / a woman wanting to look nice & be intelligent ? ' sparkman responded : ' i have zero issue with beautiful women in sports media
' to clarify her point , sparkman sent mchenry a link to the definition of ' sexualization '
mchenry was not satisfied : ' personally i believe it 's ppl who do n't have 1 trait or the other who try to demean others , ' adding , ' so you 're being more of a hater than the men themselves ? ' in a bid to extract herself from the back - and - forth , sparkman tweeted her exasperation to her followers : ' man , i swear i ca n't give an opinion without some rando on twitter seeking me out and bashing their misinterpretation
' the comment prompted mchenry 's final scathing words , which echo the abuse she level at the tow company clerk on april 6
' technically given the two of us , you 're the rando , ' mchenry tweeted , adding : ' you sound really bitter
if you work as hard as you say you do , you would n't bash more successful ppl on twitter

mchenry seems unfussed , responding : ' that âs why i have a degree and you do n't - i would n't work in a scumbag place like this
