we all need a helping hand sometimes , and nobody more so than kecil the baby orangutan , who had a tough start to life after his natural mother and another surrogate mother rejected him
but the one - year - old ape found love at the third time of asking with second surrogate mother maggie at chicago 's brookfield zoo , and has today been pictured cuddling up to the experienced mother ahead of his first public outing this weekend
maggie , 53 , who has already raised one surrogate child , has proved herself yet again by helping to raise kecil ( pronounced ka-cheel ) for the past 10 months , and the two now have an inseparable bond
kecil had to be moved from his birthplace at toledo zoo , in ohio , 14 months ago after his natural mother failed to bond with him properly after birth
in a final attempt to find a parent for kecil , he was handed over to maggie , the oldest orangutan in north america , who has already raised four children of her own , and a fifth surrogate which was given to her in 2002
turning point : keepers in chicago said the turning point for kecil came a few weeks ago when a fire alarm went off on the zoo , frightening him
usually he turned to people for comfort , but instead he ran and cuddled up to maggie big day : after settling into his new enclosure , kecil will go on display for the first time this weekend in two hours slots between 10am and midday , allowing him to nap in the afternoons getting into the swing of things : keepers said when kecil and maggie were first put into their new enclosure , the older ape would wander too far ahead , and kecil would get lost , but the pair have now learned to stick close to one another she said : ' initially when he would be feeling insecure he would turn to people , and then there was a shift where he would turn to maggie if he felt insecure
