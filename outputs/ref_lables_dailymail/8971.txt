a stunning fireball that crackled across the sky near the russia - finnish border last year shared its orbit with a huge asteroid found in october
this is according to a new study which claims the kola fireball had a ' disturbingly similar ' path to asteroid 2014 ur116 , which is due to pass by the moon in 2017
pictured is he fireball at the time of entry at the kola peninsula joseph maria trigo-rodrã­guez , a researcher at the institute of space sciences in barcelona , spain , headed the team of scientists who studied the meteorite 's orbit
they determined the fireball 's path by studying its flight and the meteorite 's final impact site , before creating a computer model based on those figures
the computer model compared the orbit of annama , a 1,100lb ( 500kg ) rock , with the evolution of a dozen orbits of near - earth asteroids

this led researchers to the annama meteorite ( pictured ) the computer model compared the orbit of annama ( pictured ) , a 1,100lb ( 500kg ) rock , with the evolution of a dozen orbits of near - earth asteroids 2014 ur116 , a mountain - sized asteroid which passes earth every three years , was discovered by russia scientists in december
proffesor lipunov said it is difficult to calculate the orbit of big rocks like ' 2014 ur116 ' because their trajectories are constantly being changed by the gravitational pull of other planets
it showed a similarity with the evolution of 2014 ur116 , which given its size and minimum distance to the planet , has been classed a ' potentially dangerous asteroid '
while the study does not claim that asteroid 2014 ur116 sent the annama meteorite directly at earth , it suggests the two bodies are related
scientists believe that streams of asteroid fragments can travel on nearly identical orbits
