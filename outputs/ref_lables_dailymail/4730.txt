straight after easter on planet football comes squeaky bum time , but the only squeaking at chelsea came from mourinho , trying to contain his mirth when told hammers had the most positive tactics in england
mourinho was having no truck with the premier league 's fair play table , which lauded the hammers for their attacking style and frowned upon chelsea 's lack of respect
he even offered support to pellegrini , claiming the manchester city boss had been treated like a ' criminal ' after losing six of eight games
chelsea manager mourinho has spoken out in defence of under pressure colleague pellegrini pellegrini has overseen a poor run of form at manchester city , losing six of their last eight games manchester city forward sergio aguero ( left ) tussles for the ball with united 's marcos rojo united defender chris smalling scores his side 's fourth goal as they beat manchester city 4 - 2 at old trafford last week pellegrini poses with manchester city captain vincent kompany ( left ) after winning the league last season no love is lost between mourinho and pellegrini , but the chelsea manager said : ' i 'm surprised a team that won two titles in three years and are still champions can be brought to hell
' it looks like they do n't deserve respect , that they are bad players , that the manager is a bad manager , that they are a disaster
' so how can you be so negative with a team that 's won two titles in three years ? some managers can not win and life goes on , but the guys at manchester city ... it looks like they 're criminals
' victory on saturday will extend chelsea 's lead over united to 11 points and inch mourinho closer to his first premier league title since 2006 , having led from the start
the conduct of chelsea 's players towards match officials is rated the worst in the league and only sunderland score worse when it comes to the behaviour of staff
' i 'm not surprised , ' chuckled mourinho
