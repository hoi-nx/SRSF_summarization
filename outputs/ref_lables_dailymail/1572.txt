there are few things more beautiful - or terrifying - than the menacing flash of lightning bolts within a volcanic ash cloud
the latests picture , captured by an amateur photographer as the colima volcano in mexico spews out a plume of ash and lava , reveals the raw power of a volcanic eruption
lightning strikes inside the enormous ash cloud thrown into the air by the colima volcano ( above ) in mexico the 12,400 feet ( 3,800 metre ) high volcano , which first erupted in 1576 , is one of the most active volcanoes in mexico
' these blots of lightning are thought to occur due to the build up of electric charge in the ash cloud as the particles rub against each other
just like in a thunder cloud , this charge eventually builds up until it seeks a path through to the ground as lightning
earlier this month scientists discovered that it is this lightning that is responsible for making the glass spheres that can appear in volcanic rocks
they found that the intense heat generated by the lightning bolts causes the ash to melt into spherules of smooth glass
a bolt of volcanic lighting can heat the surrounding air to more than 3,000 Â° c , according to the researchers from the university of alabama in tuscaloosa
' the colima volcano volcano is actually one of three volcanic domes that make up the colima volcanic complex in the mexico state of colima volcano , 301 miles west of mexico city
the colima volcano volcano is regarded as one of the most dangerous in mexico due to its large explosive eruptions mr cervantes ( shown above ) spent eight hours waiting to capture his stunning images of the colima volcano volcano getting close enough to an erupting volcano is dangerous , so scientists at the ludwig maximilian university of munich recreated volcanic lightning in a lab. in 2013 they suspended volcanic ash gathered from sites around the world in a chamber filled with argon gas , forcing the concoction through a narrow tube
they found that the movement of ash particles against each other as they go from the compressed environment under the earth 's surface into the atmosphere during an eruption causes a built of up static charge
