stunning images have surfaced of an elusive albino dolphin that can change colour from white to pink when it 's emotional
the rare mammal has been making waves at the taiji whale museum in southern japan , where it draws vast and fascinated crowds
the animal was controversially captured during the annual dolphin hunt in the town of taiji in january
but the museum claims the creatures health has been monitored through periodic blood tests , and that they are keeping it ' physically and mentally healthy ' for further research
the pink tone is a result of the animals thin skin , which means its blood vessels can cause a change in skin tone depending on their emotional state environmental activists filed a lawsuit against the taiji whaling museum in may 2014 , claiming it had refused experts to check on the safety of the elusive dolphin
the animal is captured by fishermen during the annual dolphin hunt in the town of taiji in january last year researchers at the museum , who claim they are keeping the dolphin in good health for research purposes , published a study about the animal in march
