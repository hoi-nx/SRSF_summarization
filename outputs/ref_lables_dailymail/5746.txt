sturgeon is most definitely the most dangerous woman in british
no wonder her male rivals are terrified
while in 2001 she dressed according to the angela merkel school of leadership â a boxy , androgynous look from a woman who had lost her waist along with her sanity , topped and tailed with a krankies haircut and orthopaedic shoes â today she has shed pounds , bleached her hair , squeezed her feet into kurt geiger heels , and for the leaders â debate last week , rocked a coral two - piece by the aptly named scottish design label totty rocks
not because she might well cosy up to ed miliband and keep david cameron out of office , but because she is living proof that women become sexier with age , income and office in 2001 she dressed according to the angela merkel school of leadership â a boxy , androgynous look from a woman who had lost her waist along with her sanity , topped and tailed with a krankies ( above ) haircut and orthopaedic shoes her outfit made the male leaders â dark suits seem as old as their arguments
she has shed pounds , bleached her hair , squeezed her feet into kurt geiger heels , and for the leaders â debate last week , rocked a coral two - piece by the aptly named scottish design label totty rocks the accessories 2001 : no one except the queen looks good with a brooch , seen here as a last - minute addition to stop its wearer appearing too bland
the diet 2001 : i can hear female voters muttering , â she did nât have time to get her hair done , but she certainly found time to eat ! â sturgeon appears slow - moving and complacent
here , sturgeon is all womanly curves and upright posture
we do nât want our politicians to be comfy , we want them to suffer ! sturgeon resembles a double - glazing salesperson at the annual works do
