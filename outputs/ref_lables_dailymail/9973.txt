detectives investigating the hatton garden gem heist missed the most crucial cctv footage so far until it was flagged up by a shocked worker more than one week later , it is claimed
the ' crystal clear ' footage - said to be of a significantly higher quality than the video currently in the public domain - was handed into the met by a worker based 50ft from the crime scene
the worker had reportedly contacted 101 - the police non-emergency number - on monday last week , believing detectives would already have similar images of the Â£ 60m raid
a veteran trader in the london Â­ jewellery quarter told the sunday mirror : ' it is unreal it took this employee to bring these images to the attention of the police
' you would assume the officers had done everything to get cctv footage
' scotland yard has already come under fire for its handling of the heist , with the ex-head of the flying squad john oâconnor criticising the decision to ignore the alarm as ' totally incompetent '
when asked why the new footage had not been released , a police spokesman said the force would not discuss ' specifics ' of cctv being examined and would release appropriate footage when needed for a public appeal
the ' crystal clear ' footage is said to be of a significantly higher quality than the video currently in the public domain , which was released last week ( pictured ) last week , questioned were raised over the police 's handling of the case after cctv footage showing the robbers at work was published in the daily mirror - 21 hours before they were released by scotland yard they said : ' the met has Â­ obtained and is examining a substantial amount of cctv footage in relation to the burglary at hatton garden safe deposit
' police continue to seize cctv with assistance from members of the public as the investigation progresses
' last week , questioned were raised over the police 's handling of the case after cctv footage showing the robbers at work was published in the daily mirror , 21 hours before they were released by scotland yard

but detectives later insisted they already had the cctv footage , which they claim was recovered ' at the earliest opportunity '
hours earlier , police had refused to tell mailonline whether they had the footage
