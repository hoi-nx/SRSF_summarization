a weakening us economy spilled into the job market in march as employers added just 126,000 jobs 0the fewest since december 2013 â snapping a 12 - month streak of gains above 200,000
the unemployment rate remained at 5.5 percent , the labor department said in its monthly report friday
the march jobs data raised uncertainties about the world 's largest economy , which for months has been the envy of other industrialized nations for its steadily robust hiring and growth
employers now appear wary about the economy , especially as a strong dollar has slowed us exports , home sales have sputtered and cheaper gasoline has yet to unleash more consumer spending
the yield on the us 10 - year treasury note dropped to 1.84 percent from 1.90 percent before the jobs report was released
us stock markets are closed in observance of good friday

' last month , the manufacturing , building and government sectors all shed workers
factories cut 1,000 , snapping a 19 - month hiring streak
construction jobs also fell by 1,000 , the first drop in 15 months
health care added 22,000 workers
professional and business services â a sector that includes lawyers , engineers , accountants and office temps â gained 40,000
in addition to reporting sluggish hiring for march , the government revised down its estimate of job gains in february and january by a combined 69,000
but because average hours worked fell in march for the first time in 15 months , us actually earned less on average than they did in february
many us remain out of the labor force , partly because many baby boomers are reaching retirement age
the percentage of us who are either working or looking for work fell in march to 62.7 percent , tying the lowest such rate since 1978
yet the streak of strong hiring , along with cheaper gasoline , has n't significantly boosted consumer spending
