father hamish baillie claims janner abused him during a game of hide - and - seek in 1983 a father allegedly abused by janner has called for the top legal official who decided against prosecuting him to step down
alison saunders , director of public prosecutions , concluded dementia made the 86 - year - old unfit to plead
hamish baillie , 47 , said he was unable to trust adults after being molested by janner during a game of hide - and - seek in a park , when he was a 15 - year - old resident of a children âs home
but he added that the failure to prosecute the peer for a fourth time â three inquiries were curtailed by police or the cps â was a â complete travesty â
the father - of - three said he turned to drugs as a result of the abuse , which left him â questioning myself and everyone around me â
he believes janner was â steered â in his direction by the care home âs manager , beck â a friend who would later be convicted of a string of child sex offences
' he has blighted my life â¦ how can they [ the cps ] publicise the fact that there was enough evidence to charge , yet then say it is not in the public interest to pursue it ? â mr hamish baillie , of hinckley , leicestershire , added : â no disrespect to the public , but what about the interest of the victims ? â as far as i âm concerned , her [ mrs alison saunders âs ] actions are barely any less perverse than the abuse inflicted upon me as a teenager
â mr hamish baillie said the decision not to prosecute janner ( left ) , who he claims abused him when he was aged 15 , for the fourth time was a ' complete travesty '
alison saunders ( right ) said her job as head of the cps was to make the correct legal decisions in difficult cases , not the most popular ones he said the police involved in the inquiry were â blameless â but added that â when one considers this is the fourth time janner has been investigated , i honestly think there could be a cover - up at play â
the cps last week said the â core allegation â was that janner befriended beck to access children â to allow him to perpetrate serious sexual offences â on them
the politician was first implicated during the 1991 trial of beck , who ran the beeches children âs home in leicester
following beck âs conviction , janner , then an mp , stood up in the house of commons to vehemently deny any abuse , and the cps decided not to take further action
he was placed in care aged 15 for â rebellious behaviour â and said he met janner in 1983 while playing arcade games at leicester forest east service station
mr hamish baillie said over the next seven months janner came to the service station seven times , sometimes discussing a hotel where they could go for â steak and whisky â
it was amid a game of hide - and - seek in bradgate park , leicestershire , organised by beck later that year , that he claims he was abused by the peer
â i was just moving behind a gorse bush to hide when i saw janner walking towards me , â he said
â mr hamish baillie believes beck â tipped janner off about where to find me â
â legal chief facing growing calls to quit : backlash against top prosecutor grows as she is accused of ignoring victims and claims of a establishment cover - up the furious backlash against the uk âs top prosecutor intensified last night over her decision to spare janner from the dock
mrs alison saunders fought back saying it is her job as the head of the cps to make â very difficult decisions â which are not necessarily popular
campaigners , police chiefs and mps have accused alison saunders , the director of the cps ( above ) , of ignoring the rights of victims and failing to clear the stench of an establishment cover - up that lingers overhead but the row showed no sign of abating as further details of the claims levelled against the 86 - year - old labour life peer were made public
the decision not to charge janner last week despite evidence of 22 offences against nine victims was justified because mrs alison saunders said experts agreed that the former leicester west mp was in such poor health due to advanced alzheimer âs disease
