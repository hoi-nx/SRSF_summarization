it has been a key part school chemistry lessons for more than a century , but now the periodic table may need to be redrawn after scientists found a rare element may be very different from originally thought
researchers have for the first time been able to test how much energy is required to strip an electron from an atom of the radioactive element lawrencium
the rare metal currently sits at the very bottom of the periodic table at the end of a group of elements known as the actinides , which sit in a separate block from the main table
but the results of new research suggest the element may have properties similar to sodium and potassium , which may fuel arguments that it would be better placed in the main body the periodic table
lr , marked as lr on the periodic table above , currently sits in a separate block from the main table if it is redraw , it means that chemistry students could have to relearn the order of how the elements appear
lr , which was first discovered in 1961 by the nuclear scientist lawrence , is notoriously difficult to make and only exists for a few seconds at a time
this has made the element , which can only be generated in particle accelerators , extremely difficult to study
â the current structure of the periodic table was drawn up in 1945 after the nobel - prize winning chemist glenn seaborg suggested the actinides - rare radioactive elements - belonged in a separate part of the table which is known as ' f - block '
however , some chemists have argued that placing lawrencium at the end of this block was incorrect and they should be put in the 'd - block ' of the main table
dr william jensen , a chemist at the university of cincinnati , argues that along with lutetium , lawrencium is misplaced in the f - block
' lu and lawrencium , rather than la and ac , should be assigned to the d - block as the heavier analogs of scandium and yttrium , whereas la and ac should be considered as the first members of the f - block with irregular configurations
however , scientists have only ever been able to produce minuscule amounts of the substance and it has a half life of 27 seconds
the researchers found this matched a recent prediction of 4.96ev - giving it the lowest ionisation potential of all elements in the f - block
he said : ' if the periodic table is presented in the more correct 32 - column or long - format , and if one maintains the order of increasing atomic numbers throughout the table , one is inevitably led to the conclusion that lu and lr belong to group 3 and that la and ac should be placed at the start of the f - block elements
the researchers were able to study lawrencium for the first time using an ionizer cavity ( left ) which revealed that the element has one of the lowest ionisation potentials of any of the atoms in the f - block ( right )
