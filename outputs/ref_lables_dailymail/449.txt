with a possible 11 games left to their season barca âs front three of messi , luis suarez and neymar are just seven goals short of clocking up a century in their first season together
the three amigos will match the total scored by thierry henry , samuel eto'o and messi in 2009 if they reach 100 goals and they will inevitably fuel the debate that they are fast becoming the greatest front three in barca âs history
thierry henry scored 26 , etoâo 36 and messi 38 goals in the 2008 - 09 season
they scored 98 goals in the 2010 - 11 season with messi getting 53 , villa 23 and pedro 21
both attacks had a tendency to come good in the clasicos with the thierry henry / etoâo / messi strikeforce playing in one of the most famous real madrid - barca games of all time in 2009 with barca winning 6 - 2 at the bernabeu and thierry henry and messi both scored twice
messi celebrates with thierry henry after barca won the champions league in 2009 the argentine congratulates team - mate samuel eto'o after he scores in the champions league final in 2009 the current combination lacks the champions league the other two have and a big win over real madrid but there is still time for them to combine the two with a clasico final still a possibility
after a slow start to his barca career luis suarez has now scored 19 goals despite missing the first months of the season through suspension messi celebrates with luis suarez after the uruguay international netted against valencia messi never saw eye to eye with david villa or ibrahimovic and both were put out at times at having to play second fiddle to the four times balon dâor winner but after a season accommodating daniel sturridge 's preference for playing through the middle , the demands of messi have not been a problem for luis suarez
if this season ends with messi , luis suarez and neymar smashing the 100 goals barrier and lifting the trophy in berlin no other forward line in barca âs history will be able to touch them .
