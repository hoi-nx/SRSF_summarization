i remember when our motor manufacturing industry was in the hands of â conveners â and â shop stewards â , and when the man who ran british leyland â then our biggest car company â appeared to be an avowedly communist trade union official called red robbo
boris johnson : the problem with ed miliband is that he wants to take the country back to the 1970s we had atrocious relations between management and unions , and a legal framework that gave all the power to the unions
we had a labour government that believed companies existed not to serve the needs of the market , or the desires of their customers â but to satisfy the rights of their workers
we had an era of tea breaks and â demarcation disputes â and closed shops and one - out - all - out strikes , with the labour government trying to impose such insane solutions as benn âs communist - style motorbike â collective â at meriden
i am not surprised to discover that one of the key authors of the labour manifesto is my former adversary ken livingstone , who has long been on the benn wing
by ed miliband âs own admission , ken livingstone has been a big influence in his thinking â and in their return to the benn / ken livingstone approach labour âs plans are truly nightmarish for business and enterprise
ed miliband is turning the labour sharply back to the left , and actively repudiating the chief insight of tony blair â that the party can only be successful if it makes a sensible accommodation with capitalism and the market economy
that is why british business people are so unanimous in their horror , including many former labour supporters and donors
labour wants to hit small - and medium - sized businesses with more corporation tax and higher national insurance â but it is worse than that
' i am not surprised to discover that one of the key authors of the labour manifesto is my former adversary ken livingstone ' they want to recreate the stifling environment of the 1970s , in which management was deprived of the ability to manage
that is before you have even begun to calculate the impact of their attacks on the city , higher income tax , and the higher interest rates that small firms would have to cope with â the result of labour âs failure to tackle the deficit
how mad , how tragic , that this extraordinary british triumph should be faced with a labour government that regards capitalism as â predatory â
the problem with ed miliband is not his method of consuming a bacon sarnie â in fact i totally sympathise on that one
the problem with ed miliband is that he wants to take the country back to the 1970s , writes boris johnson the problem is not even that he crashed the economy last time , though he did
the problem with ed miliband is that he wants to take the country back to the 1970s
that should tell ed miliband all he needs to know about the relative dynamism and competitiveness of the two economies
labour wants to go back to the 1970s , ukip to some non-existent version of a monochrome 1950s , the greens would like to go back to the middle of the stone age , and the lib dems would probably settle for any epoch in which they were above five per cent in the polls
the lib dems under nick clegg would probably settle for any epoch in which they were above five per cent in the polls it is only the conservatives that understand the real economic and social significance of all those british cars lined up at bristol
they are the fruits of a long and painful post-war period in which british has learned that in order to survive we must innovate and compete , and that we can not hope to compete if we over-tax and over-regulate in the way that ed miliband is proposing
those british - made vehicles are the sign of an economy that is back on its feet after the labour - made disaster of 2008 - 9 , in which motor manufacturing fell by half a million cars ; an economy that has seen the creation , since 2010 , of about two million jobs
we need five more years to entrench this economic recovery , five years to take this country forwards and not backwards
