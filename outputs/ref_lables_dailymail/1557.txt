testosterone by joe herbert testosterone does nât always get a good press
everything that âs unpleasant about male behaviour has been ascribed to the effects of this much maligned hormone
violence ? it âs all testosterone âs fault
yet , as joe herbert makes clear in his engaging whistlestop tour of the science surrounding it , testosterone is at the heart of human life
â without our father âs testosterone , â as he writes , â none of us would exist
â it has only one basic function â to enable a male to reproduce , and for that it âs essential
although this is the case and it âs impossible to think of â maleness â without testosterone , it âs also important for sexual behaviour in women
the blood of an adult woman before menopause actually contains about five times more testosterone than oestrogen , the supposedly â female â hormone
however , it âs as a metaphor for masculinity that testosterone is best known
all that âs unpleasant about male behaviour is ascribed to testosterone , yet as joe herbert explains , testosterone is at the heart of human life it begins its influence in the womb as it helps to shape the distinctive characteristics of the male body
that three - month - old baby boy , sweetly smiling at you from his pram , may well have testosterone levels that rival his father âs
we do nât know why but , starting two weeks after birth and lasting for four to six months , a little boy âs testes are producing testosterone in substantial amounts
the hormone âs power then recedes , but returns â and how ! â in puberty
even male giraffes , aroused by the hormone âs influence , flail at one another with their long necks
we can only be thankful that testosterone âs effects on sexual display in humans are not so visually dramatic
adult human males have varying levels of the hormone in different circumstances
when levels are high , the effects of testosterone on male behaviour are so strong that the human brain has had to find a multitude of ways of regulating and channelling them
in that sense , as joe herbert writes , â testosterone lies at the heart of much of our history â
