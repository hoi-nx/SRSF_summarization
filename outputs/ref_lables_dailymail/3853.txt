it was unclear whether miss flanders was voicing regret over her relationship with mr miliband , or was embarrassed by the media coverage â or both
miss flanders , 46 , accused the media of â raking over â mr miliband âs past in the run - up to the election
but in fact the revelation about the timing of her relationship with the future labour leader was revealed by miliband during a soft - focus interview with the labour - supporting mirror newspaper , which was headlined â how i fell in love with miliband â
mr rentoul said : â could the secrecy have been because he was a treasury special adviser and flanders was a bbc economics journalist ? â the revelations also revived stories about miss flanders âs former relationship with labour âs shadow chancellor balls , which is said to have been more serious than her fling with mr miliband

in an interview yesterday , the labour leader played down the controversy , saying : â i âm not at all bothered about attacks on me , but i do nât think it âs very nice for the other people who are not in the public eye
but one poll yesterday showed a sharp deterioration in mr miliband âs approval ratings among women
