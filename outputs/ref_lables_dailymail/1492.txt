from the moment johnson beat tommy burns to win the world heavyweight title in 1908 , a frenzied search began
while johnson 's victory would n't raise an eyebrow nowadays , it caused consternation in american for one simple reason : johnson was black â and a black man had never held sport 's greatest prize
' after beating tommy burns in 1908 , johnson became the first ever black world heavyweight champion it is difficult to convey to a reader in 2015 the shockwaves that johnson 's victory caused
it mattered little that johnson was american
but little did white american know that it would take over six years before johnson would be defeated , on april 5 , 1915 , 100 years ago on sunday
however , he made short work of his first four title defences , his most notable victory coming over world middleweight champion ketchel who made the massive step up in weight and even managed to knock johnson down
yet johnson had been fighting in second gear until that point and , as soon as he returned to his feet , scored a brutal knockout , uprooting several of ketchel 's teeth in the process
there seemed an obvious choice : former world heavyweight champion jeffries , who had retired undefeated in 1904
jeffries , who as champion had dodged johnson , was seen as someone who could quickly defeat the title holder and return things to the way they were
six years out of the ring had taken its toll on jeffries and in 1910 johnson stopped the former champion in 15 rounds , further enraging whites who rioted , taking out their anger on blacks who had the temerity to celebrate johnson 's win
what made johnson even more unbearable to white american was the way he lived his life

things were getting ridiculous , but johnson 's life outside the ring was unravelling
he fled to canada and then to europe , fighting three times in paris , where he made history by beating ' battling ' jim johnson in the first - ever all - black heavyweight championship bout
' to put jess willard 's size into perspective , the average height of an american man at the time was 5ft 7in
the fight would take place in cuba and was scheduled for 45 three - minute rounds , a hell of a distance given the 40 - degree heat on the day
how would johnson , now 37 , handle a challenger four years his junior ? the champion had , quite arrogantly , barely trained for the fight
his breathing became heavy , amid the sweltering heat , and jess willard grew in confidence
he faked to throw a left to the body and then swung a mighty overhand right that connected perfectly with johnson 's jaw
it was the victory that white american had been waiting for but was all as it seemed ? action from the world heavyweight title fight between johnson and jess willard in havana , cuba in 1915 photographs of the knockout appeared to show johnson shielding his eyes from the sun and he would later claim this was because he had deliberately taken a fall
his motivation , johnson said , was a $ 50,000 payout and a promise from the american authorities that he could finally return to his homeland without having to serve his prison sentence
johnson 's ' confession ' was sold for a fee to fleischer , the respected founder of the ring magazine
but fleischer never believed johnson , while jess willard was bitter about johnson 's claim , especially as the victory was his finest hour
' jess willard confronted johnson over his claims in 1944
jess willard would lose his world title in only his second defence , suffering an awful beating at the hands of jack dempsey before retiring to his farm in kansas
johnson was defeated after enduring 26 rounds in the sweltering cuba heat , compared to ' hell '
