ronaldo left the pitch with a supporter trying to hug him , bale left it knowing that once again the fingers of blame will be pointing at him after his first half miss after diego godin âs slip
on a night when atletico âs defence once again showed why it is one of the toughest to break down in europe all three real forwards were unable to get the better of their rivals
with atletico âs left - back position still bearing a filipe luis - shaped hole , bale attacked at will and he looked for ronaldo with his crosses as the portuguese found himself in centre - forward territory regularly throughout the first 45 minutes
ronaldo is confronted by a supporter at the end of the 0 - 0 draw on tuesday night ronaldo gives the fan a hug after a frustrating night at the vicente calderon for real there seems little doubt the man who is fast approaching real âs all - time goals record will finish his playing days as a central striker and he came into this game with a scoring rate of a goal every 74 minutes and seven goals in his last three matches
ronaldo had hit 15 in his 20 real derbies ; bale had only netted one goal against atletico , but what a goal it was â the strike that won the champions league final
bale misses the best chance of the match early in the first half as jan oblak saves ronaldo is squeezed out by atletico midfielders mario suarez ( left ) and gabi when free - kicks came real âs way they were almost all taken by ronaldo , although bale was allowed to run over one â and in fairness to ronaldo all the set - pieces were awarded on ronaldo âs favoured left - side of the penalty area
