rating : poets house is a swish new hotel in ely , a three - minute walk from the cathedral , offering terrific value
it 's quite a venture - and must have been a huge investment
there are 21 rooms , all with copper standalone baths placed near luxurious double beds
i keep thinking about phil neville , the former england footballer whose home once appeared in hello ! and which forever more is held as the gold standard for unadulterated bling
which is to say that poets house is glossy and lavish , but manages to stay on the right side of kitsch , not least because the finish is so good
state of the art : poets house is as much a sex and the city retreat as a hideaway in genteel ely no , it might not be to all tastes ( there are mirrors everywhere with poetry written on them , such as lines from kipling : ' since my house to thy house no greater can send than thy house but my house , friend comforting friend ' ) and the floors are given over to black - and - white squares with embedded stars
valet parking will sort it at no extra charge
black and white : poets house incorporates smart , clean lines , elegant dÃ©cor and crisp white tablecloths we 're in the zone , sitting on stools at the flashy bar as if auditioning as extras for a sex and the city sequel , and have to pinch ourselves that this is ely
poets house used to be an old people 's home
