the first farmers came to europe 8,000 years ago and spread early agricultural practices , starting in greece
experts from centre for international research in the humanities and social sciences ( cirhus ) in new york city studied neolithic ornaments ( pictured ) to understand how farming spread
these beads are examples of personal ornaments worn by the first europe farming societies â this discovery goes beyond farming , â said rigaud , the study 's lead author and a researcher at the centre for international research in the humanities and social sciences ( cirhus ) in new york city
â it also reveals two different cultural trajectories that took place in europe thousands of years ago , with southern and central regions advancing in many ways and northern regions maintaining their traditions â
to come to their conclusion , the researchers looked at the adoption or rejection of ornamental beads or bracelets worn by different populations in the early neolithic period , which stretched from 8,000 to 5,000 bc. based on discoveries of different types of neolithic ornaments in different parts of europe , they concluded that northern europe in the neolithic period initially rejected the practice of farming , which was otherwise spreading throughout the continent
examples of ornaments worn by europe foraging societies are shown scientists recently discovered that stone - age hunter gatherers in england were trading with continental wheat farmers 8,000 years ago - long before agriculture came to britain
farming is thought to have arrived in britain around 6,000 years ago so experts think that local hunter gatherers bought wheat by trading with europe farmers from as far away as the south of france or the balkans
this means that even 8,000 years ago there must have been trade routes winding their way across the europe continent to britain across an ancient land bridge
dr robin allaby , a plant geneticist at the university of warwick who led the research , said : ' eight thousand years ago the people of mainland britain were leading a hunter - gatherer existence , whilst at the same time in southern europe farming was gradually spreading across europe
