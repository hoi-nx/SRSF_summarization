researchers have discovered that the brain can remember ' neutral ' or boring events more easily when they are tied to an emotion from what we eat to what we see , we constantly take in details about our environment
and while there is no need to remember many of them , our brain has the remarkable ability to store information that seems inconsequential at the time in case it becomes useful later on
given new and relevant information , human beings have the capacity to strengthen weak memories using emotions - and researchers have said this points to the adaptive nature of human memory
psychologists at new york university have been trying to gain an understanding about how the brain stores memories for ' emotionally neutral events ' that gain significance through subsequent experience
' how does the brain store all of this information ? and how does emotion strengthen mundane memories ? ' post-doctoral fellows dunsmoor and murty wrote on the conversation
the researchers said we take for granted that we remember highly emotional events better than we remember neutral events , like a lunch date
emotion increases our ability to remember by affecting activity in brain regions involved in emotional processing - particularly the amygdala and striatum - and also the regions involved in encoding new experiences , like the hippocampus
researchers said we take for granted that we remember highly emotional events , like 9/11 , better than we remember neutral events , like a lunch date
a view over the hudson river towards the september 11th memorial lights is shown a power nap of just 45 minutes can boost memory by five times , research has found
scientists from saarland university in germany , said that during sleep , bursts of brain activity known as sleep spindles play an important role in consolidating newly learned information
dr dunsmoor and dr murty âs research has shown that people have better memory for boring information when it âs presented in an emotional context , regardless of if it is rewarding or negative
â in some of our earlier studies , we found that people selectively remember neutral pictures if the pictures had been associated with an electrical shock the previous day , even when the volunteers were unaware that we would later test their memory , they wrote
â these experiments focus on emotional factors at the time the original memory is created and the findings show how seemingly trivial information associated with a meaningful event can be selectively preserved in memory
strong emotion can strengthen memory for positive events , such as a surprise birthday party ( stock image ) , and for negative events , such as making an embarrassing faux pas at an office party emotion affects activity in brain regions involved in emotional processing - such as the amygdala ( pictured ) and regions involved in encoding new experiences , like the hippocampus ( also marked ) but what happens when the emotional event happens after the original memories were formed ? â in a recent study , we found that an emotional experience can enhance memory for neutral information encountered previously , â the researchers continued
â the negative experience selectively increased memory for related information that was completely trivial when it was originally experienced
