hanging on one 93 - year - old man 's wall at a kentucky nursing home was a photo collage of him and his wife
that sentiment came true this week when , after 73 years of marriage , william ' bill ' doug wilson and his wife lillian died just two minutes apart from each other
both lillian , 89 , and bill were alzheimer 's patients and for the last couple of years had to live in separate nursing homes
after 73 years of marriage , high school sweethearts doug wilson , 93 , and lillian kerr wilson , 89 , passed away just two minutes apart from each other this week but on tuesday their connection proved strong as ever when one of their sons , doug , received a phone call at 3.52am to inform him that his father had passed away
doug said it was his mother 's nursing home , calling with the same sad news
' we all look at it as a blessing , ' doug told the lexington-herald leader , ' because we 're going to have one funeral for both of them
' doug , 66 , believes it will also make it easier for the family to grieve
doug told the lexington-herald leader that his parents ran off to get married and that he does n't believe ' either one of them had the blessings of their parents
' but that did n't stop the couple , who survived a war and a number of relocations through their long marriage
the family , which also included doug 's brothers mike and terry , hopped around the state and country
the couple unsuccessfully tried to open a shopping center in atlanta and then one of bill 's department stores burned down and could n't reopen after they moved back to kentucky
the couple first met in corbin , kentucky and , according to their son doug , ran off and got married without either of their parents ' blessing
they spent their lives supporting and working alongside each other but doug said his parents had a ' driving force ' to make sure their three sons received the college education they never got to have
meanwhile lillian would repaint , wallpaper and do the trim work on the homes while doug did the carpentry work
doug said he regularly drove his mother to see her husband at the veterans center
' friends and family will gather on saturday evening for a ' celebration of life ' service in honor of the devoted couple .
