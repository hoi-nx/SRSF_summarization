but kendall and baylee are no ordinary twins
an amazing quirk of genetics means that one sister has black skin and the other is white
father curtis martin and mother rebecca horton cradle twins kendall ( centre left ) and baylee ( centre right ) who were born with very different skin tones thanks to a rare quirk of genetics miss rebecca horton , 28 , is white , while mr curtis martin , 24 , is half jamaican
their twins ' skin contrast is possible because the girls are non-identical , though it is still highly unlikely the effect is so striking that even their own father has said it is hard to believe that they are related
and their mother , rebecca horton , said : â when they were born , we kept staring at both of them â we could nât believe it
â the little girls â contrasting looks can be traced back to their parents
mr curtis martin says that the couple do get looks when they are out in public with the girls , and admits that if he saw somebody with them , he would struggle to believe they were related the girls also have very different personalities , as well as different skin tones
kedall ( left ) is very relaxed and likes to sleep a lot , but baylee ( right ) cries a lot and demands lots of attention but , in odds of a million to one , baylee has inherited a set of genes for white skin
and kendall âs genetic inheritance includes some genes that code for black skin , passed on from her mixed - race father
the pair say that since having twins they have forgotten what it feels like to have a good night 's sleep , but say they would n't have it any other way in contrast , baylee , who was slightly heavier at 6lb 5oz , is â loud and needy â and loves attention
â mr curtis martin , a 24 - year - old builder from kingswinford in the west midlands , told the sun : â everybody loves them
â the couple , who also have a five - year - old son called coby , knew from quite early on in the pregnancy that rebecca horton was having twins
professor pacey said the girls â contrasting skin colours are caused by the way their parents â genes were shuffled before being passed on
the first method leads to monozygotic , or identical twins , who share the same set of dna , and so will be the same sex and largely share the same physical characteristics
the second method will create dizygotic , or non-identical twins , who do not share the same genetic material and can therefore be born as different genders and with different physical characteristics
kendall and baylee are dizygotic twins , which explains their contrasting skin tone , though having twins with such a drastic difference in colour is still extremely rare
