the leaders of places with names like molossia , westarctica , vikesland and broslavia are coming together at the anaheim central library for microcon 2015 , which has been dubbed the first north american gathering of micronations
these self - proclaimed countries print their own stamps , wave their own flags and mint their own money
many do n't even live on the land at all
molossia can be found in reno , northern nevada
at 1.3 acres , the country is the size of a football field
only baugh and his wife and children live in molossia , although it has 27 citizens , as well as its own passports , railroad , phone system , bank , post office and general store

westarctica will be giving a talk at microcon called ' micronations that matter ' , to encourage more micronations to become nonprofits ' when you come to visit you see as much as possible a functioning nation , ' said baugh
westarctica , the grand duke of westarctica , will also be in attendance at microcon
westarctica is a much larger nation than molossia , with more than 620,000 square miles in antarctic to its name
none of the nation 's 300 citizens live on the frozen land
westarctica , also a recruiting coordinator in a los angeles media company , said he was ' really inspired ' when he found out there was a piece of antarctic that had never been claimed
but westarctica is not just an empty country
westarctica will give a talk at microcon called ' micronations that matter , ' which he hopes will encourage other leaders to use their countries for a good cause
molossia pays taxes to the united states but likes to think of that as foreign aid
grand duchy of westarctica one of the world 's largest micronations , it encompasses 620,000 square miles of the antarctic , but nobody actually lives there
westarctica says he would like to eventually make westarctica a real country
the vikesland located adjacent to picturesque riding mountain national park in manitoba , canada , it was founded in 2005 by christopher barry joseph beyette , a tv newsman who prefers to be called king christopher i. the king says his fascination with micronationalism led him to create the country
