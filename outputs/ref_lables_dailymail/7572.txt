he has been painted by history as a wicked hunchback , but richard iii kept the disease that curved his spine secret through out his life , a historian has claimed
but research on the king 's skeleton discovered under a council car park in leicester revealed that this may have been an exaggeration of a spine deformity known as scoliosis
dr lund , from the leicester 's school of english , said tailoring and specially fitted armour probably helped to disguise the curve in his spine
but scans of the king 's skeleton show he was n't a hunchback , but only had a slight deformity that would have barely affected his appearance or prowess on the field of battle
' writing in the journal medical humanities , dr lund argues that like other monarchs richard iii 's body image would have been carefully controlled
dr lund said that it was this treatment that later led to his reputation as a hunchback - something that was later picked up by william shakespeare
dr lund said : ' stage history has reincarnated richard iii as monster , villain and clown , but recent events have helped us to re-evaluate these physically defined depictions and strip back the cultural accretions that have surrounded his body
this reconstruction of richard iii , based on his skull , has revealed what the king looked like 500 years ago scientists studying the skull of richard iii ( above ) found he had suffered several brutal blows before he died scientists used 3d scanning to reconstruct how richard iii 's ( right ) skeleton may have been deformed ( left ) ' the care he in all probability received for his scoliosis from his surgically trained physician was large in scale : traction and manual manipulation needed specially designed equipment , space and assistants
' yet , it may have been only a relatively small group of people in richard iii 's trusted circle who knew of his condition
' what is certain is that , after his death , the exposure of richard iii 's body went beyond the two days of its exhibition in leicester
the skeleton of richard iii , with the curve in his spine clearly visible , was found under a car park in leicester ' when william shakespeare 's richard iii boasts of his shape - changing potential , he registers too the bending course of history and myth making
' analysis of richard iii 's skeleton , which was discovered buried in a shallow grave at the site of grey friars abbey in leicester in 2012 , showed that many depictions of the king 's appearance had been exaggerated
however , there are some that point to the alleged murder of richard iii 's nephews edward v and richard of shrewsbury - the so called princes in the tower - as evidence of the king 's character
genetic analysis of the battle scarred skeleton , discovered under a council car park in leicester three years ago , has confirmed that it did belong to richard iii scientists studying the remains believe the king was surrounded by a mob of enemy soldiers and hacked to death after he had lost his helmet
