a woman 's noisy neighbour has issued a withering reply to her hand - written letter complaining about his hard - partying ways , claiming only the deaf and ' those buried in the cemetery ' would have any concerns with the noise coming for his home
the man 's sarcastic response comes after melbourne - based actor , lucy gransbury , wrote a two - page rant claiming her neighbours were keeping her awake at night
lucy gransbury thought the good - humoured note worked wonders after an entire week of uninterrupted sleep until she was woken again just before dawn the following sunday
so she followed up by dropping a thank - you card and some gifts over the fence to the seven or eight men who lived there because she was ' too scared ' to knock on their door
but after a month of not hearing back from any of her boisterous neighbours , witehira posted an equally cheeky reply on his facebook page opening with ' my dearest lucy gransbury '
' there 's probably people out there that think your crazy for what you done but not me i thought you were brave and i respect you for it , ' he went on to say
' lucy gransbury dropped a thank you letter and gifts over the fence to her neighbours because she was too scared to knock on their door after they had been quiet for an entire week the good - humoured letter asks the seven or eight burly blokes not to throw a hand grenade over her fence although a week after her first letter the neighbours woke her at 4.30am when they arrived home , and again at 6.45am when their mates left , lucy gransbury decided after writing a list of pros and cons that the mostly - reformed dudes , who she fears could crush her ' between their shoulder blades ' as ' they seem to be a gang ' , deserved to be rewarded
the note , which was posted on her blog and on the mamamia site , began with thanking the less - noisy neighbours for a quieter week and although their voices woke her on sunday she was grateful there was n't the ' bass guitar song ' interrupting her dreams about prince harry
last but certainly not least - gransbury threw in some salt and vinegar chips because she wanted to share her favourite things with her dear neighbours
she signed off by saying she hoped they got a giggle out of her note instead of being insulted and throwing a hand grenade over her fence
one of the gifts was two cans and string so they could she can create her ' own old - school walkie - talkie ' with her neighbours - and she chose chickpeas so they could also whip up some hummus for their next party after she was woken by their voices on sunday morning , she wrote pros and cons about the incident - derpa is in reference to the man she used to regularly hear who sounded like he was constantly yelling ' derpa " gransbury took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the first lengthy and hilarious handwritten letter over their adjoining back fence before running off in hysterics
she posted the letter on her blog with the precursor : ' so if you never hear from me again , i 've been kidnapped and forcibly trapped in my neighbours ' sound system
lucy gransbury wrote a lengthy and quite hilarious handwritten letter to her noisy neighbours after enduring four months of sleepless nights due to their incessantly wild nocturnal ways the actor / comedian used her humour in the two - page rant to get her rage across to the party - hard residents who live next door and cause her never - ending grief lucy gransbury even took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the note over their adjoining fence before running off in hysterics she then went onto say that she had been living for the past four months next to the culprits and was woken up by them ' all the funking time '
adding that the night before she wrote the letter when was woken at 4.30am was an uncivilised time that should only be reserved for ' breakfast radio hosts , international flight passengers , and parents of infants
' lucy gransbury said she wanted to yell out to them at 5am but would n't have been heard over the revving of their friend 's engine of their ' sh * thouse fancy ute
the music was finally turned down at 6am - just two hours before gransbury had to go out and begin her day
' she also gave her neighbours two gifts - a pair of headphones and a cd she compiled herself with apt songs but then revealed that the cd was actually blank because she was ' too funking tired ' to burn the songs lucy gransbury said she bought this card because ' shut the f * * k up ' was not available in a large size as the considerate neighbour , lucy gransbury gave her next door pals two gifts - a pair of headphones and a cd she compiled herself with the apt songs : respect by aretha franklin , ' wake me up ' by avicii , ' all about the bass ' by meghan trainor , ' stop right now ' by the spice girls and uptown funk ' by bruno mars ' because it 's just a funkin ' good song , really '
' lucy gransbury also warned them that she would call the police if there was a next time
