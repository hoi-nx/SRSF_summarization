newcastle keeper krul congratulated black cats striker jermain defoe on his goal at half - time moore 's famous hug with pele in 1970 is often held up as the peak of sportsmanship and so the stadium of light on sunday afternoon
krul and jermain defoe are lesser stars than moore and pele , of course , and the newcastle goalkeeper âs instinctively friendly gesture towards the man who had just scored a brilliant goal past him took place with 45 minutes yet to play
but was it really so different to that celebrated business in guadalajara , mexico , for which we do nât only continue to congratulate the england colossus and the brazilian legend for their integrity and values , but also ourselves , somehow , for knowing and loving the game when it still had a place for common decency ? sportsmail âs jamie carragher , among many others , has lambasted krul for an inappropriate show of brotherhood towards a fellow professional
the implication is that , as he walked off the pitch at half - time , he should have been so lost in his own despair , or anger , or disappointment , or fierce resolve to get back on terms , that if he âd noticed jermain defoe at all , the only acceptable form of communication should have been a muttered oath , or at best a hard stare
krul smiles at jermain defoe shortly after the striker 's goal gave the black cats the lead in the wear-tyne derby sportsmail 's jamie carragher criticised krul for his half - time actions while speaking on sky sports any form of friendliness could at the very least have waited until after the game was over , they reckon
has football really become so leeched of humanity that one decent pro ca nât turn to another and say â well played â ? nobody thinks that krul would have complimented his opponent had it been a scuffed shot through his legs from two yards
jermain defoe ( left ) hit a stunning volley on the cusp of half - time to give black cats the lead against newcastle jermain defoe celebrates his strike which helped the black cats to victory in the wear-tyne derby others insist otherwise , saying only someone with â no passion â for football could commend krul for doing what he did
newcastle came up short against their rivals yet again , but krul 's gesture was not the problem jermain defoe 's strike was a goal worthy of winning any game , and congratulating him was the decent thing to do but that âs rubbish , too
and yet , let âs be brutally honest , would the condemnation have been quite so swift and quite so loud if the boot had been on the other foot on sunday , if it had been jermain defoe walking down the tunnel at half - time slapping krul on the back for denying him seconds earlier with a truly breathtaking , world - class save ? in fact , would there have been any condemnation at all ? or would it have been held up as a heart - warming example , even in the intense heat of competition , of a typically honest english footballer doing the decent thing ?
