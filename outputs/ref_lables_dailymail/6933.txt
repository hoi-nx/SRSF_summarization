prague âs international airport has been forced to hire porters to carry passengers â luggage up 32 stairs because a multi-million pound construction project did nât budget for an escalator
a new metro line extension opened this week in the czech capital â transporting travellers closer to the airport than ever before â but the point where passengers transfer from trains to buses does nât have a moving staircase
â without a direct train connection , the no 119 bus takes passengers on the final five miles between prague airport and the nearest metro station
the 20billion koruna ( Â£ 527million , $ 787million ) metro extension , planned by the prague public transport company , was supposed to transform nadrazi veleslavin station into a transport hub for the airport , with passengers transferring to trains , not buses
travellers can use a lift , but they are forced to cross a busy road to access the bus terminal but the project is unfinished and the escalator that was constructed connects with an unbuilt train station
â an escalator was built for airport customers but it connects the metro station and an unbuilt train station the new extension allows passengers to travel between central prague and the airport in 30 minutes , including the bus ride
