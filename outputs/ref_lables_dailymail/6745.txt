hidden along a dusty dirt track across several miles of scenic hills , it was formerly home to a post office , a grocery store and even a school house
but now , evansville in comanche county , kansas , is a shadow of its former self , with its once - thriving commissary building in a state of disrepair
however , the ghost town is still home to two final residents , who tend to the site 's numerous cattle - rancher larry ' dee ' scherich and his wife , phyllis
the couple , who live in a house just north of the historic commissary building , do not have to worry about unexpected visitors , nor noisy neighbors
instead , they encounter only hired workers in the town , which previously housed the headquarters of the largest cattle ranch in kansas 's history
