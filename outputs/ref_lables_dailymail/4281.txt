the image , together with data collected by nasa , suggests these structures only have three million years left before they fade away - a relatively short time in cosmic terms
the nebula and its associated objects are located about 7000 light - years away in the constellation of serpens ( the serpent )
located in the eagle nebula , messier 16 , researchers used the muse instrument on eso 's vlt ( vlt ) create the 3d view
by measuring the pillars of creation 's rate of evaporation , muse has given astronomers a time frame for when the pillars will be no more
they shed about 70 times the mass of the sun every million years or so
based on the their present mass of about 200 times that of the sun , the pillars of creation have an expected lifetime of perhaps three million more years
' this view shows how the muse instrument on eso 's vlt has created a three - dimensional view of the iconic pillars of creation in the star - forming region eagle nebula
' since then , these billowing clouds , which extend over a few light - years , have awed scientists and the public alike
the nebula and its associated objects are located about 7000 light - years away in the constellation of serpens ( the serpent )
eso 's muse instrument on the vlt has now helped illustrate the ongoing evaporation of the pillars of creation in unprecedented detail , revealing their orientation
this tip is bearing the brunt of the radiation from eagle nebula 's stars , and as a result looks brighter to our eyes than the bottom left , middle and right pillars , whose tips are all pointed away from our view
