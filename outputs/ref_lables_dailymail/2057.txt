trott has admitted that he thought his england career was over after he reached ' breaking point ' in brisbane and was forced to quit the last ashes tour
trott was forced to head home to an uncertain future after his ordeal at the hands of mitchell johnson in the first test but has battled back to be on the brink of making his 50th test appearance against west indies on monday
' to be brutally honest i did n't know if i 'd be able to come back here and i did n't know if i was going to be selected but i had to get my head down and push my case forward and that 's all i could do
i 'm really glad to be here , ' said a relaxed trott before england headed to antigua on friday
trott is set to make his 50th test appearance for england against the west indies on monday ' there 's excitement
it 's something i wanted again but i did n't know if things would go my way again and i 'd have this opportunity
i 'm very pleased and happy to be here
there 's a good bunch of guys here but on a personal note this is just the start of something i want to keep doing and earn my place back
' trott looks certain to adopt a new role as opener alongside alastair cook at the start of a series england can not afford to lose after battling back in county cricket with warwickshire and then as captain of the lions
' that 's all i 've done so far
i went back to warwickshire and earned my place in their side and then went on a lions tour and i think i had to do that for myself and for everyone around me
the team 's changed a bit so there are guys i have n't played with and a few guys i played on the lions tour with which is great
it was nice to go on that tour and see the players coming through there
' trott leaves the field following his dismissal during a warm - up match in st kitts on thursday trott believes that his brisbane breakdown was the culmination of problems that were eventually successfully diagnosed as situational anxiety when he began working with renowned sports psychologist steve peters
it was andy who said in brisbane that trott had suffered from a ' stress related ' condition for the bulk of his career
trott plays a shot during england 's game against a nevis invitational xi on monday ' cricket is virtually 12 months a year so if something builds up and is not kept in check it can overtake everything
' yes it 's okay , ' trott explained
it 's always nice to bat with alastair cook if i get the opportunity and he will be a familiar face if i go out there with him
trott looks sure to open with alastair cook ( left ) in the first test against west indies in antigua on monday then i had to go on the lions tour
' trott believes his issues came from putting too high expectations on himself
i set myself unrealistically high expectations that i could n't achieve
trott is set for his first test appearance since his ashes turmoil against mitchell johnson 18 months ago ' i would n't say my expectations have changed
this game and the amount of time you spend on it can be all - encompassing so it 's good to have a balanced view and i 'm a big believer in that now
' trott is adamant that his selection here does not represent a gamble for england
' and he has no qualms about facing australia and a certain mitchell johnson again this summer
and trott has been smiling ever since he arrived here in the caribbean .
