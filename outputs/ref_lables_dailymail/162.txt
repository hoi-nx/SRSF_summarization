britain 's biggest purpose - built air raid shelter , which could hold 6,500 people , was so sophisticated it even had electric lighting and flush toilets
the tunnels were dug into sandstone cliffs along the river mersey in stockport in the 1930s , and were originally intended to provide car parking spaces
but following the outbreak of the second world war , the space was redeveloped as an air raid shelter where residents of lancashire and cheshire could hide from nazi bombs
an engineering survey showed that the space was in fact unable to become a car park - but the advent of war meant that it was needed as an air raid shelter

history : a photograph of the shelter as it appeared in the 1930s , around the time of the second world war 's outbreak rambling : the tunnels were large enough to fit in 6,500 people , who came from all around lancashire , cheshire and manchester emergency : local councils had to establish air raid shelters to protect their populations from german bomb attacks base : the room belonging to the shelter 's warden , who would have been responsible for ensuring the safety of those inside danger : a fire bucket and hose which could have been used to control any unexpected blazes in the tunnels ' people are always surprised by the extent of them , and just how much thought and planning went into them
