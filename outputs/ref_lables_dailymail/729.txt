white blood cells are the important infection - fighting part of the immune system , made in your bone marrow
patients with leukaemia produce an abnormal number of immature white blood cells which ' clog up ' their bone marrow
this stops bone marrow making other blood cells , which are vital for a balanced immune system and healthy blood
common treatments for leukaemia include chemotherapy , radiotherapy or a bone marrow transplant
miss laura cant added : ' we have been told it is the first wedding that anybody can remember at the hospital chapel
' mr jordan had planned the proposal during one of his girlfriend 's daily visits to the hospital
' mr jordan , who has had a two - year battle with cancer , wrote on facebook after proposing : ' i âm so proud to call you my fiance laura
the couple were in the same school year at paignton community college but only started a relationship last year ' i went in one day and they had a collection bucket for jordan who was ill in hospital
' miss laura cant was so concerned she decided to make the 120 mile journey to jordan âs hospital in bristol to surprise him
