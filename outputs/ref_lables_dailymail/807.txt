egyptians 's former president morsi has been sentenced to 20 years for ordering the arrest and torture of protesters in 2012
but a court in the country 's capital cairo acquitted the 63 - year - old leader of charges that would have seen him face the death penalty
fourteen others were convicted on the same charges , with most also sentenced to 20 years in jail
defence lawyers said they would launch an appeal against the convictions
other muslim brotherhood leaders have been sentenced to death and tuesday 's decision to acquit morsi on the incitement to murder charge was unexpected
we were expecting life in prison , but then 20 years is not very different , ' he said
hundreds of morsi supporters have been sentenced to death in speedy mass trials which the united nations has called ' unprecedented in recent history '
earlier this month , a cairo court confirmed death sentences for muslim brotherhood leader mohamed badie and 13 others over protest violence
' morsi is facing two other trials in which he could face the death penalty , including one that sees him accused of spying for foreign powers
in november , a court dropped murder charges against mubarak in his own trial over the deaths of hundreds of protesters in 2011 .
