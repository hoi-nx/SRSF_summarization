my hazy memories of similar family holidays as a child were of slow days spent on pine - scented campsites , punctuated by trips to sun - soaked beaches
our journey to argeles-sur-mer on france âs mediterranean coast went without a hitch , despite being in the minority of travellers flying , then hiring a car , rather than driving all the way
chris greenwood stayed at camping la chappelle with his wife , catherine , and children , joe and anna families congregated around the pools every afternoon for relief from the august heat it was at this point i discovered that we did nât have any hot water and the baby bath had a big hole in the bottom and no plug
the children spent plenty of time in the pool , playing with the many new friends they made joe wears oversized sunglasses while relaxing by the pool at camping la chappelle in argeles-sur-mer instead over the next 10 days we threw ourselves at the mercy of campsite life , simply taking the path of least resistance
with hindsight , we should , of course , on that first night have just thrown the children into bed â dirt and all â and gone swimming first thing
things have come on a long way since i was a foot shorter and my family holidayed every year in tents across the south - west of france
the greenwood family made several trips to the pleasant argeles-sur-mer beach with its mountain backdrop multiple swimming pools , a kids club , swings and a bakery kept the greenwoods busy during their stay lugging jerry cans of water back to our tent with its zip - up compartments and constant procession of ants had its charm , but so does double - glazing , a fully - fitted kitchen and air conditioning
camping la chapelle 's biggest selling point is a fantastic swimming pool complex , including two water slides eurocamp offer sites for all types and tastes , and camping la chapelle is probably quite typical of a modern france campsite
in la chapelle âs case , the biggest selling point is the fantastic swimming pool complex , including two water slides
there is even a heated pool with a retractable roof , under which we spent a memorable afternoon sheltering from a thunderstorm that rolled in from the pyrenees
joe and anne , pictured with dad chris greenwood , enjoyed the kids club , run by a team of dedicated workers families congregated around the pools every afternoon for relief from the august heat and anna became an almost permanent fixture in the water , playing with the many new friends she âd made on the site
chris greenwood and catherine get into the spirit at camping la chappelle 's campsite ' olympics ' for children anna enjoyed games , crafts and an x-factor - style talent show as the club proved a hub for families staying with keycamp and its sister company eurocamp
we did venture off site most mornings , making the 10 - minute walk to the pleasant argeles-sur-mer beach with its mountain backdrop and host of accessible cafes , bars and a mini-supermarket
when the greenwoods were n't in the pool they spent time on the beach in the stunning port of collioure a little further afield was the stunning port of collioure , once a magnet for artists including henri matisse and pablo picasso
it really is a picture postcard place , with a little bay and beach perfect for swimming , surrounded by traditional france cafes , restaurants and arts and crafts boutiques
chris greenwood and his family stayed at camping la chapelle , argeles-sur-mer , for 10 nights with keycamp ( www.eurocamp.co.uk or 0844 406 0319 ) , which now operates under the eurocamp banner
chris greenwood hired a car with europcar , which cost around Â£ 250 for 10 days , including two child seats and unlimited mileage .
