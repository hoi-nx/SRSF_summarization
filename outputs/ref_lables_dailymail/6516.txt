giant glaciers of ice may be lurking all over mars , hidden from view by dust on the surface
it means that , if all ice were to be spread across the surface of mars , the entire planet would be covered in more than 3.3ft ( one metre )
this image from nasa 's mars reconnaissance orbiter shows that a thick layer of dust on mars covers the glaciers , so they appear as the surface of the ground , but radar measurements show that there are glaciers composed of frozen water underneath the dust the latest research was carried out by scientists at the niels bohr institute at the university of copenhagen and published in the journal geophysical research letters
mars is currently in the middle of an ice age , so liquid water can not exist on its surface at the present time
images from several mars satellites had revealed the shape of glaciers just below the surface , and confirmed most were made of water - ice
in total there is more than 150 billion cubic metres of ice on mars , which could â cover the entire surface of mars with 1.1 metres of ice , â explained dr nanna bjã¸rnholt karlsson at the centre for ice and climate at the niels bohr institute
she added that the ice closer to the mars equator was â an important part of mars â water reservoir
they are located on mars between latitude 30.0 and 50.0 - equivalent to just south of danish âs location on earth
mars has belts of glaciers at its central latitudes - between the blue lines , in both the southern and northern hemispheres
a thick layer of dust covers the glaciers , so they appear as the surface of the ground , but radar measurements show that there are glaciers composed of frozen water underneath the dust using radar measurements ( shown ) from nasa 's mars reconnaissance orbiter , researchers have been able to identify thousands of glacier - like formations on mars
if the ice were unprotected , it would evaporate and become water vapour , owing to the low atmospheric pressure on mars
