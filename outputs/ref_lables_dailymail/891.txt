jerusalem is a city that conjures up a sense of the holy , the historical and heavenly
the biblical city has been a magnet for pilgrims devoted to several of the world 's faiths and religions , notably jews , christians and muslims
millions flock to the ancient , religious city every year
but for a small percentage , their excitement induced by their close proximity to holy landmarks invokes a rare condition known as jerusalem syndrome
first identified in 2000 , psychologists noted religious pilgrims overcome with excitement at being in close proximity to the city 's holy places believed they were bible characters
and sufferers are often consumed by a need to be clean , before donning a toga - like gown often made from hotel bed linen
jerusalem syndrome affects people visiting the holy city
it is characterised by seven stages , including anxiety , the need to be clean and performing sermons the next stage sees sufferers overcome by the need to scream , or sing out loud psalms , verses from the bible , religious hymns or spirituals
a procession or march to one of the city 's holy places , is then finally followed by the delivery of a ' sermon '
the condition , which was first reported in 2000 , often affects people with no history of mental health problems , livescience reports
however , in many other cases , experts believe the condition is likely part of a broader psychosis , that is not unique to jerusalem
a study , published in the british journal of psychiatry , noted that since 1980 , jerusalem 's psychiatrists had encountered an ever - increasing number of tourists who , upon arriving in the city ' suffer psychotic decompensation '
a study published in the british journal of psychology identified seven sequential stages of jerusalem syndrome : 1
preparation , often with the aid of hotel bed linen , of a long , ankle - length , togalike gown , which is always white
the need to scream , shout , or sing out loud psalms , verses from the bible , religious hymns or spirituals
a procession or march to one of jerusalem 's holy places
delivery of a â sermon â in a holy place
as a result of noting ' the consistently high incidence of this phenomenon ' , a decision was taken to channel all cases to one central facility - the kfar shaul mental health centre
he visited israel because he was compelled to move one of the giant stone blocks forming the western ( wailing ) wall , pictured , which , in his opinion , was not in the right place and the third type of patient , identified in the study , were those with no history of mental illness , but who experienced a psychotic episode while in the city
dr alan manevitz , of new york 's lenox hill hospital , told livescience he believes the condition may happen when a person who is at risk of psychosis experiences the stress of travelling to another country
