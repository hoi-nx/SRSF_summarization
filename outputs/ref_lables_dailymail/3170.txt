other members of the supremely dysfunctional family became embroiled in decades long lawsuits and divorces , always over money
even andrew getty âs father , j. paul getty , a supposedly squeaky - clean married philanthropist and classical composer , was mired in scandal when it emerged he had a secret second family
in this latest tragedy , police say a woman called them to andrew getty âs home on tuesday , saying that the horror movie buff had suffered a heart attack

now , with another troubled getty life cut short , his family would no doubt agree the money that brought them such luxury has also brought seemingly endless misery
