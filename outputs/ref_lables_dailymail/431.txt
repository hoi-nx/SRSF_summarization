taken over five years , the footage includes plasma raining down on the sun , an extreme solar eruption and even a comet breezing through the sun âs atmosphere
it was made by stitching together footage from nasa 's solar dynamics observatory over five years the movie , called sun , was created by filmmaker michael kã¶nig from cologne , germany
transits of the moon , venus and earth across the sun , as observed from the solar dynamics observatory , are also seen , while towards the end of the video comet lovejoy can be seen passing the sun in december 2011
another incredible part of the video shows â coronal rain â streaming down onto the sun from a loop of material above the sun âs surface
coronal rain is formed when hot plasma in the corona - the sun âs atmosphere - cools and condenses in strong magnetic fields
nasa 's solar dynamics observatory ( solar dynamics observatory ) , illustrated below , was launched on 11 february 2010 and has observed the sun ever since
solar dynamics observatory also measures fluctuations in the sun 's extreme ultraviolet output , which provides the majority of energy for heating earth 's upper atmosphere

coronal rain is formed when hot plasma in the corona - the sun âs atmosphere - condenses and falls back to the surface elsewhere , solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are seen erupting on the sun âs surface , sending out huge amounts of energy
