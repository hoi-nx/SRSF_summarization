black boxes play a vital role in revealing what happened in the final moments of doomed flights , but not many people know what they actually look like
photographer jeffrey milstein has shot a fascinating project documenting black boxes , shedding light on what happens to the devices after tragic crashes
despite the name , the boxes are usually red to help rescuers spot them among the wreckage of crashed planes and helicopters
after disaster strikes , there is an immediate attempt to cover the black box - as seen in recent tragedies such as germanwings flight 4u 9525
the boxes , which record flight data and conversations between pilots , are incredibly important for discovering what led to a plane 's crash , as evidenced by the continuing search for malaysian airlines flight mh370 and its flight recorders in the indian ocean
photographer mr jeffrey milstein , from new york , said the boxes were the only way to piece together the cause of a disaster
mr jeffrey milstein 's ( pictured ) work saw him gain access to air safety storage facilities where data recorders end up following an incident remarkable : the fascinating photographs document black boxes , and parts of boxes , that have been recovered from aircraft accidents mr jeffrey milstein said he became interested in black boxes after being asked to take photographs of one after a helicopter crash in ottawa , canada after disaster strikes , there is an immediate attempt to cover the black box - as seen in recent tragedies such as germanwings flight 4u 9525 black boxes have developed throughout the years , becoming stronger to ensure they survive even the most devastating impacts ' while everyone has heard of the black box , few people have seen one
these photographs document black boxes , and parts of boxes , that have been recovered from aircraft accidents , ' he said
' some of the earliest boxes used wire , metal foil , or continuous magnetic tape for recording
' mr jeffrey milstein said he became interested in black boxes after being asked to take photographs of one after a helicopter crash in ottawa , canada
older models of black boxes relied on tape and magnetic wire , eventually progressing to tape following technological advances mr jeffrey milstein carried out his research in australia as the authorities in the us would not allow him to view wreckage there black boxes record flight data as well as conversations in the cockpit of planes , providing an insight into the final moments on board aircraft ' when back in the us i contacted our transportation safety board ( tsb ) but they would not allow photographs
apparently many tsbs return black boxes to the airlines
