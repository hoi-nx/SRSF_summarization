it was the most hi - tech road trip ever attempted
delphi has completed the longest automated drive in the us , travelling from san francisco to new york city in the first coast - to - coast trip ever attempted by an automated vehicle
the drive was used by delphi engineers to research and collect information that will help further advance active safety technology â the most rapidly growing technology sector of the auto industry
the firm also wants to test and demonstrate its active safety systems , which are being developed with such suppliers as mobileye nv , an israeli maker of computer vision and collision avoidance systems , and software provider ottomatika , a spinout from carnegie mellon university 's self - driving car program
delphi 's demonstration underscores growing interest and investments by automakers and suppliers in self - driving cars , some of which could be production - ready by 2020
jeff owens , delphi 's chief technology officer , sees the automated driver assistance systems in the audi as building blocks on the road to fully self - driving cars in the next decade
the delphi drivebegan march 22 near san francisco 's golden gate bridge , with plans to wind up in new york city just before the annual auto show opens there on april 3
although automakers and suppliers will have such capability within the next five years , owens said , ' our view is that the driver is going to be in the seat for a long time ' in case of emergency situations that self - driving systems may not be equipped or programmed to handle
fully automated systems that may be phased in after 2020 could add about $ 5,000 to the cost of a car , estimates glen de vos , vice president of advanced and product engineering for delphi 's electronics and safety division
delphi is providing some of the components and technology , including vehicle - to - vehicle connectivity , for gm 's super cruise automated driving system , which will debut in 2016 on the new cadillac ct6 sedan
' now it 's time to put our vehicle to the ultimate test by broadening the range of driving conditions
