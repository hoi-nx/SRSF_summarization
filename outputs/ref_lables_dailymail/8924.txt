a connecticut judge spared today a father from prison time in the death of the young son he left in a car on a hot day , saying the man had suffered enough
seitz , 37 , of ridgefield , received two years of conditional release , a sentence similar to probation , at the hearing in danbury superior court after his lawyer read aloud a letter written by his wife asking the judge for leniency on his behalf
authorities say seitz forgot to take his 15 - month - old son , benjamin , to day care on the morning of july 7 , 2014 , and left him in the car for seven hours while he went to work
co-workers at owl computer technologies said seitz spent the day working as usual , even making a trip in the car to a sandwich shop , not realizing benjamin was still buckled up in the backseat , according to the arrest warrant
it was not until seitz drove to his son 's day care at the end of the work day to pick him up that he realized ben was dead in the back of his jeep cherokee
