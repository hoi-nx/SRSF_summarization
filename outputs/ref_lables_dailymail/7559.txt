the european union will today accuse google of illegally abusing its supremacy on the internet search market
brussels will say that google has used its massive dominance as a search engine to divert internet users from rivals to its own services , which include youtube and the google+ social network
in one of the most high - profile competition cases of recent years , europe could fine google more than Â£ 4 billion amid a wave of political opposition in europe to the perceived dominance of american tech companies
google currently boasts a 90 per cent share in europe 's search engine market
the european union will accuse google of illegally abusing its supremacy on the internet search market but the ruling - the result of a five - year investigation into the american search giant â means google may ultimately have to change its business model and pay multi-billion pound fines to brussels
vestager , the european union 's competition commissioner , will today serve google with a formal charge sheet after charges are issued , google will have ten weeks to reply to brussels , according to the financial times
vestager , europe 's competition boss who was the inspiration for the hit danish political drama series borgen , took over the job in november and vowed to take google on
insiders claim the case could prove just as costly as the european union 's decade - long battle with microsoft , which ultimately cost the company Â£ 1.6 billion in fines
if google fails to rebut any formal charges imposed by brussels , the commission could impose a huge fine which could exceed Â£ 4 billion - about 10 per cent of google 's most recent annual revenue
the move will stop short of previous threats that the european union executive could consider breaking up google to separate its business from the search engine
the search engine is far more dominant in europe than it is in the american â where rivals like microsoft 's bing enjoy a share of the market
they have previously called on the europe regulator to force the american search engine to stop blocking competition in areas like online maps , shopping and travel services
and in france , lawyers have this week called on google to reveal its secret formula for ranking websites â but google argues such transparency would expose its business secrets to rivals and leave the search engine vulnerable to spam
