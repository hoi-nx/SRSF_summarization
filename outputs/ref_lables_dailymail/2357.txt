it has evolved a so - called lip - a large and irregular modified petal , to attract insects - but the driving force behind this unusual shape was not known , until now
researchers have found that its shape is determined by two competing groups of proteins and by tweaking them , they can convert this lip into a standard petal
the orchid ( an example of which is pictured ) has evolved a so - called lip - a large and irregular modified petal , to attract insects - but the driving force behind this unusual shape was not known , until now the study , published in the journal nature plants , extends scientists ' understanding of the mechanisms leading to the diverse beauty of orchid flowers
there are between 21,950 and 26,049 accepted species of orchid , most of which have a large and irregular modified petal , called the lip , in addition to three ' normal ' petals
researchers have found its shape is determined by two competing groups of proteins
they converted lips into petals in two orchid species by reducing the activity of the l complex using gene silencing ( illustrated ) conversion of lips into sepal / petal - like structures in oncidium and phalaenopsis orchids is shown orchids have three sepals , which sometimes look like other petals , and a single column at the centre
to discover why the flowers developed their distinctive lips , researchers from national chung hsing university in taiwan studied the expression of a class of genes known to be associated with petal development
they found that in mature orchid flowers , the expression pattern suggests two protein complexes , called the ' l ' complex and the ' sp ' complex , compete to promote the formation of the lip and standard petals
the experts were also able to convert lips into petals in two orchid species by reducing the activity of the l complex using gene silencing

the experts were also able to convert lips into petals in two orchid species by reducing the activity of the l complex using gene silencing
they found that in mature orchid flowers , two protein complexes , called the ' l ' complex ( red ) and the ' sp ' complex ( blue ) , compete to form the lip and petals
it was popularly thought that the insect , whose legs are flattened and heart - shaped to resemble petals , simply mimics an orchid , allowing it to ' hide ' and catch prey
first , his team tested whether mantises actually camouflage among flowers , or , alternatively , attract insects on their own
