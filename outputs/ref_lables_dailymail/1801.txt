a group of technologically - challenged senior citizens are left completely and utterly befuddled by popular messaging app snapchat after attempting to use it for the first time , in order to send the perfect selfie
in the latest video from the elders react series on thefinebros youtube channel , the clueless men and women are given their first introduction to snapchat with hilarious - and mixed â results , all of which are caught on camera
and while many of them say they understand the appeal of the social media app , which allows users to share photos that will disappear within 10 seconds , they still ca n't really wrap their heads around the point of it
' i 'm not into all this , ' a woman named darlene says of that app. ' this is yet another play on this " tweet " thing that 's happening
' i just found out about yelp , ' darlene says with exacerbation
but before the group can start sending pictures , they are given cell phones so they can learn how to snap their own selfies - which proves to be an almost - insurmountable task in itself
feeling nostalgic : liz ca n't wrap her head around the idea that the photos on snapchat disappear
' would n't you want to save it ? ' she asks ' oh god that is a gross selfie , ' yehuda , father of the fine brothers , the creators of the channel , exclaims , while catherine asks : ' can i have a better picture ? that is an awful picture
' they soon move on to captioning their own photos , which presents its own set of issues , as the seniors struggle with typing their messages
most of the elders enjoy using this snapchat feature meanwhile , johnny has no idea that snapchat is reportedly worth $ 19 billion
the revelation that snapchat is considered disposable social media because their photos will soon disappear soon leaves the group divided
no thank you : darline ( pictured ) is completely unimpressed with snapchat , calling it ' stupid ' parental supervision : alex ( pictured ) says she would never let her daughter have a cell phone during sleepovers at her house because of this app although don is not convinced that the pictures will completely disappear , explaining : ' nothing is gone forever - not on this stuff
