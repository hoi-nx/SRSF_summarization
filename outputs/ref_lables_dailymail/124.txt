english cricket âs new bosses flexed their muscles when downton paid the price for a humiliating world cup by being sacked as managing director
downton was fired by new england chief executive tom harrison , in conjunction with chairman - elect graves , after a ring - round to each of the 14 members of the governing body âs management board ahead of their spring meeting today
the decision to sack a man who has endured a traumatic 14 months since succeeding hugh morris after england âs ashes whitewash was unanimous , with one board member saying downton was just â too accident prone â
downton has left his role as managing director of england downton leaves his role as england managing director following england 's shameful performance at world cup it was downton who took the huge call to sack pietersen and then re-appointed peter moores , calling him â the outstanding coach of his generation â
former england captain michael vaughan immediately said he would like to speak to the england about the newly created job of director of england cricket and andrew strauss is another possible candidate
ultimately it was england âs failure to negotiate the first round of the world cup after an embarrassing defeat by bangladesh and crushing reverses against australia and new zealand , coupled with disenchantment at their management style from many supporters , that did for former england and middlesex wicketkeeper - batsman downton
â the england cricket needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to , â said tom harrison in an england statement
â michael vaughan ( left ) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed downton michael vaughan 's successor as england captain , andrew strauss ( centre ) , is also thought to be a contender that new role will be director of england cricket , a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and , possibly , head selector
yet tom harrison played down any suggestion that this makes peter moores , still with much to prove in his second coming as england coach , more vulnerable and that the door could now be nudged further ajar for the return of pietersen , who has rejoined surrey after being apparently encouraged by graves
