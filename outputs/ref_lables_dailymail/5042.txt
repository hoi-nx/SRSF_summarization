a family have spoken of their heartbreak after two of their beloved pet dogs were shot dead by their neighbour
the horrific incident happened after lisa and james tuttle moved with their five children to the rural village of geldeston in norfolk in 2005
they thought their big house with a large garden surrounded by arable land would be a peaceful and idyllic family home
but their happiness was shattered in 2014 after their dogs marley and lily were shot after escaping on to their neighbour 's farmland where they were accused of killing his birds
bella , left , is the family 's remaining dog lisa reveals on channel 5 show nightmare neighbour next door how she had a long - running dispute with the owner of the farm , cook , over her dogs trespassing on his property
lisa said ruby kept escaping from their garden onto mr cook 's land causing him to come and complain
james tuttle said he found this hard to believe as ruby did not show any evidence of having attacked the birds as she never had blood on her fur or around her mouth

she thought it would be the perfect place to raise her family but now wants to move following the devastating loss of their two family pets lisa added : ' she was gentle
' terrified that ruby 's life was at risk if she escaped from their garden again , lisa and james tuttle made the painful decision to have her re-homed
' ruby 's safety came first so we have to give her away , it tore me apart for three or four months , ' lisa said
the james tuttle 's first dog ruby , pictured , had to be re-homed because she kept escaping from their garden ryan said they tried to put up more fences and block holes to stop the dogs leaving their garden ' but they kept digging under the hedge and getting out
' however , as they had no further complaints from their neighbours , lisa did n't think too much of it
in august 2014 , they arranged to go away for a family holiday leaving her mother and sister to look after the three dogs
' my mum called and said the farmer had complained that lily and marley had been on his land , ' lisa recalled
lisa reveals how they tried to patch up holes in their garden walls and fences to stop the dogs getting out but they kept digging holes to escape marley , pictured , was killed for worrying livestock after the farmer 's gamekeeper acted within the law when the dogs were said to break into a bird pen on farmer cook 's property but if the killer has a ' lawful excuse ' - such as where there were no other means of ending or preventing the dogs worrying their livestock - they have not committed an offence
mr cook says he and his gamekeeper acted with the law and they have not been charged with any wrong - doing
it 's a bitter pill for the tuttles to swallow as they say they are bereft at the loss of their two pets
