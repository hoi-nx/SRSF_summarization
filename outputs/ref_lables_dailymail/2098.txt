maiquetia , venezuela : it 's a long way from bundoran â and a long way from the belfast homes of barnes and michael conlan
barnes may have already been well known in irish prior to their achievements in london , but taking up his part in a charming double act with michael conlan only endeared him further to a nation that unfortunately only flirts with the amateur version of the sport every four years before medallists appear on homecoming flights
michael conlan ( leff ) lands a right jab on matthew martin during his bantamweight bout in glasgow in 2014 the reality of making that happen is far more complex , of course , and the efforts of barnes and michael conlan to make it to rio 2016 are unprecedented
on saturday night , the belfast boys are potentially both one win away from qualifying for next summer 's olympic games , with barnes needing to ensure victory while michael conlan must do likewise and depend on another result elsewhere
their mission takes them to maiquetia , northern venezuela , where they will take on native opposition , the latest stop on the road - trip that is the wsb ( wsb ) â a part of the convoluted new structure that once was ' amateur ' boxing
barnes and conlan box for the italia thunder team , but the sights and sounds of milan and rome were not what drew them to the competition
upon their return to belfast after saturday night 's fight , they will have covered a distance of over 34,000 miles over the course of their various round trips
they will have each fought seven fights in 13 weeks and , as of today , barnes has boxed 29 rounds in 12 weeks to michael conlan 's 28
they are burnt out , peeved off and ready for rest â but only once their mission is complete saturday night
barnes is one victory away from qualifying for 2016 summer games in rio ' i just feel tired , i 'm sick of it , ' laments a worn - out barnes , who is an undefeated 6 - 0
' in addition to hand injuries , which have severely limited his training , barnes has another battle he must overcome as he bids to become the first irish boxer ever to reach a third olympic games
while their fixture list has included destinations as culturally and geographically diverse as guba in azerbaijan , palermo , poland 's konin , almaty in kazakhstan , rome , milan and now maiquetia , the two - time olympic games medallist explains that they do not get to soak up the glamorous aspects of the cities
' far from it , ' says barnes
' michael conlan ( left ) and barnes sport their bronze medals following their success at london 2012 adding to barnes ' stress is his constant struggle to make the 49kg light - flyweight limit
the 28 - year - old has been boxing in the same weight division for 12 years and tales of his notoriously cranky pre-weigh - in demeanour are common , with michael conlan witnessing the battle first hand as his regular room - mate
' it does make it easier because we 're mates outside boxing , ' says barnes of the benefits of being signed up to the same team as his pugilist pal
' but when we 're away , i barely talk to him because he knows i 'm making weight ! ' michael conlan , the laidback member of the double act , takes a far more carefree approach to travel
' getting on a plane does n't bother me , if you 're going to die on a plane , you 're going to die , ' laughs michael conlan
' the 23 - year - old recently became a father , with his young daughter just four weeks old , while barnes is also a father to a daughter of 11 months
the pair have also stayed neck and neck in terms of international achievements since michael conlan emerged on the senior scene in 2011 and the younger member of the duo is also appreciative of his friend 's presence on wsb duty
' it 's good for both of us because i know when i 'm training with him , we 're both training hard and pushing each other , ' says michael conlan
' for barnes , he maintains : ' the olympic games is what it 's all about , it 's every amateur boxer 's dream and if i qualify , i 'll be honoured to say i qualified for my third olympic games
