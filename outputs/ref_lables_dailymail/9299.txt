during its 25 years in space , hubble has provided the world with unprecedented views of the universe
but to help it find alien life , nasa needs an even more powerful tool to peer back into the depths of our cosmos
the agency hopes to do this with the james webb , which will be 100 times more potent than hubble , and will be able to see back to 200 million years after the big bang

pictured are nasa scientists completing a series of cryogenic tests on six james webb beryllium mirror segments nasa describes the telescope as a ' powerful time machine with infrared vision that will peer back over 13.5 billion years to see the first stars and galaxies forming out of the darkness of the early universe
but nasa has promised to keep the next - generation telescope on track for its october 2018 launch
' what the james webb will really be doing is looking at the first galaxies of the universe , ' james webb telescope observatory project scientist mark clampin

there at least 200 billion earth - like planets in our galaxy â and now nasa officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them
' i believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years , ' stofan , chief scientist for nasa , said
a joint project of nasa , the european and canadian space agencies , james webb will carry four instruments , including cameras and spectrometers that can capture extremely faint signals
' the james webb will have 70 times the light - gathering capacity of hubble
' unlike the hubble , which circles the earth , the james webb will go even further , to a place called lagrange point , for lagrange point , 930,000 miles ( 1.5 million km ) away in space
unlike the hubble , which circles the earth , the james webb will go even further , to a place called lagrange point , for lagrange point , 930,000 miles ( 1.5 million km ) away in space the distance will keep the telescope cold , prevent it from being blinded by its own infra - red light and shelter it from radiation the heavy telescope , pictured here during testing , is scheduled to launch atop an ariane 5 rocket , made by the european space agency , from french guiana in october 2018
