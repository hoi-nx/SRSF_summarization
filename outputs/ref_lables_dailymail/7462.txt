about 4.45 billion years ago , 150 million years after the solar system formed , earth was hit by a mars - size object called theia
the collision created the moon , but debate has raged exactly what happened during this event - and a mystery has persisted on why the moon and earth are so similar in their composition
now , conflicting studies have provided two different theories - one that theia was similar to earth , and another that earth and the moon were showered by debris following the collision
three studies have provided different theories for what happened after earth was struck by a mars - sized object called theia , 4.45 billion years ago
this is known as the giant impact hypothesis the two theories appear in the journal nature across three studies - two in favour of the â similar to earth â theory , and the other favouring the â shower of debris â model
in the latter theory , a team of scientists at the university of maryland said the impact of theia with earth was so violent , the resulting debris cloud mixed thoroughly before settling down and forming the moon
many researchers believe the moon formed after earth was hit by a planet the size of mars billions of years ago
the colliding body is sometimes called theia , after the mythical greek titan who was the mother of selene , the goddess of the moon
but one mystery has persisted , revealed by rocks the apollo astronauts brought back from the moon - why are the moon and earth so similar in their composition ? several different theories have emerged over the years to explain the similar fingerprints of earth and the moon
a third possibility is that the moon formed from earthen materials , rather than from theia , although this would have been a very unusual type of impact
â this means that , right after the moon formed , it had exactly the same isotopic composition as earth 's mantle , â said dr walker , a professor of geology at university of maryland and co-author of the study
the team said their theory largely rules out the idea that the mars - sized body theia was of similar composition , or that the moon formed from only material contained in the pre-impact earth
scientists at the israel institute of technology and the southwest research institute in colorado said that theia actually had a similar composition to earth
in one theory , a team of scientists at the university of maryland said that the impact of theia with earth was so violent , the resulting debris cloud mixed thoroughly before settling down and forming the moon
shown is an artist 's illustration of the young earth and moon the university of maryland team examined the tungsten isotopic composition of two moon rocks collected by the apollo 16 mission , including sample 68815 , seen here
however , the other theory says that earth ( left ) and the moon ( right ) are so similar because the initial mars - sized object , theia , actually had a similar composition to earth
