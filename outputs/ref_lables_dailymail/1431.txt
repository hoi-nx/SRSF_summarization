defender janmaat has admitted newcastle got exactly what they deserved from their derby trip to black cats - nothing
the 25 - year - old holland full - back played the full 90 minutes of sunday 's 1 - 0 premier league defeat at the stadium of light despite suffering a suspected tear in his calf muscle during the warm - up , but was unable to prevent the black cats running out winners as the magpies slipped to a record fifth successive defeat in the fixture
newcastle created little of note on another poor day for carver 's men , and janmaat was pulling no punches as he assessed the fall - out
janmaat ( left ) has admitted that newcastle 's performance in their tyne-wear derby against black cats was n't good enough and they got exactly what they deserved - nothing the holland full - back played the full 90 minutes despite a suspected calf muscle tear janmaat tries to get across and stop a cross from black cats 's steven fletcher at the stadium of light he told nufctv : ' it was not good enough
' newcastle were simply not at the races as a black cats side motivated by new head coach dick advocaat dominated from the off , although they looked like making it to half - time unharmed before defoe smashed home a stoppage - time volley which proved to be the tangible difference between the teams
defoe scored the winning goal - a spectacular volley - on the stroke of half - time defoe 's goal proved to be ample reward for black cats 's dominance in the tyne-wear derby the result moves black cats three points clear of the premier league relegation zone april 13 liverpool ( a ) april 19 tottenham hotspur ( h ) april 25 swansea city ( h ) may 2 leicester city ( a ) may 9 west bromwich albion ( h ) may 16 queens park rangers ( a ) may 24 west ham ( h ) ' but they deserved to score in the first half because they had maybe 20 free - kicks and they were better than us , then normally you score a goal
indeed , the black cats have won just 17 of their last 75 league games , five of them against their neighbours , a statistic which provides a damning indictment of newcastle 's lack of progress on the field
carver went into sunday 's game with only one recognised central defender and right - back janmaat having to play in the middle with midfielders ryan taylor and jack colback operating as full - backs , and he was also without a proven premier league striker in the 18
newcastle manager carver had to cope with a weakened defence following injuries janmaat gets stuck into a challenge with black cats 's steven fletcher during the derby match that selection crisis was due in part to suspensions for fabricio coloccini and papiss cisse and injuries to steven taylor , paul dummett and massadio haidara , as well as midfielders cheick tiote , siem de jong and rolando aarons , a casualty list which has served to expose the lack of depth in a squad assembled on a budget and made up largely of players sold a move to st james ' park as a stepping stone to bigger things
