the red planet might still have liquid water , suggests information collected by nasa 's curiosity
researchers have long known that there is water in the form of ice on mars
now , new information from the mars rover curiosity , published in the journal nature , shows that it is possible that there is liquid water close to the surface of the red planet
new information from nasa 's curiosity , published in the journal nature , shows that it is possible that there is liquid water close to the surface of the red planet
the explanation is that the substance perchlorate has been found in the soil , which lowers the freezing point so the water does not freeze into ice , but is liquid and present in very salty water
when night falls , some of the water vapour in the atmosphere condenses on the planet surface as frost , but calcium perchlorate is very absorbent and it forms a brine with the water , so the freezing point is lowered and the frost can turn into a liquid
doctor madsen , associate professor and head of the mars group at the niels bohr institute at the university of copenhagen in denmark , said : ' we have discovered the substance calcium perchlorate in the soil and , under the right conditions , it absorbs water vapour from the atmosphere

researchers say that gale crater was once a giant lake on the red planet ' the soil is porous , so what we are seeing is that the water seeps down through the soil
' observations by the mars probe 's stereo camera have previously shown areas characteristic of old riverbed with rounded pepples that clearly show that a long time ago there was flowing , running water with a depth of up to one metre
mars is currently in the middle of an ice age , and before this study , scientists believed liquid water could not exist on its surface
last month , scientists provided the best estimates for water on mars , claiming it once had more liquid h2 ) than the arctic ocean - and the planet kept these oceans for more than 1.5 billion years
the findings suggest there was ample time and water for life on mars to thrive , but over the last 3.7 billion years the red planet has lost 87 per cent of its water - leaving it barren and dry
' however , he added that it is not likely that life will be found on mars as it is too dry , too cold and the cosmic radiation is so powerful that it penetrates at least one metre into the surface and kills all life - at least life as we know it on earth
the finding , however , could make it easier for humans to live on mars in the future
