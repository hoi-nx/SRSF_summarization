dundee have hit back at fierce criticism of the board 's performance by two leading supporters ' groups
arabtrust and the federation of dundee united supporters clubs say they are ' shocked ' that 25 per cent of Â£ 6.3million worth of transfer fees for ryan gauld , andrew robertson , armstrong and mackay-steven were paid in commission to unnamed parties
the dundee board have hit back at criticism from supporters by pointing to their on - field success the tannadice club - already under fire for selling armstrong and mackay-steven to celtic six weeks before their league cup final defeat to the scottish champions - responded by defending their record in a statement
' on the field the club has reached back - to - back domestic cup finals for the first time in 29 years , qualified for european competition in three of the last four years , finished in the premiership top six in every one of the last seven years and won the scottish cup in 2010
' defending their record on that point , the club statement responded : ' off field the board has reduced overall debt , including thompson family loans , from Â£ 5.2m in february 2014 to Â£ 2.6m while successfully extricating the club from all bank debt
the most explosive allegation , however , is the claim concerning the commission paid to outside parties â none of whom are understood to be players , agents or other clubs
when all of these various payments are totalled , over 25 per cent of the Â£ 6.3m in fees received has not been kept in the club
' united last year announced that a recent debt settlement would see the bank of scotland collect a share of transfer fees received before the end of august 2015
' some supporters were angered by the amount of commission that was paid from transfer fees received
