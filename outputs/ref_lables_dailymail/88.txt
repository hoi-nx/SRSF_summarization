it is said to be the first high - performance aluminium battery that is ' fast - charging , long - lasting and inexpensive ' the aluminium battery was created at stanford university , california , and the findings have been published in the journal nature
lead author and professor of chemistry at the university , dai , said : ' we have developed a rechargeable aluminium battery that may replace existing storage devices , such as alkaline batteries , which are bad for the environment , and lithium - ion batteries , which occasionally burst into flames
it consists of a negatively charged anode made of aluminum and a positively charged graphite cathode along with an ionic liquid electrolyte
these sit inside a flexible polymer - coated pouch
and while lithium - ion batteries can take hours to charge , the new battery has ' unprecedented charging times ' of down to one minute
it is more environmentally friendly than alkaline batteries , and ca n't catch fire like lithium - ion technology
' but the researchers said the battery has only half the voltage of lithium - ion technology
the aluminum - ion battery consists of two electrodes - a negatively charged anode made of aluminum and a positively charged graphite cathode along with an ionic liquid electrolyte
these sit inside a flexible polymer - coated pouch
' lithium - ion batteries can be a fire hazard
' and while lithium - ion battery can take hours to charge , the new battery has ' unprecedented charging times ' of down to one minute
by comparison , a typical lithium - ion battery lasts about 1,000 cycles
the battery consists of a negatively charged anode made of aluminum and a positively charged graphite cathode along with an ionic liquid electrolyte
these sit inside a flexible polymer - coated pouch
' but the researchers said the battery has only half the voltage of lithium - ion ( stock image ) ' you can bend it and fold it , so it has the potential for use in flexible electronic devices
