the results of early trials published last month showed that among 34 practices taking part in the scheme in central london , the number of patients going to a&e dropped by between 8 and 10 per cent
but a survey of 15,560 gps by their union , the british medical association , found 63 per cent were opposed to forming networks with other surgeries to open seven days a week
and 93 per cent said their heavy workload has negatively affected patient care
drop : a trial period opening gps surgeries seven days a week found the numbers going to a&e fell â while there is a willingness from gps to look at offering extended hours , more than nine in ten gps do not feel that their practice can provide blanket seven day services when gps are struggling to provide even basic care to their patients
