darius seems nonchalant about his world record â and untroubled that he is set to lose his title to his son , jeff
with a rabbit 's peak weight and length kicking in at the age of two , jeff has got some way to go
' he 's going to get bigger , ' says their owner , annette edwards
i think he might well take darius 's record
' annette edwards , a former playboy model ( not a annette edwards , it must be noted ! ) , is a genius at giant rabbit - breeding

' you must n't , ' annette edwards stresses
' unsurprisingly , nutritious food is at the heart of giant rabbit - breeding , and annette edwards admits that darius is ' very greedy '
but , even with these hearty appetites , rabbit - breeding is a cheap hobby : Â£ 10 a week in grub for both bunnies
' they do n't need much looking after , ' annette edwards says

her work took her around the world , including new york , where she appeared as a model in playboy

is his title under threat ? annette edwards says : ' no one 's come close so far
competition : darius the rabbit measures 4ft 4in long while 3ft 8in jeff still has six months of growing to do ' that 's cruel â it would kill the mothers in the end , ' says annette edwards
