researchers in north carolina claim that zapping the brain with a mild electric current can boost creativity by nearly eight per cent as well as creativity , these oscillations - or the lack of them - are linked with depression
' alpha oscillations occur within the frequency range of eight and 12 hertz 9 ( or cycles per second )
alpha oscillations happen most prominently when we close our eyes and shut out sensory stimuli â things we see , feel , taste , smell , and hear
when alpha oscillations are active , your sensory inputs might be offline as you daydream , meditate , or conjure ideas
when you come fully online , alpha oscillations disappear
enhancing these electric oscillations may help treat people with depression , scientists claim they tested their theory using a 10 - hertz current run through electrodes attached to the scalp on 20 volunteers to stimulate the brain 's natural alpha wave oscillations
they then recorded the results using eeg knowing this , other researchers began associating alpha oscillations with creativity
if he could enhance the rhythmic patterns of alpha oscillations to improve creativity
for the study , professor frohlich 's team enrolled 20 healthy adults
however , new research from the university of oxford suggests that the benefits of this technique , which stimulates activity in the brain with an electrical current , may be limited by personality as it appears to only be helpful to people who are stressed about performing a task
this way , the 10 - hertz alpha oscillation stimulation for each side of the cortex would be in unison
during one session , researchers used a 10 - hertz sham stimulation for just five minutes
in the other session each participant underwent the same protocol , except they were stimulated at 10 hertz for the entire 30 minutes while doing the torrance test
