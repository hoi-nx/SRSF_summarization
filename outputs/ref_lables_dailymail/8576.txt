a mother says she must quit her job after her daughter was refused a place at a junior school 150 yards from their front door - and sent to one more than two miles away instead
her mother lynne , 49 , who has two other children , claims taking her daughter to school and back every day would require four hours of travelling on the bus and force her to quit her job
unhappy : briggs , seven , was refused a place at a school 150 yards from her home and offered one two miles away , so her mother lynne , pictured together , must quit her job to ensure she gets there and back decision : the schoolgirl leaves across the street from her preferred school but instead will have to head to shooters grove , which is around two miles away mrs briggs had believed broomhill infants school in sheffield , where charlotte is a student , was a feeder school to lydgate junior , so only put one school on charlotte 's admission form
the mother - who works in it for council and is married to financial planner simon , 55 , - also believed the short distance from her home to the school would also be a deciding factor
but the council said the school charlotte attends has never been a feeder school and advised parents to always submit three preferences when applying
charlotte is in the catchment area but the school is oversubscribed , so children who also live in the area but go to the correct feeder school were given a place above her
mrs briggs is now planning to appeal the decision made by the authority after charlotte was given a spot at shooters grove - more than two miles away
alternative : the seven - year - old was instead offered a place at shooters grove - more than two miles away ' broomhill infant school is not and has never been a linked feeder school to lydgate junior school and a member of the admissions team attended broomhill in october 2014 to offer help and advice to parents before applying
this may be a school outside the catchment area , if no other preferences were requested
' mrs briggs said she has contacted her local prospective parliamentary candidates in deputy prime minister nick clegg 's constituency of sheffield hallam - but has yet to receive a reply
