the federal government is looking to take a hard line with parents who choose not to vaccinate their children
under ground breaking reforms , social services minister scott morrison will reportedly scrap a provision that allows parents who do n't vaccinate their children to claim welfare benefits , including $ 726 from family tax benefit a , $ 7,500 - a - year from childcare rebate and $ 200 - a - week from the childcare benefit scheme
the way the system works now , children must be immunised to access childcare payments , however , a ' contentious loop hole ' means parents can avoid loosing their benefits by simply signing a form that says they object to immunisation based on ' personal , philosophical or religious ' reasons
mr scott morrison recently said the rules around welfare payments need to be ' tightened ' and that while immunising children against deadly diseases protects the wider society , it should be a prerequisite to receive tax payer money
' and in fact , you know , those parents have taken decisions to immunise their children , and that 's obviously the sensible thing to do
we 're a free country , and we 're for free society , but that does n't mean you get to take taxpayers ' money if you do n't want to go along with the rules
' while doctors and pro-vaccination groups are tipped to welcome the reforms as a way to increase the number of children being vaccinated , some immunisation experts are worried the move wo n't bolster immunisation rates
