campaigners are calling for the government to implement an almost 90 - year - old law that would fix the date of easter in a bid to boost the economy
after next month 's election , ministers could be asked to make sure easter sunday always falls between april 9 and 15 , so businesses can plan holiday rotas in advance and allow the travel industry to better prepare for the summer season
in 1928 , the easter act was passed in parliament to make sure that the holiday weekend would be a fixed date in april
after next month 's general election , minister could be asked to consider fixing the date of easter both the house of commons and house of lords passed the act but it was unable to get the agreement of churches and therefore has never been implemented
but just before the dissolution of parliament last week , conservative sir greg knight , who is defending his east yorkshire seat at the general election , asked ministers if there were any plans to implement the easter act 1928
this also prompted the national secular society to write to prime minister david cameron demanding easter be a set date in april
on the gregorian calendar , used in the uk , easter sunday always falls on the first sunday after the paschal full moon the local government association and the family and childcare trust have also backed the plan , saying that at least the two - week easter school holidays should be the same every year to allow parents to plan childcare
however , according to the independent business minister jo swinson said there was ' no indication ' that easter would become a fixed date
