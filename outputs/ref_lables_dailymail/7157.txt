the ethnic minority population in uk will more than double by the middle of this century , meaning one in four uk will be from black or minority groups by 2051 , research shows
the huge rise will be due to a baby boom among pakistani , bangladesh , and africa immigrants who usually come to this country during their young , child bearing years
campaigners fear that this sudden increase will put pressure on housing , schools and the nhs , and worsen the quality of life in uk as a whole
a baby boom among ethnic minorities in the uk will see numbers rocket by the middle of the century , according to new data , with a quarter of uk coming from a minority background by 2051 the research , carried out by leeds university and reported in the times , shows that overall , between 2011 and 2051 , the uk 's population will rise from 63.4 million to 77.4 million
while the number of white uk will increase over that time , by almost three million , the minority population will increase more than three times faster , by 10 million
by the midpoint of the 21st century , minority ethnic communities will make up 24.3 per cent of the total population , compared with 12.8 per cent during the 2011 census
the sudden rise in the ethnic minority population marks an increase on predictions from the same university just five years ago
in an almost identical study , published in july 2010 , professors at leeds university predicted that ethnic minorities would make up around a fifth of the total population by 2051
while the white uk population will increase between now and 2051 , the minority population will increase nearly three times as fast , meaning they will make up a greater share of the population ' at a regional level , ethnic minorities will shift out of deprived inner city areas to more affluent areas , which echoes the way white groups have migrated in the past
