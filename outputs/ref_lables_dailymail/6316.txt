barry beavis , 48 , lost his case at the court of appeal millions of motorists face spiralling parking fines after judges ruled yesterday that Â£ 85 was not an ' excessively high ' penalty for staying too long in a car park
barry beavis launched a legal bid to overturn his fine , saying it was unfair , disproportionate and unenforceable
but in a landmark ruling , appeal court judges decided the size of the fine was neither ' extravagant or unconscionable '
mr barry beavis , from chelmsford , essex , had gone to court to fight what he called the ' bullying and threatening ' private car park firms which heavily penalise motorists who overstay in parking spaces
the 48 - year - old , who runs a fish and chip shop , got the Â£ 85 fine in april 2013 when he overstayed by 56 minutes in a private car park at the riverside retail park in chelmsford
the car park , run by parking firm parkingeye , allowed two hours of free parking , but mr barry beavis stayed for three
he claimed the Â£ 85 charge against him was disproportionate and vowed to fight the companies who ' extort money by threatening and bullying people into paying up '
ian taylor , of the alliance of british drivers , said : ' i think the judges are somewhat out of touch if they think Â£ 85 is n't extravagant
' if judges believe Â£ 85 is not an extravagant amount then what is ? Â£ 100 ? Â£ 200 ? our fear is that parking firms will now be falling over themselves to raise their penalty charges and punish drivers
' speaking outside of the court of appeal mr barry beavis said he would now be taking the case to the supreme court parking trap : many motorists face steep fines for running a few minutes over their allotted time the three judges who unanimously dismissed the challenge â lord justice moore-bick , lord justice patten and sir timothy lloyd â are all thought to earn around Â£ 202,000 a year
