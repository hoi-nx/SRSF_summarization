campaign : amanda burleigh has won her battle a midwife has won a decade - long battle to give mothers more time attached to their newborns before the umbilical cord is cut
amanda burleigh was convinced that clamping the cord within seconds of delivery â shutting off the blood supply from the placenta â was wrong
since the 1950s , when doctors and midwives started giving women a hormonal injection to reduce the risk of haemorrhage , they have clamped the cord within seconds of birth
but ms amanda burleigh , a midwife at leeds teaching hospitals nhs trust , believed it was unnatural to clamp the cord when it was still visibly pulsating with blood
she said : â one day i had a brainwave and thought , â we all clamp the cord within seconds of the baby being born , but we are doing it without any evidence about whether it âs good or bad for the baby
â ' she contacted other medics , including obstetrician dr hutchon , and together the group amassed evidence that stopping the blood flow so early could be harmful
there is also growing evidence that immediate cord - clamping can be particularly harmful for premature babies
national institute for health and care excellence now states that doctors and midwives should not routinely clamp the cord â earlier than one minute from the birth of the baby â
â there is also growing evidence that immediate cord - clamping can be particularly harmful for premature babies however , she said she felt a â moral duty â to challenge a practice that was not grounded in evidence
ms amanda burleigh , recently named midwife of the year by the british journal of midwifery , added : â in 20 or 30 years i think we will look back on immediate cord - clamping and think , â what were we doing ? we dropped an absolute clanger
