north sea cod stocks are bouncing back after being heavily overfished for decades and could even be sustainable in five years , new research has found
the population was deemed healthy in hundreds of the northern european fisheries analysed and experts say the fish is closer to being certified as a sustainable species
consumers were previously told to eat gurnard instead of cod after stocks plummeted in the 1980s and 1990s , but the industry has steadily recovered since regulations were put in place in 2006
north sea cod stocks are on the rise after being heavily overfished and could be sustainable in five years however the findings by seafish and the marine stewardship council ( marine stewardship council ) revealed that one in nine fisheries operate sustainably , with 400 suffering from serious failings in data management
dr pickerell , technical director at industry - funded seafish , which represents the seafood industry , told the paper he was surprised at how close the north sea cod is to being certified
he said : ' i would like to think within a decade we will have marine stewardship council - certified north sea cod. i would like to put it closer â where within five years it could look at entering the system
' cod stocks plummeted in the 1980s and 1990s , but the industry has steadily recovered since regulations were put in place in 2006 the findings by seafish and the marine stewardship council ( marine stewardship council ) did reveal however that one in nine fisheries operate sustainably , with 400 suffering from serious failings in data management although eight out of nine fisheries fell short dr pickerell remains optimistic , adding : ' it 's a question of glass half full or half empty
trawling in the north sea saw catches grow each year until the 1980s , with figures for cod peaking at 300,000 tonnes in the 1970s
a report in 2012 suggested that there were only 100 adult cod , which become more fertile as they age , left in the north sea
' the research included 450 inshore fisheries , which were assessed against the criteria set out by the marine stewardship council to be considered for its ' blue flash ' logo
