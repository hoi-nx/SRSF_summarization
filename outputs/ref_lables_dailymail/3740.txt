allen , the microsoft co-founder this week unveiled ' vulcan ' , which will look after the space programs of stratolaunch systems
this includes an ambitious project to launch spacecraft and probes into orbit from of a huge carrier aircraft with a wingspan of 385ft ( 117 metres ) the plane will climb to 30,000 feet and launch a rocket at high altitude , avoiding the huge fuel costs of launching from earth
initially , the system is intended to deliver satellites weighing up to about 13,500lbs ( 6,124 kg ) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles ( 180 km and 2000 km ) above earth
the stratolaunch systems carrier aircraft will be powered by six 747 - class engines , is currently being assembled at mojave , california
initially , the system is intended to deliver satellites weighing up to about 13,500lbs ( 6,124 kg ) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles ( 180 km and 2000 km ) above earth
the plane will climb to 30,000 feet and launch a rocket at high altitude , avoiding the huge fuel costs of launching from earth
the stratolaunch systems project was inspired by spaceshipone which won the $ 10 million ansari x prize in 2004 for becoming the first privately funded manned vehicle to reach space
' stratolaunch systems 's ability to launch from variable locations will enable satellites and humans to be efficiently inserted into their most optimal orbit at a time of the customer 's choosing , ' beames wrote
the stratolaunch systems carrier aircraft 's 385 feet ( 117 metres ) wingspan compares to 320 feet for hughes h-4 hercules and 225 feet for boeing earlier this year , the world received its first glimpse of a gigantic airplane that will serve as an airborne launch pad for putting satellites - and eventually people - into orbit
the stratolaunch systems carrier plane is on track to make its first test flight in 2016 , according to space.com
the rocket is being developed by orbital atk , and the designs uses solid - fuel lower stages and an upper stage powered by rl-10 engines
wingspan : 385 feet ( 117 metres ) engines : six 747 - class engines fuselage length : 238 feet ( 72 metres ) weight : 1,200,000 lb ( 544,311 kg ) maximum speed : 460 knots , 530 mph ( 850 km / h ) maiden launch : flight testing will begin in 2016
satellite delivery : initially , the system is intended to deliver satellites weighing up to about 13,500lbs ( 6,124 kg ) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles ( 180 km and 2000 km ) above earth
an animation of the moment the stratolaunch systems carrier aircraft delivers a rocket high into earth 's atmosphere before it goes into orbit each of the twin fuselages of the the stratolaunch systems carrier aircraft is 238 feet long and , when complete , will be supported by 12 main landing gear wheels and two nose gear wheels ' what we really want to do is focus on a lower - cost propulsion system that is evolvable in some fashion , ' he said
that company added that it is deferring work on a crewed vehicle that would launch on the orbital atk booster to focus more heavily on getting the stratolaunch systems carrier aircraft off the ground
its 385 feet ( 117 metres ) wingspan compares to 320 feet for the hughes h-4 hercules and 225 feet for the boeing
