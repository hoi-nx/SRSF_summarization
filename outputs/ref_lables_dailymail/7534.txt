cable prides himself on being the tories ' bogeyman in the coalition
just as cameron and george privately describe clegg as a ' closet conservative ' , they regard labour politician
not surprising , since he once was a labour politician , albeit a councillor , in the 1970s
with cable in charge of labour 's spending plans , voters would stop worrying that would - be pm miliband might do something barmy
not only is he ready to spend another five years helping the tories run britain , he wants to replace george as chancellor
' how does he sit down with tories he privately despises ? ' when we have a business meeting we put the guns at the door and sit down and talk , ' he smiles
he complains of ' nasty and vicious stuff ' from the tories
and after one heated coalition verbal exchange with defence secretary liam fox , cameron rushed up to cable on his way out and begged him to keep it secret to stop the coalition collapsing
' so how , and more to the point , why , does cable want another five years of more of the same ? ' because i 've realised it is possible to be business - like with them
i can envisage a scenario in which i would stomach working with the tories if the situation required
' it 's important coming from me because i 'm the one seen as having the least affinity with the tories
' cable is also quick to make clear he does not rule out working with labour
but he ' envisages ' remaining in a government led by cameron , not miliband
cable says he would stop ' the nasty tail of right - wing mps wagging the tory dog ' if cameron scrapes home
he denounces ' horrendous ' public spending cuts proposed by cameron and george â ' almost all affecting the disabled and working poor '
in the next breath he says : ' cameron and george are highly intelligent guys and i respect their abilities
' his warm words for the tories are all the more remarkable , bearing in mind that , around the corner , conservative chiefs have sent extra teams of canvassers to twickenham to try to ' decapitate ' cable
giving a timely reminder to local tories in his middle - class constituency , home of the chaps of the english rugby football union and hampton court , of his fondness for dave and george will do him no harm
his warm words for the tories are all the more remarkable , bearing in mind that , around the corner , conservative chiefs have sent extra teams of canvassers to twickenham to try to ' decapitate ' mr cable ' he could have done so much better and has made two really big mistakes
yet , audaciously , the evergreen septuagenarian has set his sights on a new star turn â chancellor in a tory - led government
