when ulster confirmed the audacious signing of new zealand wing charles piutau this week , the scale of their transfer coup was illustrated by the complaints emanating from new zealand
charles piutau rejected a new deal with the blues and nzru in favour of a season in belfast fly - half colin slade is thought to be deciding between a move to toulon or pau in france â while the latter club have already landed conrad smith
the prospect of piles of euros and a gathering of elite players from around the world makes the top 14 league the destination du jour , for southern stars seeking a stint abroad
what makes the piutau deal so eye - catching is that it is a bold endorsement of ulster âs ambition and also a boost to the wider celtic game , below test level
that boost is much - needed , because there are simmering problems â as exposed and bemoaned by leinster âs head coach matt oâconnor last weekend
the australian was infuriated by the softly - softly stance of ireland coach joe schmidt , whose final say on release of test players meant he was forced to rest a raft of leading lights for the pro 12 clash with leaders glasgow
the pro 12 has a credibility issue , due to the continuing absence of so many irish stars from so many matches
a leading figure such as alun wyn jones gives body and soul to the ospreys week after week , but still found the energy to face down the more rested irish in cardiff during the six nations
if the irish can not fully commit to a league â making it a fitting stage for charles piutau âs class â they could play club rugby at home to sharpen up for european combat with their provinces
wasps forward nathan hughes was clumsy , not reckless wasps players were incensed by the three - game ban handed to their no 8 , nathan hughes , for the collision which left george north unconscious last friday night , and their angst is understandable
the big fijian was clumsy , but no more , by failing to move in time to prevent his knee striking the head of the lions wing , as he scored a try
nathan hughes was clumsy rather than reckless and did n't deserve a three - game ban the disciplinary panel called the offence â reckless â and the reaction of wasps captain james haskell was priceless
a player who has scored a try deserves to be protected from belated , damaging contact , however accidental , but the suspicion lingers that nathan hughes is serving a ban because north was knocked out
the webb ellis cup visits a school in toronto as part of the rugby world cup trophy tour we are in the cost - cutting age of do - it - all - online , so thousands of wannabe spectators were forced to endure endless hours of staring at a seemingly frozen screen on monday
yorkshire carnegie 's signing of rugby league legend kevin sinfield is a statement of intent he wants to play fly - half and while the prospect of him igniting the championship at the age of 34 is far - fetched , he is a proven leader and winner , and his mentality is what the union side at headingley are keen to tap into
sadly , team gb âs preparations â complicated by the presence of separate home nations in rugby â have been marred by a chronic lack of clarity and foresight , and being forced to enter what amounts to a repechage event would be somehow fitting .
