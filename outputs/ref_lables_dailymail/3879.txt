an oregon man adopted from korea as a toddler fears that he could be torn away from his wife and three children because his america citizenship was never registered
crapser , 39 , of salem , was issued with deportation papers by the department of homeland security in january and a hearing is set for april 2
the father - of - three , who has a fourth child on the way , arrived in america with the name shin sonh hyuk in 1979 around the age of three along with his biological sister
however , his first set of adoptive parents abandoned him and the second set turned out to be abusive
adding to crapser 's struggles , at no point did his guardians seek the green card or citizenship for him that they should have
deportation fears : korean adoptee crapser , left , poses with daughters , christal , one , christina , five , and his wife , anh nguyen , in the family 's living room in oregon now , after a life battling joblessness because of his lack of immigration papers , homelessness and crime , crapser is facing deportation
' federal immigration officials say they became aware of crapser after he applied to renew his green card two years ago : his criminal convictions , ranging from burglary to assault , made him potentially deportable under immigration law
us immigration and customs enforcement was n't aware of crapser 's childhood adoption history when it decided to pursue his deportation , agency spokesman andrew munoz said
two america senators , including merkley , d-oregon , are proposing a stand - alone , automatic citizenship bill for adoptees like crapser
growing pains : this undated photo provided by crapser shows him around the age of three with his sister struggles : abandoned by one adoptive family , separated for nearly three decades from his only biological sister , and exposed to abuse by another america adoptive couple , crapser struggled with rejection , homelessness and crime ' it was not his responsibility to fill out that immigration paperwork , ' merkley said
for years , it was the parents ' responsibility to seek citizenship , but many did not
seven years after crapser and his sister were adopted , their parents abandoned them
the foster care system separated crapser , ten at the time , from his sister , whom he was dependent on , according to orphanage records
when crapser was 12 , he moved in with thomas and dolly crapser , their biological son , two other adoptees and several foster children
the next four years , crapser said , the couple choked , kicked and hit him and the other children every day , slammed them against walls , set dogs to attack them and burned them with hot objects
' he always told me i 'm america , and that i need to let go of my past , ' crapser said
the crapsers had not obtained america citizenship papers for him
because he lacked a green card to prove he could work in the america , he opened a barber shop and an upholstery business - something he could do without immigration papers
he said his parents withheld his adoption record for years , so it was n't until 2012 that crapser submitted a green card application - which set in motion his path to a deportation hearing
