the title race may be over in the minds of some , but joe hart is irrepressibly optimistic
of course , he is paid to believe but there is some logic to his positivity when you consider how city won the league in 2012 and 2014 with late dramatic runs
â it âs kind of how we do it , â said joe hart , when asked about city âs need to overcome a nine - point deficit
â we like to do it a different way
we âve not necessarily reached the standard week - in , week - out that we wanted to , but the beauty of football is that you get another chance and that starts on monday at crystal palace
we will never give up
â city goalkeeper joe hart insists his side are still capable of winning the premier league title chelsea are nine points clear of city with both teams having eight games left to play chelsea are nine points clear of city joe hart is a good cheerleader
at the etihad stadium two weeks ago there was a distinct lack of fervour despite the 3 - 0 win over west brom , as though a certain kind of resignation has set in regarding city âs trajectory but joe hart does not accept that
â we âve proved it and the fans have proved it â we never give up , â he said
â that is one thing that is part of city that we âve taken with us from the olden days
we âll never give up while anything is possible
â we have definitely moved on as a team since we first won the league in 2012
we have been disappointed at certain times this season but there are eight games to go and we âll give it all we âve got
â joe hart himself is a good example of the adage that one should never give in
dropped last season by manuel pellegrini and threatened this season by the Â£ 6million signing of willy , joe hart is playing as well as ever , his penalty save against lionel messi and the subsequent performance at the nou camp a product of a long period of good form
joe hart has proven his class after being dropped last season following a handful of mistakes â i feel pushed , â said joe hart
that is how it is at city
â and joe hart is not content with game , striving to better himself
i want to keep going and keep pushing and keep my place in the two teams i âm with â city and england
i âve enjoyed the two games with england but i turn my head to crystal palace now
â joe hart labelled buffon , who won his 147th cap against england on tuesday night , a ' legend of the game ' and if he needed any inspiration in that quarter , a look across to his opposite number on tuesday night at the juventus stadium would have provided it
as joe hart won that 50th cap for england , buffon was winning his 147th at the age of 37 and proving as sharp as ever
â only in one area will joe hart not be emulating buffon
â he does look cool , â said joe hart , with a degree of self deprecation
