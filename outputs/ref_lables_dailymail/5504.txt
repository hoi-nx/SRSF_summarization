every family in the country will be left Â£ 350 worse off if the snp is left calling the shots in a labour government , osborne claimed today
the chancellor warned of a ' dangerous cocktail ' if miliband is at the mercy of snp leader nicola sturgeon
with polls showing no party will win an overall majority , mr osborne claimed it would spark a ' constitutional crisis ' if scots nationalist mps held the balance of power in the uk government
she demanded her mps have a say over the running of the whole of the uk , raising the prospect of scots nationalists calling the shots on policies which only apply south of the border
and she unveiled a Â£ 140billion ' ransom note ' for uk to drag labour to the left , including an end to austerity , rising benefits payments and the abolition of trident as the price mr miliband would have to pay for getting into number 10
' the scottish nationalist leaders would clearly be the stronger force in a labour minority government propped up by them
' salmond boasted that he would write labour 's first budget because the snp would hold the balance of power he said global investors warn that an snp - labour deal ' will lead to higher market interest rates , which means higher mortgage rates for families , which means higher bills , cut incomes , it means businesses finding it more difficult to expand '
they say a labour government supported by the snp would lead to a dangerous cocktail where taxes are going up , spending is going up , interest rates are going up
' the warnings come after former snp leader salmond boasted : ' i 'm writing labour 's budget
' the former scots first minister , who is set to be one of up to 50 mps elected next month , was filmed at a rally mocking labour 's weakness north of the border
he highlighted comments by the shadow business secretary chuka umunna â who tried to downplay claims the scots could avoid spending cuts by saying the party 's leader north of the border jim murphy ' will not be in charge of the uk budget '
' labour leader miliband today warned voters in scots that every mp labour does not win north of the border makes a tory government more likely it prompted david cameron and johnson to join forces to warn of a looming ' constitutional crisis '
mr miliband today warned voters in scots that every mp labour does not win north of the border makes a tory government more likely
' and every one less labour mp means it 's more likely that david cameron will be the prime minister again
people have to make their choice , but we will keep fighting that big argument about how we can create a better scots for working people and a better uk
' challenged about why he is not willing to work with the snp , he added : ' the reason why i am not going to have a coalition with the scots national party is we have got fundamental differences
' the tories will tomorrow inflame the row over a potential labour - snp power - sharing deal by unveiling the party âs first â manifesto for england â
the reform would make it impossible for any future labour government to press ahead with its plans to raise the top rate of tax to 50p in england without winning the support of a majority of english mps
tensions : the manifesto is expected to inflame tensions between the tories and nationalist parties like nicola sturgeon 's snp and plaid cymru , led by leanne wood it could also make it difficult for a scots mp to again hold the office of chancellor or prime minister , given they would be unable to vote on some of their own government âs legislation
for decades , labour has relied on the votes of its power base of scots mps to rule westminster
