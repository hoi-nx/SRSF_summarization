now , seven decades on and in the twilight of their lives , these former ss guards who ruled the human slaughterhouse auschwitz with an iron fist will go to their graves having escaped justice
those ' merciless ' women who traded femininity , motherhood and marriage to wed themselves to the dark side of hitler 's nazi include charlotte s. a guard at the notoriously brutal women âs concentration camp of ravensbrueck , in northern germany , she was remembered by survivors as a feared woman who beat prisoners and unleashed on them her alsatian dog
a fanatical nazi , the dog handler patrolled the camp with her alsatian she had trained to bite at the inmates ' genitals
she was transferred to auschwitz where she and her teeth - baring dog were feared by the prisoners kept as slaves and worked in the sweatshop factories around the camp

they and their relatives look likely to never get the justice they deserve survivors : french prisoners pictured when the nazi concentration camp of dachau , near munich , was liberated by allied troops at the end of april 1945
many of the nazi guards got away with their crimes by claiming they were just following orders she began an affair with an ss man while serving at the camp and was discharged from the service in 1943 when she fell pregnant
after the war , in saxony-anhalt , which was behind the iron curtain , the communist authorities tried her for her wartime role and she was sentenced to 15 months in jail for ' mistreatment of and thefts from prisoners in her charge '
nevertheless , unlike 93 - year - old groening , a former ss sergeant being tried on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder , charlotte s has been told there is no case for her to answer
another to get off scot free is gisela s , a ' hard - faced ' woman who worked in the feared ss under her maiden name of demming
gisela s was also in charge of the standing cells - small , dark rooms where up to 15 people at a time were crammed into
it was not uncommon for her to leave prisoners in these rooms for days on end , causing the death of some or all of those confined
demming formed a romantic relationship with ss dr franz bernhard lucas but she abruptly ended it when he criticised the hideous experiments on prisoners carried out by notorious ' angel of death ' dr josef mengele on inmates
he is charged with complicity in the killing of 300,000 jews at the camp groening , pictured , told the court that he is ' morally responsible ' for the mass slaughter even though he did not participate personally in any violence trial : people like auschwitz survivor eva pusztai-fahidi , left , from budapest and her 23 - years - old granddaughter luca hartai , have traveled from all over the world to witness one of the few prosecutions held possibly most frightening of all is gertrud elli senff , who revelled in the power she yielded to play ' god ' in choosing who should live and who should be sent to the auschwitz gas chambers
now 92 , she was formerly an ss guard at majdanek in lublin , poland , where an estimated 235,000 people were murdered during ww2
' after service in majdanek she was sent to auschwitz , where she was based at auschwitz - the gas chambers complex where 1.1million prisoners were exterminated
but officials at the ludwigsburg authority have , it is understood , testimony from several now deceased prisoners that she was a ' cruel ' and ' merciless ' guard who beat them with leather whips and who was present at the infamous railway ramp where daily ' selections ' were made about who should live - and who was to be gassed
vicious : another was accused of making as many as 15 people stand for days on end in a tiny cell , a punishment which left people dead - but she will never be brought before the court to answer to the law getting away with it : of the 6,500 members of the ss who served in auschwitz and survived the war , only 29 were convicted in germany and reunified germany , while about 20 were convicted in east germany ' unfortunately , very few people who committed the crimes had to pay for them , ' said efraim zuroff , the simon wiesenthal centre 's top nazi hunter
it 's only a shame that this kind of legal reasoning was not applied previously , because it would have led to many , many more cases of people who definitely deserved to be brought to justice
