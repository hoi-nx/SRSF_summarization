as james bond , he is licensed to kill
but it takes a great deal of artistic licence for daniel craig 's character to survive his on - screen ordeals , medical experts say
for in real life 007 would have perished several times in his most recent movie , skyfall
the incidents that ought to have been fatal include one before the opening credits rolled that would have ' turned his lungs out '
daniel craig is clearly a lot more vulnerable than his alter - ego â he has just had knee surgery after hurting himself in a stunt for the next james bond movie , spectre
only in the movies ... daniel craig in fighting form as james bond despite a potentially fatal wound but james bond is not the only one to defy medical science
writing for total film , the experts say many characters in other top films would also have struggled to escape alive from their injuries
they include mcclane â played by bruce willis â in die hard , the serial killer in halloween and , perhaps more surprisingly , three of the cast of family comedy home alone
skyfall [ 2012 ] the fifth james bond film may well have been called you only live twice but in daniel craig 's most recent outing as james bond he should have died at least three times , according to the medical experts

' james bond would not have survived
' yet james bond survives and only five minutes later plummets off a train , 260ft into the river below
james bond 's own medical techniques are n't up to much , either

james bond 's retirement would not have been a blissful one
he would have been extremely hard of hearing , thanks to the grenades and gunfire that wrecked his skyfall estate in scotland an hour and 54 minutes into the film
only eight minutes later , a deafened james bond plunges into an icy loch and , while underwater , fights a pursuer to the death â not a prospect he was in the best shape for
in real life , bruce willis ' mcclane would never have survived long enough to smash through a plate glass window in the first die hard movie a posse of baddies have rounded up a group of hostages , including mcclane 's wife , in a los angeles skyscraper
in his analysis , not only would poor little kevin ( macaulay culkin ) have been a goner , so would his tormentors , burglars harry and marv ( joe pesci and daniel stern )
macaulay culkin 's home alone character kevin would have died from head injuries when he fell from some high shelves when kevin falls from some high shelves , he would almost certainly have suffered fatal head injuries
