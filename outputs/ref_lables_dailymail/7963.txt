one season soon , there will be more people watching each premier league match live in the us than in britain
that is the confident expectation of broadcasting titan nbc , who hold the live rights to show matches stateside and have more than doubled us interest in england âs elite division in the past two years
in 2012 - 13 , some 13 million different us watched at least one top - flight england game live
this weekend , for the first time , reflecting their boom product , nbc have transported their entire premier league production from their hq in stamford , connecticut , to england

â it âs important that we do tell our audience about [ smaller clubs like ] burnley because otherwise it could all be arsenal , man united , city , chelsea , liverpool , â lowe says
â martino says that when nbc won the rights to show games â for the three - year period , 2013 - 16 , for $ 250 million ( Â£ 167m ) â some critics feared that showing every match â was going to be overkill â¦ [ but ] what we âve found is there is a demand for that level of consumption of this product â
