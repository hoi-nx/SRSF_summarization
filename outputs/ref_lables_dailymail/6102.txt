the tory leader vowed to cut the number below 100,000 ' no ifs , no buts ' , but latest figures show the number hit 298,000 in the year to september
in an interview today mrs morgan admitted it is a ' big issue ' for voters and revealed she has asked the department to examine the impact on schools
it is expected to look at how migrant children perform in exams and how schools with large immigrant populations cope
mrs morgan told the sunday telegraph : ' i think there is pressure in the classrooms in terms of teaching â how prepared [ immigrant ] children are when they start school
ofsted chief inspector sir michael last year warned schools had faced an ' influx ' of immigrants ' it would be wrong to say immigration holds results back or affects overall qualifications ultimately
but at the start of primary school , especially , it means that teachers have to tailor their lessons , to spend longer with pupils who have english as a second language
' we are looking at that in the department â exactly mapping the pressures , what teachers have to do , the resources that takes
' she added that she wanted to ensure that migrant children have caught up with other pupils before the end of the year 1 , aged six or seven
in october last year , ofsted chief inspector sir michael was challenged about the increased worked of teachers caused by a large number of children who could not speak english
sir michael said : ' schools need the resources to deal with that
' when they 're faced with an influx of children from other countries , they need the resources and capacity to deal with it , and if those resources are n't there , that 's a big issue for government
' net long - term migration to the britain was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending september 2014 , a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier but a week later mrs morgan questioned sir michael 's language and played down the scale of the problem
' obviously sir michael has gone round to various schools but no , when i go round schools i see that they have adapted and are doing extremely well with students who do come from abroad
' everyone who comes to britain should know how to speak english , labour miliband has warned as he admitted labour made mistakes on immigration
