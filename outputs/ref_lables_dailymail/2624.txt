a new collaborative robot can work alongside human factory workers helpful robots are typically shown as mechanical maids or humanoid teachers in sci - fi films
the fanuc cr-35ia claims to be the first ' heavy - lifting industrial collaborative robot ' to work with humans without the need for safety fences
the coventry - based company fanuc 's robot uses integrated vision technology called irvision to keep an eye on humans and automatically stops if it touches an operator
this removes the need for safety fences - a previous requirement for all industrial robots - and is said to increase efficiency and enable a higher level of automation , the firm claims
the robot can lift objects weighing up to 77 lbs ( 35kg ) and could be used in a number of industries , from warehouses to production lines
for example , it could move heavy objects or assemble parts within a shared workspace without safety fences
â collaborative robot technology opens up a new era for manufacturing in which humans and robots will work even more closely on tasks ; increasing productivity and efficiencies across the plant floor , â said chris sumner , vice president of fanuc
the fanuc cr-35ia claims to be the first ' heavy - lifting industrial collaborative robot ' to work with human employees without the need for safety fences
in the car industry for instance , many are automated so that robots perform the bulk of dangerous tasks , such as welding ( pictured ) , away from humans some 15,000 robots pick up items ordered by customers in warehouses to save humans walking miles
the robot can lift up to 77 lbs ( 35kg )
it 's designed to work alongside humans without the need for safety fences
the robot stops what it 's doing if it touches a human
it 's designed to be as reliable as other robots on production lines and could be used in warehouses to lift heavy objects , for example
â the squat orange robots use technology acquired when the company bought robot - maker kiva systems in 2012 , according to dave clark , amazon 's senior vice president for operations
