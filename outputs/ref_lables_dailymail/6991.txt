boy , would tiger woods like to find a fairway here , â said former professional david feherty
tiger woods had worked so hard on his short game , the other quality needed to take a safe passage through these parts had been forgotten
so tiger woods âs short game is killing him ? opposite
there has been so much yip yap these last few weeks it was forgotten that tiger woods was becoming more erratic off the tee , long before his chipping went west
from the first , when he drifted into a bunker on the right , to the final par five , when he fired one into the crowd , castigating himself as a â dumbass â â although a shout of â fore â might have been more helpful â woods took the long road around augusta
the galleries were packed as crowd favourite tiger woods struggled on his first round at augusta tiger woods reacts to a poor chip shot on the third hole as the pressure begins to tell tiger woods feels the heat at augusta with the world no 111 struggling to get under par during the opening round that he recorded a relatively respectable score â some significant distance off the lead , but certainly in the ball park of what would have been considered a reasonable number given that this was his first competitive golf for two months â was testament to his cussedness as much as his talent
tiger woods dug deep and his play around the greens saved him
on the sixth , a par three , tiger woods missed the green again
how he must miss that old tiger woods
the best poker players do nât have tells and tiger woods likes las vegas as much as any high roller
it was still a tiger woods gallery , of course
still the biggest , still primed to applaud even the tiniest glimmer of his genius
but they would have recognised this as tiger woods bluffing
so tiger woods got it close and made the solid up and down
if tiger woods âs short game was as bad as it had looked last time , the ball could easily have taken a bath
â i made two dumb mistakes , â said tiger woods
â even so , dramatic saves were nât all the old tiger woods was about
tiger woods hits and off they go to see tiger woods hit again
but tiger woods is hitting more and more
not the 82 times he hit at the waste management phoenix open in january perhaps , but more times than he would have hit in such benign conditions at augusta in the old days , when he would nât have been so pleased to tie for 41st place after 18 holes
the crowd lost the flight , the cameraman too , but woods did nât
and then it was 2015 again and he left his 25 footer short
par. woods was not impressed with his approach shot to the 10th , but he managed to salvage par on the hole woods ' beau lindsey vonn was in attendance as her other half mopped his sopping brow with a towel woods , jimmy walker and jamie donaldson walk to the 6th green during an absorbing day 's play increasingly , his gallery writes cheques the man in the arena can not cash
they were 14 rows deep just to watch him walk the ten strides from putting green to first tee
even for augusta in april it was unseasonably warm : 89 , according to the weather channel
tiger woods breezed through , to applause , cheers and the odd whoop ; the love of the common people
swallowed up as the ropes dropped and the crowd fell in behind him
will he , wo nât he ? could he , could nât he ? they had seen the man , but would they ever see the man ? he was coming here with a new game , and a new mindset , but was this a new tiger woods ? woods lines up his putt on the par three sixth as the 15 - time major winner had a solid start to the day tiger woods shows his fury at a chip from a bunker on the fourth , but he managed to steady the ship woods patrols the augusta fairways on a largely frustrating round for the former world no 1 no. not a new tiger woods like the old tiger woods anyway
he was better than the tiger woods that departed torrey pines in february , with fears for his long - term future
but he was still the 111th ranked golfer in the world
a bit rusty , a bit erratic , a bit brilliant , a bit fallible
and that is tiger woods âs problem
tiger woods wills his second shot from the 14th on with the galleries gripped on the unfolding soap opera woods looks anxiously as his tee shot from the 15th sails into the still georgia skies on a perfect day for golf woods finished the day at one over as he looks forlornly at a shot on the eighth
