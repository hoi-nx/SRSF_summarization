arsenal are only three signings away from winning the title and should start by pinching chelsea goalkeeper petr cech , according to former gunners midfielder parlour
petr cech is likely to be watching from the substitutes bench when arsenal face chelsea at the emirates stadium on sunday , having made only four league starts this season
mourinho 's men are 10 points clear going into the game this weekend but parlour believes signing petr cech in the summer can help arsenal overcome the blues next year
parlour believes arsenal moving for petr cech this summer would be a ' no brainer ' the experienced keepers has made just four league starts this season for the blues ' petr cech would definitely be on my radar if i was arsene , ' said parlour , who was speaking at the boot camp stage of the people 's pundit , championed by carlsberg - the official beer of the england team and the premier league
if you can get petr cech for around Â£ 10m and sell szcezsny for Â£ 6m , it 's a great deal for arsenal
' the question is will chelsea sell to a rival ? i 'm not sure they will
' arsenal can make it nine consecutive league victories with a win on sunday and the team 's strong finish to the campaign has given gunners fans hope for a more sustained title challenge next year
chelsea ground out a 1 - 0 victory against manchester united last time out and parlour expects the league leaders to be resolute again on sunday
parlour believes the gunners should sell wojciech szczesny in order to sign petr cech this summer ' a draw is a perfect result for chelsea , ' parlour said
chelsea will win the league but there 's still a battle for second , third and fourth so it 's a bigger game for arsenal than it is for chelsea
