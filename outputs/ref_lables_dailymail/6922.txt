former sports minister gerry sutcliffe says new allegations surrounding the bradford fire in 1985 which claimed 56 lives do not justify a new inquiry into the disaster
a new book claims that the fire at valley parade was just one of at least nine fires at businesses owned by or associated with the club 's then chairman stafford heginbotham , who died in 1995
gerry sutcliffe , mp for bradford south and deputy leader of bradford city council at the time of the tragedy , says he knew stafford heginbotham ' flew by the seat of his pants ' in terms of the finances of the club but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry by high court judge mr justice popplewell that the fire was an accident
a memorial to the people who dies in the 1985 fire at valley parade the judge ruled the fire was started by a spectator dropping a cigarette into the rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand
gerry sutcliffe said : ' the inquiry by mr justice popplewell concluded that it was caused by a discarded cigarette in what was an old wooden stand and i have not heard anything to convince me that that was not the case
the fire at bradford 's valley parade claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on may 11 , 1985 ' but i think the inquiry was very thorough at the time and i do n't think there needs to be another because of this
the book , published on thursday and being serialised in the guardian , does not make any direct allegations but fletcher says stafford heginbotham 's history with fires , which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around Â£ 27million in today 's terms , warranted further investigation
