farage suffered a fresh blow today after a new poll showed ukip trailing badly in a series of key seats
across 10 constituencies targeted by mr farage 's party , ukip has fallen 18 points behind the tories and seven behind labour
the revelation came as mr farage admitted that he had ' made some mistakes ' during the campaign but insisted he was confident he could get it back on track
however , speaking to channel 4 news tonight , mr farage insisted he was looking forward to the rest of the campaign and had ' a bit of the old vim and vigour back '
my desperation for ukip to do well meant that i really packed the diary and the day in a way that frankly was n't very bright
' the ukip leader - appearing on itv 's lorraine this morning - said he had ' made some mistakes ' by trying to do too much and had had to scale back his commitments mr farage insisted he was looking forward to the rest of the campaign and had ' a bit of the old vim and vigour back ' the admission came as the deputy prime minister nick clegg accused mr farage of being an ' odious victor meldrew ' character
the democrats leader condemned cameron 's appeal to ukip supporters to ' come home ' , warning the ' bandwagons of the far right ' are encircling an ' increasingly hapless conservative leadership ' which is losing all grip on the party
nick clegg told mailonline that mr farage was ' odious ' the democrats leader condemned cameron 's appeal to ukip supporters to ' come home ' , warning the ' bandwagons of the far right ' are encircling an ' increasingly hapless conservative leadership ' which is losing all grip on the party
the ukip leader said ' millions ' of refugees could arrive on boats in europe over the next few years unless they are intercepted and turned back now
the poll by ipsos mori suggests this unhappiness may be the key factor behind large numbers of conservative voters switching to ukip
cameron and boris johnson campaigned together in london with polls showing that the tories are on course to hold on to a string of key marginals of those who supported cameron in 2010 , but now intend to vote for mr farage 's party , 94 per cent are dissatisfied with immigration policy
this compared to 45 per cent of voters sticking with the tories
this loss of voters to ukip could be crucial in deciding the outcome of the general election on may 7 â with the prime minister now facing a race against time to win them back
for all voters , six in ten electors say they are unhappy about the tories handling of the nation 's borders
during the current campaign , the tories , labour and liberal democrats have all avoided talking about the subject
the public considers labour and the tories to be just as bad as one another when it comes to getting a grip
