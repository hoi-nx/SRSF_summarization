a controversial anti-vaccination organisation has come under fire for comparing compulsory vaccination to rape in a social media post
the avn , an anti-vaccinations lobby group , posted an image to their facebook page on thursday which shows a man holding a woman with his hand over her mouth in an aggressive silencing gesture
the avn has come under fire for comparing vaccinations to rape the image was posted in response to tough new laws announced by social services minister scott morrison earlier in april , which means that parents will no longer be able to access childcare benefits simply by signing a form that says they object to immunisation based on ' personal , philosophical or religious ' reasons
however , a president of the avn said the message had nothing to do with the group
' i can state categorically that the australian vaccination-skeptics network inc does not support or agree with the sentiments or messages portrayed in the picture , ' she said
' ' what the avn does support and believe in , is the right of all parents to make an informed choice in regards to vaccinating their children , whether they vaccinate , selectively vaccinate or do not vaccinate at all , ' she said
the new federal law , which was in part prompted by the death of one - month - old riley hughes from complications arising from whooping cough , means that parents who refuse to immunise their children are set to lose up to $ 15,000 a year for every child when the changes come into force from january 1 , 2016
the post , which has since been removed , caused an instant outcry from followers and opponents of the group alike , with social media users labelling the post ' tasteless ' , ' disgusting ' , and a possible trigger for those who had suffered sexual assault
the administrator of the page defended the post , maintaining that is was n't tasteless , but honest
and if you find this post confronting â imagine how you would feel if you were a parent who was being told that they were going to have to vaccinate their children or starve
social media users labelling the post ' tasteless ' , ' disgusting ' , and a possible trigger for those who had suffered sexual assault the image was posted in response to tough new ' no jab , no pay ' laws which was announced by social services minister scott morrison earlier in april ' to compare a doctor injecting a child against something like the measles to rape â¦ it 's obscene , ' ms mccormack told the age
' as written in the about section , the avn has not owned this facebook page for some time
the avn has previously used the metaphor of rape to oppose vaccinations , when reports of a child being given a court order to be immunised was labelled by the group as ' court ordered rape '
the avn has previously used the metaphor of rape to oppose vaccinations ' think this is an exaggeration ? think again
' the health care complaints commission released a statement in relation to the avn last year , which contained a warning for members of the public when considering the information the lobby group posted on their website
' avn does not provide reliable information in relation to certain vaccines and vaccination more generally , ' the statement said
' the tough new vaccination law was in part prompted by the death of one - month - old riley hughes from complications arising from whooping cough on wednesday , a post to the page said that the controversial post was made by someone independent to the organisation in december 2012 , the new south wales department of fair trading ordered the avn ( avn ) - which ms dorey was then president of - to change its name or risk being shut down
the avn claims to be pro-choice and a ' vaccine safety watchdog ' however , t - shirts on the group 's website seemed to promote more fierce objectives which rule out vaccinating children at all
