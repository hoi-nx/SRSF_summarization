melissa wilson and her team - mates are on the brink of making history
on saturday , at the 161st oxford - boat race , the women âs crews will battle the same river thames course as the men , who will follow an hour later

wilson , 21 , said : â i remember when i was 14 watching with my dad and my brother and saying â are there going to be women on ? â they laughed â not in a malicious way â and said : â there are nât any women , you could cox i guess â
so the fact that 10 years on there is a women âs race on the tideway and i âm in it is pretty remarkable
