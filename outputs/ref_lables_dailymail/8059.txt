officially it 's known as a ' forward three - and - a - half somersaults with one twist pike ' but unofficially it 's the ' firework ' and daley hopes it 's the dive that turns london bronze into rio gold
the former world champion knows he needs to push the boundaries of his sport and spent most of last year battling to master his ' demon ' dive , a dizzying combination of somersaults and twists he had hoped would prove the difference
daley spent long hours on the trampoline perfecting technique before building the dive in stages from different heights
daley hopes his new ' firework ' dive can help win olympic gold at the 2016 rio de janiero games it was painstaking and detailed work but the dive finally got its premiere at the british championships and was part of daley 's repertoire when he won silver , with a personal best score , at the recent world diving series in dubai
' there was a sense of relief when we decided to bin the old dive but the pressure was on to come up with something , ' admitted daley
' we tried doing it at the beginning but it made the dive really hard because the g - force getting into your pike shape is really difficult
' daley ( right ) has spent the winter modifying the plunge with his new coach jane it 's six years since daley won his breakthrough world title in rome , one year after making his olympic debut as a 14 - year old in beijing
last year there were inaccurate reports that daley was to call time on his diving career but he insists he 's enjoying the sport more than ever , following the decision to relocate from plymouth to london
his home pool is now the olympic pool , a place with happy memories , and he 'll be the star attraction at next month 's fina diving world series , 1 - 3 may in his newly - adopted hometown
but daley is no longer the sole standard bearer for british diving , jack laugher became the first non-chinese diver to win on the fina diving world series this year in dubai and tonia couch and synchro partner sarah barrow are also established among the world 's elite
it 's normally a sell - out and the atmosphere is a bit more electric than anyone else , it gives you that extra adrenaline rush and , in theory , it should get us to dive a little bit better
' and daley hopes his new dive will bring victory at next month 's fina diving world series in london but daley 's key ambition for the season in this summer 's world championships in kazan
so it 's a really good marker to see how the new dive 's going and how all of that is piecing together and it 's exactly the half - way mark competition wise so i 'm really looking forward to it
