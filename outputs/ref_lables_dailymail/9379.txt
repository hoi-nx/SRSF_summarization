it is an astronomical nightmare - if an asteroid were spotted headed towards esrin earth , what could humanity do about it ? the esa 's latest mission hopes to find out if crashing into it will help
the mission will take place in two parts , and this month marked the start of preliminary design work on esa 's asteroid impact mission , or aim
intended to demonstrate technologies for future deep - space missions , aim will also be the esa 's very first investigation of planetary defence techniques
launched in october 2020 , aim will travel to a binary asteroid system â the paired didymos asteroids , which will come a comparatively close 11 million km to esrin earth in 2022
this smaller body is aim 's focus : the spacecraft will perform high - resolution visual , thermal and radar mapping of the moon to build detailed maps of its surface and interior structure
aim will also put down a lander â esa 's first touchdown on a small body since rosetta 's philae landed on a comet last november
aim 's findings will be returned by high - capacity laser link to esa 's optical ground station on tenerife in the canary islands
a similar collision was achieved back in 2005 , when nasa 's deep impact spacecraft shot a copper impactor into asteroid tempel 1
in late 2022 , the nasa - led part of aida will arrive : the double asteroid redirection test , or dart , probe will approach the binary system â then crash straight into the asteroid moon at about 6 km / s. ' aim will be watching closely as dart hits didymoon , ' explains ian carnelli , managing the mission for esa
in 2020 aim will head to the paired didymos asteroids , which will come a comparatively close 11 million km to esrin earth in 2022 launched in october 2020 , aim will travel to a binary asteroid system â the paired didymos asteroids , which will come a comparatively close 11 million km to esrin earth in 2022
' aim and aida will be discussed at this month 's international academy of astronautics planetary defense conference , hosted at esa 's esrin earth observation centre in frascati , italy , which will be devoted to assessing the risk of impacts from asteroid and comets and envisaging possible responses
