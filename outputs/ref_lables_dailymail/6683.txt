it 's been a frustrating few weeks but at our end we are trying everything we can to make the fight that everyone in this country wants to see â scott quigg against carl frampton
you 'll have seen by now that we have offered frampton Â£ 1.5million for the fight â all he has to do is turn up , we will take all the risks
if they do , cash the cheque and come to the manchester arena on july 18
scott quigg is desperate to fight carl frampton and has offered him Â£ 1.5million to do so on july 18 promoter eddie hearn produced a cheque for Â£ 1.5m live on television on tuesday i hope they do because i really ca n't understand what is stopping them
if this only generates average pay - per - view numbers then he might only make a third of what carl frampton is getting
personally , i think it will do big numbers and then scott quigg will probably get about the same as carl frampton
the fact is it 's not about cyclone or matchroom , it 's about scott quigg and carl frampton
carl frampton made the first defence of his world title against chris avalos in february in any case , scott quigg will fight on july 18 at manchester arena
i have held talks with both nonito donaire , the filipino sensation , and kiko martinez
scott quigg has options but he knows the biggest fight in the super-bantamweight division is a unification against carl frampton
it is looking very likely at the moment that kell brook will fight on my may 30 card at the o2 arena
with kevin mitchell and selby fighting for world titles and anthony joshua taking on kevin johnson , the addition of kell brook will make this one of the very best cards this country has seen in years
many have called for a fight between the ibf 's no 5 ranked fighter frankie gavin to face kell brook
kell brook looks set to make a quick return to the ring with an appearance on may 30 at the o2 arena it 's been an interesting few months for frankie gavin
in november he won the british and commonwealth titles against bradley skeete and now his options look like a fight for the ibf international title against chris van heerden , an ibf title eliminator against bradley , or a straight fight against the holder , who happens to be kell brook
as his promoter , i ca n't see the merit in him going to america to fight bradley if kell brook is an option on may 30
frankie gavin could challenge kell brook for his world title in london in an all - british showdown the public , more than anything , like an all - british fight
and every 10 minutes since we signed frankie gavin he has been asking for a fight with kell brook
anthony joshua made it 11 stoppage wins from as many fights when he beat jason gavern in newcastle anthony joshua is likely to fight in birmingham on may 9 before taking on kevin johnson three weeks later we will now carry on full speed with a guy who i am convinced will soon be a world champion
