scientists believe the first complex conversation between humans took place around 50,000 to 100,000 years ago
but in a new study , one linguist argues that human language developed rapidly with people quickly using complex sentences that sound like our own
scientists believe the first complex conversation between humans gradually took place around 50,000 to 100,000 years ago
much of it , they believe , still involved cavemen grunting , or hunter - gatherers mumbling and pointing , before learning to speak in a detailed way ' the hierarchical complexity found in present - day language is likely to have been present in human language since its emergence , ' says shigeru miyagawa , professor of linguistics at massachusetts institute of technology
most scholars believe that humans first started using a ' proto - language ' , which was a primitive kind of communication with only a gradual development of words and syntax
but according to professor shigeru miyagawa , single words bear traces of syntax showing that they must be descended from an older , syntax - laden system , rather than from simple , primal utterances
remains from this species have been dated between 300,000 and 125,000 years ago professor shigeru miyagawa has a different theory about what created human language
he says humans combined an ' expressive ' layer of language , as seen in birdsong , with a ' lexical ' layer , as seen in monkeys who utter isolated sounds , such as alarm calls
in his paper , professor shigeru miyagawa writes that a single word today can be ' internally complex , often as complex as an entire phrase , ' making it less likely that words we use today are descended from a presyntax mode of speech
' hierarchical structure is present not only in single words , but also in compounds , which , contrary to the claims of some , are not the structureless fossilised form of a prior stage , ' he says
earlier this year , researchers argued that cavemen initially began communicating 2.5 to 1.8 million years ago - and they were talking about diy
he believes it is possible that studies of the concept of ' symmetry - breaking , ' a potentially distinctive part of sentence formation , ' may offer new empirical data to test the hypothesis and shed light on the birth of human language
