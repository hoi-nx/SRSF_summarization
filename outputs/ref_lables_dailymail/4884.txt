did you blink ? there was a total eclipse of the moon on saturday - but it was an unusually short one
the lunar event - where earth 's shadow completely blocks the moon - lasted only five minutes , making it the shortest eclipse of the century , nasa said
but observatory staff in sydney were unable to see the eclipse due to cloudy weather and instead wrote on twitter : ' our live feed from the griffith observatory [ in north america ] is showing gorgeous totality pink ! ' do n't blink ! the moon may have shone red for three hours but it was only visible to citizens for five minutes ( pictured over new zealand ) on the west coast of north america , the total eclipse â what astronomers call totality â began shortly before 5am pt they accompanied their tweet with a picture of a bright pink moon
' blood moon ' refers to its orange or red appearance , which is the result of sunlight scattering off earth 's atmosphere
unlike more lengthy eclipses , the moon in this case only skimmed the upper part of earth 's shadow
' ' blood moon ' refers to its orange or red appearance â the result of sunlight scattering off earth 's atmosphere , seen here in santa barbara unlike solar eclipses which require eye protection , you only need clear skies to view this lunar eclipse ( pictured over santa barbara ) whether the moon appears dark red , copper or bronze depends on several factors including the amount of volcanic ash in the atmosphere as well as california , the eclipse could also be seen in its entirety on saturday night from eastern australia , new zealand and japan the total lunar eclipse is observed above cherry blossoms in shiraishi city , miyagi district , northeastern japan on saturday geoff chester of the u.s. naval observatory in washington added that it was the changes in colour that makes lunar eclipses so interesting
but those who missed out in australia will have to wait until january 31 , 2018 , for the next lunar eclipse
japan sky - gazers caught the moon when it was still white and out of the earth 's shadow it is the third of four consecutive lunar eclipses separated by six months - a tetrad - which is very rare atmospheric : the sky ( pictured in japan ) burned a deep red as the gleaming orange light shone through the clouds in new york , where the sun was rising , the sky glared orange from the reflection of the sun 's rays from the moon the full moon is seen over the santa monica mountains in topanga , california , shortly before it turns red during the lunar eclipse the moon is seen behind downtown high - rise buildings during the shortest total lunar eclipse of the century before dawn sky - gazers will have a better chance of catching the next full lunar eclipse on september 28 , that will last over an hour
