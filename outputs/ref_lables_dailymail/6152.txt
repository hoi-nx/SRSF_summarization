now an israel team of developers has built a ' thermal protection ' case that not only warns you when your phone is getting too hot , it will automatically cool it down
called amited , the case uses micro-fans to blow heat away from the device , or can heat a phone using resistance coils if it gets too cold
sensors in the case monitor the phone 's temperature and if it gets too hot , optimal will cool the device using two built - in micro-fans
and if it gets too hot , optimal engages its anti-freeze protection mode to gently heat the phone using resistance coils the recommended storage temperature for most batteries is 15 Â° c ( 59 Â° f ) , while the ' extreme allowable ' temperature is 40 Â° c to 50 â° c ( 40 Â° c to 122 Â° f )
optimal syncs with a smartphone over bluetooth and constantly analyses the phone 's temperature when auto mode is enabled , using built - in temperature and humidity sensors
optimal syncs with a smartphone over bluetooth and constantly analyses the phone 's temperature when auto mode is enabled , using built - in temperature and humidity sensors
users can then set their own custom temperatures zones and set alarm thresholds inside the 0.19 - inch ( 5mm ) thick case is a pair of ' virtually silent ' , 0.07inch ( 2mm ) micro-fans with air flow of 1.3 litres per minute
when optimal notices a drop in temperature , anti-freeze mode will engage these coils to stop the phone from freezing , even in sub-freezing conditions
optimal 's sensors are pictured
when optimal 's air vents are blocked , for example when the phone is in a pocket or bag , it will alert the user to warn them the temperature in their phone needs to be corrected
alternatively , the phone can use optimal 's built - in battery as a backup optimal is fitted with temperature sensors , resistance coils and two 2mm micro-fans
it syncs with a smartphone over bluetooth and constantly analyses the phone 's temperature when in auto mode
if it gets too hot , optimal will cool the device using the micro-fans
and if the phone gets too hot , optimal engages its anti-freeze protection to gently heat the phone using the resistance coils
auto mode can be switched off at any time , though , and people can manually analyse their phone 's temperature , as well as see which apps impacting the device
plus , when optimal 's air vents are blocked , for example when the phone is in a pocket or bag , it alerts the user to warn them the temperature of their phone needs to be corrected
alternatively , the phone can use optimal 's built - in battery as a backup
when auto mode is enabled , these subtle temperature changes are tracked automatically , but this mode can be disabled and users can manually track these changes using the optimal app. this app shows temperature changes over time , but also reveals which apps are having the highest thermal effect on the phone
