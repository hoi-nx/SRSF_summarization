frampton has been offered a huge Â£ 1.5million payday to face quigg in one of the biggest all - british fights in recent memory
talks between the two super-bantamweight world champions have reached a standstill , but quigg âs promoter , hearn , attempted to jolt frampton âs camp into a july 18 fight in manchester by offering the biggest cheque of the northern irishman âs career to date
hearn presents the cheque for Â£ 1.5m to set - up quigg 's fight with frampton matchroom boss hearn said the cheque offered 1.5m reasons for the two boxers to fight quigg stares down the camera to tell frampton to ' put his money where his mouth is ' it âs a bold move that could see quigg pocket substantially less frampton if the pay - per - view purchases do not meet hearn âs predictions
i generally believe he wants the fight but we will find out if he actually does â there is Â£ 1.5m if he wants it
â quigg is the defending wba super-bantamweight champion and wants to fight frampton in manchester quigg celebrates his win over hidenori othake at the liverpool echo arena in november last year hearn added : â quigg might not get Â£ 1.5m
if it does nât do the pay - per - view buys that we anticipate , quigg might get a third of that ( Â£ 500,000 to frampton âs Â£ 1.5m )
those talks ended in stalemate , with cyclone promotions insisting on tuesday that hearn would have to return to the negotiating table if the fight is to happen
â if matchroom does not want to meet , frampton will make an optional defence of his ibf world title this summer
