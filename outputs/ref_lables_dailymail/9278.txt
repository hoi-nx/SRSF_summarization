but a police poster advising women to stick together on a night out provoked anger yesterday , as campaigners claimed it suggested victims were responsible for sex attacks
sussex police was accused of â victim - blaming â in its campaign , which urges women not to leave their friends alone or let them wander off with strangers
women âs rights groups said rapists were to blame for sex attacks , not their victims
anti-rape campaigners have criticised the message in this sussex police poster arguing it implies that victims are to blame for getting raped but the poster won praise from supporters who said it was â blindingly obvious â that it was not blaming women , and that it simply offered â sensible advice â
it features a picture of two smiling young women posing for a selfie , with the text : â which one of your mates is most vulnerable on a night out ? the one you leave behind
â but anti-rape campaigners said police should target potential attackers instead , and that the poster sent a message that women needed a constant chaperone
she added : â we need to get beyond police campaigns giving instructions to women on how to behave to be safe
â campaign : the posters are due to be put up in pub and club toilets as well as bus stops in brighton ( pictured ) as well as other areas of sussex police a pair of police officers watch on as university students gather on the street outside a bar in brighton fabia bates , of the survivors â network , said : â sussex police has made great strides to encourage people to report sexual violence and there is the possibility this could damage people âs confidence
â chief inspector katy woolford said the police had a responsibility to advise potential victims on how to minimise risks but david davies , a former special constable who is running for re-election as tory mp for monmouth , said he thought the poster offered â common sense advice â , adding : â i do nât think it âs blaming victims ... it âs like telling people to lock car doors
â i âm quite sure that sussex police in no way intended to imply that women are somehow responsible for any attack , â he said
