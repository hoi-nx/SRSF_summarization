bournemouth are within touching distance ; they can almost smell the big - time
but winning a place in the top - flight has never been easy ; bournemouth are finding exactly that out
wilson celebrates after opening the scoring for bournemouth in the fourth minute wilson opens the scoring for bournemouth early on against reading at the madejski stadium reading : federici , gunter , a pearce , hector , obita , chalobah ( appiah 67 ) , karacan ( danny williams 59 ) , ake , mccleary , jamie mackie , robson-kanu ( aiyegbeni 81 ) subs not used : kelly , norwood , andersen , stacey booked : a pearce , hector bournemouth : artur boruc , simon francis , elphick , steve cook , daniels , ritchie , arter , andrew surman , marc pugh ( smith 69 ) , kermorgant ( pitman 75 ) , wilson ( jones 90 ) subs not used : camp , gosling , fraser , ward goal : wilson 4 booked : artur boruc , simon francis , wilson , smith referee : keith stroud attendance : 18,917 but , as of yet , the cherries are n't choking , wilson 's 22nd goal of the season setting them on their way to a third successive win at the madejski stadium
this victory secured bournemouth 's position in the top - six , meaning - at the very least - that they 'll have a crack at promotion via the play - offs
and so it proved as the cherries took a fourth minute lead when wilson fired home from close range after andrew surman 's shot from the edge of the area struck federici 's far post
but the visitors had goalkeeper artur boruc to thank in the 17th minute as he produced an outstanding one - handed save to deny jamie mackie 's close range effort from obita 's cross
and despite yann kermogrant sending a towering header from marc pugh 's cross narrowly wide during the dying seconds of the first - half , bournemouth 's early mojo had vanished
bournemouth 's simon francis ( left ) on the run with nathaniel cahalobah in hot pursuit players appeal to referee keith stroud ( right ) as wilson lies injured on the ground howe would have been happy to get his players in at half - time ; his side , in truth , were starting to rock
though , goalscorer wilson was booked for diving in the 55th minute as the striker took the necessity for points too far
and bournemouth were struggling to create the opportunities that would have calmed their manager 's obvious nerves
the reading defence made a mockery of trying to clear a bournemouth throw deep inside their half , the ball eventually fell to richie who let fly with a curling left - footed effort that skimmed the top of federici 's far post
wilson ( bottom ) is challenged by reading 's alex pearce during the championship clash reading manager steve clarke gestures to his players but the hosts could not find a way back but reading refused to lie down , and had danny williams not miskicked in the final six minutes then the hosts could easily have pulled level
wilson missed a glorious chance to seal victory for bournemouth in the 87th minute , but his control let him down at the vital moment
and the visitors had endure some terrifying moments as reading laid siege to the cherries goal
