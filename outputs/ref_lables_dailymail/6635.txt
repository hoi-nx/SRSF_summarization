most teens would be mortified to have a parent chaperone their prom - let alone take one of them as a date
the 17 - year - old albertville , alabama high school junior was proud to be escorted by her grandfather to the annual end - of - year dance this weekend
webb told daily mail online that she asked her 80 - year - old ' poppa ' drain to prom because he never got to attend the dance himself
drain dropped out of school after the eighth grade and then enlisted in the navy in 1951 at age 17 - just in time to be shipped off to serve in the korean war

about a month ago , when her grandfather was over for dinner , joy webb asked if he would be her date and he agreed
getting ready : on saturday night , drain came over to his granddaughter 's house and the two swapped a boutonniere and corsage for the event prom pictures : then , like typical prom dates , the two posted for pictures outside joy webb 's house in their evening wear family photo : after having a pre-prom dinner , joy webb and her grandfather went on a horse and carriage ride around town drain then escorted his granddaughter to mater 's restaurant for prom dinner , where he had a special surprise waiting for the granddaughter he calls ' princess '
her grandmother died two years ago on thanksgiving , and joy webb says her grandfather now commutes to a senior center in a nearby town ever friday night to dance
drain was apparently the life of the party at the prom , with joy webb 's friends coming over to say high to and dance with the man they so often see at show choir and band concerts
' joy webb says her grandfather had a great time and even asked if they could go again together next year
