on sunday night , at the velodrome , it âs the stevedores against the dauphins
marseille vs psg â the hard - nosed , port - city , blue - collar roustabouts against the rich , privileged , capital - city - slickers
the way many in marseille have always viewed it â and always will
the home side are ligue 1 top scorers , two points behind the visitors who are leaders and have won seven of france âs last eight classique matches

but it is also a contest which pitches marseille âs ultra-eccentric , â is he a fraud / is he a genius ? â coach , bielsa , right where he wants to be
so obsessive has bielsa been about football for so long that it has devoured him
ergo , there has thus far been some success for the man who appointed him â marseille president labrune
initially , he reckoned : â getting bielsa , the perfect man for our project , was a huge stroke of luck
â i still sometimes ask myself how on earth we managed to get a coach like bielsa
marseille manager bielsa pictured during a press conference on friday ahead of the tie marseille have not had this many points in ligue 1 at this stage since winning the title back in 2010 the two men thrashed out a truce , which has held , in public at least , and that has yielded more of the â ready brek â glow which can envelop the early stages of a bielsa infestation
marseille have not had this many points at this stage since winning the title back in 2010 â only their second major trophy since 1992
at the volatile , passionate , but success - starved velodrome , the fans sing songs about argentina and chant bielsa âs name
bielsa âs deal is for two years , but a â break â clause is available to either side in june
bielsa âs bible says , literally : â running is commitment , running is understanding , running is everything â
bielsa âs is the forrest gump method
bielsa pictured during the 2002 world cup in japan as argentina competed in group f bielsa took 7,000 videos of matches , goals , players , free - kicks , corners and penalties with him to japan after his first season with the basques ended in sequential 3 - 0 defeats in the europa league and copa del rey finals , he tried a â but brutus is an honourable man â speech on his players
â it âs completely clear that you âve got it all wrong , â he accused
bielsa âs bible states : â running is commitment , running is understanding , running is everything â â it âs what has happened to me for the last 30 years
but to return to the original idea , this is where â el loco â yearns to be
nelson vivas recalls that when bielsa âs argentina were playing colombia away , he came in from the warm - up and told them : â in a street fight , there are two kinds of guy
â so of what will bielsa smell on sunday night ? success ? failure ? blood ?
