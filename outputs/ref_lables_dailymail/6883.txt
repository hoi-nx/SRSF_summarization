happiness on a plate : the mistley thorn has been around for ten years , and revels in an understated luxury we are paying Â£ 100 for two people , dinner , bed and breakfast
i am almost embarrassed and seek clarification from a friendly young man called rowan , who shows us to our room on the top floor with wonderful views across the stour estuary , where swans preen themselves as the sun sets and the tide recedes
we are in essex , just down the road from manningtree
seafood dining : mersea oysters are available year - round - as are colchester natives , when in season connected : the hotel is a two - minute walk from mistley station which has services to london liverpool street i had never heard of mistley , but what a fascinating spot , with a grand twin - towered church ( designed by robert adam ) that originally was meant to be a spa , gorgeous terraces of georgian houses , industrial buildings near the quay that have not yet been dolled up , a post office
the mistley thorn has been around for ten years , in the capable hands of californian sherri singleton
well set : built as a coaching inn circa 1723 , the mistley thorn offers award - winning dining and accommodation weekends too : the sunday lunch menu features roast red poll beef and local sutton hoo chicken it is a sunday evening , and plenty are in for dinner - unless they are still here from lunch
the mistley thorn is happiness on a plate
