a los angeles judge agreed with the governor 's decision to reject parole for a gary hinman follower imprisoned 43 years for two brutal murders

the parole board cited those accomplishments , along with his age and good behavior as reasons to grant him parole in march last year
gov. jerry brown rejected that decision in august , saying factors in his favor were outweighed by the brutality of the killings and davis ' lack of insight into the crimes , which he did n't admit until 2012 after claiming for years to be an innocent bystander
davis held gary hinman at gunpoint while gary hinman sliced his face open with a sword
' the judge said he gave broad deference to jerry brown 's discretion and that the governor 's decision in august did n't amount to cruel or unusual punishment
