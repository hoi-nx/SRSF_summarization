a teenage boy who stood before his florida church and made a heartbreaking plea for someone to adopt him has finally found the loving family he has always craved
davion only , 16 , had spent his entire life in foster care after his mother gave birth to him behind bars
on april 22 she will officially become davion 's mother
she admitted that it has not always easy integrating him into her existing family , but she said it was worth it
since august , davion has been spending weekends with connie and her daughters , sydney , 21 , carley , 17 , and with her adopted son taylor , who is now 14
then in december , going took the steps to begin the adoption process and davion moved with the rest of the family into a larger home
' davion became an example of the struggle faced by many teenagers in the system when in 2013 he stood up and told worshipers at his church : ' my name is davion and i 've been in foster care since i was born
' davion only , 16 , has been adopted by his old case worker , connie going in florida ( above )
davion had been in the foster care system his entire life davion ( above ) captured hearts in 2013 when he made a plea in front of a st petersburg church congregation for a family to ' love him forever ' most of all , davion said he just wanted a family that would ' love him forever '
millions of people around the country soon heard about davion 's story , and the young boy was even interviewed by barbara walters on the view , which all eventually led to him being adopted by a minister in ohio and his family
davion only ( pictured above with connie going at the church where he made his speech in 2013 ) was adopted by a minister in ohio but sent back into the system a few months later when he fought with one of the minister 's children going says she had begun to call him numerous times , but he always hung up the phone
the 52 - year - old case worker has three children of her own , one adopted and two biological daughters , and was a single mother , but she was no longer davion 's case worker , which made the process easier
' only now i get to call you that for real , right ? ' davion officially became part of the family in february however , when after he and going celebrated their birthdays , which fall on the same date , they went home and sat around the table for cake with his three siblings and signed the court papers
what 's more , because of that day in september 2013 when davion stepped up on the pulpit , hundreds of others have been adopted as well
' i guess i always thought of you as my mom , ' davion ( above in 2013 ) said to going last december
