support : kai , now 10 , with his mother rachel like most boys , he always preferred football to dolls
but kai started life as a girl â and knew from the age of three that he had been born into the wrong body
by four , he refused to wear dresses â and at six he wanted his hair cut short and developed a boyish awkwardness around girls
â now , at the age of ten , kai is set to undergo hormone treatment to halt puberty to stop him developing into a woman
miss windsor , from cheltenham , gloucestershire , said : â as a toddler , kai only wanted to play ball
â and as soon as he began school , he only wanted to wear trousers as the other boys did
but the single mother , who runs a health juice business , said kai had â amazing support â from his primary school
â then when he came out as transgender , they sent a letter out to all the parents in his year to explain he now wanted to be referred to as a boy
â kaia pretty in pink , aged four , pictured left , and dressing up as a pirate , at five , pictured right when kai was born there was no outward sign he was anything other than female
â she added : â looking back kai knew then he was a boy
â at seven , kai wanted his hair cut shorter
kai is now happy in his skin at last and is now set to undergo hormone treatment meanwhile , his grades immediately improved
â once people stopped referring to kai as a girl and he could just be the little boy he wanted , he was so much happier , â she said
kai is now set to have hormone treatment to curb puberty
