it looks like a cross between a catamaran and a hovercraft , but these strange vehicles are actually new new type of aircraft developed in china
two prototypes of the cyg-11 were tested this week over the sea off the coast of haikou in hainan province in china
the cyg-11 seaplane ( above ) uses reduced drag and increased lift from wing - in - ground effect to glide the vehicles takes advantage of an aerodynamic phenomenon known as the wing - in - ground effect - where lift is increased and drag decreased when an aircraft 's wings are close to the ground
length : 13m wingspan : 15.6 m weight : 3800 kg seats : 12 people maximum load : 1200 kg maximum range : 1500 km flight speed : 175 - 250 km / h flight height : 3 - 5 m wave height : 1.25 - 3 m by placing the wings low on the fuselage of the aircraft , this effect is increased and the the result is an aircraft that essentially floats on a cushion of air
with a maximum range of 930 miles ( 1,500 km ) , the aircraft can reach a top speed of 155 mph ( 250 km / h )
the cyg - 11 aircraft , which have been developed by the hainan yingge wing with russian engineers , can carry 10 passengers plus two flight crew
the hainan yingge wing in ground effect craft manufacturing company tested two prototypes of the plane the prototypes are designed to carry two pilots ( above ) and 10 passengers but larger craft are in development the plane can be used like a catamaran initially until it builds up enough speed to lift off from the ocean it says the aircraft could find uses for coastal defence , customs patrols and perhaps even be used as the public transport of the future along ' marine highways '
