parents craig and bonnie morgan want their children to have the best possible start in life
but so desperate are they to get their son craig â known to them as cj â into a local prep school that they âve put their house on the market in order to pay the fees
they âve also slashed their weekly grocery bills by more than half , taken in lodgers , and have pinned their hopes on a â crowd - funding â initiative , hoping members of the public will help them achieve their dream
they are selling it for Â£ 185,000 to help pay for craig jr 's prep school fees â we believe any child will benefit more from what a private education has to offer , â said mrs bonnie morgan
â morgans , from hastings in east sussex , settled on the idea of a private education for their children after cj , who they say is academically gifted , found that he was nât being stretched at his state primary school
â we always knew cj was very bright , â mrs bonnie morgan said
â despite his success at the local school â rated as outstanding â the morgans felt he was too bright for state education and not achieving as much as expected
â he won a trophy for his go - karting hobby and after taking it to school he was constantly taunted by two boys , â mrs bonnie morgan said
â friends and family ca nât understand why we are giving up everything ' to send cj to the Â£ 4,000 a term school , says mum bonnie morgan heartbroken , the morgans kept their son at home and contacted their local council to see if he could be transferred to a different primary school , but no places were available
eventually in august 2014 â and with cj refusing to return to his state school â he sat the entrance exam for battle abbey prep school
mrs bonnie morgan said : â he sailed through the exam and when we looked round the school , we all fell in love with it
â but at Â£ 4,000 a term , the fees were crippling for the family , particularly as their income depended on mr morgan âs work as a taxi driver
â our net monthly household income is Â£ 2,300 , â said mrs bonnie morgan
â as well as putting their house on the market , the morgans have taken in a number of lodgers and have set up a â gofundme â account in the hope of attracting donations of Â£ 115,000 from the public
mr morgan works as a taxi driver meaning the bishop abbey fees were crippling for the family , forcing them to sell their house , take in lodgers and attempt crowd - funding to afford them â holidays are out and even day trips are nât possible as we ca nât afford the petrol , â said mrs bonnie morgan
it means they have to sleep in the same bedroom as craig and me
â private school fees are a growing problem for parents , with those on middling incomes finding themselves increasingly forced out
since 1990 , fees have quadrupled , with the average cost of sending two children to private school now estimated at more than half a million pounds
mrs bonnie morgan said : â the fees include extras such as some after - school clubs and trips
the morgans have had to slash their weekly grocery bills by more than half to try and give cj , and in future his brother alfie , the private education they believe they deserve â our clothes come from second - hand shops and we âve even stopped the boys â pocket money , â mrs bonnie morgan added
once their house is sold , the morgans plan to rent a property , using about Â£ 85,000 of equity they have in their home to pay the fees
â ironically , as our mortgage is only around Â£ 200 a month and renting will cost about Â£ 1,000 , it is going to add to our outgoings , â mrs bonnie morgan said
