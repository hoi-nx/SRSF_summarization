researchers have discovered that people who have breathing problems while asleep are more likely to experience an early decline in memory and other brain functions
in a worrying study , they found that people with sleep apnoea - a condition often typified by heavy snoring - saw a mental decline more than a decade earlier , on average , than those who had no sleep problems
people who have breathing problems while asleep are more likely to experience an early decline in memory and other brain functions the us researchers â results also suggested that the onset of alzheimer âs might be accelerated among those with sleeping problems
at least half a million british suffer from sleep apnoea , which is most often found in middle - aged , overweight men
study author dr osorio , of new york university , said : â abnormal breathing patterns during sleep such as heavy snoring and sleep apnoea are common in the elderly
their investigation , published in the journal neurology , found that people with sleep breathing problems were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment at an average age of 77
those with no breathing problems , in comparison , did not typically see a decline until age 90 - more than a decade later
among that group , those who had sleep breathing problems also developed alzheimer âs disease five years earlier than those who did not have sleep breathing problems , at an average age of 83 compared to 88
the onset of alzheimer âs might be accelerated among those with sleeping problem , experts said ( file photo ) the scientists also found that treating the problem with a night time air mask - known as continuous positive airway pressure or cpap - saw significant results
dr doug brown , director of research and development at the alzheimer âs society , said : â most of us do nât think of snoring as something to be concerned about but frequent , loud snoring could be a sign of sleep apnoea - a disorder that affects breathing during sleep
â in this study , those who reported a sleep apnoea developed cognitive decline a decade earlier than those without sleep breathing problems , but the link between sleep apnoea and alzheimer âs disease was much less clear
â a good supply of oxygen to the brain is vital to keep it healthy and it is interesting to see that treatment of sleep apnoea was associated with a trend towards a later onset of memory and thinking problems
