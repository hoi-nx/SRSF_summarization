shelly sterling has spoken out about her legal victory over her husband 's alleged mistress stiviano , saying she took the much - younger woman to court ' for justice '
the billionaire wife of former clippers owner sterling said she felt vindicated by the judge 's ruling this week that stiviano , 32 , must return $ 2.6 million in sugar daddy gifts
sterling , 80 , had lavished his alleged girlfriend with gifts including a $ 1.8 million house , luxury cars and stocks - all while hiding them from his wife of six decades
she said she drafted divorce papers last year , but never filed them
still , sterling is suing his wife and the nba over the $ 2 billion sale of the team
a year ago , a recording of sterling telling stiviano not to associate with black people led the nba to ban him for life and fine him $ 2.5 million
together : sterling is pictured with stiviano in 2011 as they watch the clippers play
he lost the team last year after a recording emerged in which he told stiviano not to be seen with black people shelly sterling added on wednesday that she mourns the loss of the team
in court : stiviano , pictured heading to court last month , accepted gifts worth $ 2.6 million from the older man and has now been ordered to hand them back over
the exact nature of their relationship was never clear shelly sterling had filed the suit against stiviano a month before the recording of her husband telling stiviano not to associate with black people created an uproar and led the nba to ban him for life
but judge richard fruin jr. said this claim was ' not believable ' and he relied instead on a recording in which she told sterling : ' i want shelly sterling to know you bought me the house
' still smiling : stiviano , pictured showing off her new braces , was seen out in los angeles earlier this month he ruled earlier this week that stiviano must now turn over the keys to the $ 1.8 million house and pay shelly sterling some $ 800,000 that her husband showered on the younger woman in gifts
it was stiviano who recorded the now - infamous conversation with sterling in which he berated her for associating with black people and urged her not to bring minorities with her to clippers games
in the subsequent furor , the nba banned sterling from the league for life , and he was ultimately forced to sell the clippers franchise he had owned for 33 years for a record $ 2 billion
