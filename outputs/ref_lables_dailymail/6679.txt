our young earth may have collided with a body similar to the planet mercury , says a new paper
and it could also explain why certain rare - earth elements in earth âs mantle do not seem to originate from the planet âs other building blocks - meteorites
oxford scientists say a mercury - like body struck the young earth ( artist 's illustration shown )
the object would have been the heat source for our planet 's core
it also explains where some rare - earth elements came from the study , by two scientists from the oxford , was published in the journal nature
however , this model can not explain where the heat source for earth âs core - and ultimately its magnetic field - came from
in addition , earth âs crust and mantle appear to have a higher ratio of the rare - earth elements samarium and neodymium than most meteorites - suggesting there was more at play in earth âs formation than first thought
to address this discrepancy , scientists believe that earth was hit by a body that was the size of mars - but like mercury in its composition - early in its life
many researchers believe the moon formed after earth was hit by a planet the size of mars billions of years ago
now scientists think that earth was hit by a body that was the size of mars , but like mercury ( right ) in its composition , early in its life
and they do not rule out the possibility that this is the same mars - sized body that formed the moon
