the tranquility of a high - priced inner - sydney suburb has been shattered as a transport war has broken out between locals and commuters
a fed up resident of cammeray , a wealthy north shore suburb , stuck a note to the windscreen of car parked near a school they believed belonged to an outsiders
this controversial note was left on the windscreen of a car by a fed - up resident of cammeray ' if you ca n't afford to park in the cbd do n't come here ! ! cammeray is not a parking lot for losers
' dijana wolffram , a local who is friends with the woman who found the note , said the letter created a few laughs among other residents when she posted it to a community facebook page
but we were horrified that such a nimby ( not in my backyard ) culture existed in cammeray
' the north shore suburb was split on the parking issue , with other locals ' horrified ' by the letter a local woman , who only wanted to be known as lauren , did not agree with the tone of the note , but said it was a real issue
it 's really annoying ... they park up your a * * * , sometimes taking up 2 spots
