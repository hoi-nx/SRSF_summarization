volunteers who have restored one of the dunkirk ' little ships ' are now hoping they will be able to take the unique vessel back to the beaches where it helped to rescue 600 british soldiers
fire boat massey shaw was requisitioned from the london fire brigade in 1940 and transported to dunkirk to help with the evacuation of allied troops in the face of the nazi germany advance
after carrying 600 soldiers back to british , the boat returned to london where it helped to save st paul 's cathedral and other buildings damaged in the blitz
they are now seeking additional funding to allow them to transport massey shaw to dunkirk next month , which will mark the 75th anniversary of the little ships ' adventure
comeback : it took six years to undo the damage wrought on the massey shaw and restore it to how it was in the 1930s interior : the engine room of the old fire boat , which is still working well even though it was first built 80 years ago on board : the controls and fire bell of the massey shaw have also been repaired thanks to a national lottery grant deck : the boat is mounted with a hose which can pump out 3,000 gallons of water every minute , the same as four fire engines saying goodbye : the massey shaw pictured on its final voyage before being decommissioned as a fire boat in 1971 mr rogers said : ' the boat was built in the 1930s and during its career fought fires along the thames and london before being called to dunkirk in 1940
it was the only fire boat to go
' it went with the little ships and was initially going to be used as a fire boat but the strafing and gun fire was too much
controls : volunteers who restored the boat praised the quality of its 80 - year - old engineering which still propels the boat journey : a charity needs to raise Â£ 10,000 so they can afford the fuel needed to take the massey shaw back to dunkirk this year repairs : the engine being removed from the interior of the boat while restoration works were going on commemoration : the vessel boasts a plaque marking its historic status as one of the dunkirk ' little ships ' ' of course she was involved in the blitz and the massey shaw 's pumps helped saved st paul 's cathedral
' the veteran firefighter , who spent 30 years with the london fire brigade , paid tribute to massey shaw 's unique survival
the trust is seeking at least Â£ 10,000 to pay for the fuel which would be needed to transport the boat from british to dunkirk
