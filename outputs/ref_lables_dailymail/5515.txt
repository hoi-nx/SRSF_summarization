â we did nât want to mess too much with thunderbirds but needed to make it in a way that would excite 21st - century children
â in a nod to 21st - century political correctness , there are also more women and several multicultural characters have been added as with the original , at the heart of thunderbirds are the five gung - ho tracy brothers , all named after real astronauts on america âs mercury space mission in the early 1960s : scott ( carpenter ) , john ( glenn ) , virgil ( grissom ) , gordon ( cooper ) and alan ( shephard )
their mission is to save the world through their secret organisation thunderbirds
