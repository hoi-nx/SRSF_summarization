the romantics will pick sean dyche or ronald koeman , the statistics lovers will go for jose mourinho or , at a push , arsene wenger
but for me there is one standout contender for manager of the year and that 's louis van gaal
manchester united boss louis van gaal is among those in the running for manager of the year manchester united 's players celebrate together during the derby win against rivals man city wayne rooney , young and juan mata celebrate during the 4 - 2 win against man city manuel pellegrini is punching above his weight at man city ... the club must think big or forever remain small forget eden hazard and michael carrick ... the best player in the barclays premier league this weekend was leicester city 's jamie vardy how stupid do some english football ' experts ' look now ? after the early - season defeats at mk dons and leicester city , they were laying into van gaal
so while he was busy trying to rectify the massive problems he inherited at manchester united , there were too many who could n't wait to hammer him for every single slip - up
listen , manchester united were seventh last season , their defence was decimated in the summer , and this season the two big signings â radamel falcao and angel di maria â have , for different reasons , failed to hit the heights they achieved previously
in fact , it 's mid-april and manchester united are still in the title race ( unlikely , but they 're just a point behind arsenal so of course they 're still in it )
and it highlighted one of the biggest strengths of van gaal 's reign at manchester united so far â the way he has worked with and improved individual players
all of a sudden young looks brilliant â it was n't just sunday , he 's been arguably manchester united 's best player this season
how many managers could have made young look convincing in a manchester united shirt ? at the start of the season i was asking the question about chris smalling and phil jones â could they make the centre - half spots their own ? i think that question is still pertinent , but those two played very well against man city and are starting to look the part in the old trafford back four
a little more than a year ago manchester united were humiliated at home by man city
