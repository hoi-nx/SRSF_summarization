armstrong admits taking receipt of his first premiership league winners â medal would help finalise the process of feeling like a celtic player
last may , at the culmination of an exciting season on tayside , armstrong and his young dundee united team - mates harboured high hopes of becoming just the third team in tannadice history to lift the scottish cup
celtic 's armstrong ( right ) is hoping to get his hands on the premiership title armstrong completed a move from dundee united to celtic during the january transfer window following a 2 - 0 defeat in the final against st johnstone , however , the 23 - year - old was left crestfallen as he watched the perth side celebrate their own slice of history on the parkhead turf
a year on and he is part of a celtic side rapidly closing in on a title that even derek mcinnes , manager of closest challengers aberdeen , admits is essentially over
while insisting nobody at celtic is taking league glory for granted , armstrong â who joined celtic on transfer deadline day - admits that a title party in the east end of glasgow next month would represent a green day to banish the blues that still hang over his head from a year ago
â last year âs scottish cup final at parkhead was a disappointing end to a very enjoyable season , â armstrong recalled ahead of his side 's lunchtime clash at inverness
â we had the joy of winning the scottish cup semi-final against rangers at ibrox so to then go on and lose in the final to st johnstone was very difficult to take
armstrong joined celtic along with his close friend and former dundee united team - mate gary â i âve been here at celtic a few months now and i âve played a few games so i do feel like a celtic player
but i would feel even more like a celtic player with a league winners â medal
â in this season when achieving just the fourth treble in celtic âs long history is a real possibility , armstrong , like close friend gary , has been limited to premiership action because of his involvement in the cups with dundee united earlier this season
his league cup - winning team - mates return to hampden next sunday to face inverness in the scottish cup semi finals and , while being on the outside for cup ties is undeniably frustrating , armstrong believes arriving in january has been of huge benefit in other ways
â it would be bizarre to maybe only be part of one part of a treble - but it âs also exciting to be part of a team who are capable of doing it , â he said
â but i definitely feel part of it at celtic now
even if it felt wrong not having my friend gary there in dubai with me , since we âre always together ! kris commons scored in celtic 's recent premiership 2 - 0 win over partick thistle â but being in dubai to relax let me reflect on everything that âs happened since january
but the advantage of coming in january was that by the time the qualifiers come round next season i will look forward to them rather than be nervous
