that âs the fantastic future imagined by one artist , whose awe - inspiring drawings of a next - generation space station in orbit reveal what space travel may one day look like
taking one of several imaginative space planes , in this future timeline you âll be partying to your heart âs content in an orbital extravaganza
concept artist alex brady from cambridge has created beautiful pictures of what space travel might look like
he imagines a space station of tomorrow similar to las vegas ( shown in image ) , with neon lights and plenty of attractions the images were created by concept artist alex brady , 32 , from cambridge in the uk , who normally works on video games and movies
several spacecraft docked at the space station can also be seen , based on similar designs for space planes
the cone - shaped space station is also shown in a state of partial completion , with space planes again making the journey from the ground
â it âs inspired by super yachts docking at the casino marinas in monaco , as well as macao and of course las vegas [ pictured ] , â artist alex brady , 32 , told mailonline
â i liked the kind of trashy , flashy future in movies like the fifth element ' the station is located in orbit around earth , allowing planes to seemingly take off from earth and then return to the planet with relative ease the cone - shaped space station is also shown in a state of partial completion , with space planes again making the journey from the ground the strange and twisted shapes , seen here , resemble future structures and spacecraft
the cylindrical design would allow the space station to rotate and provides its inhabitants with artificial gravity and mr alex brady has also given his take on how humans might get into orbit in the future on a variety of space planes
mr alex brady has also given his take on how humans might get into orbit in the future on a variety of space planes these planes are commonly known as single - stage - to - orbit ( ssto ) vehicles , as they could take off from a runway and land back on earth without having to use an expendable rocket - like the space shuttle had to but when it comes to space stations , mr alex brady says his designs are a little different and more free - form than others that have been devised
â he adds that these images are nât meant to be taken as a wholly serious look at the future of space travel , but rather â a light - hearted imagining of the future where even a poor space miner can maybe strike it lucky at the zero - g roulette tables ! â mr alex brady says his designs are a little different than others that have been devised , such as in 2001 : a space odyssey ( image from the movie shown )
' i imagine maybe space cities to be like our cities here on earth ; cluttered , crowded , busy , a little dysfunctional , ' he said mr alex brady adds that these images are nât meant to be taken as a wholly serious look at the future of space travel his designs incorporate efforts from europe , the us and india
the images are â a light - hearted imagining of the future where even a poor space miner can maybe strike it lucky at the zero - g roulette tables ! â here we see several spacecraft docked with a space station in orbit , attached by cables
