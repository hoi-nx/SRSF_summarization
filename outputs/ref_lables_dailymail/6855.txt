esa âs rosetta spacecraft has survived a hair - raising encounter with comet 67p after the probe ran into difficulties during a recent flyby
but during the manoeuvre , rosetta lost sense of where it was due to the amount of dust and gas and was placed into â safe mode â , causing it to momentarily lose contact with earth
the esa 's rosetta ( illustrated ) has survived a hair - raising encounter with comet 67p after the probe ran into difficulties during a recent flyby
rosetta launched into space in 2004 and entered orbit around 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko in august 2014 â not the best month to choose to go dry â¦ â rosetta project scientist dr taylor quipped on twitter , as the team back on earth sweated over the safety of the spacecraft
crucially , the star trackers allow rosetta to know where it is with respect to the sun and earth , so it can correctly orient its antenna to send and receive signals from ground stations on our planet
the rosetta probe , which was carrying philae , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of earth and mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67p
but when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet
from data collected by the two proves , esa said that water on the comet was different to that on earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid , not a comet
when the star trackers are not working properly , the antenna drifts , causing communications to be temporarily lost
and during the recent flyby , the spacecraft started to mistake comet debris for stars , causing it to lose sight of earth
esa said that â hundreds of â false stars â were registered â and it took nearly 24 hours before the spacecraft could properly start tracking again
on whether the problem could cause rosetta to lose permanent contact with earth if it happened again , dr taylor told mailonline that they were ' looking at ways to minimise this from happening
he also said they had been â flying at a very low relative velocity to the comet to reduce the chance â of any lasting damage being caused by debris
the spacecraft is now performing a wide sweep around the comet , giving engineers ample time to make sure the problem does not occur again
the star trackers allow rosetta to know where it is with respect to earth , so it can send and receive signals
it is hoped that continuing studies like this could reveal what the comet 's interior is composed of - but engineers will be hoping that this ' false stars ' anomaly does not occur again this diagram shows an example of rosetta 's recent flyby trajectories at 67p
the spacecraft completed a manoeuvre yesterday that will bring it from about 250 miles ( 400km ) of the comet to within 90 miles ( 140km ) by wednesday next week the purpose of flying in so close is to examine 67p 's geysers
despite the drama , esa was still able to release some amazing images recently taken by rosetta
the washing machine - sized philae probe gripped the imaginations of the world when it landed on comet 67p on 12 november 2014
