a woman who spent 30 years of her life believing that she suffered from cerebral palsy , only to learn that she had in fact been misdiagnosed and almost all of her symptoms could be cured with just one pill , insists she feels no resentment or anger about her doctor âs life - changing error
jean , 38 , from plymouth , minnesota , was told she had spastic diplegia , a form of cerebral palsy , when she was just four - years - old , she explained to the mighty
but after three decades of suffering from muscle spasms , weakness , near immobility , as well as undergoing painful surgical procedures , she learned at the age of 33 that she actually had dopa - responsive dystonia ( drd ) , a rare , yet treatable , muscle disorder
' honestly , i âve never had any negative thoughts about what i went through , ' jean told daily mail online of her misdiagnosis , which saw her confined to a bed for much of her childhood
the 38 - year - old has now discovered she was misdiagnosed with spastic diplegia , a form of cerebral palsy different life : jean , who is pictured with her husband ( l ) and by herself ( r ) , used a mobility scooter before she was diagnosed as having dopa - responsive dystonia ( drd ) , a rare , yet treatable , muscle disorder while jean admitted that there ' plenty of times ' she wished she did n't have to deal with the physical symptoms associated with condition , including her dependence on others to complete everyday tasks , she noted that she still had a ' fantastic childhood ' - thanks in large part to the unwavering support of her family and friends
' when jean was first diagnosed with spastic diplegia , she was considered a textbook case , even though her mris and cat scans did nât show any typical symptoms of the disorder
' they confirmed the spastic diplegia diagnosis and said that my doctor taught all of them
' by the time she was 12 - years - old , jean underwent a ' very painful ' muscle transfer to prevent her knees from knocking together when she walked
miracle drug : jean , who was once nearly immobile , completed a 10 - mile hike with her husband ( pictured ) four months after she started taking her drd medication known as l - dopa happy family : jean is pictured with her husband and their three children following her correct diagnosis of drd although she compared the physical agony to open heart surgery , she said she was glad her parents encouraged her to have the procedure , which helped her a great deal and helped to prevent her from tripping over herself when she walked
when she was in her late twenties , the mother - of - three had a pump implanted in her body to distribute medicine , but when she ended up over-medicated she visited a specialist who would eventually change her life forever
her new neurologist told her she had actually been living with drd , noting that most of her symptoms would improve or disappear with a daily dose of a medication known as dopa
the neurologist explained that the symptoms of drd , including the involuntary muscle contractions and tremors , are often mistaken for cerebral palsy or other disorders
but jean ' could n't imagine having anything other than spastic diplegia ' and confessed that she was n't even going to fill the prescription until her husband persuaded to her to try it
new world : jean can be seen using trekking poles during one of her hikes true love : the happy couple posed for a photo when jean still believed she had spastic diplegia it soon became clear that the medication was working better than jean could have ever imagined
and not only was jean able to walk to the touristy locations that she previously had to be carried to , she was actually able to complete a 10 - mile hike along with her husband
' and while jean realized that there are so many things she wants to try now that she can , she still insists that she does n't have any regrets about receiving her diagnosis so late in life
i âm just so darn happy ! ' night out : jean was wearing heels six months after she started taking dopa to relieve her muscle spasms and tremors i began to think of all the places i would love to travel with my family that would nât have been an option before although dopa has drastically changed her life , jean still has to make sure that she gets plenty of sleep and remains as stress free as possible , or she can suffer from incredibly sore muscles and cramps , as well as issues with balance and tremors in her hands
' five years after her proper diagnosis , jean has become an advocate for raising awareness for drd , which is often misdiagnosed
and eight months ago , she decided to wean herself off of dopa for a week so she could film herself walking , both on and off her medication , in order to help others recognize the symptoms of drd
