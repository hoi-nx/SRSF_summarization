holy smokes ! researchers found the bombardier beetle mimics a machine gun by mixing chemicals in an internal ' reaction chamber ' a beetle with a machine gun built into its rear end sounds like something from a comic or sci - fi film - or the stuff of nightmares
but researchers have discovered the bombardier beetle mimics this powerful weapon by mixing chemicals in an internal ' reaction chamber ' in its stomach
when threatened , the diminutive bug can then repeatedly fire streams of foul - smelling liquid from its rear , complete with ' gun smoke '
many beetles secrete foul - smelling or bad - tasting chemicals from their abdomens to ward off predators , but bombardier beetles take it a step further
when threatened , they combine chemicals in an explosive chamber in their abdomen to simultaneously heat and propel their defensive load as a boiling hot spray
assistant professor moore , from the department of entomology at the university , has published a paper along with her team that not only reveals the beetle 's firing apparatus in never - before - seen detail , but also solves a long - standing mystery of how the animals achieve their incredible rapid - fire capabilities
arndt and ortiz teamed up with professor moore to study the anatomy of the beetle 's reaction chamber , which is constructed of cuticle , a composite of chitin , proteins and waxes
a real hot shot ! the research , including video footage ( shown above ) not only reveals the beetle 's firing apparatus in never - before - seen detail , but also solves a long - standing mystery of how the bugs achieve their rapid - fire capabilities the mechanism of the bombardier beetle 's spray pulsation had not been understood because previous studies , relying on external observations , could not probe exactly what happens inside the reaction chamber of the chemical gun
the chemicals are stored separately in the creature 's abdomen and then combine explosively , explaining why they are ejected at such high speed and at 100 c. ' twenty - five years ago , a team of scientists from cornell university and mit discovered that each blast from the bombardier beetle is actually a series of extraordinarily fast micro-pulses , ' assistant professor moore said
' what was n't known is what causes each discharge to be pulsed , like a machine gun
this was enough to provide high - definition , high - speed video of what happens inside a bombardier beetle 's reaction chamber when it goes off
all guns blazing : ' twenty - five years ago , a team of scientists from cornell university and mit discovered that each blast from the bombardier beetle is actually a series of extraordinarily fast micro-pulses , ' assistant professor moore said , which led to the machine gun analogy
a stock image of a machine gun is shown it turns out the pulses are generated in a passive way , not through an active process involving muscle contraction , as previously thought
as the chemicals pass through a valve into the reaction chamber , they mix with enzymes and explosively liberate oxygen gas , water vapor and heat , propelling a hot , noxious spray down the nozzle and out the exit pore
