it 's probable that thiago would never have signed for manchester united even if david moyes had wanted him
once pep guardiola had made it clear he required the midfelder at bayern munich , it was pointless for manchester united to continue their pursuit anyway , but the fact that david moyes was n't keen on the transfer - ' not his type ' said a club source - was probably an early indication that he was n't the right fit for manchester united
however , manchester united 's need for passing quality from deep midfield was apparent throughout david moyes ' short time at the club
the kind of passing display thiago delivered in bayern munich 's 6 - 1 win over porto on wednesday has been precisely what manchester united have been missing
thiago ( right ) heads in bayern munich 's first goal during their 6 - 1 win over porto on tuesday night thiago blows a kiss to the crowd as he celebrates his goal which started bayern munich 's remarkable comeback thiago is congratulated on his strike by pep guardiola , the man who took him from barcelona to bayern munich without quality in that area , few teams can compete at the elite level any more
moyes might quite reasonably been worried that thiago was on the slight side to thrive in the rough and tumble of the premier league
one experienced german journalist who has been watching bayern munich for 35 years commented last night : ' thiago might well be the most technically - gifted central midfielder who has ever played for bayern munich
' thiago dictated the pace of the game from deep for bayern munich as they crushed porto thiago started his career at barcelona but was overlooked for cesc ( right ) by boss tito vilanova and no - one has invested more in thiago than pep guardiola , which is why manchester united had no realistic chance of signing him once his offer had been made
it was pep guardiola who promoted him to the first team at barcelona in 2009 and made him an integral part of the squad
at barcelona they are said not to be disturbed by the rise of thiago
should barcelona end up against bayern munich in the champions league semi finals , they may yet rue the day they deemed him surplus to requirements
