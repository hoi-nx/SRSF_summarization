a third investigation has been launched by the general pharmaceutical council into pharmacy2u , the britain âs biggest online pharmacy
the mail revealed that pharmacy2u had passed information on nhs patients to alchemy
the eating disorder data â passed to the mail by a whistleblower â is being touted by a firm called sequester , which is a business partner of alchemy
sequester is offering to sell information on people suffering from 43 different health conditions â from skin problems to insomnia and migraines
such data is a goldmine for unscrupulous firms and criminals â who can use it to target vulnerable individuals and scam them over the phone
the whistleblower , who works in the data industry , said it was â madness â that so much personal information was available to him and he had passed it to the mail because he was worried about who else might have access to it
â the list of categories of data was contained in an email â seen by the mail â from sequester âs ceo foy in which he described the information his firm was able to supply on its new database
when i realised the level of information companies like sequester have , that is when i knew how serious a problem this is
dr sarah wollaston , who was the tory chairman of the commons health committee , said ' it 's appalling ' one of those on sequester âs arthritis database is diana doyle from wandsworth in london , who says she is â frightened â her health details are being sold on
â she suspects her medical details were obtained from a survey she filled out in a catalogue
â when approached by the mail , bosses at sequester , which describes itself as a data controller , claimed they had never actually distributed any information on eating disorders or any of the other sensitive health information advertised in the email

the second firm â data bubble â supplied our team with health details on 3,000 patients â such as whether they suffered from high blood pressure , arthritis or even bladder problems
when asked how the information was obtained , the firm âs owner , hypnotherapist joanne clayton , said : â it could be people who bought mobility products from a catalogue â¦ or even if they âve been on holiday and they âve ticked to say that they are needing help on the flight with regards to that , we can then identify that they actually have problems with mobility
the announcement follows calls â led by david cameron â for a clampdown on companies found guilty of selling personal data without consent
