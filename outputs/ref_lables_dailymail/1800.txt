ferrari technical director james allison believes mercedes are again likely to lead the way in chinese this weekend
fears of another season of domination from mercedes were blown away by a shock , yet deserved victory for sebastian vettel last time out in malaysia
it was the maranello marque 's first success for almost two years and at least offered hope to neutrals that reigning champion lewis hamilton and team - mate nico rosberg will not have it all their own way
sebastian vettel won the second race of the season with victory in malaysia last month sebastian vettel saw off the challenge from mercedes drivers lewis hamilton and nico rosberg in malaysia in searing heat and high track temperatures the ferraris of sebastian vettel and kimi raikkonen were far kinder on their tyres , stopping only twice compared to the three trips to the pits for lewis hamilton and nico rosberg
this weekend 's race at the shanghai international circuit , however , should favour mercedes given the cooler climes than that of sepang
' as to whether ferrari can stay the course with mercedes and provide a season - long challenge , for now that is too difficult to determine
' in melbourne ( the season - opening australian grand prix ) mercedes were very , very dominant , and we were better than we looked
