a schoolboy with a rare illness which means he is allergic to sunlight has been racially abused in the street because of the brown suncream he has to wear
james creag , 11 , is so sick of being taunted that he has stopped putting on the special cream - meaning that it is not safe for him to go outside
he suffers from the condition erythropoietic protoporphyria , whose victims are nicknamed ' real - life vampires ' because their skin can not be exposed to direct sunlight
james creag must use the special brown suncream ( pictured ) as he suffers from a rare sunlight allergy he suffers from the condition erythropoietic protoporphyria , which means he suffers from terrible sunburn ( pictured ) when exposed to sunlight james creag , from salford in greater manchester , was given dundee , a thick brown paste which blocks out the light
but when strangers shouted out abuse such as ' chocolate face ' and ' you 're coloured ' because of his unusual appearance , he refused to wear it any more
his mother claire , 34 , said : ' when he had the cream on he was called names - the kind of names a racist would say
i do n't know why
people think he 's different so they taunted him
' the cream was meant to protect him but he 's stopped wearing it now
however , his condition can also can flare up when he is inside , so his parents have installed specially dimmed windows to block out the sun 's rays
he was in agony , i was so worried
family : james with his mother claire and younger sister grace , who does not have the condition erythropoietic protoporphyria occurs when there is a build - up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood
the condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling , itching and burning when exposed to sunlight
' but after half an hour outside , they came running towards me , james creag screaming
' the family visited their gp , who suggested that james creag might be allergic to grass
' but it kept happening and i took james creag to the doctors three times that week
' eventually he was referred to hospital and diagnosed with the rare condition
' so , even if it 's overcast , james creag still wears a hat , scarf and gloves to cover every inch of his skin
' she spoke of her joy at discovering that her daughter grace had not inherited the illness despite the genetic risks - and paid tribute to james creag for his bravery
' he always wears a hat too he just puts up with it though
' mrs creag continued : ' doctors said his erythropoietic protoporphyria was an inherited condition
so when i fell pregnant with grace i was terrified she âd be born with erythropoietic protoporphyria too
