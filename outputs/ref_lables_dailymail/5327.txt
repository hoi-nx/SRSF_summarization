but astronomers say ' rogue ' , sun-less planets that wander the stars could still harbour extra-terrestrials
but astronomers say ' rogue ' , sun-less planets that wander the stars could still harbour extra-terrestrials this is according to sean raymond , an astrophysicist with the laboratoire d'astrophysique de bordeaux in france , who has taken a look at how life can form on rogue planets
writing in aeon , he says : ' to have any chance of life â at least life like our own â a free - floating earth would need liquid water
' a planet needs to keep warm for liquid water to form , and without the sun , this heat would have to come from its interior
rogue planets are of particular interest to astronomers because they represent objects that have likely failed to form into a star pso j318.5-22 was detected 80 light years away from earth and it is estimated to have a mass six times that of jupiter several years ago , an international team of astronomers discovered a large planet floating freely through space with no star to orbit
' if the ice layer is thick enough , then a planet can maintain an ocean of liquid water beneath the ice
as well as internal heat , sean raymond says another way a planet can keep warm is using a thick atmosphere
' a free - floating earth with a thick hydrogen atmosphere could keep its surface temperature above the freezing point of water , ' writes sean raymond
' rogue planets are hard to find because , without orbiting a star , they reflect very little light
but 50 have now been found in the past 15 years , leading some to suggest they may be abundant in the universe
rogue planets are of particular interest to astronomers because they represent objects that have likely failed to form into a star
the exact boundary between a giant planet and a low - mass brown dwarf is still being debated , but finding more rogue planets could shed light on this mystery
and this could indicate that there are more rogue planets than we know of in the cosmos .
