my son is ahead of me , his kayak skimming across the slate blue water
â there âs a great beach over there
then a friend suggested a back - to - nature break in poland
unknown : wigry national park , in north - east poland , is the furthest outreach of the masurian lakes our destination is wigry national park , in the north - east of the country , close to the lithuanian border
it is the furthest outreach of the masurian lakes ( poland âs lake district ) , and the most sparsely populated
the area is unspoiled , but it is also exceedingly well set - up for outdoorsy pursuits
the hotel rents mountain bikes and nordic walking poles , and you could cycle or hike for days around the well - marked trails
come and discover : the area is unspoiled , but it is also exceedingly well set - up for outdoor pursuits or you can take to the water
whichever way you turn , there is another beach , another jetty , another twisting corner of wigry â the name means â winding â â and it has the longest and most meandering shoreline of all of poland âs lakes
a holiday of an old - fashioned kind : jane found a refreshing simplicity to this pretty corner of poland it is all so wholesome that , as we sit by another pristine lake , watching the sun dip down , i find myself singing old campfire songs as james takes another swim
