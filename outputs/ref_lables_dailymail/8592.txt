professor ninian peckitt , 63 , has been struck off after a hearing heard that he punched a patient in the face ten times to fix a broken cheekbone a groundbreaking facial surgeon has been struck off after repeatedly punching a patient in the face ' like a boxer ' to fix his broken cheekbone
professor ninian peckitt , 63 , claimed he was attempting to reduce the fracture when he hit the patient up to ten times while a colleague held his head , a medical hearing heard
the patient , known as patient a , had come to ipswich hospital in february 2012 after an industrial accident and been operated on by prof peckitt , who is a world - renowned facial surgeon
but he required a second procedure after falling off the bed in hospital which displaced his cheekbone
that 's when prof ninian peckitt struck the patient while he was under anesthetic
prof ninian peckitt , an honorary locum consultant in oral and maxillo - facial surgery at ipswich hospital , claimed he ' digitally manipulated ' the patient 's face and denied any wrongdoing
the hearing heard that patient a could have been blinded by the force of the punches from professor ninian peckitt
rapaport , a dental surgeon with more than 30 years experience , said she was told to hold the patient 's head before the first punch
' he said that when the patient fell out of bed , the cheekbone which was already fractured was moved outwards so he was trying to re-position it without having to make further cuts to the face
' he applied about ten punches like a boxer
professor ninian peckitt did n't seek advice from colleagues and quit his post days later
professor ninian peckitt had been an honorary locum consultant at ipswich hospital when he punched a patient to correct a broken cheekbone
he later wrote the patient 's face had been ' digitally manipulated ' ' when i said it was like a boxer i meant he was carefully aiming where he wanted to hit
' then he pulled his hand back to get the maximum hit as he touched the patient 's face
' i can remember a feeling of total shock the first time he hit the patient because i was n't expecting it and i think anyone who saw what happened was reacting in a similar way and then he asked me to assist by holding the patient 's head
' [ the punches ] were his fist aimed at the side of the patient 's face
' miss rapaport added that following the operation , prof ninian peckitt told her to write that the cheek had been adjusted by ' external pressure ' in her operating notes
' i particularly [ did n't want to ] write the note because accurately i would have had to write " prof ninian peckitt punched the patient to try and move the left zygoma " and that 's not something i would have wanted to do
' prof ninian peckitt has pioneered ' engineering - assisted ' surgery techniques and written extensively on the subject , as well as cosmetic surgery
he is now believed to be working as a consultant surgeon in dubai and elected not to attend the hearing but issued an email in which he ' emphatically denied ' the allegations
panel chair ian spafford said : ' the panel has determined that mr ninian peckitt 's misconduct is fundamentally incompatible with his continuing to practise medicine
' the panel is of the view that the public interest requires that it be made clear that mr ninian peckitt 's behaviour is unacceptable in a member of the medical profession
