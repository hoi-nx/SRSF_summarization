in february , when lady gaga went on stage at the oscars , millions of viewers in more than 200 countries saw her perform a tribute to the sound of music to mark its 50th anniversary
each year , 300,000 people come to salzburg to soak up the magic and visit the locations of the film â it âs the reason three - quarters of all tourists head to the city
the beautiful flower beds of at mirabell gardens in salzburg that the sound of music fans will recognise andrews from the beloved film the sound of music , fans of which continue to flock to salzburg the first tours started shortly after the film opened , but now buses emblazoned with the sound of music circle the city , day in , day out
you âll be looking a long time in the salzburg tourist shops before you find a andrews postcard for sale , let alone lederhosen fashioned from curtain fabric
there are some real advantages in this if you âre a fan of the sound of music
the old town , where much of the movie was shot , is too narrow for tour buses , and that fact â combined with the lack of tourist tat â means there âs nothing to break the spell as you slide into the sound of music mindset
also happily for fans of the film , salzburg is a pretty conservative sort of place , and does nât rush about embracing change
half a century after shooting the movie , andrews could return to the city and wander round without too many shocks to the system ( providing she overlooked the mcdonald âs on getreidegasse , sitting uncomfortably amid shops selling austrian national dress )
for me , salzburg is the most hummable city ever â although the tunes you find yourself humming are probably not those that would be chosen by the city fathers
lady gaga paid tribute to the film , in the presence of its original star , for its 50 anniversary at the oscars built into the mountains , in medieval times the church harnessed much of the local wealth that came from salt mining â in fact , it still owns a lot of the surrounding land , and built the magnificent monasteries and convents that dominate the city
the real maria â played by andrews in the film â actually did become a novice at nonnberg , which was founded in the 8th century
on my first trip , more than 20 years ago , i stayed at an independent hostel , the yoho ( www.yoho.at ) in paracelsusstrasse , which i âm pleased to say is still going strong and still showing the sound of music for free each night
it was an ideal base for a the sound of music weekend
it has to be said that breakfast does nât really feature in the film , which is the perfect excuse to start the day with apple strudel
and the best place to do so ? cafe tomaselli , salzburg âs oldest , dating from the 18th century , right in the centre of the city in alter markt
cafe tomaselli , salzburg âs oldest , dates back to the 18th century and is in the centre of the city in alter markt rumour has it that as the second world war had ended just 20 years earlier , the city authorities were nât keen on the flags , but the producers won them round by saying that the alternative was to use original footage of the germans annexation of austrian in the film
residenzplatz , just outside cafe tomaselli , was draped in nazi flags in the 50 - year - old film but to really immerse yourself in the full experience , and to see the more outlying locations , you have to take a tour
i âve taken a few in my time â i tend to feel them calling me each time i head to salzburg , just as maria felt the mountains calling her
we also passed the house that served as the main location for the the sound of music family home

what âs more , the state theatre in salzburg â the landestheater â now even has a production of the sound of music
it âs only taken 50 years
