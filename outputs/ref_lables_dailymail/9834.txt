warrington crashed to a third straight super league defeat and could be in trouble with the rugby football league following crowd trouble in the cheshire derby
the game was stopped for eight minutes after a flare was thrown from the stand housing visiting fans but widnes maintained their focus to run out 30 - 10 winners and maintain their impressive form at the select security stadium , where they have taken seven points out of a possible 10 this year
following a delay caused by a flare , widnes condemned warrington to a third defeat in a row widnes , hammered by salford in their previous outing , were boosted by the return of influential captain kevin brown from a three - match absence with a hamstring injury and the wolves had no answer to his half - back partnership with mellor
yet warrington could hardly have made a better start , with england forward westwood collecting a rebound from o'brien 's high kick to score the opening try after only five minutes
it was eight minutes before o'brien could add the goal as the game was stopped to enable stewards to clear the flare from the pitch and remove the offenders
