police are using tiny plastic lego figures in a campaign to warn people about the rising tide of housebreakings in scottish
officers from police scotland âs edinburgh division â which has seen break - ins soar by nearly 40 per cent â posted pictures of the lego models on their facebook page as part of a move to raise awareness of crime
hands up : plastic lego figures are being used by police as part of a quirky campaign to warn people about the dangers of housebreaking
but the move received a backlash , with victims branding it as ' a joke ' the police internet posting showed scenes of lego criminals attempting to break into people âs homes before being arrested by officers â and were accompanied by a scots dialect poem giving advice
but the publicity stunt was met with criticism from politicians and victims who said officers should concentrate on solving real crimes
break - ins in edinburgh rose by 38.7 per cent in the 12 months to april 2014 , with 4,101 homes hit
the row will fuel concerns over the number of officers spending their days in police stations , rather than pounding the beat
be vigilant : the lego figures are arranged into scenes with robbers and police officers to provide safety tips and highlight the importance of securing people 's homes
but scottish conservative chief whip john lamont said : â with housebreaking on the increase , officers should be out solving real crimes , rather than relying on lego to try and prevent it
â the pictures are part of an anti-housebreaking drive , operation rac
one image shows a lego figurine in a hat and standing beside a door
poems were posted alongside the pictures , with one reading : â staying in or goin oot ? lock the windaes â n â front door
â one victim of housebreaking , tamara swanson from newhaven , edinburgh , was not impressed
â her father , peter swanson , added : â why would they bother doing that ? lego ? it âs a joke
mr wright , whose young son was at home sleeping at the time of the incident , said : â could they not have used the resources elsewhere , rather than reconstructing scenes of burglaries with lego sets ? â when i saw that , i thought it was just insensitive to the victims of burglaries
pictures were uploaded days after police vowed to target a group of 40 criminals suspected of fuelling edinburgh 's housebreaking problem he added : â most of the people who are being targeted are older folks in their 80s
they do nât have facebook or social media , so how are they supposed to get the message ? â chief supt mark williams , edinburgh divisional commander , said : â over 354,000 people have already seen this campaign on social media giving us significant reach for crime prevention messages
