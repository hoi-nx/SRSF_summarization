it is eight long , barren years since an english club claimed the top prize in european rugby and the bookmakers are n't convinced the grim cycle can be broken this year
yet since then irish teams have seized four titles â leinster claiming a hat - trick â and french teams three , accurately reflecting the balance of power in the european game
this season is not seen as any real exception , despite the presence of four english sides in the last eight of the new european champions cup
francois louw runs with the ball during the bath training session held at farleigh house bath 's george ford practices his kicking during the training session at the farleigh house complex leinster 's jamie heaslip is tackled by sailosi tagicakibau during the european champions cup match with wasps in world cup year it would provide a clear boost to national morale if one of their elite clubs could shatter the status quo by lifting the trophy on may 2 but there are significant reasons why an english triumph should n't happen
northampton , saracens , bath and wasps are well - funded , with strong squads , but their resources are modest compared to french powerhouses toulon , clermont and racing , who have budgets three or four times the size of their premiership opponents
the saints are the only english team to win an away quarter - final against french opposition â beating biarritz 7 - 6 in 2007
english sides have lost the eight other quarter - finals they have played across the channel
the london club lost to toulon in the final , but they have been the standard - bearers for english rugby in the last two seasons and will believe they can go to paris and beat racing , who can be wildly inconsistent
if two were to make it , that would provide a colossal and timely boost to national morale
