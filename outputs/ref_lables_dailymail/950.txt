a mother whose baby nearly died after he was born severely premature has urged other women to be aware of the infection that triggered her early labour
amanda butler , 42 , had enjoyed a totally normal pregnancy until her waters broke at 25 weeks
her son son callum was born weighing just 1lb 9oz and with translucent skin - and both she and doctors feared he would not survive
mrs amanda butler , a marketing consultant from milton keynes , later discovered her premature labour had been triggered by a common infection called bacterial vaginosis ( bv )
his mother amanda was later told an infection she had , called bacterial vaginosis , was to blame
the condition can also cause miscarriage bv affects one in three women , making it twice as common as thrush
if untreated , it can lead to fertility problems and increased risk of contracting stis such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia
one of the biggest problems is that bv often goes undiagnosed - or women wrongly assume they are suffering from another similar ailment , such as thrush
many other women , such as mrs amanda butler , have simply never heard of the condition
she said : ' i was angry when i found out that bv had caused son callum âs premature birth because it was the first i had heard of it
' after the trauma of the premature labour and birth , mrs amanda butler was initially told it had occurred because she had an ' incompetent cervix '
it was only during a consultation with a specialist two years later that she was horrified to be told an infection must have caused son callum 's early arrival
like many women , mrs amanda butler had never heard of the condition
son callum 's frail state when he was born meant doctors feared he may not live
bv affects one in three women , making it twice as common as thrush
if untreated , it can lead to fertility problems and increased risk of contracting stis such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia
symptoms include : * a strong smell , particularly after sexual intercourse * discharge that becomes a white or grey colour , or becomes thin and watery babies born before 37 weeks are classed as premature and as many of their vital organs will not have had a chance to fully develop causing both short terms problems , such as breathing and digestive difficulties , and potential longer term health implications , such as severe disabilities or cerebral palsy
study leader brown said there is â mounting evidence â that using these products internally can also increase the risk of bacterial vaginosis
for instance , 40 per cent of the women who used petroleum jelly as a lubricant had bacterial vaginosis - an infection that can be caused by a number of common bacterial species - compared to 18 per cent of women who did not insert petroleum jelly
