three 's company : rebecca and husband harry settle in at anantara the palm jumeirah my husband harry and i knew this was going to be a landmark holiday - the last one on our own for a long time
our baby girl is due on june 4 and , when we touched down in dubai , i was 28 weeks pregnant
you ca n't fly after that without a doctor 's note
i 'd been to dubai once before as a swimmer , when we stayed in an apartment
this was completely different - and utterly amazing
because it has over-the - water bungalows there were times when it felt like we were in the maldives , but when we went to the australian themed restaurant , i imagined i was back in the jungle on i 'm a celebrity â even though there were n't any luxuries in that jungle
you have to see dubai to believe it
our room was on the lagoon , which meant we had direct access to the water
we tended to spend a couple of hours in the morning by the main pool , then , after lunch , we retreated to our gorgeous room , where we had sun beds on the balcony
harry is doing a graphic design course back home and so he spent some time each day on his studies
by 4pm , it gets hazy in dubai
some days we went for a wander around the whole resort , which is about two miles round but it is cleverly laid out
jump in : the anantara has three turquoise - blue ' lagoons ' ideal for swimmers of all experience levels we had a lot of time to think and to discuss what name we should give our baby
naming something before you see it is strange and it 's vital that her first name goes with her last , which will be harry 's name , needs
one day , we went out on a boat and i hoped to see david beckham 's house , but no one seemed sure where it was exactly
there 's a lot of money splashing around in this part of the world
and guess what ? we bought our not - born - yet baby her first swimsuit
that 's why i 've started becky adlington swim stars for three to 11 - year - olds
one thing i enjoyed at the anantara was looking at all the baby equipment people have
paradise pictured : the anantara offers over-the - water villas which provide the perfect sea view after i retired from competitive swimming at the age of 23 , i did n't go near a pool for six months
harry and i went to the gym a few times at the hotel and i did a bit of this and that , but i am not used to high - impact sport
it gives me an opportunity to try new things â like coming to dubai with harry and spending most of the time lying around
what 's for sure is that it really made me appreciate a holiday like the one in dubai
