cruz is personally against the legalization of marijuana but the gop presidential candidate said this weekend that he believes states have the right to put decriminalization laws on the books if they want - even though they directly conflict with federal law
cruz implied during a conversation with daily mail online on saturday that if he ascended to the highest elected office he would n't make his attorney general enforce federal laws pertaining to marijuana in states that have approved sales and consumption of the drug
the position stands in contrast to the views of at least three of his gop competitors , who last week said that while they believe in states ' rights to self - determination , they 'd lay the hammer down on colorado and washington for flouting federal law
gop presidential candidate sen. ted cruzcruz implied during a conversation with daily mail online on saturday that if he ascended to the highest elected office he would n't make his attorney general enforce federal laws pertaining to marijuana in states that have approved sales and consumption of the sticky icky cruz , pictured here on sunday in litchfiled , new hampshire , at the londonderry fish and game , is personally against the legalization of marijuana but said this weekend he believes states have the right to put decriminalization laws on the books if they want - even though they directly conflict with federal law asked saturday during a new hampshire campaign stop if he would direct his attorney general to enforce federal pot laws , cruz said â yes â before providing a lengthy answer that indicated he would not
cruz 's stance on the issue presents a problem the politician who has said the ' most dangerous ' aspect of president barack obama 's tenure â has been lawlessness , the unwillingness of the president to follow federal law or the constitution
cruz was then asked if he âd make his own attorney general follow the rule of law when it comes to federal marijuana policy
just say no : cruz 's position stands in contrast to three of his gop competitors - rubio , left , christie , center , and graham , right - who said last week that while they believe in states ' rights to self - determination , they 'd lay the hammer down on colorado and washington for flouting federal law cruz shakes hands with adam prendible , 8 , of bedford , new hampshire , at his sunday stop
cruz was in town for the first in the nation forum , held saturday in nashua daily mail online followed up on the statement in an email to cruz 's presidential campaign and pointed out that the constitutional scholar seemed to arguing that states â rights should supersede federal law in this specific â circumstance â - marijuana policy - and that he 'd legally get around the supremacy clause of the constitution by claiming that â conflict of law standards â should apply
daily mail online also pointed out that cruz 's competitors for the gop nomination - new jersey governor christie , a likely 2016 candidate , and florida senator rubio , an announced contender - were asked a similar question about weed on conservative radio host hewitt 's show last week and they were clear in their answers
' marijuana is a gateway drug , ' christie said after hewitt asked him if he 'd crackdown on weed sales in colorado and washington
' marijuana is an illegal drug under federal law
a former solicitor general of texas , cruz 's stance on pot resents a problem the politician who has said the ' most dangerous ' aspect of president barack obama 's tenure â has been lawlessness , the unwillingness of the president to follow federal law or the constitution ' accompanying cruz on the trip was his wife heidi
' asked if he would crack down on states deploying their own standards for weed sales as president , graham said , ' the federal law preempts the state law
' the framers of our constitution understood cooperative federalism -- the overlapping spheres of authority between the federal and state governments -- and federal law enforcement can and often should respect and incorporate state law , ' the statement from cruz 's campaign continued
' the voters of the states of colorado and washington have made the decision to legalize marijuana , and that is a change in law that alters the appropriate enforcement of federal law
' she also made clear that cruz is of the opinion that the department of justice ' lacks the authority to simply refuse to enforce current federal law ' in states that have not passed their own marijuana laws
