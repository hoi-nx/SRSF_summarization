after years of suffering behind its barbed wire fences , watching those they loved waste away before their eyes while nazi guards systematically slaughtered them by the tens of thousands - this is the moment the inmates of bergen-belsen watched as the death camp was burned to the ground
shortly after the camp was liberated by british and canadian troops in 1945 , it was torched , and at least part of that suffering was destroyed forever as the buildings , along with the german reichskriegs flag and hitler portrait which adorned them , were consumed by flames
these hellish images , which were taken by british reverend charles martin king parsons , captured that poignant moment in history for future generations to remember
infamous : this is the bergen-belsen in german as it appeared in the days after it was liberated by british and canadian troops , adorned with the german reichskriegs flag ( left ) and a portrait of hitler ( right ) historic : as a crowd of people watch on , british troops burn the buildings to the ground
these never - before - seen images were captured by reverend charles martin king parsons , who was one of a handful of chaplains who helped liberate it up in smoke : the camp , which became the final resting place of 50,000 jews , gypsies , homosexuals , nazi opponents and those with disabilities , is burned to the ground after liberation in 1945 gone , but not forgotten : the images were uncovered by marshall , the great - grandson of mr king parsons , who said he is proud that his great - grandfather was brave enough to take the pictures , so future generations do not forget what happened send off : in dramatic scenes soldiers line up in front of a stage as the camp is torched , bringing to an end the suffering inside mr king parsons , orginally from leicestershire , was one of just a handful of british army chaplains who made it inside the camp , and whose job it would have been to help cure the sick , and offer last comforts to those who were beyond saving
the images were brought to light by mr king parsons ' great - grandson marshall , 27 , who decided to publish the pictures after finding them tucked inside an old box among his grandmother 's possessions
mr marshall , a photo restorer who lives in glasgow , said : ' i often come across very interesting historical photographs showing stories that impel me to dig deeper and find out as much as i can about the people in the pictures , and what they did with their lives
charles martin was one of a handful of british army chaplains who entered the camp in the days following liberation
chilling : this temporary sign was erected by british troops , detailing just a portion of the grisly death total , which eventually reached 50,000 sickening : inside one of the camp hut , the sick and the dying huddle on the floor in the appalling conditions their nazi captors left them in clinging on : survivors huddle inside tents in the wasteland in the centre of the bergen-belsen camp , where diarist anne frank also died horrific : around 500 people were dying per day of typhus and starvation when the allies arrived
the number of bodies was so great that the nazi captors had given up burying them , and had simply dumped many in the woods mr marshall added : ' perhaps the most discussed jewish victim of the holocaust anne frank died in bergen-belsen shortly before the liberation , probably of typhus which was rife among the dying
' after the war , charles martin returned to his work as a vicar , and raised two children , marshall 's grandmother ruth and sister joan before dying aged 54 , in 1953
mr marshall said : ' i never knew him as he died 35 years before i was born but i do know he was a brave man who saved many lives
' slaughter : more emaciated bodies are piled in one of the many shallow graves that surrounded the camp , located in northern german mr king parsons ( left ) took the pictures following the camp 's liberation after he went inside with other british troops to tend to the sick
when the camp was discovered , up to 500 people a day were dying there from typhus burial : british soldiers and german locals helped to bury the dead in the days after the camp was liberated from the nazis 70 years ago
