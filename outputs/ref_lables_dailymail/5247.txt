it has been revealed that starving competitors on the survival show hunted and killed an endangered crocodile during filming after the show 's bosses mistook it for a more common species
male competitors had not eaten for two weeks when they tracked down and killed what the show 's producers thought was a common caiman - a small , relatively common reptile
a spokesman for channel 4 said the islands used in the show were surveyed to establish what wildlife lived there before filming , and it was not known that american crocodiles ( pictured ) could be found there while several caimans had been discovered , it was not known that the american crocodile also lived there until the competitors found it
prior to filming experts were consulted to ascertain species on both islands and the american crocodile was not known to be in the area or on the island
