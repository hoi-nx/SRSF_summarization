' we cover a rural area from two sites so it is now going to prove incredibly difficult to provide a realistic , safe service for our patients , but we will endeavour to do so
he added : ' i want the health board to recognise the severity of the situation here
' i would be grateful if the health board could use all resources at their disposal to do all that they can so that we can retain a decent service to our patients which is safe , and provide it to the highest possible standards
dr williams said ambulances queuing at a&e departments is a sign that the system is broken ' difficulties in recruiting gps is a national issue ; however , there are particular problems in specific areas of north wales
' we are currently exploring a number of short and long - term ideas to address the local shortage of gps , including taking advantage of the opportunities arising from cluster working and working together with other practices
