the seeds of the josh meekings furore were planted during an otherwise unremarkable match between hibernian and dundee in the early weeks of 2013
easter road striker gary deegan caught dens defender gary irvine high on his right shin in a dangerous challenge
referee craig charleston saw an incident , but not the gory details
the official had his view obstructed by bodies and because of that the sfa could take no action
the governing body immediately took the stance they * should * be allowed to use video evidence to review incidents the referee had clearly missed
rules over use of video evidence to retrospectively ban players changed after this challenge by gary deegan ( right ) on gary irvine pfa chief executive wishart disagreed , telling them so
and on thursday night he renewed his call for member clubs to put the genie back in the bottle amidst widespread unease at the fact josh meekings might have missed a scottish cup because a referee and his assistants failed to see a handball in last sunday âs semi-final victory over celtic
retrospective action , believes the scottish players â union , has become too far reaching
â the referee had a clear view of it but could nât see the actual contact because of the two players â bodies , â said wishart of the critical gary deegan and irvine incident two years ago
â under the rules , they could nât charge gary deegan because the referee was the wrong side of the incident
â but as has been proven with josh meekings , it was opening a whole can of worms as you are effectively re-refereeing the games
inverness defender josh meekings clearly used his hand to stop the ball in the scottish cup semi-final â we warned this was too far and it would cause problems
â wishart takes no pleasure in being vindicated by the decision of the independent appeal panel which lifted a one - game suspension on inverness player josh meekings on thursday
under the existing rules , sfa compliance officer tony mcglennan was within his rights to charge the player
echoing the views of fifa vice president jim boyce and others , however , wishart believes the rules have gone too far
steven mclean did have a view of the incident on sunday , even if he did nât see the handball
josh meekings has been cleared to play after sfa had banned him after deeming the hand ball a red card offence â it âs a major mistake and that should be dealt with in terms of referee âs observer and their markings
â we react to one incident - and what happened here was a reaction to gary deegan
â wishart âs issues with events on sunday extend beyond the josh meekings scenario
in contrast with josh meekings , he * will * miss another final against falkirk under the punitive two strikes rule
