a grieving widow said she was frightened for the lives of herself and her family thanks to a ' nasty ' neighbour who terrorised them for seven years
during the course of her harassment , pauline 's neighbour yvonne plagued her with silent calls , taunted her dying husband and attacked her son with secateurs
it 's not the quiet and peaceful life pensioners pauline and her late husband tony expected when they moved to a static home on a community park for over- 50s in ludlow , shropshire , following tony 's retirement in 2002
she did n't even show any compassion when tony was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2011 and continued to torment pauline and her son from a previous marriage , john , when they were grieving his death a year later
pauline reveals on channel 5 's nightmare neighbour next door how yvonne turned on her after finding out she had struck up a friendship with another woman on the community park
yvonne started ignoring her and when pauline asked why , she was told : ' because i had a new best friend , she did n't want to know us any more
she began making silent phone calls to the couple day and night
pauline said : ' it unnerved us very much , you do n't know why people are making silent calls or who they are
she started shouting abuse through the windows calling us peeping toms and perverts - it went on like this for four years , ' pauline recalled
' then in march 2011 tony was diagnosed with terminal cancer and told he did n't have long to live
when yvonne heard the news , instead of expressing sympathy , she mocked tony telling him : ' you 've got cancer , you are going to die
' she also started making her crank phone calls again
pauline said : ' tony was terminally ill so we had precious time left and to have that spoiled by someone making unnecessary phone calls made things worse
yvonne , pictured in footage taken by john , would taunt the family about tony 's cancer when john was visiting one day , he said she threatened him with a four - foot long branch
she started spurting her mouth off about tony having cancer saying " oh dear , guess who 's got cancer , and guess who 's got terminal cancer "
following tony 's death , john moved in with his mother to support her and he continued to be abused by yvonne
tony died in 2012 with no sympathy from yvonne who instead harassed the family with crank calls despite being heterosexual , john said yvonne would make homophobic jibes towards him as well as calling him a ' w * * * * * ' and a ' mummy 's boy '
then one day the abuse became physical after yvonne 's dog attacked john 's , scrappy , after leaping into their garden
' pauline witnessed the encounter and tried to intervene to stop yvonne attacking her son
pauline said yvonne continued to be ' nasty ' in this time and once again john said she hit him when he caught her prowling around his mother 's house at night
