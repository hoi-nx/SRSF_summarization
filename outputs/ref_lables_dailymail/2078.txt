researchers found that heart patients who expressed gratitude for the positive things in their life had improved mental , and ultimately physical , health
heart patients who expressed gratitude for the positive things in their life had better mental and physical health , a study found stage b is where patients have developed structural heart disease - they may , for example , have had a heart attack that damaged the heart - but do not show symptoms of heart failure , such as shortness of breath or fatigue
it is important to make beneficial lifestyle changes at this stage because patients are at a high risk of progressing to stage c heart failure - where risk of death is five times higher - the researchers said
inflammation can often worsen heart failure
â we found that more gratitude in these patients was associated with better mood , better sleep , less fatigue and lower levels of inflammatory biomarkers related to cardiac health , â said professor paul mills , from the university of california
patients who were more grateful had lower markers of inflammation , which can worsen heart failure to further test their findings , the researchers asked some of the patients to write down three things for which they were thankful most days of the week for eight weeks
