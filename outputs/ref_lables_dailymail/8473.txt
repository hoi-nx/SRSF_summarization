to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the hubble space telescope tomorrow , nasa has released an image of a fantastic tapestry of stars snapped by the orbiting observatory
the image shows a giant distant cluster of about 3,000 stars called westerlund 2 inside a stellar ' breeding ground ' called gum 29 , 20,000 light - years from earth
in the image massive young stars can be seen feeding a nearby region with the fuel it needs to form new stars
despite a shaky start , when its primary mirror was ground to the wrong shape , hubble space telescope soon began returning fantastic images of the distant universe , to the delight of scientists and the public alike on earth
' hubble space telescope has completely transformed our view of the universe , ' said john grunsfeld , astronaut and associate administrator of nasa 's science mission directorate
' this vista of starry fireworks and glowing gas is a fitting image for our celebration of 25 years of amazing hubble space telescope science
' hubble space telescope captured the image using its wide field camera 3 , which pierced through the dusty veil of dust and gas around the stellar nursery using near - infrared light
the cluster is between six and 13 light - years across but only two million years old , and thus contains some of the hottest , brightest and most massive stars in the galaxy
hubble space telescope 's near - infrared imaging camera pierces through the dusty veil enshrouding the stellar nursery , giving astronomers a clear view of the dense concentration of stars in the central cluster , shown westerlund 2 is surrounded by the star - forming region gum 29
the heaviest cluster stars are unleashing a torrent of ultraviolet radiation and hurricane - force winds streaming with charged particles , etching away the enveloping hydrogen gas cloud from where the cluster formed the red dots scattered throughout the landscape around westerlund 2 are a rich population of newly forming stars still wrapped in their gas - and - dust cocoons
hubble space telescope 's near - infrared vision allows astronomers to identify these fledgling stars the pillars in the star - forming region surrounding westerlund 2 , composed of dense gas , are a few light - years tall and point to the central cluster
' we never thought it would last this long , ' said nasa administrator and former astronaut charlie bolden , the pilot on the mission that launched hubble space telescope
nasa is celebrating the hubble space telescope 's ( pictured ) 25th anniversary with a variety of events highlighting its groundbreaking achievements and scientific contributions with activities running april 20 - 26
in its quarter - century in orbit , the observatory has transformed our understanding of our solar system and beyond , and helped us find our place among the stars this is one of hubble space telescope 's most iconic images : the eagle nebula 's pillars of creation
more than 3,000 stars of various sizes appear in this image
hubble space telescope 's observations of a particular kind of exploded star helped astronomers realise that the pace of the universe 's expansion is ramping up , propelled by some unknown force referred to as ' dark energy
the first so - called exoplanet was discovered in 1992 , two years after hubble space telescope 's launch
