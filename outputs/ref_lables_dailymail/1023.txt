a husband was left so traumatised by his wife 's botched surgery that he was awarded thousands of pounds in compensation for nervous shock , despite his wife already being given a hefty payout
in a case which could have huge financial consequences for the nhs , julie ronayne was awarded Â£ 160,000 after she was left ' looking like michelin man ' following the bungled hysterectomy in 2008
her husband husband edward , who lives with mrs julie ronayne in netherley , liverpool , was awarded Â£ 9,000 due to the nervous shock he suffered when he saw his wife 's appearance
ronayne was given Â£ 9,000 in compensation after he claimed he suffered a psychiatric injury from seeing his wife swell up ' like michelin man ' after botched surgery at liverpool women 's hospital ( pictured ) the severe swelling had been caused by a dangerous infection known as peritonitis , which the woman had contracted during the surgery at liverpool women 's hospital
the nhs is now fighting to overturn the payout , fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation
the test case , being heard at london 's appeal court , could set a significant precedent about who is able to claim for shock or distress following an nhs mishap
mr ronayne was awarded the damages from liverpool women 's hospital in july 2013
liverpool county court heard how he had been a ' secondary victim ' of the incident and had suffered psychiatric injury caused by the shock of seeing his wife 's new appearance
' but in the appeal court today , charles cory-wright qc , who represents the health trust , told the judges that nervous shock victims are normally only awarded compensation if it can be proved that they have been left with psychiatric injury
he said mr ronayne 's win had moved the goalposts drastically and could lead to a flood of similar claims , costing the cash - strapped nhs millions in compensation
the barrister argued that mr ronayne would not have suffered a sufficient level of shock to qualify for compensation
the nhs is now fighting to overturn the payout , fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation if mr ronayne is allowed to keep the money
' stressing the importance of the appeal , he told the judges : ' this appeal is not just about this case , but the concerns nhs trusts have about claims being brought on a secondary basis where clinical negligence has taken place
source : nhs ' the effect of this judgement , if it stands , is to alter the effect of the law in secondary victim cases , as the award was made absent any evidential basis that the secondary victim suffered any psychiatric injury as a result of shock
mrs julie ronayne went on to make a good recovery .
