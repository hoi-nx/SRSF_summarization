it had seemed tom ince , fresh from pulling out of england âs under - 21 side to concentrate on reigniting his stuttering career , had produced a goal of splendour that would do much the same for derby âs season
tom ince picked up the ball in the 57th minute , danced round two watford defenders and bent a finish into the far corner

watford , starting with three forwards in troy deeney , matej vydra and odion ighalo who have 48 championship goals between them this season , carried a sizeable offensive threat
