the international space station is to have an italy espresso maker so astronauts can have a break from instant coffee to ' boost spirits ' spacex is scheduled to launch its unmanned rocket with the espresso maker â and 4,000 pounds of food , science research and other equipment â on monday afternoon
the experimental espresso machine is intended for international space station astronaut samantha cristoforetti of italy
the final version will be the first real italy espresso machine on the international space station on monday a version of the coffee maker is scheduled for launch to the international space station aboard a supply capsule which will also include 4,000 pounds of food , science research and other equipment it was supposed to arrive in january , shortly after her arrival , so she could get some relief from the station 's instant coffee
the espresso machine was originally intended for astronaut samantha cristoforetti of italy so she could get a break from the station 's instant coffee the espresso maker is dubbed isspresso â isspresso standing for international space station
italy coffee giant lavazza joined forces with the turin - based engineering company argotec and the italian space agency to provide a specially designed machine for use off the planet
it is the first coffee machine able to work in micro gravity on the isspresso , where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on earth
in order to handle liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space environment , the plastic tubing inside the normal coffee machines has been replaced with a steel tubes designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar

' the isspresso machine is the first coffee machine able to work in micro gravity , where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on earth hovering up to 270 miles ( 435 km ) above the earth , the international space station ( pictured ) is a long way from home and astronauts have reported missing creature comforts such as coffee and beer astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw
the space - bound machine weighs around 44lbs ( 20kg ) because there are backups of all the critical components , for safety reasons , and in accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the italian space agency nasa 's space station program deputy manager , dan hartman , said it 's all part of making astronauts feel at home as they spend months â and even up to a year â in orbit

he continued : ' if an espresso machine comes back and we get a lot of great comments from the crew ... it 's kind of like the ice cream thing , right , when we fly ice cream every now and then
' the spacex dragon supply ship also holds experiments for nasa 's one - year space station resident scott kelly , who moved in a couple weeks ago
this will be the california - based spacex company 's seventh station supply run since 2012 , all from cape canaveral air force station
