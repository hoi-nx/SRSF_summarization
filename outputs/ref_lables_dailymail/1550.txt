according to a change.org petition that aimed to stop the auction , eaton would himself have been opposed to the sale
' these items were given -- not sold -- to the original collector , eaton , because he wanted to display them in an exhibition that would help tell the story of the incarceration of 120,000 innocent people , ' reads a change.org petition ' american crafts ' : the pieces were from the collection of ' dean of american crafts ' eaton ' eaton opposed the incarceration and this sale goes against his intent for a public exhibition that received official support , ' opponents of the sale claimed ' eaton opposed the incarceration and this sale goes against his intent for a public exhibition that received official support
