the collapse of yesterday 's old bailey trial will raise question marks about the judgment of the labour darling who took a central role in the disastrous and misguided prosecutions of journalists
keir starmer , who ran the crown prosecution service for five years , was in charge when operation elveden began its tainted ' witch hunt ' into tabloid journalists
central role : former director of public prosecutions keir starmer was in charge of operation elveden most controversially , he pushed the use of an almost unheard of 13th century law â misconduct in public office â to go after journalists for what amounted to them simply doing their jobs of informing the public
despite the best efforts of prosecutors and millions of pounds of public money , juries have almost universally refused to convict , and after four more reporters were cleared yesterday and all but a handful of cases withdrawn , elveden was left in ruins
already a kcb and a qc , in a few weeks ' time sir keir starmer is likely to add mp to his lengthy list of titles and be returned for the safe labour seat of holborn and st pancras in north london
but under keir starmer it was far more public
