one problem with space travel is that humans are nât very good at coping with reduced gravity - their bones and muscles deteriorate over time
but one company says they have an answer - a giant rotating space cylinder that can create artificial gravity
their giant cylinder ( shown , with the iss and space shuttles illustrated ) could apparently replace the iss. it would rotate four times per minute to create artificial gravity , and would be 1,300ft ( 400 metres ) long , cost Â£ 200 billion ( $ 300 billion ) and take 30 years to build the â space mushroom â was designed by bill kemp and ted maziejka from united space structures ( uss ) , based in washington , dc , washington , dc the final design would be 330ft ( 100 metres ) in diameter and 1,310ft ( 400 metres ) long

the necessity for this dome gives the space station its mushroom - like appearance
â we believe artificial gravity is required to support long term living in space , â mr bill kemp told mailonline
while exact details are nât known at the moment , another company - tethers unlimited - has demonstrated how structures could be built in space with their spiderfab proposal , a system of robo - spiders that would build parts of spacecraft in orbit , although mr bill kemp told mailonline that the uss method would be ' different '
mr bill kemp added that , for this large structure , it would take about 30 years to build and cost close to Â£ 200 billion ( $ 300 billion )
for comparison , it took more than 10 years to build the iss. , at a cost of around Â£ 67 million ( $ 100 billion ) - although this new station has 2.89 million times more volume
â artificial gravity has been considered many times before , most famously in the ' stanford torus ' design ( interior seen here )
the gemini 11 spacecraft was attached to an agena target vehicle and spun , with the astronauts reporting a small amount of artificial gravity in their spacecraft on the iss. , the station is in constant freefall towards earth as it orbits the planet - so the astronauts live in â zero - gravity â
â our first structure will be 30 metres [ 100ft ] in diameter , it will create a 0.6 gravity environment and would house at least 30 people , â he said
the majority of early space station concepts created artificial gravity one way or another in order to simulate a more natural or familiar environment for the health of the astronauts on board however , space settlement expert al globus , who is also a contract scientist at nasa 's ames research centre , told mailonline that he thought the idea was somewhat sound - and artificial gravity was a necessity for prolonged stays in space
several other proposals for a rotating space station have been drawn up - including a nasa concept called nautilus-x - but as of yet , there are no concrete plans by nasa , russian space agency ( the russian space agency ) or any other nation on what to do after the iss. whether this station by united space structures or another concept will be built , remains to be seen
the spacecraft is designed for long trips to the moon , mars or beyond while a spacecraft could be created with artificial gravity , astronauts will still have to contend with zero - gravity conditions if they ever venture outside into space
