filmed in the thai town of kanchanaburi , the monkey approaches the woman , who holds a banana , with its outstretched hands
getting right up into the camera âs lens the monkey appears to sniff it while diverting its eyes , as if hoping that it is food
the cheeky money snatches the banana from the woman 's hand and begins scoffing it down realising that it is out of luck , it returns to its original position and continues tucking into the banana
cradling its food under its arm as if protecting it from the oncoming threat , the monkey raises its left hand and gives the camera a slap
