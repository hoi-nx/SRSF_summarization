she , her mother and three siblings are understood to have been living in the syrian camp since hudea 's father was killed in the 2012 hama massacre
but two weeks ago , the family took a fateful decision to move south , towards the city of idlib - only for it to fall into the hands of al qaeda 's brutal syrian affiliate at the weekend
pictured : an al nusra fighter holds his group flag in front of idlib 's governor building sharia law : al nusra have promised to bring in sharia law in the city , and have already started burning things considered banned under islam - like these cigarettes the al nusra - led rebels is set impose sharia law on the city , which is only the second state capital to fall from the grip of president al-assad 's regime
' we salute the people of idlib and their stand with their sons , the mujahideen , ... and god willing they will enjoy the justice of sharia , which will preserve their religion and their blood , ' said abu mohamad al-golani , al nusra 's leader , in a recording released on wednesday
winter , of the qilliam foundation , warned : ' al nusra is an outspoken al qaeda affiliate
it espouses a severe interpretation of islam and sharia law
it is a violent interpretation of sharia law
worringly , the al nusra - who reiterated their allegiance to al qaeda in the last month - have said they want to create their own ' islamic state '
in the days since they took control of idlib , there have been reports of two christians men being executed , while the vatican - citing local news sources - claimed a greek orthodox priest had been kidnapped by jihadists
fight : the city fell after a four day battle which saw fighters on both sides lose their lives flee : it is thought about 15,000 people ran from the city as the al nusra approached trauma : save the children reports many of the children were traumatised by what they had seen for a child like hudea , who has clearly already been left horribly traumatised by a war which has been raging her entire life , life under the strict sharia law is likely to be nothing be more terrifying
they fled to a village in idlib about two weeks ago
relative safety : many of the 15,000 are headed to refugee camps like atmeh , near the turkish border - but it is not known where hudea and her small family are civil war : fighting has been going on hudea 's entire life , killing 10,000 children since 2011
one suspects the memory of what they did to her husband will mean hudea 's mother will keep her family away from al-assad 's forces
but villages not in the control of the regime have come under attack since al nusra 's assault on idlib - which itself sent 15,000 people fleeing for their lives
