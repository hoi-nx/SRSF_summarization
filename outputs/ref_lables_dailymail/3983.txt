few people can fail be wowed by technicolor butterfly wings that ' sparkle ' in the sunlight
this image shows the wing of a sunset moth the photos were shot by linden gledhill from staffordshire , who combines his love of photography with a phd in biochemistry
the 51 - year - old uses a modified microscope and a camera to capture the detail of the butterfly 's wing pattern
butterfly wings are covered by thousands of microscopic scales split into two to three layers , which gives them their greek order name of lepidoptera - meaning scaled wings
it is a species of swallowtail butterfly native to eastern north american and is one of the most familiar butterflies in the eastern us , where it is common in many different habitats each scale of a butterfly is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring , but eye - catching blues , greens , reds and iridescence ( pictured ) are created by the microstructure of the scales , rather than pigments
in fact , each scale has multiple layers which are separated by air , so when light hits them it 's reflected many times and the combination of these reflections causes us to see the intense yellows and blues of many butterfly species the brighter colours are created thanks to the scattering of light by the scales , which are layered in different patterns on top of each other
â he uses a trinocular - reflecting light microscope fitted with neo s - plan objectives , or attachments , and takes the photographs using a canon eos 5d mark ii , which is fitted to the top of the microscope
' this close - up image shows scales on the wings of the monarch butterfly mr linden gledhill imaged the madagascan sunset moth 's wings in minute detail
he also captured the wings of the monarch butterfly ( stock image shown right ) , which is the most familiar north american butterfly species he uses a trinocular - reflecting light microscope fitted with neo s - plan objectives , or attachments , and takes the photographs using a canon eos 5d mark ii mark ii. this camera is fitted to the top of the microscope
overlapping pale blue scales are pictured the depth of field in a single microscope image is too small to see the whole of the butterfly in one image , so mr linden gledhill takes up to 200 separate images spaced by one micron intervals to capture the creatures
