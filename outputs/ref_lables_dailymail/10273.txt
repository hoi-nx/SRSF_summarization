labour leader harold wilson secretly lobbied the bbc to change the time of popular comedy steptoe and son on the night of the 1964 election because he feared working class voters would stay at home and watch the show instead of supporting his candidates
according to new archive footage held by the bbc , mr harold wilson went to the home of bbc director general sir hugh and told him the show could cost him 20 seats
the labour leader thought the planned repeat of the sit - com starring harry h corbett and wilfrid brambell would hit them badly
the bbc is releasing an archive interview with sir hugh recorded in 1982 as well as a 1981 interview with the former prime minister
he had been very much upset because the bbc had planned the beginning of a series of repeats of a very popular light entertainment programme , steptoe and son , on the evening of polling day
sir hugh continued : ' harold wilson that evening began by accusing the bbc of plotting against him
the next day i discussed the matter further with the controller of bbc and we thought a good idea would be to shift it from early in the evening until nine o'clock , when at that time the polls closed
' i rang up harold wilson and told him about this decision and he said to me he was very grateful - it might make a difference of about 20 seats to him
' former bbc director general sir hugh , pictured , said mr harold wilson feared broadcasting steptoe and son on the 1964 election night could end up costing the labour 20 seats - they won the election by four mr harold wilson also gave an interview on the subject which has been published as part of the archive
