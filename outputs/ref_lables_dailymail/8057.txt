the future of britain 's independent nuclear deterrent sparked a bitter war of words yesterday
tories claimed russia leader vladimir putin would be happy with miliband as prime minister because he can not be trusted to keep our trident submarines
defence secretary michael fallon led a ferocious assault on the labour leader â claiming he is a ' backstabber ' who can not be trusted not to sell out in a ' grubby ' deal with the snp
business and skills minister boles , a close ally of david cameron , went further , claiming the russia president would be pleased to see mr miliband enter downing street propped up by snp leader sturgeon
who does vladimir putin want to see running britain after may 7 ? ' mr boles demanded
' mr miliband reacted with fury to the attacks , accusing the tories of ' desperate smears ' and dragging the election campaign ' into the gutter ' by claiming he would ' stab the britain in the back ' in the same way that he did brother david in the labour leadership contest
' david cameron should be ashamed , ' mr miliband said , insisting that labour was committed to renewing the trident fleet
but mr michael fallon 's promise to renew all four submarines appeared to leave labour in disarray
mr michael fallon said the full replacement of trident would be a ' red line ' in any second conservative - liberal democrat coalition
mr miliband said he favoured ' basically four boats ' but it was ' right to have a review ' while labour treasury spokesman chris leslie said that maintaining four submarines was ' exactly the policy that we have had for a very long time '
earlier this year mr miliband had said he favoured the ' least cost deterrent ' possible
a survey of labour candidates , conducted by the cnd , suggests that mr miliband would have difficulty carrying large sections of his party with him if he sought to renew trident
former defence secretary liam fox said the lack of clarity from labour over trident left britain in a ' very dangerous position '
' as many as three - quarters of labour candidates oppose the replacement of britain 's trident nuclear deterrent

' mr david cameron backed mr michael fallon 's attack and challenged mr miliband to rule out any arrangement with the snp that would put labour into power
