wellness warrior belle gibson sensationally admitted yesterday in a tell - all interview that she had made up her terminal brain cancer diagnosis
the 23 - year - old founder of the whole pantry app came clean about her circumstances , telling the australian women 's weekly , ' none of it 's true '
in the interview , gibson asked her former fans and customers who purchased her app and books to see her as only ' human '
leading psychologist jo lamble told daily mail australia that this is a common reaction from people who are suffering from anti-social personality and narcissism disorders
lack of remorse is a common trait seen in those with anti-social personalities , jo lamble says
' while other experts suggested to australian women 's weekly that she could be suffering munchhausen , jo lamble believes this is n't likely to be the case for gibson
changing times : ' in the past , a need for that love and attention may have been in less dangerous ways ... but now technology has allowed it to get completely out of hand , ' says jo lamble ' with munchhausen , they normally do nât just lie , they go much further to be sick
they also might drink poison or swallow things or stab themselves , then ask , " what âs wrong with me ? '' ' so i think in this particular case , she âs made up a story for fame , fortune , signing book deals - which suggests more narcissism and anti-socialism , ' added jo lamble
' a lack or remorse definitely fits in ... you do want you need to do to get what you want ' : leading psychologist jo lamble says that gibson 's actions point to both a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder ' narcissistic people will lie and build themselves up to be an amazing person full of grandiosity , wanting fame and fortune
according to jo lamble , the common signs of someone showing an anti-social personality disorder are ... 1
' social media has become the perfect way to gain that , we know anyone is thrilled when they get new followers - let alone hero worship , worldwide fans and book deals , ' she said
' jo lamble says our social media culture is fuelling unhealthy expectations for young girls but also a way of accessing information that could be misleading
' they love to believe they are special ' : ' narcissistic people will lie and build themselves up to be an amazing person full of grandiosity , wanting fame and fortune , says psychologist jo lamble ( pictured left )
