and then needing a win to go top of the premier league with just two games to go , mourinho watched his side draw 0 - 0 at home to norwich , who were about to be relegated
chelsea âs most impressive result during that run - in was a 2 - 0 win at liverpool , a game made famous by steven gerrard âs slip
that day chelsea let liverpool have 73 per cent possession over the 90 minutes
and mourinho did the same on saturday to an in - form manchester united , who had 70 per cent possession at stamford bridge
manchester united boss louis van gaal was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1 - 0 by chelsea steven gerrard slips against chelsea at anfield last season - a game chelsea won with only 17 % possession ba scores as chelsea go on to win at anfield and effectively end liverpool 's title push last season the dutch master might just wonder to himself if things could have been different if he had certain individuals fit
