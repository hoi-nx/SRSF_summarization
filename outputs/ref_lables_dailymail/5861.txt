ed miliband 's proposed change in the rules on ' non-doms ' would cost britain billions , experts warned last night
the labour leader announced plans to overhaul britain 's non-domicile regime , which allows 116,000 foreigners and people with foreign links to pay tax only on money that they bring into britain
mr ed miliband initially suggested he would ' abolish ' non-dom status â but it later emerged that labour is effectively proposing a time limit on it of between two and five years
announcing the policy , labour aides suggested the change in the rules , which date back to the 18th century , would raise as much as Â£ 1billion
with non-doms paying around Â£ 8billion in tax and national insurance a year , it is claimed that labour 's proposal could in fact create a huge hole in treasury coffers
in a video that emerged yesterday , mr balls can be seen telling a local bbc radio station that abolishing the status altogether ' will probably end up costing britain money because some people will leave the country '
the issue of non-doms is a sensitive one for the tories , because mr ed miliband has claimed david cameron is close to ' dodgy donors ' , including non-doms , who support the party
last night , sources close to chancellor osborne indicated he would consider scrapping the right to pass on non-dom status to heirs
you have balls admitting it will cost britain money and then when you look at the small print it turns out the majority of non-doms wo n't be affected
' in a speech at the university of warwick , mr ed miliband insisted non-dom status was an ' arcane ' rule dating back to the time of william pitt the younger , allowing a ' few people at the top ' to ' operate under different rules '
but he was scathing about labour 's proposals , which he said would cost the country dear
' jolyon maugham , the qc who advised labour on its plans for reform , conceded the policy could lead to a flight of wealthy taxpayers from britain
yet the labour supporter was cited by both mr ed miliband and mr balls as an independent expert who supports the policy
lib dem leader nick clegg defended the non-dom rule , saying it allowed people to come to britain , some of whom were not ' massively rich '
