three reportedly inexperienced abalone divers died after jumping into rough seas off the coast of northern california on sunday
the men were part of a group of five divers from the east coast and san francisco
ten friends , including the dead men , had rented a house on caspar cove 160 miles north of san francisco to hunt for abalone , a rare and expensive mollusk that is prized as a delicacy
witnesses said at least some of the men appeared to be inexperienced abalone divers who chose rough , choppy waters near several dangerous rock outcroppings to dive - instead of entering the water at the soft beach nearby
