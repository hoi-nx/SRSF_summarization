rangers manager ramsey claims that covert racism still exists in football boardrooms ramsey believes that the implementing of a rooney rule could help raise awareness of the ' covert ' issue john barnes â view that black managers find it hard to get a job after being sacked was backed up by ramsey â the fact we âre still , at this stage of the game , highlighting that i âm the only black premier league manager shows that it âs not the norm to have people from ethnic minorities in this position
â obviously , i âm in a very fortunate position to be the manager of rangers but i hope people wo nât look at that as a token gesture
he lasted four months before being sacked ramsey is operating as the only black manager in the premier league as he looks to keep rangers up ramsey was without a job for seven months after leaving his coaching role at tottenham last season â i think that there are other people who are probably more talented or better suited , from a profile point of view , as many white managers who have got jobs based on their profile and playing experience
i think the rooney rule is an important factor as there âs an awareness that something has to be done to affect the way people think in boardrooms
