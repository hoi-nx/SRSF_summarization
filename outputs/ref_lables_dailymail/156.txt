but the manchester derby this sunday still holds great significance for both clubs , managers and , of course , supporters
manchester city have won the last four contests between the sides , as well as the previous three at old trafford
can manuel pellegrini survive a derby loss ? the word is the chilean âs future will be decided come may when the dust on a creaking season has settled
it would leave manchester city trailing united by four points and likely to finish fourth , needing to get past a qualifying round to reach to champions league â the very minimum requirement
manuel pellegrini ( centre ) is a man under - pressure at manchester city and a defeat to their rivals is unthinkable who needs the win more ? to that end you would probably have to say manchester city
a victory would inject some happiness into what seems a rather glum situation , and reignite ambitions to finish second , possible saving manuel pellegrini from the axe
manchester united look set to finish in the top four regardless , the baseline attainment for this campaign to be judged satisfactory
manchester united have never lost five in a row to manchester city before
glenn murray ( right ) tormented manchester city at selhurst park as they dropped out of the premier league title race would victory dispel any lingering doubts about van gaal ? quite likely
van gaal has had his critics this season but manchester united 's performances are proving them wrong should kompany remain in the manchester city side ? it would be a big call for a game of such size , but the sense that manchester city may be better off without their captain can not be disregarded
kompany ( left ) has struggled for form this campaign and could lose his place for the derby where does this rank in english football âs biggest games ? manchester has become a powerhouse of english football through manchester city âs ascent
mario balotelli ( centre ) produced one of the most iconic derby moments when he scored at old trafford who is the better player right now : wayne rooney or sergio aguero ? no doubt sergio aguero is the better striker , his movement , angles for shooting , and goal - scoring record stands testament to that
but since being shifted to his preferred centre - forward role , wayne rooney is displaying form that would see him into any side
wayne rooney holds the record for most all - time goals with 11 , while sergio aguero has six in seven
wayne rooney ( left ) and sergio aguero are two of the best forwards in the current premier league how crucial might michael carrick be ? his return to the manchester united lineup in the fulcrum role in front of defence has lifted the side considerably
he has not enjoyed the best returns facing manchester city in recent seasons â and in the corresponding fixture was asked to play centre - back as a first - half substitute â but will get more space in his deeper midfield role
like kompany , yaya toure 's form is patchy but he scored a stunning goal against crystal palace on monday will manchester united solve the problem of angel di maria ? the team looks balanced right now , with ashley young doing nothing to lose his place
angel di maria has n't quite settled in manchester but recently has done well when coming off the bench
