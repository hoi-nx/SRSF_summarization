the reports come as acoustic scientists from curtin university refuse to rule out the possibility that ' distinctive ' data they recorded from the area at the assumed time of the crash may have come from the impact of the aircraft as it hit the indian

malaysia 's civil aviation chief , azharuddin abdul rahman declared the crash an accident dr duncan ( left ) from curtin university 's centre for marine science and technology began investigating a low - frequency underwater sound signal the signal was recorded west of rottnest island using acoustic recorders ( above ) at 1:30 am on march 8 the reports from kudahuvadhoo follow information released from curtin university that a ' clear acoustic signal ' was recorded at a time reasonably consistent with the timeline of the plane 's disappearance
dr duncan and his associates from the university 's centre for marine science and technology began investigating a low - frequency underwater sound signal which was recorded west of rottnest island just after 1:30 am utc on march 8
the centre , along with united nations â comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty organisation ( ctbto ) and geoscience australia were involved in investigating data that might prove helpful to the search , and originally determined that the noise 's source was close to the maldives and kudahuvadhoo
' data from one of the imos ( integrated marine observing system ) recorders showed a clear acoustic signal at a time that was reasonably consistent with other information relating to the disappearance of mh370 , ' dr duncan said in a statement released by curtin university
an indian sand artist created a message of prayer for the missing crew and passengers of the flight relatives of the missing passengers of flight mh370 visit a temple in china to pray for their family members relatives of passengers of the flight are told the news that mh370 plunged into the sea on march 24 , 2014 ' the crash of a large aircraft in the ocean would be a high energy event and expected to generate intense underwater sounds
