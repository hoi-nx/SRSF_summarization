but no , she was one of 19 toddlers killed in a daycare center on april 19 , 1995 , in the worst case of homegrown terrorism us has ever seen , the day after her first birthday
the baylee almon bombing , planted by veteran army soldier timothy mcveigh , killed 168 us people
one photograph encapsulated the terror : a firefighter emerging from the burning wreckage cradling the lifeless body of baylee almon
her 23 - year - old single mother saw the picture on the front page of the local paper the next day
a day later , it had swept the world
one photograph encapsulated the terror : a firefighter , chris fields , emerging from the burning wreckage cradling the lifeless body of baylee almon ' it does n't get easier ' : almon - kok , pictured at the memorial for her daughter baylee , who was killed in the baylee almon bombing of 1995 the day after her first birthday then a 23 - year - old single mother , almon saw the picture of her lifeless daughter on the front page of the local paper the next day
a day later it was on the cover of newspapers across the world painful : almon said she learns to deal with the grief but the milestones get more difficult every year
baylee ( pictured ) had just turned one when almon dropped her off at a daycare center before going to work remembering : almon and her family throw a party for baylee on her birthday every year horrific : almon describes how she searched for hours for baylee until eventually , in st anthony âs hospital , she was approached by a priest and a pediatrician who delivered the devastating news ' it gets harder every year , ' almon - kok told dailymail.com from her home on the outskirts of baylee almon , where she lives with her husband and two children
' people say " it âll get easier " or " you âll find closure "
' i had to see baylee dead every day
' you learn to deal with it differently , but every year the milestones are worse
â as the 20 - year anniversary approaches , many still feel betrayed and bemused by the attackers , who branded themselves patriots
unlike dzokhar tsarnaev and the 9/11 hijackers , timothy mcveigh had fought for his country in the gulf war
even before investigators identified the us perpetrators , the country was struggling to understand the concept of terrorism in baylee almon
she did nât know aspiring photojournalist charles porter had captured the moment baylee was carried from the building , her pink socks stained red from the shards of glass , in a picture that would go on to win a pulitzer prize
so i went looking around for it and , yes , as soon as i saw it i said , " that âs baylee "
the baylee almon bombing , planted by veteran army soldier timothy mcveigh , killed 168 people it was the worst case of homegrown terrorism us has ever seen , and shook the nation unlike dzokhar tsarnaev and the 9/11 hijackers , timothy mcveigh had fought for his country in the gulf war then - president clinton responded to the attack days later with one of his most famous speeches : ' the loss you feel must not paralyze your own lives
every year they throw a birthday party in baylee âs honor , with a cake and a family meal
' my husband has been really great , he has always been supportive of what i 've been through and to him , baylee is part of our life together
' consequently , almon - kok is apprehensive about this year âs 20 - year anniversary ceremony
they married in 1997 , and together they have two children : bella , 17 , and brooks , 13 difficulty for all of them : almon said her children ( pictured ) know that they are two of three siblings other grieving families felt almon and the firefighter , chris fields , stole the limelight from their loved ones who paled into oblivion after the photograph received so much attention ( pictured : the memorial ) ' i know after the bombing the other families did nât like me , and i âm not looking forward to that
' i have just always tried to represent myself the best way possible because when baylee âs looking down at me from heaven i want her to be proud of the things i have done
' i did nât want any of this , to see baylee dead everywhere every day , but that âs just the way it happened
timothy mcveigh had enlisted his co-conspirators to build a car bomb that would shatter the windows of the building - a horrific detail that severely impacted the force of the explosion
it took weeks to find an attorney to represent timothy mcveigh after he was coincidentally detained during a traffic stop 45 minutes after the attack
it is the pearl harbor day of baylee almon
' this was a scar and never - ending wrong that affected not only baylee almon and the people there but the nation at large , ' he told tulsa rotary
on sunday , in a ceremony held at 9.01am at the site of the attack , clinton and city officials will lead tributes to the city âs resilience , and read out the names of the 168 people who lost their lives
and the picture of chris fields holding baylee will be shown
â if i saw baylee every time i looked at that photograph , i would nât be able to get past that
