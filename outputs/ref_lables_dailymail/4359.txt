a writer has revealed why she stopped washing her hair six years ago after embarking on a quest to try and control her greasy , limp locks - by avoiding shampoo
new york city sarah theeboom was inspired to give up using products on her hair after she ran into an old friend whose once dry , frizzy locks were smooth and shiny
when sarah theeboom asked for her secret , her friend explained that she had simply stopped shampooing , opting to partake in the apparently - popular ' no poo ' movement , which sarah theeboom had never heard of until that moment
new woman : the writer from new york city said her hair is now silkier and ' totally frizz - free ' since she gave up using shampoo it took six weeks for her hair to feel somewhat normal again and then another six weeks of her hair looking ' so - so ' before the ' magic happened '
' it was silky and wavier and totally frizz - free
' the ' no poo ' movement has gained popularity over recent years because of celebrities such as kim kardashian , shailene woodley , adele and jessica simpson who have revealed that that they avoid washing their hair for days - and sometimes months - on end
because it is no longer considered a ludicrous concept , sarah theeboom said that she typically does n't have a problem sharing her hair secret , but she did note that sometimes she will come across someone who just does n't get it - including one hair stylist who did n't understand why she could n't shampoo her hair
