a set of stone flakes shaped more than 3.3 million years ago could be the world 's oldest tools created by early human ancestors , according to researchers
archaeologists have revealed that they have discovered 20 stone flakes and anvils - used to help shape the tools - just west of lake turkana in kenya
the discovery could fundamentally change the current view of human evolution as - if correct - the date of the stone tools is 700,000 years older than any others found previously
the stone tools were discovered buried in sediment along the west coast of lake turkana ( above ) in kenya it means that ancient human ancestors were creating tools hundreds of thousands of years before the appearance of the first ' man ' - the start of our branch of the evolutionary tree known as homo
many experts have long believed that it was the use of stone tools by early species of homo like homo habilis and homo erectus that helped set them apart from other human - like species
they had brains no larger than a chimpanzee 's 2.8 million years ago - ld 350 - 1 appeared and may be the first of the homo family 2.7 million years ago - paranthropus , lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing 2.3 million years ago - homo habalis first thought to have appeared in africa 1.8 million years ago - homo ergaster begins to appear in fossil record 1.6 million years ago - hand axes become the first major technological innovation 800,000 years ago - early humans control fire and create hearths
brain size increases rapidly 400,000 years ago - neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across europe and asia 200,000 years ago - homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in africa 40,0000 years ago - modern humans reach europe scientists behind the discovery now believe ancient species known as australopithecine - typified by the fossilised skeleton called lucy - or kenyanthropus platyops made the tools
but after taking a wrong turn they came across another area and spotted what looked like stone tools on the sandy surface
' the tools were found at a site known as lomekwi 3 , just west of lake turkana in kenya
a further 130 stone tools were discovered on the surface
this skull of kenyanthropus platyops was found close to the site of the stone tools in 1999 close to lake turkana in kenya and may be the species responsible for creating the stone flakes that have been discovered this stone tool - known as an olduvai chopper - on display at the british museum is around 1.8 million years old was thought to be one of the earliest examples of stone that had been used by ancient human ancestors these early stone tools found in ethiopia are thought to be around 1.7 million years and were used as choppers this is close to the date of another piece of controversial evidence found in 2010 that suggested stone tools were used long before the appearance of the homo species on earth
now the latest discovery is the strongest evidence yet that these early humans did have ability to make and use tools rather than being primative creatures
until the recent discovery , the oldest stone tools to be discovered were in gona , ethiopia and were thought to have been made by early homo species - possibly homo habilis
the stone tools were discovered buried in sediment at a site called lomekwi on the coast of lake turkana the stone tools may have been made by relatives of ' lucy ' , a female australopithecus afarensis that lived 3.2 million years ago who is shown above in a reconstruction at the houston museum of natural science in texas recent discoveries have suggested that the homo genus first began around 2.8 million years ago , but the tools discovered at lake turkana are 500,000 years older than that
' this fossilised jawbone with teeth still in place is thought to belong to the earliest member of the homo genus 2.8 million years ago but this is still 500,000 years short of the time when stone tools were being used
