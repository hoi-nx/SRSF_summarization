break - ups can be hard enough to deal with but two women were left with permanent reminders of their failed relationships thanks to having their ex-partners ' names tattooed on their bodies
jessica hardy , 23 , from hereford , was so desperate to remove her former flame 's name from her forearm when she met her new man , ryan , she tried to burn it off with acid
' i 'm desperate to get rid of it , i have bad dreams about it , ' she said on channel 5 show tattoo disasters
' but instead of removing her tattoo as she hoped , jessica hardy 's dangerous diy treatment gave her chemical burns
a chemical peel should be applied by a beauty professional as it 's designed to damage the skin in a controlled way
the body responds to the damage by healing and rejuvenating the skin - supposedly making it look younger
but jessica hardy applied the acid without diluting it with water or reading the instructions
as a result , it immediately caused her skin to burn and blister

her skin became red raw , scabby and inflamed - and worst of all , the tattoo was still visible
