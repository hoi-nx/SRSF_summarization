ula has unveiled radical plans to launch a reusable rocket named ' vulcan ' in 2019
vulcan will use new engines , mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on - orbit manoeuvres
the company appears to have timed the announcement to overshadow spacex ' launch of falcon , which today hoped to prove that reusable rockets are viable
ula has unveiled a radical plans for reusable rocket named ' vulcan ' that is slated to take off in 2019
vulcan will use new engines , mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on - orbit manoeuvres the aim of both spacex and ula is to end us dependence on russian - built rocket engines , but the technology has so far proven difficult
russian - made rd-180 engines currently ula 's atlas rocket , but congress banned further imports as part of trade sanctions enacted after russian invaded ukraine last year
ula said the new rocket 's first stage will be powered by a pair of liquid - oxygen and liquefied methane engines under development by blue origin
it hopes to separate the engines after launch , inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to nab them mid-air
it hopes to separate the engines after launch , inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to grab them mid-air reusing the engines will enable ula to cut launch costs to about $ 100 million for a medium - lift booster and about $ 200 million for heavy - lift variants
initially , ula will use its existing upper - stage centaur engine but plans to introduce in 2023 an advanced motor that can recycle waste propellants
hours after unveiling its next - generation ' vulcan ' rocket , ula ( ula ) , ran into its first problem - the rocket 's name
' paul allen and vulcan were early leaders within space exploration with the launch of spaceshipone more than a decade ago
' ula also plans to reduce its launch pads from five to two , and offer a standardised menu of fixed launch prices , much like spacex , which posts its falcon rocket pricing on its website
today , it attempted to land the first - stage booster of a falcon 9 rocket on a platform floating a few hundred miles off florida 's northeastern coast , near jacksonville
spacex founder , elon musk 's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world , to reduce launch costs
