garza was given the death sentence after killing san antonio police officer riojas in february 2001 asked to make a final statement , garza said he was sorry for causing pain to his family , friends and ' especially police officers '
' y'all probably hate me , ' he said , looking at three friends of his victim , dressed in their navy blue san antonio police uniforms
' as the lethal drug began taking effect , garza uttered : ' here it comes ! ' his voice rose as he said ' goodbye , ' and then he let out a howl that was cut short within seconds as he took three deep breaths , then a couple of shallow ones
he was pronounced dead 26 minutes later at 6.40pm
before his death , garza was given the same food as the rest of the inmates in his unit for his final meal because texas no longer allows special - order last meals , according tolast suppers
garza , 35 , already had a long criminal record at age 20 when he was stopped by riojas , who was part of a team targeting property crimes at apartment complexes

riojas , 37 , was fatally shot in the head
witnesses said garza put riojas 's gun in his pants , cursed at the fallen officer , and ran away
garza was apprehended a day later at his sister 's apartment after an informant told detectives that someone had tried to sell him the officer 's missing semi-automatic service weapon
garza fled when he was stopped by riojas , which led to a struggle and the police officer 's death he used obscenity - laced language to tell officers they were ' lucky i did n't get y'all ... too
several dozen police officers were outside the prison wednesday evening , and stood at attention and saluted as riojas ' sister - who also is with the san antonio department and watched garza die - and the officer - witnesses emerged
