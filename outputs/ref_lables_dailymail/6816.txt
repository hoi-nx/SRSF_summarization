david cameron has been criticised for ramping up aid spending britain is paying professional aid workers up to Â£ 1,000 a day to work in africa and asia as part of a huge push to meet government targets on aid spending , it was claimed last night
spending on consultants has doubled to Â£ 1.4billion over the past four years and now makes up more than ten per cent of all foreign aid spending , an investigation revealed
hundreds of â team leaders â working on aid projects earn at least Â£ 120,000 a year once the costs of their expenses , security and accommodation are taken into account , an investigation found
daily rates of between Â£ 800 and Â£ 1000 are commonplace , the times newspaper claimed
the revelations will return attention to britain âs growing aid budget , which now accounts for some Â£ 12 billion of public spending a year
the coalition government committed to spending 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid â and even passed legislation to enshrine the target into law
that target means that aid spending will increase every year if the economy grows , even if other areas of government spending face swingeing cuts
david cameron has been criticised for ramping up aid spending while slashing funding for the police , defence and justice
a spokesman said : â dfid has slashed spending on external consultancy and advisory services by 98.9 per cent since 2009 , down to just Â£ 200,000 last year , but we rightly continue to use the private sector where it delivers aid projects on the ground that are effective and the best value for money
