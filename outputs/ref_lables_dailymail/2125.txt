winemakers have been accused of fighting new eu regulations on revealing the calorie count on their labels because it will reveal that a bottle of red has the same as six digestives
however , european winemakers argue that introducing nutritional labelling would lead to an intolerable rise in production costs , and hit smaller vineyards
closing the loophole : the european parliament is set to vote on whether alcoholic beverages must include calorie counts on their labels under current eu regulations , producers of alcoholic drinks are not obliged to reveal the nutritional value of their products on the label
according to times , winemakers fear a fall in sales if consumers realise that ' a bottle of red wine has about the same amount of calories as half a packet of digestive biscuits '
' obligatory nutritional labelling would lead to an intolerable rise in production costs , ' said abad , policy officer for the comitã© europã©en des entreprises vins , the wine industry 's european body , told times
fighting back : winemakers say that introducing nutritional labelling would mean annual tests to extablish calories of each vintage , leading to a rise in production costs that would mainly hit smaller vineyards ms abad also said that as the nutritional value of a bottle of wine changes with age , the calories on the label would not be the same down the line
counting calories : consumer and health organisations want wine producers to include calories on their bottles so drinkers can make ' informed choices ' rsph chief executive shirley cramer said : ' calorie labelling has been successfully introduced for a wide range of food products and there is now a clear public appetite for this information to be extended to alcohol to help individuals make informed choices
