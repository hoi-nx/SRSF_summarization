a picture , believed to be the only image of the civil war ironclad , the georgia has been revealed to be a fake created in a teenage hoax using a 2ft model
john potter , from savannah , has admitted forging the picture with his brother in the 1980s and placing it in a frame which now holds a picture of his dead dog
he then passed on the image on to the georgia historical society and the photo became an unofficial part of the ship 's history even though it was never authenticated
' he told historians that he did n't have the $ 175 the owner wanted , so he took a photo of it and then mailed it to historical groups in savannah
john potter has now admitted the sham and explained how he falsified the image
when he was a teenager in savannah , john potter , his brother jeffrey and a friend shot a short 8mm movie about the building â and destruction â of the georgia in a fictional battle with union troops
john potter also used an illustration of the ironclad he found on a postcard
to create the fake image john potter 's younger brother put on a coat and straw hat went out to a marsh with a cane fishing pole and john potter took a photo
he took another photo of the 2 - foot model and cut out the boat 's image , glued it onto the photo of his brother , then used dirt and glue to create the illusion of a photo faded by age and stained by water or chemicals
evidence of the hoax : all elements of the fakery were snapped by john potter at one time
the small model boat here appears alongside the false picture , polaroids of it and a 1984 copy of mad magazine he bought an old picture frame and beat it up even further
the army corps of engineers appealed for information about the picture as it embarked on a project to raise the ironclad john potter sent out the photo to historical groups , setting off the sporadic , and fruitless , search for a georgia photo that he now says never existed
