palaeontologists are referring to chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a ' platypus ' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features a new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants , despite being closely related to notorious carnivore tyrannosaurus , has been discovered in chile
palaeontologists are referring to chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a ' platypus ' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics , including its small skull and feet
the presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds , but chilesaurus diegosuarezi shows that a meat - free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought
the seven - year - old came across the fossils at the toqui formation in southern chile when he and his sister , macarena were looking for decorative stones
experts initially thought diego had unearthed several species , due to chilesaurus diegosuarezi ' unusual combination of features
the dinosaur has been likened to a platypus , which is one of the most unusual creatures in the animal kingdom , because it 's one of very few mammal to lay eggs , has venomous spurs and a paddle - shaped tail like a beaver , as well as webbed feet and a bill like a duck , among other idiosyncrasies
most of the specimens discovered are the size of a turkey , but some isolated bones reveal the maximum size of chilesaurus diegosuarezi was around 10 feet ( three metres ) long , according to chile and argentina palaeontologists from institutions including the university of birmingham who have studied the skeletons
unusual : fossils dating from the late jurassic period , around 145 million years ago , reveal an unusual combination of features from various dinosaur groups , including relatively short arms , a long neck , small head and leaf - shaped teeth ( pictured ) bizarre : palaeontologists are referring to chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a ' platypus ' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics including its small skull and feet , which are more like those seen on long - neck dinosaurs
the dinosaur itself , has a lengthy neck and must have had good balance ( illustrated ) palaeontologists are referring to chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a ' platypus ' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics
chilesaurus diegosuarezi has robust forelimbs similar to jurassic theropods such as allosaurus , but has two blunt fingers instead of sharp claws , like the velociraptor , for example
it has leaf - shaped teeth , similar to those of primitive long - neck dinosaurs
they discovered that chilesaurus diegosuarezi has robust forelimbs similar to jurassic theropods such as allosaurus
for example , its leaf - shaped teeth are similar to those of primitive long - neck dinosaurs because they were selected over millions of years as a result of a similar diet between these two lineages of dinosaurs
' chilesaurus diegosuarezi can be considered a " platypus " dinosaur because different parts of its body resemble those of other dinosaur groups due to mosaic convergent evolution , â martã­n ezcurra , a researcher at the university of birmingham explained
painstaking : close inspection of the fossils revealed that chilesaurus diegosuarezi has robust forelimbs similar to jurassic theropods such as allosaurus
the process of excavating the skeleton is shown the presence of herbivorous theropods was , up until now , only known in close relatives of birds but chilesaurus diegosuarezi ( illustrated left ) shows that a meat - free diet was acquired much earlier than thought
its fossils were found at the toqui formation in southern chile , marked with a red star on the map , right â in this process , a region or regions of an organism resemble others of unrelated species because of a similar mode of life and evolutionary pressures
' chilesaurus diegosuarezi shows how much data is still completely unknown about the early diversification of major dinosaur groups
he was at the site while his his geologist parents , manuel suarez ( pictured right ) and rita de la cruz were studying rocks with the aim to better understand the formation of the andes experts initially thought diego had unearthed several species , due to chilesaurus diegosuarezi ' unusual combination of features
here , a palaeontologist painstakingly excavates the fossils he said : â chilesaurus diegosuarezi is the first complete dinosaur from the jurassic found in chile and represents one of the most complete and anatomically correct documented theropod dinosaurs from the southern hemisphere
â chilesaurus diegosuarezi was an odd plant - eating dinosaur only to be found in chile
