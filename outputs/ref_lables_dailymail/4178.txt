the party âs deputy leader harriet harman , in an interview with the daily mail , said grandparents would be allowed to take up to four unpaid weeks off per year in order to help with childcare
she said the policy , to be unveiled in labour âs women âs manifesto , to be launched today , would require a change in the law and would help millions of working families
but the proposed extension of workplace rights to millions more staff is likely to meet with a backlash from some business leaders , who will have to bear the costs of absences
critics will argue businesses can not be expected to cope with more rights for employees as the economy recovers from the recession
miss harriet harman insisted many businesses would welcome â granny leave â , since it would be likely to keep more older women in the workplace â and also enable their children have a better work - life balance
â in many families , grandparents play an integral part of caring for their grandchildren and for many people that âs a financial necessity , â she said
it âs the first time there has been a policy which recognises this role of grandparents
â miss harriet harman says a labour government would legislate to allow grandparents as well as parents , or those with legal responsibility , to access the leave currently , parents can claim 18 weeks unpaid parental leave - of up to four weeks in any given year - per child up to their fifth birthday , soon to be extended to their eighteenth birthday
miss harriet harman says a labour government would legislate to allow grandparents as well as parents , or those with legal responsibility , to access the leave
â so this policy is also a win for employers as it helps both parents and grandparents stay in work
the party will also pledge today to crack down further on domestic violence by appointing a new commissioner to direct policy to tackle abuse .
