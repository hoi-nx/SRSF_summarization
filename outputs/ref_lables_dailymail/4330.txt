spfl clubs are poised to do battle over a late hibs move to cash in on the premiership play - offs
currently second in the championship , the easter road club stand to make Â£ 1million from anticipated sell - out home gates against rangers and the 11th place club in the premiership - currently motherwell
under recently passed spfl rules , however , play - off sides must hand over 50 per cent of their play - off profits for distribution among lower league clubs within seven days
and , faced with the possible loss of substantial sums from two lucrative matches , hibs chairman rod petrie has garnered support from hearts and motherwell for a resolution to slash the profits levied from play - off finalists from 50 per cent to 25 per cent
hibs face a battle over potentially lucrative gate revenues with lower league clubs on tuesday , one senior club figure told sportsmail on condition of anonymity , that the hibs , hearts and motherwell proposal was â outrageous â
â hibs declined to comment last night although the easter road club will argue that funding for lower league clubs will be unaffected by slashing the levy because of a new six - figure broadcast deal for the play - offs and the imposition by the spfl of new minimum pricing policy of Â£ 15 and Â£ 10 for all six matches
hibs would have to hand over 50 per cent of play - off gate revenues to lower league clubs under spfl rules hibs are believed to have had reservations over the 50 per cent levy before the redistribution package was passed and have now gathered backing to revisit the issue next thursday from motherwell â also likely to be involved in the play - offs â and city rivals hearts
