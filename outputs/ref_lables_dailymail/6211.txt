a 32 - year - old english teacher admitted in court thursday that she had sex with a 16 - year - old student , in a forgiving plea deal that gets her out of serving any prison time or having to register as a sex offender
former destrehan high school teacher dufresne was arrested in september after the teen in question started bragging to friends at the st charles parish , louisiana school that he had slept with two teachers
an investigation later revealed that the unidentified teen had sex with both his current english teacher at the time , dufresne , and his english teacher from the prior year , 24 - year - old rachel respess - including an alleged a threesome with both at respess 's house
the married mother - of - three pictured above leaving the st charles parish courthouse on thursday double the trouble : dufresne ( right ) and fellow teacher rachel respess , 24 ( left ) , were arrested in september when a student at destrehan high school started bragging that he was sleeping with both of them how they met : the unidentified 16 - year - old victim was a student in dufresne 's english class last year
rachel respess taught the same student english the year prior though she originally pleaded not guilty in november , married mother - of - three dufresne changed course and confessed to the sordid act at a status conference in court on thursday
instead she will undergo a 90 - day inpatient mental health treatment program , surrender her teacher 's license and stay away from the victim and his family dufresne must also undergo a 90 - day inpatient mental health treatment , surrender her teacher 's license , and stay away from the now 17 - year - old victim and his family
if she complies with all of those terms , the carnal knowledge charge will be dropped after three years and she will not have to register as a sex offender
the charges she settled thursday had to do with sex acts she and the 16 - year - old committed at a residence in that town both towns fall under different parishes , and jefferson parish has yet to formally arraign dufresne on charges of carnal knowledge with a juvenile , indecent behavior with a juvenile and contributing to the delinquency of a child
it was at rachel respess ' home in kenner that the teachers allegedly had a three - way with the student after a high school football game in september , and that is the incident they await arraignment on
