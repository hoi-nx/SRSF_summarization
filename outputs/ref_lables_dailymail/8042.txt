west ham manager sam allardyce believes filling your home ground is paramount to premier league clubs - with the west ham announcing their new season - ticket structure ahead of the move to the olympic stadium
the cheapest season ticket at upton park is Â£ 620 but there will be Â£ 289 seats on offer from the 2016 - 17 season - the club 's first in the 54,000 - seater olympic stadium
west ham 's season tickets will cost as little as Â£ 289 when the club move to the olympic stadium next year manager sam allardyce says filling the stadium is the most important thing for any football club west ham 's vice-chairman karren visited the club 's future home in stratford on tuesday and sam allardyce believes performing in front of a sold - out crowd is something that should not go unappreciated as the other 19 premier league clubs are now being pushed to follow west ham 's lead
a view of the olympic stadium on tuesday ahead of west ham 's switch to the 54,000 - capacity arena ' it 's about creating the atmosphere in a stadium that thrills not only the fans there enjoying the atmosphere , but the players who respond to that ' to make sure everywhere you go in the premier league maintains a high level of attendance and selling out your stadium has to be the ultimate goal for any premier league football club , for me
