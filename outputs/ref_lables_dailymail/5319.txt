forget chicken fingers and fries â neil and david 's twins prefer much more foodie - approved fare than the average four - year - old
in a recent interview , david , 39 , explained how being a personal chef and graduate of the famed le cordon bleu cooking school has helped him to influence his children 's culinary tastes
gideon eats everything that is put in front of him , said david , but favors clams , sushi , octopus , grilled pork , steak , parmesan cheese , coconut , and spices like ginger , mint , and cinnamon
daughter harper , meanwhile , prefers ' very strong and briny flavors ' including oysters , sardines , prosciutto , capers , duck liver , miso , and â not so unusually â chocolate
foodie feast : neil commented on this instagram picture that his kids were ' devouring oysters at eataly ' in new york ; the seafood pick is one of daughter harper 's favorite foods impressive tastes : though the twins eat regular ' kid food ' like popcorn , shown here , they also love a lot of dishes that most children their age would n't touch , like ceviche and sardines though david said that he and husband neil , 41 , do n't usually cook as a couple , with david himself taking the reins in the kitchen , neil does serve as ' more of the bartender ' when they have company at their new york home
