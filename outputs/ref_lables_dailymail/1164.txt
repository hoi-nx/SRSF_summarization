what on earth have i got myself into ? the pristine white room adds to the feeling that i 'm about to undergo major surgery
i 'm here to try the wackiest face treatment to hit the beauty scene : the tuning fork facial
offered at the upmarket hale clinic in london and other clinics nationwide , the scary sounding tuning forks are pieces of metal that make different pitched sounds when struck and made to vibrate
tuned in : marianne is given the tuning fork treatment when they are placed on specific parts of the face - the neck , the jowls , forehead and around the eyes - vibrations are said to tighten sagging skin , eradicate dark circles , lessen the appearance of wrinkles and stimulate collagen
the treatment comes from the u.s. - where else ? advocates claim the ' sound waves of the forks vibrate and travel deeply into the body along energy pathways , affecting human physiology and reaching places not easily accessed '
there seems to be no scientific proof that tuning forks can make you look younger , prettier or more rested
it sounds nutty - the kind of thing practised by people who like panpipes and hemp seeds
' what 's wonderful about these facials is they improve the appearance of the skin , but also treat the cause of the problem , ' she says
the forks can boost blood flow , which will give you a healthier colour
' samara has been a facial acupuncturist for 20 years , but she has started using the forks on their own and in conjunction with needles
' i can see my jawline for the first time in a while , and my skin looks plumper and pink , rather than white ' the therapies work on the same principle of chinese acupuncture , which follows the idea that our body 's energy - or ' qi ' - flows through 12 main channels called meridians
if this flow is interrupted , it can cause ill health and affect our appearance , causing premature ageing , dry skin and eye bags
inserting needles or vibrating tuning fork on these trigger points supposedly restores the flow of energy , improving fine lines and circulation , leading to a clearer , rejuvenated complexion
samara uses them together for a more powerful effect , but for the needle - phobic the forks can be used on their own
certain forks are designed for different parts of the face and the body - there are dozens of them , with names such as ' sun ' , ' earth ' and ' new moon '
the physical vibrations have an effect on the body , while the sound from the forks is simultaneously soothing
samara pings one of the forks and puts it up to my ear
she explains she will tap my feet with the forks and apply needles to ' bring the energy down for grounding ' ( whatever that means ) before starting on the face and getting the energy flowing all around my body
samara uses a ' gold ohm unison ' tuning fork
she strikes it against a hard disc strapped on her leg , which creates a vibration , before putting the base of the fork on various points on my feet
it 's a strange , tingly sensation , and builds as she places the fork on more points on my feet
' the vibration from the forks can help the lymph glands to drain , which will help bring down the swelling , ' she says , adding that all she 's doing is ' clearing blockages ' , which will help everything work better
inserting needles or vibrating tuning fork on these trigger points supposedly restores the flow of energy , improving fine lines and circulation , leading to a clearer , rejuvenated complexion marinna finds the physical vibrations have an effect on the body , while the sound from the forks is simultaneously soothing she also explains that she uses tuning forks to help tighten loose muscle around the jawline
as she puts the base of the ' earth ' fork around my jawline , the vibrations go deep into my head
she then puts the forks up to my ears and i hear a clear , deep , bell - like sound that feels as if it 's cleaning my mind
samara , who is wafting around the room ethereally , as new aged therapists are wont to do , explains in her soft , slow voice that different forks have different sounds , varying from deep and resonant to high - pitched
she says the ' new moon ' fork is good for wrinkles and crow 's feet , because it relaxes the skin
but when she starts talking about how the sounds will ' bring me into alignment with the cycles and rhythms of the cosmos ' , it feels a step too far
i can see my jawline for the first time in a while , and my skin looks plumper and pink , rather than white
