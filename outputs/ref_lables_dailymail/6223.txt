an explosive new report reveals that the americans began secretly tracking phones long before the events of 9/11 or passage of the patriot act
in 1992 , a drug enforcement agency operation which has since been discontinued , monitored every telephone call made from the americans to one of the up to 116 countries on their watch list for drug trafficking , including almost every country in both north and south america
the data collection did not however allow drug enforcement agency investigators access to the actual content of calls , just the numbers dialed and time of the calls were all recorded
that decision came from attorney general eric holder in september 2013 , just months after edward snowden began systematically releasing classified information he obtained while working at the national security agency , most notably documents that detailed the agency 's reach , which while viewed by some as crucial and necessary , was seen by many as an orwellian nightmare , specifically as it pertained to the freedoms and allowances the agency had been granted when it came to spying on americans
the drug enforcement agency confirmed this , and they now send subpoenas on a daily basis to telephone companies to obtain records
in that regard the program was a massive success , allowing agency officials to take down larger members of drug organizations thanks to a system that no longer required them to reach out to the phone companies every day , where the could only request individual phone records
the success of this new system impressed president george h.w.bush , who spoke of the idea of ' sophisticated intelligence - gathering and defense department technology ' in a 1989 speech , the first time these concepts had been mentioned by a president
it was around this time that the drug enforcement agency program was approved , with president george h.w.bush , along with attorney general william barr and chief criminal prosecutor , robert mueller , giving the agency these new data collection privileges in the final months of his first term
the drug enforcement agency , who just years earlier were reaching out to phone companies in search of individual records , would now receive phone company records on a daily basis thanks to a request from the justice department
what 's more , whereas before the focus was on getting records only of those who were known drug suspects due to time constraints , the agency now received a list of every single phone call from an americans phone line to a country on the drug watch list
' the aforementioned letter to sprint in 1998 was an example of these notes sent to the phone companies , and given the fact that six years later there was still unease about turning over these records it would seem this was a constant battle throughout the years the program was active
with the program now shuttered , there are some concerns about the list of countries on the drug enforcement agency list being revealed , though officials said that in many cases they were aware of the program , which would likely be just as beneficial to them as to the americans
