as manager of rangers , mccall has learned to tolerate supporters booing their own players
' i remember standing at the back of leeds kop , maybe i was 15 or 16 year old and terry yorath and ray hankin were getting booed
terry yorath had just taken over from billy bremner and it was boooooo â¦ rangers manager mccall has had to get used to his players being booed by supporters mcculloch , the rangers captain , was booed for an error that led to a goal against raith rovers mccall hopes that for the time that he is manager of rangers , mcculloch will be the last player to get booed ' they had a song for ray hankin and it went : ' ray hankin , ray hankin ' and half of them would then shout : 's * * t ' and this is while he was warming up for the game
' that 's when i got into fights , with the people shouting s * * t. ' tell me , how 's that going to help any individual when that 's the reaction to their name just being read out ? ' those sour memories returned last weekend when rangers skipper mcculloch was the object of frustration from the ibrox stands
culpable for a raith rovers goal , the veteran defender suffered the embarrassment of being booed by his own supporters
so long as mccall remains manager of rangers â an unknown currently â he hopes mcculloch will be the last
' i 've no problem with a team being booed off at half time or full time , that 's fine
' the good thing was that within minutes of it happening most of the supporters actually turned it round and he was getting backing again
' it spun itself round and then the majority of the supporters were clapping
' in the west of scottish , grown men rarely express their feelings
mcculloch has made no reference to the incident to mccall and vice versa
' should mcculloch play against hearts at tynecastle on saturday â and the indications are he will â the defiant , thrawn streak in away supporters will no doubt prompt a different response
' mcculloch has a leadership mentally and he has been about
' he 's had highs and lows and he 's been there and seen it and represented rangers terrifically well in his career
' hopefully that 's it and , although it happened , the overriding feeling for me was that other supporters turned it on its head and that made it better
' the need for rangers to find some unity at tynecastle is obvious enough
they must beat champions hearts and hope hibs â yet to beat falkirk this season â show the mental fragility many now regard as their trademark
if rangers do attain second place , it means two less play - off games
mcculloch is in line to play for rangers against league leaders hearts at the weekend mccall questioned whether fans booing their own players has any positive impact upon the team ' if we manage to win at hearts and hibs do n't win , there will be no great celebrations from our point of view because we wo n't have achieved anything
' we 're aiming to win on saturday , we think we can win , but i just really want a good , strong performance to go into the play - offs
