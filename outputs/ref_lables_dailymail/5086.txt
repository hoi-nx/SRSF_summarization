nine uk muslims caught trying to cross into syria are no longer welcome in england and should find a new country to live , labour 's danczuk has said
the outspoken rochdale candidate said it was ' unacceptable ' that people who were prepared to join isis should be free to come home
it comes after nine members of the same family were arrested in turkey â including the 21 - year - old son of a labour councillor in rochdale
but mr danczuk today lashed out at suggestions that the family could be allowed to return to uk without facing any terror charges
speaking to mailonline mr danczuk said : ' i think i speak for the vast majority of people in rochdale in saying that this family will not be welcome back in rochdale
mr danczuk said they were not welcome back in rochdale ' the police have to recognize this , because the idea that someone who was prepared to join a terrorist outfit like isis could be allowed to return to civilian life in rochdale and carry on as though nothing has happened is unacceptable
rochdale labour councillor shakil ahmed , pictured on his facebook page with labour leader ed miliband just weeks before his son tried to cross into isis controlled syria waheed smiled in a car as he left a hospital after undergoing medical checks and fingerprinting in hatay southern of turkey last week he is suspected of acting as an islamic state smuggler , paying for four men and a woman to join the terrorist group
mr danczuk said the number of uk fleeing the country to join isis â now thought to number more than 600 â exposed the failure of the government 's anti-terror strategy
' rochdale mp danczuk said the uk family caught trying to cross into would be forced to train up as isis fighters the outspoken candidate added : ' the message coming back to me loud and clear is that while the vast majority reject this ideology of hatred , exclusion and intolerance , there are some people who are susceptible to radicalization
