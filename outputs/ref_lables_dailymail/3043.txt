one of them belongs to their old nemesis samuels who , along with the obdurate brathwaite , saw west indies into credit and within sight of another draw with only the final test in barbadian next week to play
samuels had the chance to renew his feud with ben stokes but the pair buried the hatchet on a day the west indies dominated root leaves the field after being left stranded on 182 not out after a stunning display of batting on the fourth morning in grenada the 24 - year - old looks dismayed following anderson 's careless mistake in between the wickets cost him a shot at a double century england 's rising star had been in imperious form as he built yet another ' daddy ' hundred while wickets fell around him before his error , anderson had played his part as a no 11 with intelligence , supporting root sensibly and keeping off strike root plays the ball away for another boundary as west indian captain denesh ramdin on his way to yet another big score 110 root has a test average of 110.1 in the last year
alastair cook brought ben stokes back when samuels arrived at the fall of west indies â second wicket , but his four - over burst failed to earn a breakthrough
west indies ended this fourth day on 202 for two , a lead of 37 , with brathwaite unbeaten on 101 , and the only winner on day five looks likely to be the lifeless pitch unless england make big inroads with the second new ball
england were all out when anderson strolled back to his wicket which led to his run out following a fine catch by holder west indies star holder leaps in the air before hitting the stumps to end root 's chance of scoring 200 runs holder takes the bails off while anderson makes his way to the crease without sliding his bat on the floor earlier , anderson had left root stranded with one of the doziest pieces of cricket imaginable as england threw away their chance of reaching 500
it may seem harsh to criticise a tail - ender who had hung around valiantly in a last - wicket stand of 34 as root moved majestically to his latest â daddy â hundred
root had reached 182 and been imperious as one team - mate after another got themselves out softly before the third and most frustrating run - out
it gave england a crucial early breakthrough as west indies , 165 behind on first innings , began their attempt to bat for four of the five remaining sessions that would effectively save this 2,000 test
brathwaite is a batsman who needs little invitation to dig in and the solid barbadian was in his element as he frustrated england in a stand of 142 with bravo that wiped off the bulk of west indies â deficit
when another wicket came it was a surprise , bravo getting a thin edge to a delivery from stuart broad when he had made 69
root and anderson made up as they returned to the pavilion for lunch during west indies ' second innings chris jordan was one of three english batsmen run out in their second innings , despite a despairing dive to make his ground anderson began to make amends almost immediately when he bowled devon smith , off yet another inside edge on the slow wicket stuart broad 's woes with the bat continued , as he found a new way to get out , edging a sweep into the air without scoring it looked like being a frustrating day all round for stuart broad , as the west indies set about nullifying england 's lead on a dead pitch stuart broad eventually found england 's second breakthrough of the day , removing bravo who edged a good delivery behind moeen ali looked rusty on his return from injury , and root 's bowling was often preferred to the nominally first - choice spinner bravo cuts the ball through the field as the west indian batsmen closed the gap on england quickly during the afternoon and evening bravo and brathwaite were relatively untroubled for a long period of the day , as they put on 142 for the second wicket jos buttler got over-excited and was stumped , before chris jordan also ran himself out after showing a few glimpses of the batting quality which will surely one day earn him a test century of his own
there was a time when stuart broad , who hit a brilliant hundred against pakistan at lord âs in 2010 , looked like a genuine all - rounder but now there is even an argument that anderson should bat above him
england 's two fast bowlers , stuart broad and anderson , discuss tactics with skipper alastair cook as they look to take wickets brathwaite cuts away for more runs as the young opener made england 's attack toil in the west indian heat brathwaite acknowledges the crowd after reaching his half - century , and the west indies batsman would go on to make three figures anderson wipes the sweat from his forehead on another difficult day for england 's bowlers on a tour featuring flat pitches ben stokes looks back as the ball passes him on its way to the boundary , as the west indies retook the lead on day four chris jordan appeals vociferously , but unsuccesfuly , as england found wickets hard to come by on day four
