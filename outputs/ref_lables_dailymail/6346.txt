seaworld has been accused of drugging killer whales , painting over their injuries and keeping them in pools so shallow they get sunburned
a lawsuit filed by kuhl , a grandmother from south carolina who visited the orlando park in 2013 , claims orcas are being kept in 8ft deep holding pools , leaving the marine animals ' essentially roasting '
in her suit she also alleges that the giant marine mammals are being deprived of food for days while being trained to perform at seaworld , and that the chlorine used in their tanks is ' many times stronger than household bleach '
this is the second lawsuit against seaworld in less than one month , with similar filed in california which accuse the company of ' misleading the public ' by claiming that their killer whales are happy
the lawsuit also alleges that the giant marine mammals are being deprived of food for days while being trained to perform at seaworld this follows a failed social media campaign last month , during which seaworld organised a q&a on twitter using the hashtag # askseaworld
many people used the opportunity to express their anger at the company and questioned its ethics for keeping killer whales and other animals in captivity , often in solitary confinement
the backlash comes two years after the release of the documentary blackfish , which questioned the conditions orcas were kept in following killer whale tilikum 's fatal attack on trainer dawn brancheau at orlando in 2010
seaworld 's stock value has also plummeted
