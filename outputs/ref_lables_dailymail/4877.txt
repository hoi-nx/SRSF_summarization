the physicians accused oz of pushing ' miracle ' weight - loss supplements with no scientific proof that they work
the doctors wrote that oz , for years a world - class university cardiothoracic surgeon , has ' misled and endangered ' the public
' thus , dr oz is guilty of either outrageous conflicts of interest or flawed judgments about what constitutes appropriate medical treatments , or both
