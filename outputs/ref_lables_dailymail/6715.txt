more than a dozen areas in the us have been shaken by small earthquakes triggered by oil and gas drilling , according to a government report released today
the man - made quakes jolted once stable regions in eight states , including parts of alabama , arkansas , colorado , kansas , new mexico , ohio , oklahoma and texas
researchers say there have been ' substantial increases since 2009 that continue today ' they said the spike in seismic activity was largely down to the oil and gas industry injecting wastewater deep underground , which can activate dormant faults
many studies have linked the rise in small quakes to the injection of wastewater into disposal wells , but the geological survey 's report takes the first comprehensive look at where the man - made quakes are occurring
oklahoma lately has been rocked by more magnitude - 3 quakes than california , the most seismically active of the lower 48 states , petersen said
oklahoma was not on scientists ' radar until recently when the state experienced a spate of quakes , the largest registering a magnitude - 5.6 in 2011
recently , man - made quakes jolted once stable regions in eight states , including parts of alabama , arkansas , colorado , kansas , new mexico , ohio , oklahoma and texas the cumulative number of earthquakes with a magnitude of 3.0 or larger in the central and eastern us , 1973 - 2014
many faults awakened by drilling have not moved in millions of years , geological survey geophysicist ellsworth said

scientists said it 's difficult to know what jobs will trigger shaking a group of experts met last year in oklahoma to pinpoint seismic hotspots around the country caused by induced quakes
scientists initially identified 14 regions affected by quakes linked to drilling
they later added three other high - risk areas - northern oklahoma - southern kansas ; greeley , colorado ; and azle , texas
researchers study man - made quakes in the affected areas to determine how often they are expected to occur in the next year and how much shaking they would produce
