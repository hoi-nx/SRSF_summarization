an upcoming documentary describes yelp as the internet 's equivalent to the mafia , and the publicly - traded company is doing everything in its power to discredit the film before it is released
however , like many web businesses , yelp 's revenue comes mainly from advertising and the businesses that buy ads are often also rated and reviewed on the site
kaylie milliken is the filmmaker behind billion dollar bully , an ongoing documentary focused on yelp 's impact on small businesses
while she has n't finished the documentary yet , kaylie milliken tells daily mail online her research so far has indicated yelp 's advertising structure appears to punish businesses that choose not to advertise on the site - a claim that company has vigorously denied
above , yelp ceo jeremy stoppelman in august 2014 pay to play : billion dollar bully is still in production , but filmmaker kaylie milliken says she 's already interviewed several small businesses who believe they 've been targeted by the company for refusing to advertise ' businesses feel extorted , ' kaylie milliken told daily mail online
' and at hundreds of dollars a month for advertising , the price to work with yelp is too big for many mom and pop businesses , kaylie milliken says
kaylie milliken first started investigating the company a year ago , when she went to see her doctor , who started talking about her negative experiences being listed on yelp
and then she received a review where the client listed ailments about themsel [ f ] that she had never seen before , and this was the day after she had gotten off the phone with someone from yelp , ' kaylie milliken told international business times
yelp spokeswoman eis ( left ) also appeared on the show to defend the company last month , kaylie milliken released a trailer for her documentary in an attempt to fund the rest of the film 's production
yelp 's company spokesman eis went on cnbc to speak out against the documentary in a segment with kaylie milliken , to further illustrate how the company 's business practices have been backed by both the courts and independent investigations
however , the harvard study that the eis cited in yelp 's defense was n't solely focused on whether advertising impacts the ratings of businesses listed on the site - rather the investigation was designed to find out how many of the reviews on the site were fake
while the study 's authors did find that businesses that advertise on the site are no more likely to have extreme 1 or 5 - star ratings than any other business , they made it clear that yelp 's advertising practices were not the topic of their study and therefore their research was not exhaustive
standing up : kaylie milliken says that most of the business owners she spoke to were too afraid to appear on camera , for fear of retaliation fro yelp
she plans to resume filming in may and have a rough cut by fall kaylie milliken says she does n't place much faith in these cases or investigations , after interviewing several small business owners in the course of her research
kaylie milliken says that these business owners were so afraid of yelp that about 80 per cent of them refused to go on camera for fear of retaliation on their own yelp pages - which they are not allowed to opt out of
in their cnbc talk , eis also accused kaylie milliken of having a conflict of interest , since she had created several yelp accounts to write fake reviews of businesses - including her husband 's law practice
' i think it 's shocking and very telling that this billion dollar corporation has come after this grassroots production company - where there are only two of us - creating a documentary that were still in production over ... and yelp has fired back with all that ... i think it does clearly show that they are concerned about what will be coming out in the documentary , ' kaylie milliken said on cnbc
daily mail online reached out to yelp for evidence of the allegedly fake reviews kaylie milliken wrote , and the company sent screen grabs that show several accounts tied to the filmmaker and the fact that she commented on her husband 's business page
