harkin , 54 , gave Â£ 30,000 to a builder using the school chequebook claiming the work was to be carried out at llwyncelyn primary school in porth , when the work was actually carried out at her home a headteacher who secretly tried to use a school chequebook to pay for thousands of pounds worth of work to be carried out at her family home has been jailed
married mother - of - two harkin , 54 , abused her position of authority by signing cheques totalling Â£ 30,000 to her builder claiming the work was to be carried out at llwyncelyn primary school in porth , wales
harkin claimed the money was to be used to build a rain shelter for waiting parents at llwyncelyn but the proposed work , which never materialised , was never ratified by governors
instead , work was carried out at her home in pontypridd , which she shares with her bank manager husband anthony and their two children
knight , prosecuting , said harkin skipped procedures and instead issued cheques , even forging the deputy head 's name in order to cash one in person
' ms knight told the court that cowboy builder lee slocombe had carried out Â£ 80,000 worth of work at harkin 's home in pontypridd over an 18 - month period from november 2012
labelled a fraudster and a conman who swindled thousands from victims , lee slocombe was jailed for 43 months earlier this year for fraud
she signed another one in september of the same year for Â£ 5,000 , which was cashed at cash converters , in aberdare , by one of lee slocombe 's employees
since there was no second signatory on that one either , staff phoned the school and spoke to harkin
' in total , harkin ( left ) signed six cheques to cowboy builder lee slocombe ( right ) totalling Â£ 30,000
local authority auditors spoke to harkin in the autumn and she claimed the cheque was a holding cheque for work to be done in october half - term
in november 2013 , harkin moved to coedpenmaen primary school in pontypridd and in december wrote a cheque for Â£ 5,000 for a shelter at llwyncelyn
the bank refused to honour it but lee slocombe took it to abermarle bond pawnbrokers in cardiff , which cashed Â£ 2,500 on the basis he would return to get the rest
harkin issued another Â£ 5,000 cheque later that month , which lee slocombe partially cashed
the last cheque , for Â£ 3,200 , harkin actually took into a porth bank herself to cash after forging the signature of the deputy head , susan jones
' lee slocombe carried out Â£ 80,000 worth of work at harkin 's home in pontypridd ( pictured ) , which she shares with her bank manager husband anthony and their two children , over an 18 - month period from november 2012 lee slocombe was jailed earlier this year for 43 months for fraud for swindling money from dozens of victims
pictured : rubble and building materials remain outside harkin 's family property in pontypridd , wales harkin was called into a special meeting on january 21 last year and challenged about the irregularities
that led to a criminal investigation and harkin admitted five counts of fraud and one each of theft and forgery
' she came under lee slocombe 's spell
' merthyr tydfil crown court heard that not only did harkin use the chequebook of llwyncelyn primary school ( pictured ) when she was headteacher there , but she also continued to use it when she moved schools ms lewis asked for any sentence to be suspended but judge richard twomlow refused her plea and jailed harkin for 12 months
' lee slocombe may be a fraudster and a plausible man but he was doing work at your house
' this was a repeated and persistent breach of a high degree of trust
' i am a bank manager and have proved to police that each pound and penny was met by us
