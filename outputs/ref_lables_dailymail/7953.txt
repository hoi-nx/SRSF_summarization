manchester united used to do this to manchester city all the time
but not since 2009 - 10 when manchester united beat manchester city twice in the premier league and edged a league cup semi-final have they brutalised them like this
old trafford roars with fellaini after the influential belgian gave the red devils an advantage they never looked like relinquishing fellaini leaps to meet man - of - the - match ashley young 's superb cross with a thumping header to send old trafford into a state of euphoria manchester city 's defence was caught flatfooted and hart could only watch as fellaini 's header flew into the net on a great day for the hosts mata was released by rooney and the spaniard ran through to shoot between hart 's legs to extend the host 's advantage mata once again showed his value to the side and pointed the way with a display full of energy , poise and intelligence smalling showed his hunger to beat a lethargic manchester city defence to ashley young 's free - kick to add a fourth to give the score more gloss all of manchester united 's outfield players congratulate smalling after his close - range header ensured the red side of manchester has bragging rights young latches on to a loose ball which bounced off gael clichy and fires past the despairing dive of hart to level matters rooney cannons the ball into the net in celebration to release a shower of water as mata and ashley young charge to the sidelines aguero finishes off a surgical move for the opener , tapping silva 's cross into the empty net to give the visitors hope the manchester united defence looked at sixes and sevens as david de gea fumes after conceding an early goal to their manchester city rivals aguero made it a double late of , latching on to zabaleta 's cross , but manchester city leave old trafford with very little to cheer about time will tell what the ramifications will be
manchester city actually bookended this game with two very good goals , aguero scoring in the eighth and 88th minutes
what happened in between , however , served to confirm recent indications that manchester united have finally found their true selves while manchester city have fallen off the edge of the proverbial cliff
fellaini , ashley young , daley blind and mata were all excellent and key to events

this time , a move began by gael clichy and soon joined by a silva dash to the by - line was finished off by aguero
a goal ahead and with three clear chances already to reflect on , manchester city seemed to have given themselves a platform while manchester united looked hesitant
but when fellaini won a challenge with zabaleta opportunity suddenly beckoned

this time , manchester city had to ask themselves questions and over the remainder of the game it became a theme
the threat in the air from fellaini was obvious but somehow he managed to isolate gael clichy at the far post as ashley young crossed above the head of the taller demichelis , who was essentially marking nobody
from that point on until aguero âs late consolation , manchester city hardly made a chance
aguero finished off an incisive manchester city move which cut through manchester united 's defence in an impressive opening spell manchester united went back to basics for the leveller , with ashley young pouncing after herrera 's cross hit gael clichy manchester united exploited manchester city 's right wing for their second too , with ashley young and daley blind combining to great effect intelligent play from rooney set up the third , with mata darting through and coolly slotting home smalling rose unmarked to head ashley young 's free - kick beyond hart to make it 4 - 1 for rampant manchester united aguero gave a semblance of respectability to the scoreline by meeting zabaleta 's cross late on as half - time neared , their captain vincent kompany could have been sent off for a lunge at blind
as it was , he strained a muscle making the challenge and did nât reappear for a second period that began with hart saving rooney âs free - kick and then michael carrick âs follow - up
from here on in , only the winning margin was in doubt and when smalling ran off demichelis âs shoulder to head in the fourth from a ashley young free - kick anything seemed possible
as it turned out the final act belonged to aguero â zabaleta the provider this time â and the winning margin settled at a rather modest two
