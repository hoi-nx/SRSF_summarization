when lane passed away in a freak accident last july , he left behind his heavily - pregnant girlfriend and their unborn son
but now , nearly eight months after his passing , the young oklahoma family has been reunited in their first ever family portrait , thanks to some clever photoshopping by a local photographer
kayli henley was snapping pictures of six - month - old taos and his 20 - year - old mother , sharry , when the young mom asked the photographer if she could make their family complete
so henley took a photograph of lane from the family and , with a ghostly filter , fitted the image around his girlfriend and son , as if he were standing over them
lane passed away before his son 's birth sharry called the ghostly final picture ' amazing '
it has been liked more than 200,000 times and shared more than 25,000 times , and henley has been inundated with requests to create other pictures for families who have lost a loved one
in a post shared on the facebook page , sharry explained that in july 2014 , she and 26 - year - old lane had been nervous about the impending birth of their son
excitement : 26 - year - old lane , pictured with his girlfriend in the couple 's pregnancy announcement , died after hitting his head in an accident in july 2014
' strong : sharry said that part of her has been missing since the death of taos ' father but that the photograph allowed her to see her complete family for the first time
she is pictured in another image from the shoot missed : she said she knows that lane , pictured left , will always be watching over her and their son , right their son was born just a few weeks later and when he approached six months , sharry asked henley , who is baked in yukon , if she 'd be able to put together a family photo
' i just got to thinking , we do n't have a picture with lane in it , ' sharry explained to koco
so rene created the photo that has since been shared thousands of times online
taos and i living our lives the best we can with lane always watching over our shoulder
