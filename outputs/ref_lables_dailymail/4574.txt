former leeds captain cherry has branded the six leeds players who withdrew at short notice from saturday 's match against charlton a ' disgrace ' and called for them to be sacked by the club
italian quartet antenucci , giuseppe bellusci , dario del fabro and silvestri , frenchman souleymane doukara and albanian edgar cani all told beleaguered head coach neil redfearn they were injured and could not travel to london
neil redfearn , speaking after his side lost 2 - 1 at the valley , described it as a ' freakish ' set of events
neil redfearn had a depleted squad to pick from when six leeds players pulled out at late notice antenucci was among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by charlton but cherry was unimpressed and wants the players out of elland road
' i do n't think players can do that , it 's scandalous and it 's just another story for leeds that is disgraceful
however , cherry questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw
neil redfearn 's position at elland road has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks , despite leading the club to championship safety after taking over from ill - fated predecessors david hockaday and darko milanic
the withdrawals , including souleymane doukara 's , are the latest incident in another turbulent period at leeds club president massimo cellino has been banned since january after being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in italian , but is due to return in a fortnight 's time
cherry , who played for leeds between 1972 and 1982 , was left to lament the situation at his old club
you could n't write a book about leeds and what 's happened
