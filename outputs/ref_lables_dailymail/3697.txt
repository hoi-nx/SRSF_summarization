a former commander of the metropolitan police 's elite flying squad has said the hatton garden gem heist could be linked to the huge underground fire which ripped through london last week
the massive fire started last wednesday and took more than 24 hours to put out
john o'connor , a highly experienced former police detective , has claimed the major power outage and the proximity of the multi-million burglary was far more than a coincidence
' i 've never heard of an outage of electricity like that causing a fire that lasted as long as that
' he later told sky news : ' you 've got a major strong room , there 's no sign of a forced entry , they 've apparently been able to abseil down the lift shaft to get access to the vault - i just find it astonishing that it was that easy
' the fact that there is no sign of forced entry , what does that mean ? that someone left the door open ? that someone left the windows open ? former head of scotland yard 's flying squad , john o'connor , pictured , said the holborn fire and the raid could be linked ' it smacks all the time of inside aid , all of the way through it
fire experts said their initial assessment showed that the fire was caused by an electrical fault in the victorian tunnels running below ground , damaging an eight inch gas main which ruptured and fuelled the flames
fresh details of the daring heist emerged yesterday as police forensic teams continued to sift through the rubble in the vault
it is believed an alarm was triggered when the professional gang broke into the building in the heart of london âs jewellery district
police have refused to say whether officers were despatched to investigate around the same time
the gang used a heavy - duty drill weighing 77lb to bore through a reinforced 7ft concrete wall to reach the vault
when the raid was discovered on tuesday , police discovered cheaper jewels left strewn amid a large heap of rubble in the vault
detective chief inspector johnson of the flying squad said : â i âd say it âs a sophisticated offence and clearly it would have taken some pre-planning
â the fire started underground just several hundred yards from where the heist took place a few days later the gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault it has also emerged that celebrities and premier league footballers could be among the victims of the thieves
a source told the daily mail : â at least two of the jewellers have gems in the vault which have been bought by footballers and celebrities
once in the basement the thieves forced open the lift doors to get close to the vault
