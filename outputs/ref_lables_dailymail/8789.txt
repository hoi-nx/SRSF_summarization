nearly 100 primary pupils from lostwithiel school in cornwall were due to travel 68 miles to visit the mosque in exeter , devon , as part of an re trip to learn about different faiths
however , about 10 pupils have now pulled out of next week 's school trip after their parents said they would be exposed to ' violence and guns ' and expressed ' grave concerns ' about the teaching of islam
christine trevethen , 47 , a housewife from lostwithiel , cornwall , has stopped her 10 - year - old daughter keira going on the visit
' sally cox , 39 , a self - employed cleaner from lerryn , cornwall , has also blocked her son jed pearce , 10 , from going on the visit
there was a british muslim bomber in exeter just a few years ago
' they decided to take him out of re , but i said i am fine with that
' nearly 100 primary pupils from lostwithiel school in cornwall were due to travel 68 miles to visit the mosque in exeter , devon ( pictured ) as part of an re trip but 10 pulled out after parents expressed ' grave concerns ' another parent , who did not want to be named , said : ' we have grave concerns about the children 's safety during the trip due to the horrific events that occur every day
' the parent said she was furious after the pupils who pulled out of the trip were singled out in a school assembly
' however , not all parents are opposed to the trip , with some backing the school and suggesting the visit is a positive move
' carolyn huxley , headteacher of lostwithiel school ( pictured ) , which has just 156 pupils on its books , said the trip would still take place on may 7 to ' show children the views of extremists are not a true reflection of islam ' kat smith , the chairman of governors for the school , said a group of parents had expressed concerns about the trip due to recent terror attacks by groups such as isis
she said : ' this is the first time pupils from the school have visited a mosque and it 's an exciting opportunity for them to learn about different faiths and ensure that they 're aware of the diverse nature of modern britain
' because of recent news reports about extremist groups , such as isis , that identify themselves with islam , a small number of parents have expressed concerns about the trip and the teaching of islam in school
' in response , the school held a special assembly with children to discuss these issues , and the head teacher has met and sent letters to parents with specific concerns
she said : ' re forms part of the basic curriculum in schools and its teaching is enshrined in law
kat smith , the chairman of governors for the lostwithiel school , said parents expressed concerns about the teaching of islam at the school ' the school recognises that parents have the right to withdraw their child from re in whole or in part , and provide alternative work to further their child 's knowledge and understanding of the parents ' beliefs and values
' however , the school is aware that children growing up in cornwall may have little contact with muslims and it is aware that it has a duty under the equality act 2010 to promote good relations between people of different beliefs and ethnicities as part of its single equality duty
' the governing body fully supports this trip and the teaching of re , including islam
' it is the governors ' hope that the visit to the mosque will provide an insight for pupils into the nature of islam , help them understand how islam is presented in the media and that groups like isis are not a true reflection of the islam followed by the vast majority of muslims in britain
' carolyn huxley , headteacher of the primary school which has just 156 pupils on its books and teaches those aged four to 11 , said the trip would still be taking place on may 7
the mosque also welcomes groups as part of education programmes and regularly hosts school trips
lostwithiel school , which has around six teachers , said the trip was planned to enable children to learn further about different religions
the school said it follows the cornwall agreed syllabus for re and part of the curriculum encourages children to study christianity in great detail , as well as finding out about hinduism , sikhism , judaism and islam through school trips , visits from outside speakers and class teaching
it is therefore disappointing to hear that some parents have chosen to pull their children out of a visit to a mosque due to events elsewhere in the world
