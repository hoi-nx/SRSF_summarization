bird numbers have dramatically declined in fukushima , research has revealed
researchers have found that bird species are continuing to drop in fukushima ( shown after the disaster in 2011 )
the barn swallow , for example , dropped from hundreds to dozens
this is despite radiation levels in the region starting to fall
and comparing it to chernobyl could reveal what the future holds the research , published in the journal of ornithology , was carried out by scientists at the university of south carolina including biologist dr tim mousseau
reports claim the soil and water in the region still contains high levels of radiation which makes the clean - up effort difficult
one of the most hard - hit species is the barn swallow , hirundo rustica , which suffered large population losses due to radiation exposure
â so both the biodiversity and the abundance are showing dramatic impacts in these areas with higher radiation levels , even as the levels are declining
â dr tim mousseau and his team made the findings using thermoluminescent detectors , which use gamma - radiation - sensitive crystals ( shown ) to measure radiation doses in individual subjects living in the wild one hard - hit species was the barn swallow ( stock image shown ) , hirundo rustica , which suffered large population losses due to radiation exposure the team are hoping to get information on what the future holds for fukushima from the chernobyl site , which was the scene of a devastating release of radioactive materials in ukraine in 1986
one difference noticed so far is that migratory birds fared worse in chernobyl , whereas it was year - round residents that were doing worse at fukushima
shown are radiation levels immediately after the accident in 2011
