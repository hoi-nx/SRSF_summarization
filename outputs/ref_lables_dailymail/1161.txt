paranormal investigator jayne harris , based in shrewsbury , shropshire , said she has received an influx of messages from people describing chest pains , nausea and crippling headaches after viewing photos and videos of peggy , who she believed to be possessed with an evil spirit

' paranormal investigator jayne harris ( left ) said she received an influx of messages from people describing chest pains , nausea and crippling headaches after viewing photos and videos of peggy ( right ) mrs jayne harris continued : ' another lady yesterday said she had been experiencing light bulbs blowing and a presence in her home after she had been speaking about peggy
' with peggy , it 's not only while people are looking at her or watching her , it seems to be afterwards too
' mrs jayne harris , who has herself experienced migraines and feeling drained after working with peggy , said she has never seen a case of this intensity before
mrs jayne harris , pictured conducting a ritual with the doll , has experienced migraines and feeling drained after working with peggy , and said she has never seen a case of this intensity before peggy was sent to her recently after her previous owner reported a series of terrifying nightmares
' there is still a shroud of mystery surrounding peggy âs religion , according to mrs jayne harris , but she appears to have an aversion to a crucifix necklace she was previously made to wear the team , along with members of haunted dolls â social media groups , have been trying to put together a clearer picture of the spectre inhabiting peggy
it is thought she is possessed by the spirit of a woman born in 1946 in london âs holland park who died of a chest - related condition - possibly an asthma attack â and strongly dislikes clowns
four different psychic mediums have â read â peggy , all invariably picking up that she is restless , frustrated and was persecuted in life
' there is still a shroud of mystery surrounding peggy âs religion , according to mrs jayne harris
' a lot of people , including two mediums , have said they feel she has links to the holocaust and was possibly jewish , ' said mrs jayne harris
' after a recent session with peggy during which mrs jayne harris made notes , she left the room and returned to find that peggy had moved the notebook high up to the joists of her ceiling ( pictured ) it was during the automatic writing session â a ritual whereby a psychic will communicate with a spirit , producing any messages they have without consciously writing â that an cryptic instruction was passed on to a member of the haunted dolls community
the woman in question , a developing medium known as lindy , had experienced paranormal activity related to peggy before when her facebook page kept posting comments about the doll over and over again
' when i commented my thoughts and feelings [ about peggy ] all my comments were duplicated â no one else âs , just mine , ' she said
' i ended up apologising to peggy as i felt maybe she disproved of us chatting about her and my symptoms stopped
' mrs jayne harris uses a k-ii meter ( pictured ) during her paranormal investigations , which pick up ghostly ' activity ' three days later , another peggy video inspired lindy to have an overdue conversation with her daughter about how they were to deal with her mental health issues
i felt that peggy had helped me
' lindy did not know that the automatic writing session with peggy was taking place , but when she logged onto facebook and saw images of the messages received during the session , one seemed to be for her
mrs jayne harris consulted a physic who ' communicated ' with peggy by writing down the cryptic messages she was conveying ( right ) though they have had offers from other psychics to rid peggy of her spirit , mrs jayne harris and the haunted dolls team are going to research her case
' i âve been asked to take her along to various paranormal events and investigations at haunted locations but , for now , i want to continue my private studies into her case , ' she said
if it were one or two occasions that things were happening on , i could do that , but with peggy i just know there âs something more
