lawsuit : a student expelled from george mason university for violating its sexual misconduct policy is suing in federal court to clear his name , arguing that an encounter with a girlfriend was sadomasochistic role playing , not sexual assault ( file ) the lawsuit comes as colleges across the country , and particularly in virginia , are under increased scrutiny for how they respond to allegations of sexual assault
the university of virginia implemented changes in its sexual misconduct policy in the aftermath of a now - discredited rolling stone article alleging that school officials were indifferent to allegations that a student had been raped at a fraternity party
the sexual misconduct allegations at george mason stem from an october 2013 encounter with the couple in the male student 's dorm room on the fairfax campus
at one point , according to the lawsuit , she pushed him away but did n't invoke her safe word
later that night , the two engaged in a second sex act , in which the male student asked her if she was interested , and she replied , ' i do n't know
process : the lawsuit claims the woman only filed a complaint after the couple broke up and she had found out the man was cheating on her ( file ) the lawsuit says that the appeal was handled improperly
if roe ( the pseudonym for the unidentified female student ) were not a female complaining of sexual assault , her testimony would not have been credited over doe 's given the evidence corroborating doe 's explanation of their bdsm relationship and the material concessions roe made at the hearing , ' the student 's lawyers wrote in their complaint
the university 's lawyer writes that the male student should have no fear of embarrassment if the allegations are true , because the public is increasingly accepting of unusual sexual relationships
