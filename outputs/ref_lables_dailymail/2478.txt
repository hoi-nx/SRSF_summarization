so it seems you are either with me or firmly against me : there does nât appear to be a middle ground after my comments about tim krul
it is a week since i criticised newcastle âs goalkeeper for appearing to congratulate jermain defoe at half - time during the wear-tyne after the black cats striker beat him with a brilliant volley
i âm still struggling to work out why tim krul did what he did
i have nothing against tim krul , personally or professionally
he âs been one of the few players who have performed consistently for newcastle in recent seasons , which led to him being part of holland âs world cup squad last summer
newcastle keeper tim krul congratulated black cats striker jermain defoe on his goal at half - time tim krul smiles at jermain defoe shortly after the striker 's goal gave the black cats the lead in the wear-tyne derby sportsmail 's carragher criticised tim krul for his half - time actions while speaking on sky but coming together with an opponent and smiling after he âs scored against you in a match of such importance ? no , i âm sorry
i ca nât understand why any player would feel the need to do that
he clearly felt i had been harsh on tim krul and he told me cricketers applaud the opposition batsman when he passes 50 or 100 , quite often with a handshake
you do nât congratulate the opposition at a time when your team have been put on the back foot
growing up as an everton , i would work myself into a frenzy in the week before a derby match

put it this way â i could nât have shared a joke with tim cahill if he âd scored 30 seconds before half - time like jermain defoe
i âm not saying my way is right or wrong but to be at my best i needed to be tense and wound up

before that , you have business to take care of and that should be the priority â that âs why i felt so strongly about tim krul
even when newcastle won the title in 2013 , there was a feeling that it was down to unrest behind the scenes with roberto mancini rather than the brilliance of sir alex ferguson âs squad

newcastle , having won their last five premier league fixtures , are firm favourites and will feel confident of finally ending their neighbours â title aspirations
there is no doubt newcastle will spend big again in the summer and , with the full implications of financial fair play kicking in , they might be able to recruit the players that city need
newcastle will certainly fancy their chances but they should not take anything for granted
if city want to send a message to newcastle â and for next season â aguero , silva , kompany and toure will have to show what we know they are capable of
van gaal is starting to put his stamp on newcastle â they have improved since the switch to 4 - 3 - 3 â and has big ambitions
city have relished having newcastle in their shade
