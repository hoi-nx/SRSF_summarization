a new york woman who appealed to her facebook friends last week asking to pray for the safe return of her fiance who went missing 11 days ago after his kayak capsized has now been charged with his murder
the orange county district attorney 's office said thursday that 35 - year - old angelika graswald , of poughkeepsie , is charged with second - degree murder in the death of 46 - year - old viafore
troopers have said viafore , also of poughkeepsie , was kayaking with angelika graswald on the hudson river april 19 when his vessel flipped over near the town of cornwall-on-hudson
police have yet to find viafore 's body
according to a criminal complaint unveiled thursday afternoon , prosecutors allege that graswald intentionally caused viafore 's death
the complaint states that rough waters combined with strong winds caused viafore âs kayak to overturn
authorities did not specify what led them to conclude that angelika graswald was responsible for her fiance 's death , only saying that she had made statements implicating herself in the crime
as recently as tuesday , she shared a picture of the happy couple at a lakeside cabin , accompanied by the caption : ' i miss you , my love ... ' lingering questions : according to a criminal complaint , prosecutors allege that angelika graswald intentionally caused viafore 's death - but they would n't say how she did it ' clever ruse ' : she managed to make it out of the water and call 911
last monday , she asked friends on facebook to keep praying for her partner and hoped for a miracle the couple , who had been together for many years , were kayaking on the hudson river between plum point and bannerman âs island at around 7.30pm april 19 when viafore 's vessel overturned , sending him into the frigid water
viafore 's friend wes gottlock said he saw them out on the water , but did not discover there was a search underway until later on that evening
