the encounter begins with the young man approaches the ' fake service member ' asking him a series of questions including where he did his basic and boot camp training as the confrontation became tense , bar staff came over to tend to the shouting men ( above one member of staff tries to stop the ' fake service member ' ) after the young man asked for his geneva conventions identification card the young man says : ' do you realize what you are doing is a federal offense ... where is your geneva conventions identification card ?
