the mortgage market has reached a â watershed â moment with the launch of the first five - year fixed rate below 2 per cent
but the mortgage wars will erupt again next week after hsbc announced a 1.99 per cent interest rate on a five - year fix
experts said it was the cheapest ever deal of its kind and described the move as â astonishing â
new low : the mortgage market has reached a â watershed â moment with the launch of the first five - year fixed rate below 2 per cent the offer from one of the country âs biggest mortgage lenders â hsbc is consistently in the top five â launches on monday and is expected to trigger a flood of rate cuts by other banks and building societies
mortgage broker andrew montlake , of coreco , said : â the breaking of the 2 per cent barrier for a five - year fix is a watershed moment and one many thought would never be seen in the uk
â hsbc already had one of the lowest five - year fixes on the market at 2.19 per cent , but decided to under - cut itself to try to steal more customers from its rivals
with the hsbc rate cut from 2.19 per cent to 1.99 per cent , a homeowner borrowing Â£ 200,000 over a 25 - year term would save more than Â£ 1,100 during the five - year deal
the battle between lenders has intensified in recent months , plunging home loan rates to their lowest in history mortgage broker david hollingsworth , of london and country , said : â this is an astonishing low rate for a five - year fixed rate and certainly moves the market on again after a recent lull
charlotte nelson , at moneyfacts , said : â this 1.99 per cent deal is the first five - year fixed - rate mortgage to be launched below 2 per cent
â the average rate on a five - year fixed rate on offer , across all deposits , is now 3.55 per cent , compared to 4.04 per cent a year ago
increased competition from new banks such as tsb and virgin has forced major banks and building societies to compete harder , according to experts
experts warned that borrowers looking for a fixed - rate mortgage deal must consider the whole package rather than the headline interest rate , and factor in any fees , which can add significantly to the overall cost of the loan
