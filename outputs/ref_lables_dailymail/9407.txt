until two years ago , 50 - year - old roxy was a bodyguard called bob , who lived a reclusive life , plagued by depression

with jo 's full support , roxy started on the journey of gender reassignment - a move which has finally given her the parent - son relationship which has always been missing
and for william , ' mummy roxy 's ' new lease of life has changed everything - and he has no desire for ' grumpy daddy ' to return
