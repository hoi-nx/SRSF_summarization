h â e said mr salmond had made the problem worse and said it was wrong that ukip is called racist
' asked if being anti-english was the same as being racist , mr farage said : ' when i say that i do n't think we should have an open door to poland , latvia and lithuania i 'm accused of being racist and yet when it 's the scottish being rude about the english you do n't think it is
the ukip leader said it showed that people in the north east are ' particularly tough '
' mr farage accused the former scottish first minister of not doing enough to counter the problem
' asked if nicola sturgeon was also to blame , mr farage added : ' she has n't done anything to stop it , but i have n't heard her say anything to encourage it
â ' but snp msp humza yousaf hit back at the ukip leader 's ' politics of fear and intolerance '
he said : ' these disgraceful comments - which are n't just offensive to the snp , but to the majority of people in scottish on current polls - show exactly why the people of scottish reject ukip
' mr farage said both nicola sturgeon and mr salmond had failed to act to quell resentment between the english and scottish mr farage also dismissed a claim from labour 's shadow business secretary umunna that ukip is infected with the ' virus of racism '
he said mr umunna , who he labelled ' the high priest of the liberal metropolitan elite ' , had made the comment because labour is ' running scared ' of ukip
hartlepool , which has been held by labour since it was formed in 1974 , is ukip 's main target seat in the north east at the general election in 2010 , ukip took just seven per cent of the vote and labour 's iain wright retained the seat with a 5,509 majority
