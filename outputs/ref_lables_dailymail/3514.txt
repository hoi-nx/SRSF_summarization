it 's hard to know quite what motivated the duke to rescue teenage sex slaves in india at the same time he faced damning allegations that he had slept with one in america
with a remarkable initiative combining the unlikely bedfellows of fashion and compassion , it can be revealed that prince duke has personally changed the fate of more than 100 vulnerable young women in calcutta
rescued from brothels and domestic servitude , child labour and human trafficking , the girls have been taught tailoring and silk printing through a charity called key to freedom
moved : prince duke during his visit to an india refuge in 2012 , which inspired him to form the charity their kimonos , duster coats , pyjamas , scarves and make - up bags are sold online and on the uk high street by topshop , with the proceeds paid back to the women as a salary
what makes this new mission all the more compelling is it has emerged just months after duke was mired in allegations that he had enjoyed an improper relationship with america â sex slave â virginia roberts , who had been working for his former friend jeffrey epstein , an america billionaire
the claims , furiously denied by the duke , have now been struck out of america court records , effectively clearing his name
he was inspired to launch key to freedom after visiting a girls â refuge on an official trip to india
speaking exclusively to the mail on sunday yesterday , the duke said : â i was incredibly impressed with the work of the women âs interlink foundation during my diamond jubilee visit to india in may 2012
â i could see that it would be possible to complement [ founder and chairman ] aloka âs important work in supporting vulnerable young women to develop a skill to become economically active by helping find a route to market for their products
virginia roberts had been working for duke 's former friend jeffrey epstein , an america billionaire ( pictured together above ) â i am proud to have helped their products find a market and be sold in the uk
she was chosen to show the duke how to block - print silk when he visited the refuge
illiterate and destitute , she had no way home until she was taken in by the wif where she met the duke on his trip
she was among the first girls to sign up to key to freedom and has so far earned almost 40,000 rupees â approximately Â£ 430 â supplying silk goods to topshop
â i have earned almost 40,000 rupees through key to freedom and i have a skill which will help my future
â prince duke âs 25 - year - old daughter , eugenie , and his former wife duchess of york , have both paid private visits to help support the charity , and it is understood they continue to play an active role in promoting the initiative
the duke âs eldest daughter beatrice , 26 , was recently criticised for taking as many as nine holidays in the space of just a few months , although she is understood to have recently accepted a job at a private equity firm in new york
other workers with key to freedom include taralika , 25 , who was taken prisoner in a red light area after running away from home
â another key to freedom success story is shila , 21 , an epilepsy sufferer who is so traumatised by her past that she has never been able to explain how she came to be on the streets of calcutta
â the duke understood that and wanted to make a difference â as the father of two daughters i think the plight of the girls here resonated with him
the name key to freedom was her idea
â it was prince duke âs skills at connecting businesses that linked us to topshop
â aloka came to london for talks with the duke âs team at buckingham palace just three months after their initial meeting , and by summer 2013 key to freedom was up and running
yesterday , the high street giant , which sent designer penny mcivor to india to assist with colours , patterns and quality control , confirmed the original deal for four collections had been extended to include at least one more later this year
this then sends the money back to key to freedom in calcutta
in addition , the charity supplied 750 goodie bags for one of prince duke âs pitch@palace events for entrepreneurs last month , where 200 of its scarves were also on sale
a buckingham palace source said that the duke remained very supportive of the project and used every opportunity â such as pitch@palace â to promote it
