yet another scientific study has found no link between autism and the vaccine against measles , mumps and rubella - even among high risk children
the findings , in the journal of the american medical association ( journal of the american medical association ) , are based on a study of about 95,000 young people
numerous studies over the last 15 years have ruled out a link between the mmr vaccine and autism since autism can run in families , researchers decided to look at whether vaccines could make autism even more likely in children who had siblings with autism
they found that vaccines had no effect on autism risk , whether or not a sibling in the family was diagnosed
' we also found no evidence that receipt of either one or two doses of mmr vaccination was associated with an increased risk of asd among children who had older siblings with asd
' although a substantial body of research over the last 15 years has found no link between the mmr vaccine and asd , parents and others continue to associate the vaccine with asd , ' said the journal of the american medical association study
' children who have an older sibling with autism are less likely to get vaccinated , the study found
' the only conclusion that can be drawn from the study is that there is no signal to suggest a relationship between mmr and the development of autism in children with or without a sibling who has autism , ' king wrote
