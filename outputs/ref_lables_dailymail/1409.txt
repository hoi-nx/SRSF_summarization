barcelona took a major step towards qualification for the last four of the champions league after they dismantled psg on wednesday night
super suarez it feels rather strange now but there was a time last summer when we were all wondering whether suarez - with his penchant for a human - based snack during football matches - was worth all that money for barcelona
it is now 17 goals for the season and barcelona 's front three , spearheaded by suarez , lionel messi and neymar is the most in - form in world football
they are a frightening prospect and suarez , after three goals in his first 12 games for barcelona , has hit the high notes at the right time
he has scored 10 in his last 11 games - including two crucial goals away at manchester city - and his understanding with his strike partners has elevated this barcelona side to a new level
suarez scores his second of the night to give barcelona a 3 - 0 lead in their tie at psg the former liverpool forward is mobbed by his barcelona team - mates after doubling his tally for the evening psg yearn for zlatan ibrahimovic 's quality prior to this game , psg were unbeaten so far this season when playing without zlatan ibrahimovic , winning 11 and drawing 5 of the 16 games
it had developed a view - nourished by that inspiring performance when ibrahbimovic was sent off at chelsea - that psg may be a stronger collective unit without the swede
yet on the grandest occasions , you still require that moment of world - class quality and laurent blanc really needed edinson cavani to stand tall here
zlatan ibrahimovic , pictured in action on saturday , missed the game against barcelona through suspension edinson cavani failed to deliver the goods for psg and looked out - of - sorts against barcelona on wednesday once more , though , the uruguayan failed to deliver on the biggest stage
neymar back in form after a run of three goals in 10 games , the brazilian had begun to fade into the shadows a little , particularly when placed against the the brilliance of lionel messi and suarez
lionel messi was pulling the strings as ever but neymar was the most eye - catching barcelona forward in the first - half
neymar was barcelona 's most eye - catching forward in the first half of their victory against psg neymar celebrates with suarez after the uruguayan scored his first of two goals against psg psg 's euro home run comes to an end this victory for barcelona brought a shuddering end to psg 's proud unbeaten run at the parc de princes in european competition
marquinhos and yohan cabaye reflect on psg 's defeat ... their first at home in european football since 2006 busquets is the midfield maestro we have marvelled for years at the gifts of xavi and iniesta and while the shielding work of sergio busquets has also been appreciated , it does seem as though he has become even more prominent under luis enrique
