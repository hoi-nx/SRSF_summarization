on the eve of the county championship season , hemphrey has finally secured the professional cricket contract he has been striving for over the past decade
for hemphrey , a 25 - year - old former folkestone grammar school pupil who suffered habitual rejection in his attempts to breakthrough into the englishman system , has an amazing story to tell , after forging an unlikely first - class career in australia
it has been an extraordinary journey for hemphrey from a second xi debut for kent at 15 to his recent status as the first englishman to hit a sheffield shield hundred since john hampshire for tasmania in 1978
that feat was accomplished in queensland 's final match of the 2014 - 15 season , a victory over australia at the gabba
hemphrey during his kent career ( left ) and as a youngster for notts under 11s where he scored his first hundred ( right ) when he emigrated to brisbane 18 months ago , he admits his desire for a shot at the top level had regressed into an ' unrealistic dream '
a stunning first season down under â in which he finished third top scorer in queensland 's grade competition â was followed by a state second xi debut last october
it put him in the frame for higher honours when the sheffield shield season reopened post-big bash and a new year injury to australia batsman usman khawaja gave him his chance
james pattinson dismissed him for a second - ball duck but queensland â showing numerous changes in the wake of stuart law 's removal as coach â crushed eventual champions victoria by an innings
the following week hemphrey hit 58 and tasmania were defeated in hobart by a similar scoreline
queensland were not going to change a winning side and that very fact secured his future
matches 5 innings 8 not outs 0 runs 310 highest innings score 118 batting average 38.75 balls faced 809 batting strike rate 38.31 100s 1 50s 1 4s 37 6s 0 ' the system over here guarantees you a minimum contract if you play three state games , ' hemphrey explained to sportsmail
a week after basically being told that i was n't good enough my granddad came to watch and it was great afterwards listening to him talk about how i 'd played from his non-cricket perspective , ' hemphrey explained
to me , scoring a first - class hundred in australia is quite something but he taught me a lot about life , and i have to say i was a lot more nervous when i stood up to speak at his funeral than i was when i was on 97
according to hemphrey , a combination of leaving outside off - stump and playing the ball late is his modus operandi
' hemphrey 's rise is all the more remarkable given that the three counties in his first incarnation as a cricketer were at least as interested in his off - spin ( he has not bowled this past winter due to a labral tear in his shoulder )
in contrast , his performances were catching the eyes of justin sterns and trevor hohns - state coach and convenor of selectors respectively - not long after australia twenty20 international chris lynn , with whom a friendship developed during a previous three - year stint in queensland grade cricket , lured him to toombul
' but for now he is running with the queensland as englishman cricket 's unsung export .
