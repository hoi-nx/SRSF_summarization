the tragic death of a seven - week - old baby in his mother âs bed has led a coroner to demand new guidelines to warn parents of the dangers of sleeping next to newborns
â well cared - for and loved â efan was found lying face down and unresponsive the morning after hannah , 26 , took him to bed
at the baby âs inquest this week , a coroner in pembrokeshire said new parents were given â confusing â advice over how tired they could be when they slept in the same bed as their child
tragedy : efan , who was described as ' well cared - for and loved ' , was sharing a bed with his mother hannah ( pictured together ) when he died in his sleep last october co-sleeping : mrs hannah had taken her son to bed with her at the family home in milford haven , west wales but the next morning he was ' lying face down and unresponsive ' , an inquest heard the wales government âs â reducing the risk of cot death â leaflet , which offers similar advice to the nhs in england , says parents should not share a bed with a young baby if they â feel very tired â , take drugs , smoke , or have drunk alcohol
but coroner layton said : â the advice is that it is not wrong to share a bed with your baby â but you should refrain from doing so if you are â excessively tired â
miss hannah had been to a party and had â a little to drink â before she , her baby and a friend all shared the bed at the family home in neyland , west wales , in october last year
the next morning efan was found â face down and unresponsive â
pembrokeshire coroner layton said the current advice on ' co-sleeping ' is ' confusing ' pembrokeshire coroner âs court heard how attempts were made to resuscitate efan but he could not be saved
tests later showed his brain had been starved of oxygen.home office pathologist richard jones told the inquest there was no specific cause of death but it was typical of sudden unexpected infant death or â cot death â
examination showed a suggestion that the brain had an inadequate supply of oxygenated blood shortly before efan died
â the coroner recorded an open conclusion and said the death could not be explained on pathological grounds , adding : â there is no doubt that he was well cared for and loved by his family
the nice ( nice ) published advice for england and wales in december which told parents there was a strong link between co-sleeping and cot death , or sudden infant death syndrome
inquest : mr layton recorded an open conclusion and said efan 's death could not be explained on pathological grounds - but a pathologist said it was typical of sudden unexpected infant death or ' cot death '
