my teenagers demand something a bit more exciting than sand and sea from family summer holidays nowadays , and given their obsession with all things kardashian , we decided on california this year
in fact , we plumped for a classic america road trip - driving along the pacific ( aka route 1 ) from san francisco to los angeles
it took molly , dylan and i three weeks to do it , and we fitted so much in during that time it 's difficult to even do it justice
navigating route 1 from san francisco 's iconic golden gate bridge to los angeles , jane enjoys her road trip san francisco is known as america 's most europe city , possibly because you 'll need to pack a fleece even in late july
the mist that rolls in off the sea and shrouds the golden gate bridge most days can sometimes linger , but we never stayed still long enough to get cold
based in the funky hotel zetta - where the foyer - come games room and bar is plastered with colossal photos of john lennon and past guests of alcatraz - we spent three days hurtling around the city , often clinging for dear life to the famous cable cars that haul you up and down the city of angels 's hills
we ate clam chowder from a bread bowl at fisherman 's wharf , we trawled the boutiques of haight ashbury in search of the summer of love , we bussed out to the golden gate , and we wondered at the aquarium in golden gate park
jane travelled the scenic route , taking in beaches and , fleeces on , we took the boat trip to alcatraz , which is not to be missed
the brilliant audio guide that leads you around the prison is narrated only by men who were once guards or prisoners on the rock , making for an eerie and compelling tour
after trying to distil the city into only 72 hours , we climbed into our suv and headed for route 1
it 's only about 350 miles as the crow flies between san francisco and los angeles , but this ( mostly ) coastal route is probably well over 500 miles long as it winds through some of california 's most wonderful , ever - changing scenery
much of the highway has a 55mph speed limit and has only one lane in each direction - it 's time to take your foot off the gas , relax and take it all in
my children said it reminded them of dorset as we headed south past santa cruz and then nipped briefly into monterey to dine in a seafront restaurant on the edge of cannery row , the waterfront district made famous in john steinbeck 's novel of the same name
at dylan 's insistence , we took a detour on to 17 mile drive , the scenic road around the monterey peninsula that leads to the world - famous pebble beach golf club
he was rather disappointed by the condition of the course there , but thrilled with the state of quail lodge and golf club , our first port of call just outside the pretty little town of carmel
even the non-golfers among us loved our luxurious bungalow at the edge of the course ; secluded and tranquil , plush and green with a view of distant mountains
when the sound of silence got too much for us , just across the street at valley hills there was the excellent and lively baja cantina mexican restaurant , and a wonderful deli too
leaving carmel , you find yourself at the edge of the spectacular area known as big sur : wild and often mountainous terrain battling it out with the equally wild pacific
this was a completely different wildness , underlined when dylan narrowly avoided stepping on a basking rattlesnake
big sur : where the wild and often mountainous terrain battles it out with the equally wild pacific ocean we took a rare detour off route 1 to the danish settlement of solvang , a sort of cutesy yet sinister re-creation of denmark in the california sun , full of pastry shops and chinese tourists
having soaked up a bit of the golden age of hollywood , we headed off on route 1 again to see the city of angels of today
it includes room - only accommodation at a choice of hotels along the route from san francisco to los angeles , return flights with united airlines from gatwick into san francisco and out of los angeles , and 4wd car hire
