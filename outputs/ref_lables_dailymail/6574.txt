beaming towards the camera as a toothy 10 - year - old , thompson is the picture of health as he poses in his family 's back garden
consuming 10,000 calories - a - day by gorging on takeaways and whole loaves of bread , the 32 - year - old is too heavy to walk or wash himself
but aged around 10 he was a normal size and played like a normal child living off a combination of incapacity benefits and a disability allowance , mr thompson spends roughly Â£ 200 every week on takeaways and online food shopping
at the time mr thompson said he ate everything the factory did n't sell
but after the death of his mother in 2012 from a brain tumour , mr thompson turned to food as a means of coping with his grief
breakfast : four sausages , five fried eggs , fried bread , mushrooms fried in butter , bowl of cereal with full fat milk lunch : bowl of pasta , chips , bacon , pork pies , crisps , pasties , sandwiches and chocolate dinner : chinese or indian takeaway of up to Â£ 25 five nights a week snacks : Â£ 10 a day on yorkie bars with food as his only source of comfort , he doubled in weight from 30 to 65 stone in just three years and became housebound
since he is unable to leave the house mr thompson relies on online shopping deliveries and takeaways
' i order takeaways five nights a week , usually spending between Â£ 10 and Â£ 25 on chinese , curries , pizza or fish and chips , ' he said
' alongside takeaways mr thompson spends Â£ 10 a day on chocolate , typically yorkie bars
mr thompson has put on 30 stone since 2012 ( pictured above ) when his mother died he has not had a relationship since his early twenties which ended because of his weight gain
while mr thompson said he has always had a problem with food ( he was caught raiding his neighbours ' fridges when he was three ) he said it was made worse by the death of his mother in 2012
desperate to shed 45 stone , mr thompson said : ' i could die , that âs the bottom line if i keep going the way i do
' but unlike paul mason , previously britain 's heaviest man who tipped the scales at 70 stone , mr thompson said he does not want to undergo gastric band surgery
â while mr thompson said he has always had weight issues , he ballooned in size following the death of his mother ( pictured together left when he was 15 )
the 54 - year - old travelled to the u.s. to have the operation carried out after being refused by the nhs
mr thompson eats 10,000 calories a day between takeaways , fry up breakfasts , pork pies and microwavable meals the 32 - year - old said he is desperate to lose weight but does not want a gastric band because he thinks they are dangerous
