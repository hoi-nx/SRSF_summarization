warne hailed benaud as the ' godfather of cricket ' following the former australia captain and broadcaster 's death at the age of 84
benaud was as well known for his commentary as his cricket after moving into a career in the media in 1956 which saw him become the voice of the game in both england and his homeland
but he was also a trailblazing all - rounder who took 228 wickets and scored 2,201 runs in 68 tests while never losing a series in charge of his country
tributes are seen at the statue of benaud at the scg after his passing aged 84 a tribute of a microphone with benaud 's test cap number of 190 is left at the statue the flags atop the sydney harbour bridge can be seen flying at half - mast as a tribute to benaud the australian flag at the scg is lowered at half mast for the australian cricketer and commentator one of benaud 's most famous commentaries was on the ' ball of the century ' - warne 's first delivery in ashes cricket which dismissed mike gatting - and the 45 - year - old fellow leg - spinner paid an emotional tribute to his mentor on instagram

' warne paid tribute to benaud , calling him the ' godfather of cricket ' current australia test captain michael clarke believes it was benaud 's spirit as well as his prowess with bat , ball and microphone that made him one of the most popular figures in the game
' i think that everybody involved in the game of cricket : supporters , players , the media , everyone , richie is known for a lot more than bowling a few leg - spinners and hitting a few cover drives , ' he told today on channel nine in australia
' he was a great player and a great captain , a wonderful leader of men and i think he 's continued that off the field
' benaud took a break from commentary in 2013 after being involved in a car accident and just over a year later his comeback was put on ice as he began to receive treatment for skin cancer
benaud was one of cricket 's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge benaud was a daring captain and became the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in tests a floral tribute lies at a plaque at the scg he never did return to the microphone full time but his legacy was long since secured and australia coach lehmann hailed him as ' one of the game 's greats '
' the fact that australia never lost a series under his captaincy says so much and those standards were just as high when he turned his attention to calling the game , ' said lehmann
' there will only ever be one benaud
our thoughts go out to daphne , john and the entire benaud family at this sad time
benaud at one point was australia 's leading wicket - taker with his leg - spin before his record was surpassed by dennis lillee and eventually warne
england coach peter moores was also among those to express their sympathy at benaud 's passing , saying : ' richie sums up all that is great about our sport
' he was a true gentlemen with a real insight into the game , he made heroes of the players he commentated on and his enthusiasm for the sport made you want to get off the sofa and play
australia batsman steve smith , currently in india playing in the indian premier league , wrote on twitter : ' sad to wake up and hear of the loss of benaud
true gentleman and the voice of cricket
' the number 190 refers to benaud 's test cap number for australia
' sri lanka 's kumar sangakkara added : ' so sad to hear about the passing of benaud
