lauda âs red cap stood out like a beacon on the dull , grey tarmac of the biggest , most soulless paddock in all formula one
the three - time world champion is colourful , candid and carefree
when your face is the charred remains of having nearly burned to death at the wheel of a ferrari , why not throw caution to the wind or , in shanghai âs case , the smog ? lauda , now chairman of mercedes f1 , aimed his first verbal grenade at his driver rosberg , who moments earlier had stood in front of him rotating his shoulders and about to play keepie - uppie to warm up for friday 's second practice session for the chinese grand prix
lauda aimed a first verbal grenade at his driver rosberg ahead of the race in shanghai mercedes f1 driver rosberg is pushed back into his garage during the second practice session rosberg ended that session , as he did the first , behind lewis hamilton ( below ) , his in - the - groove world champion team - mate who also markedly outperformed the german in the first two races , in australia and malaysia
of course , not long after these words reach your breakfast tables in the shires , rosberg may buck up and take pole , but it would be something of a surprise , not least to lauda , if he did
â yes , rosberg is definitely a little bit behind lewis hamilton , â said the austrian
â rosberg looks on in the paddock after practice for the china formula one grand prix in shanghai rosberg drives during practice for the formula one grand prix of china at shanghai international circuit rosberg is supremely professional
then lewis hamilton put down the hammer , changing the dynamic for both men
at least rosberg is not the watching neutral âs only hope of a contest breaking out this season , after ferrari shocked everyone by winning a fortnight ago
nobody was ever more pleased to see vettel wagging his finger in celebration than fans whose own digits were poised over the television remotes â off - switches , so jaundiced were they by the prospect of mercedes f1 â seemingly endless hegemony
mercedes f1 driver rosberg chats with team members on the pit wall after the first practice rosberg prepares to drive during practice for the formula one grand prix at shanghai international circuit rosberg drives during practice for the formula one grand prix of china at shanghai international circuit as bernie joked , mercedes f1 team principal toto wolff could have the legend , â the man who killed formula one â , engraved on his tombstone
lauda , a long - time friend of bernie , has no time for sentiment
vettel is a four - time world champion and so is someone to look up to
even though they appear not to be as quick over one lap , they look strong , possibly stronger than mercedes f1 , on a long run
