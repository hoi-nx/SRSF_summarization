scientists say they have found 50 galaxies that may contain intelligent alien races
these galaxies were found to be emitting â unusually high â levels of radiation - possibly indicating â the presence of a highly advanced civilisation
â within these galaxies , the researchers said it was possible that an alien race could be harnessing the power of the stars - emitting huge amounts of noticeable heat in the process
pennsylvania scientists have found evidence that we may not be alone
they found 50 galaxies emitting unusually high levels of radiation
this could be because aliens are harnessing the power of stars
however , further research is needed to confirm that is the case
a proposed method for harnessing the power of an entire star is known as a freeman dyson sphere
the energy used by such a race to be noticeable would have to be huge - likely harnessing the power of a galaxy âs stars
the researchers picked out 100,000 galaxies of interest , and found that 50 of them were emitting â unusually high levels of mid-infrared radiation

he said , including the 50 galaxies , none of the 100,000 were found â with more than 85 per cent of their light being used by alien industry
