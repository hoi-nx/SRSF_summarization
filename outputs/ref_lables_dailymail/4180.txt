a keen fisherman got more than he bargained for at the weekend when he reeled in a massive shark after spending hours battling the beast
max , 19 , from coomera in qld was camping at tweed heads just across the nsw border with his girlfriend when the pair decided to go for an early morning fish
an avid angler , mr max could n't believe his luck when a huge four metre tiger shark took a bite of his line , and he spent the next three hours trying to bring it to shore
' the teenager , who is in his own words ' a shark conservationist first and foremost ' , also said the massive three hour battle left him with some serious battle wounds
' the first hour this shark absolutely made a mockery out of me , ' mr max wrote
the huge struggle with the shark left his antique fishing rod bent slightly out of shape the 19 - year - old said the catch was a once in a lifetime opportunity mr max believes it could have been world record size but he was n't able to accurately measure the beast he was with his girlfriend alexia ( right ) on the beach , who was snapping photos of him reeling in the shark ' i was hurting bad , really bad
mr max said he did n't even get a proper glimpse of the shark until the second hour , ' when it jumped out of the water ! ! ! what a sight , i have never seen that before ! ' the teenager also spoke to nine 's today show on thursday morning , telling the program he knew what he was up for about ' 20 seconds in ... it definitely shocked me and my girlfriend ( who ) i was fishing with '
mr max said he thinks the catch could have been close to the world record , and he wished he could have measured it accurately
' the current catch and release world record tiger shark held by joey polk is 10 foot eight inches ( 3.25m ) in fork length and 12 foot 9 inches ( 3.88m ) overall length , ' he told the gold coast bulletin
after getting a quick measurement of the huge creature , mr max sent it back out to sea he is pictured here watching the huge creature swim back out into the ocean mr max ( left ) and alexia ( right ) were camping on the tweed heads coast when they were fishing mr max said he decided to release the shark rather than getting the measurements necessary to prove the record because the animal was in distressed after being landed
