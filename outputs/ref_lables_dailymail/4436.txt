an extremist preacher who is suspected of radicalising jihadi john lives in a leafy west london street and can not be deported because of his human rights
egyptian - born hani al-sibai is believed to have influenced a number of young men , who then travelled abroad to join terror groups , including jihadi john , whose real name is emwazi
the radical cleric lives in the same neighbourbood where emwazi , who was unmasked in february as the notorious murderer in islamic state 's ruthless propaganda videos , hung out with fellow jihadists
now , security services are believed to be investigating al-sibai 's influence on the london boys terror cell of which enwazi was a part
al-sibai recently sparked controversy when he aired his sexist comments live on air leading the female tv host to cut him off abruptly al-sibai 's bank accounts and assets are subject to freezing orders by the un , the uk treasury and us treasury
al-sibai was a close associate of egyptian jihadist adel abdel bari , whose son abdel-majed abdel bary ( pictured ) is believed to be part of jihadi john 's network in islamic state but as officials were unable to obtain the necessary assurances to guarantee al-sibai âs safety , human rights laws mean suspects can not be deported to countries where they are at risk
and while in the country , he has regularly provoked outrage with his extremist comments , notably describing the july 7 bombing as a ' great victory ' for the terror organisation
more recently , he made headlines after a female lebanese tv presenter cut him off for making sexist comments live on air
