manchester united had four different scorers on sunday
with all that money flashing around you would have picked angel di maria over juan mata , marcus rojo over chris smalling and just about anybody over marouane fellaini and ashley young
marouane fellaini is now manchester united âs go - to guy and chris smalling has improved
juan mata celebrates after scoring against manchester city , and he is part of louis van gaal 's ' fab four ' ashley young is another player that few would have expected to be a key part of van gaal 's plans marouane fellaini has become manchester united 's go - to player in midfielder this season chris smalling has improved and despite the summer spending he remains a key aprt of the team as for ashley young , who would have thought he would become one of manchester united âs most consistent players ? it just shows how louis van gaal works
van gaal does nât care about names â he wants to pick the right person at the right time and give a chance the only potential problem would be a michael carrick injury as he has been instrumental in manchester united âs revival adding goals will make james a star we 've heard a lot about james ward-prowse and he was one of my 10 players to watch at the start of the season
james ward-prowse was one of my 10 players to watch at the start of the season and he scored this weekend now he has to go up a level and try and emulate his heroes by scoring goals on a regular basis
ward-prowse grew up idolising david beckham ( right ) and steven gerrard ( centre ) , he must score like them my tip for ward-prowse from august 2014 as one of my 10 players to watch this season 1998 - the last time all three promoted teams were relegated the following season was in 1997 - 98
the three promoted teams are all in the relegation zone as it stands but i âve got a sneaky feeling one of them will get out of it
only once before in premier league history have all three promoted teams gone straight back down and that happened 17 seasons ago
qpr were unlucky to lose against chelsea but i âve got a feeling one of the promoted teams will survive lennon looking happy again when aaron lennon went on loan to everton , his first photo shoot caused quite a stir
aaron lennon looks like he âs loving life under roberto martinez and he suits the way the manager plays cresswell 's curler aaron cresswell âs free - kick was one of the finest set - piece goals we âve seen all season
it feels like a lot of free - kicks have gone flying in this campaign and i wondered if the referee âs vanishing spray was having a big impact
but even with the spray , which is a good addition , there has nât been a big change in terms of successful free - kicks , as our table shows
aaron cresswell âs free - kick against stoke was one of the finest set - piece goals we âve seen all season aaron cresswell 's was good but there has nât been a big change in successful free - kicks , as our table shows 4 - in 29 games this season , yannick bolasie has four goals
everything he does happens at blistering speed and he absolutely terrorises defenders
yannick bolasie has been one of the main reasons behind crystal palace âs incredible run of form this year homegrown stars francis coquelin and harry kane have been the two breakthrough players of the year and in positions where their clubs needed reinforcements
francis coquelin has become such a strong presence in arsenal âs midfield and harry kane is a striking star for tottenham
harry kane 's progress goes to show you do nât always have to go out and spend huge money to solve issues spurs stagnate that was a big win for tim sherwood at white hart lane
but how much has really changed at tottenham ? if it were nât for harry kane , there would be some serious criticism heading their way â as the table below shows , they have not improved on last year
