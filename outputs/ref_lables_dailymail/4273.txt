between the bad behaviour and the bad advice , raheem sterling is not exactly endearing himself to potential suitors right now
hippy crack and shisha pipes , mixed in with accusations of greed after being encouraged by his agent to reject liverpool âs offer of close to Â£ 100,000 - a - week , might not be quite enough to send rival clubs running
after all , as liverpool know only too well , you can bite and racially abuse opponents and still secure a move to barcelona
but the evidence is sure to be a concern when the world âs richest clubs assess the character as much as the class of an individual before parting with the Â£ 40million upwards liverpool will demand to secure the services of a player like raheem sterling
liverpool players raheem sterling and jordon ibe ( left ) have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe this is the second time raheem sterling has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days the recent images of raheem sterling will be a concern to clubs considering parting with Â£ 40million to sign the star luis suarez secured a move to barcelona despite being involved in a number of incidents on the pitch english football would appear to have yet another flawed talent , another player seemingly lacking the wit to make best use of the ability he has been blessed with
there is a reason why we rarely see the finest players on the planet caught in as compromising a position as raheem sterling found himself on monday night
as the latest photographs show , this is not an isolated incident and he will be lectured on the dangers of nitrous oxide when he meets with brendan rodgers tomorrow
it is more of a health issue than an image issue for liverpool âs manager , as raheem sterling did at least opt for the privacy of his own home to suck on a balloon filled with nitrous oxide â unlike tottenham âs kyle walker , for instance
but brendan rodgers will also suggest to the unsettled 20 - year - old that he needs to select his friends more carefully given the emergence of the video in the first place
jordon ibe was also pictured smoking shisha with raheem sterling in fresh pictures that will further embarrass liverpool it appears that liverpool stars raheem sterling and jordon ibe had a shisha pipe apiece and were also drinking fanta raheem sterling celebrates after scoring liverpool 's opening goal in monday night 's 2 - 0 win over newcastle becoming as good as lionel messi ( right ) or cristiano ronaldo ( left ) requires more than just ability alone he should also heed the warnings of other talented players who have run into such trouble , like jack wilshere and ravel morrison
of course , it will not be the first time brendan rodgers has questioned raheem sterling over the company he keeps
but brendan rodgers â criticism of ward is limited to the issues over the contract because he recognises the agent as someone who , at times , has had a positive influence on a young man whose life has not been without its problems
ward is credited to some extent with the fact that raheem sterling actually gives his manager few concerns when he is at work
liverpool manager brendan rodgers was due to speak to raheem sterling to remind him of his responsibilities jordon ibe and raheem sterling were wearing casual clothing and pictured inhaling from the lit shisha pipe ( bottom right ) shisha is a water pipe in which flavoured tobacco is roasted with charcoal
for all the uncertainty over his future , brendan rodgers and the player have managed to maintain a healthy working relationship
the relationship between ward and raheem sterling is more personal than the typical agent - player dynamic
while ward has 80 per cent of the equity , the remaining 20 per cent is divided between raheem sterling and arsenal âs alex oxlade-chamberlain
but ward has an almost paternal relationship with raheem sterling , with the player affectionately addressing him as â uncle aidy â
clearly , raheem sterling needs that kind of guidance
raheem sterling was pictured on social media smoking a shisha pipe in a story published over the weekend raheem sterling was also filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - known as ' hippy crack ' beschi told the mail on sunday two years ago that he would walk raheem sterling and his classmates to look at the building site that would soon become the new wembley
when raheem sterling moved to liverpool at 15 he lived in digs with the couple he warmly refers to as his â house parents â
raheem sterling acknowledges young qpr supporters - the liverpool star joined the loftus road club at the age of 10 there is nothing wrong with trying to secure the best deal possible for a player
particularly when ward can point to the fact that , right now , a player of raheem sterling âs value to liverpool is earning roughly Â£ 6m - a - year less than daniel sturridge ; Â£ 35,000 - a - week compared with Â£ 150,000 - a - week
by the end of last year , liverpool actually thought they had reached an agreement at just shy of Â£ 100,000 - a - week
the academy staff at liverpool consider him the most exciting winger to have come through the club âs system and brendan rodgers has described him as the finest young player in europe
raheem sterling celebrates with jordon ibe after scoring in monday 's premier league match at anfield against newcastle jordon ibe pictured during monday night 's win over newcastle , which kept liverpool in the top four chase if ward âs intention is to take raheem sterling away from liverpool this summer , the player is not making his job easy right now
the agent will tell potential suitors not to read too much into the photographs , that raheem sterling is a good christian boy who says his prayers every night and rarely , if ever , touches alcohol
