they were 2 - 1 down at that point , two moments of genius from ross mccormack and matt smith the difference
they rallied to come away from fulham with a point - it was a night in which new manager caldwell certainly saw enough to build on - but all at the club know their stay in the championship is unlikely to be extended beyond may

matt smith scores fulham 's second goal to restore their lead against wigan at carven cottage on friday matt smith slides to his knees as he celebrates putting the home side back in front in the championship match and to come from behind twice shows qualities they just did not possess under mackay
caldwell , a rugged central defender , will be unhappy with the ease with which ross mccormack opened the scoring after just four minutes ; harry maguire 's header was a poor one , straight into the path of sean kavanagh , who fed the scot and he was afforded the time to pick a spot and curl beyond carson
firstly jermaine pennant levelled for wigan , bending a wicked 25 - yard free - kick away from the despairing marcus bettinelli
wigan utility player james perch ( left ) jumps for the ball and is challenged by fulham 's sean kavanagh ( right ) but anything the winger could do , lanky matt smith would match
fulham 's target man - again in too much space - looked up from the same distance and marvellously clipped over carson to net just his third goal for the club since a summer move from leeds
fans were furious at symons ' lack of tactical imagination , further compounded when jason pearce gambled at the back post to equalise for the visitors in the 69th minute
matt smith had been taken off six minutes previously to a chorus of boos and chants of ' you do n't know what you 're doing ' rained down on symons
much like against brentford , fulham 's paying customers did not shirk away from telling him exactly what they thought
