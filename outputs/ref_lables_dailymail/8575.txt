the humanoid , known as ham , has been drawing in crowds with his incredible range of facial expressions at an electronics event in hong kong this week
the head , designed by us robotics designer hanson robotics , is able to answer basic questions and can also be used in the simulation of medical scenarios
the head is created with malleable material called frubber using soft - bodied mechanical engineering and nanotechnology
using specialised software the machine can recognise and respond to a number of human facial expressions in a natural way
reactive : the robot smiles using multiple motors - which whir into action and subtly adjust multiple points of articulation around his mouth and brown eyes state - of - the - art : the head is created with malleable material using soft - bodied mechanical engineering and nanotechnology
leading designer : mr hanson robotics sees robotics as his calling and works on many fronts , from sculpting features to developing artificial intelligence on show : ham is currently on exhibit at the global sources spring electronics show at asiaworld expo - the largest event of its kind in the world previous model : the einstein robot , which made its public debut at the technology , entertainment and design conference in the us in 2009 , was developed at the uc ( uc )
