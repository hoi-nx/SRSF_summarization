but what they did have was a battery that lasted more than a few hours before the phone went dead
compare that with the battery life of a modern iphone or samsung
this week it was revealed that sir james dyson , inventor of dyson hoovers , is attempting to solve the problem by investing Â£ 10 million in u.s. - based battery experts sakti3
the 67 - year - old entrepreneur is supporting the company as it attempts to double the battery life of our phones , electric cars and vacuums
in the tech world , the battle for better battery life is never - ending
sir james dyson , pictured , inventor of dyson hoovers , is attempting to solve the problem by investing Â£ 10 million in battery experts sakti3 at the launch , apple chief executive tim cook boasted that the device had a battery life of 18 hours
but it later emerged that using the smartwatch for phone calls or apps means it will die after three hours
according to a recent poll , nine out of ten people feel stressed if their phone battery run out
so is there anything we can do to get more juice out of our phones ? linge , professor of telecommunications at salford university , says the problem is nât the batteries , which have improved immeasurably over the past couple of decades
â the reason why batteries lasted seven days in the 1990s is that a phone back then did nât do a great deal , â says professor linge
it did nât have apps , gps , bluetooth or wi - fi and it was nât used for facebook
â if you take a modern phone and turn off all those things and just use it for phone calls and text messages , it will last a lot longer
â the first mobile phone batteries were bulky , heavy and made with nickel cadium
they also lost battery life over time if they were not run down fully between charges , known as the â memory effect â
caught out : early mobile models could n't surf the internet , take pictures , play music or make you a cup of tea
but what they did have was a battery that lasted more than a few hours before the phone went dead â one of the big drains is the screen â if people have the brightness turned up , it will run down the battery , â says professor linge
â if you are in a low signal area , your battery will drain more quickly because the phone has to work harder to stay in contact with the nearest phone mast
but sunetra chakravarti , from mobile choice magazine , says there are simple things everyone can do to extend their phone âs life between charges
turning off bluetooth â the wireless system used by phones to connect to printers , laptops and other computers â will save your battery from running down
switching off location services which use the phone âs built - in gps tracker can also save power , as can turning down the volume of the ring tone and silencing any bleeps and clicks when you press buttons on the phone
however , unlike the older style batteries , you do nât need to discharge modern ones fully before you top them up
charging overnight should nât cause problems , as modern phones and batteries have switches that stop the charging when they are full
another way to get more out of a battery is to download the latest version of the phone âs operating system
when technology consumer website expert reviews tested the battery life of different smartphones , it found that the best lasted an amazing 14 hours longer than the worst
it emerged that using the smartwatch for phone calls or apps means it will die after three hours other tests have found that the xperia z3 lasts on average 48 hours when used for five hours a day to stream music , make calls and watch videos
but until battery life catches up with the demands of modern phones , millions of mobile users will spend their life plugging in their phone to charge .
