both federal government regulations and the american heart association have for decades warned that excess salt contributes to the deaths of tens of thousands of americans each year
as the federal government prepares its influential dietary guidelines for 2015 , some scientists are now saying that the average american salt consumption rate carries no risk
the guidelines currently dictate the people should limit their intake to 2,300 milligrams , with an even stricter 1,500 milligram limit for americans and people over 50
the average american ingests about 3,500 milligrams of salt per day - the amount of sodium in a teaspoon of salt - and so under the current dietary guidelines americans are indeed endangering themselves
in their view , a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6,000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks
the skeptics also warn of the dangers of consuming too little - they say that below 3,000 milligrams also raises health risks
the pure study published last august by the new england journal of medicine found that people who conform to the recommended limits ( 2,300 milligrams ) actually have more heart trouble
