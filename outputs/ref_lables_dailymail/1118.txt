first blood to united after their under 18s saw off man city 1 - 0 in the ' mini-derby '
callum gribbin was the matchwinner for united with a delightful free - kick ticket prices ? entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of moss lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on saturday with half - and - half scarves nowhere to be seen
altrincham 's compact 6,000 - capacity home may not be old trafford , but it does have a proud history of its own
it was certainly a grander stage than a windswept saturday morning on an outfield at united 's carrington complex , where paul mcguinness 's under 18s usually ply their trade
in an even first - half the impressive marcus wood , from just down the road in sale , came closest for man city with an audacious chip
united manager paul mcguinness saw his side claim victory in the ' mini derby ' for the home side towering centre - forward marcus rashford , another local lad from whom big things are expected , wasted two decent opportunities when put through
after dusting himself down callum gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free - kick around the wall and beyond blonde joe hart - a - like charlie albinson in the man city goal
the result leaves united , who have won two of this year 's cross-town clashes , two points behind leaders middlesbrough with a game in hand
