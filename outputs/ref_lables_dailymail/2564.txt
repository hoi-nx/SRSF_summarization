nasa has released the first close - up views of the north pole of dwarf planet ceres from the dawn
however , the images have not yet revealed what the mystery â bright spots â on the surface of the world are , which have gripped the attention of scientists and the public alike
nasa scientists in california have released new images of ceres ( shown )
they were taken by the dawn from a distance of 21,000 miles ( 33,000km )
the spacecraft is beginning to move closer and closer to ceres
and it will soon study the whole planet - including its mystery bright spots the latest images were taken on 10 april from a distance of 21,000 miles ( 33,000km ) , and are the highest - resolution views of ceres so far
nasa 's dawn has been making its way to ceres from the asteroid vesta since september 2012

this map - projected view of ceres was created from images taken by nasa 's dawn during its initial approach to the dwarf planet , prior to being captured into orbit in march 2015
differences in morphology and color across the surface suggest ceres was once an active body perhaps of most interest , though , are the mystery bright spots on the surface
based on new infrared images released by nasa the other day , it appears that the pair of spots have different thermal properties - suggesting they have different origins
' the bright spots continue to fascinate the science team , but we will have to wait until we get closer and are able to resolve them before we can determine their source , ' said chris russell from the university of california , los angeles
these images , from dawn 's visible and infrared mapping spectrometer ( vir ) , highlight two regions on ceres containing bright spots
the images suggest they coudl be towering â water volcanoes â , but more observations will be needed to confirm or deny this ' the bright spots [ seen in this previous nasa image ] continue to fascinate the science team , but we will have to wait until we get closer and are able to resolve them before we can determine their source , ' said chris russell from the university of california , los angeles
