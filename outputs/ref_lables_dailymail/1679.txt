the secret service took more than a year to replace a broken alarm system at the home of bush , it has emerged
the alarm failed at the former president 's houston residence in september 2013 and even though the secret service bought a replacement system in january 2014 , it took until december for it to be installed - leaving the couple without the protection of a working alarm at their home for 15 months
the oversight - just the latest in a string of blunders by the agency - was revealed in a report by the department of homeland security office of inspector general , which was released on thursday
concerns : former first lady barbara bush and former president bush , pictured watching basketball in march , did not have a working alarm at their houston home for more than a year during the time the alarm was out of service , the secret service assigned an employee to keep watch over the residence , according to the report , cbs news reported
some inside the agency contended that the agent was not sufficient to replace the alarm system , the washington post reported
despite the apparently relaxed security measures , there were no breaches at the property , where 90 - year - old bush and his wife barbara have lived for more than two decades
endorsement : in light of the reports , bush tweeted that he had ' great respect ' for the secret service property : their houston home , circle , was guarded by a secret service agent throughout the 15 months the report also raises concerns about the security at other former presidents ' homes , but has redacted their names
the new report , which was addressed to secret service director clancy , recommended that the agency reviews all security equipment and looks into how it keeps track of maintenance issues
