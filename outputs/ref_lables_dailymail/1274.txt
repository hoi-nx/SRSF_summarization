guardiola , the bayern munich coach , craves stability and chooses his clubs based on such assurances bayern munich 's dominance of the german domestic scene means guardiola may be tempted by a move this summer pellegrini 's position at man city is under threat as they fight for fourth place abramovich had been seduced by barcelona âs football , the 14 titles that the club won during guardiola âs four years in charge before he took off to new york with his family for a year - long sabbatical
chelsea âs inner circle believed they had finally landed their man and abramovich began recruiting players in anticipation of his arrival
guardiola was spooked , pulling out of the deal to become chelsea âs next manager the following day and decided instead to succeed jupp heynckes at bayern munich
chelsea owner abramovich believed he had landed guardiola in the summer of 2012 - but the then - barcelona coach was spooked by the russian 's habit of hiring and firing managers expecting guardiola to arrive , abramovich recruited the likes of eden hazard ( right ) for Â£ 32m guardiola opted to join bayern munich instead and has maintained their dominance in the bundesliga barcelona la liga 2008 - 09 , 2009 - 10 , 2010 - 11 copa del rey 2008 - 09 , 2011 - 12 supercopa de espana 2009 , 2010 , 2011 champions league 2008 - 09 , 2010 - 11 uefa super cup 2009 , 2011 fifa club world cup 2009 , 2011 bayern munich bundesliga 2013 - 14 german cup 2013 - 14 uefa super cup 2013 fifa club world cup 2013 this is precisely the scenario that is facing man city as they weigh up what on earth they are going to do with a coach who can no longer motivate his players

to fire pellegrini with six games left of the premier league season would be an admission by man city âs owners that anything other than the premier league trophy or the champions league warrants a dismissal
man city 's place in the premier league top four is under threat from liverpool and southampton man city slipped to a 4 - 2 loss to manchester united at old trafford on sunday , leaving them in fourth place pellegrini guided man city to the premier league trophy last season but they 've fallen well short this time that was chelsea âs game before mourinho returned , via spells at inter milan and real madrid , and they lost a lot of goodwill over it
after meekly surrendering their premier league title and being given another chasing by barcelona over two legs in the champions league , it is clear that man city have failed to make significant progress under pellegrini
