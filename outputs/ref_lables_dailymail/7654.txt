a remote iron age fort built by the picts as a look out post on top of a 20 - foot - high sea stack has been uncovered on the coast of scottish
archaeologists believe the stronghold , which would have been cut off from the land at high tide , may have been one of a number that lined the east coast of scottish
the fort , which was found on top of the dunnicaer sea stack close to stonehaven , aberdeenshire , appears to have been built with stone imported from elsewhere in the country
the small fort was discovered on top of dunnicaer sea stack ( shown above ) and would have given the inhabitants a strong defensive position , although resupplying the fort up the cliff faces would have been hard stones used to construct the walls were also engraved with pictish designs of fish and disks with broken spears through them
dr noble , an archaeologist at aberdeen university who led the excavation , said the site was so remote it could only be accessed by climbing up the cliff face with ropes
the habit of fighting naked , especially in the cold scottish climate , did n't harm the tribe 's reputation for ferocity
dr noble said it was possible the fort had been built there to help the pictish tribes living there dominate the sea in the area
the archaeologists discovered the fort on dunnicaer after following up reports that pictish stones had been found there when some local youths climbed up the sea stack
they also found post holes and the remains of a hearth that appears to have been within a house built inside the fort
they even found charcoal still in the stone fire place
mr noble said there may have been a settlement built on the land behind the fort , although as the picts largely built their homes from wood , it would be hard to find many remains
in order to reach the site , the team had to employ the services of professional rock climber duncan patterson , who climbed up the sea stack and put ropes in place
the archaeologists found the remains of a stone wall that would have formed part of the iron age fort some of the stones used to build the walls of the fort ( like the one above ) had rough pictish carvings on them the sea stack is only accessible at low tide and still requires a rock climb up the cliff face to reach the summit this stone hearth , with the black charcoal dust still evident at the bottom of the picture , was uncovered by the team
the dunnicaer sea stack sits just off the east coast of scottish close to stonehaven in aberdeenshire the researchers also found evidence for post holes ( above ) that were used in the fort ramparts during the dig archaeologists had to set up ropes to reach the sea stack after a professional climber scaled the rock face dunnicaer sea stack ( on the far left of the picture above ) is just quarter of a mile from dunnottar castle ( right )
