after experiencing major devastation and loss of life in the april 25 earthquake , nepalese was left with an unsavoury taste in its mouth after receiving packets of â beef masala â as part of the relief package from pakistan
since the majority - hindus country treats cows as sacred and there is a blanket ban on slaughtering the animal , the development has the potential to trigger diplomatic acrimony between the saarc ( saarc ) member countries
indian doctors at kathmandu âs hospital told mail today that packets of â beef masala â were sent by pakistan on tuesday as part of relief aid to the temblor survivors
these doctors â drawn from ram manohar lohia ( rml ) hospital , safdarjung hospital and all india institute of medical sciences ( aiims ) â are members of a 34 - member medical team sent to nepalese for treating the survivors
â when we reached the airport to collect the food items from pakistan , we found packets of ready - to - eat meals , including packets of â beef masala â
â we did not touch the pakistan aid , â dr singh said
he added : â pakistan has hurt nepalese âs religious sentiments by supplying the masala
shockingly , it did not care about the sensitivity of the matter

these pictures clearly show that the place of origin of these packets was nowshera cantt in pakistan
a top nepalese government official said : â the matter has been conveyed to prime minister sushil koirala and the intelligence chief
we are also starting an internal inquiry to verify the facts
if the report is correct , we will raise the matter at the diplomatic level with pakistan
indian , being our key partner , will also be informed of the developments
â tasneem aslam , spokesperson for pakistan âs ministry of foreign affairs , told mail today : â i am not aware of the issue â¦ i am not responsible for the dispatch
â nepalese soldiers stand next to wrecked buildings at durbar square a press note uploaded on the website of national disaster management authority ( ndma ) , pakistan ( http://www.ndma.gov.pk/new / ) , states : â ( the ) national disaster management authority has dispatched the second of two sorties of c - 130 aircrafts on april 28 in collaboration with pakistan army , ministry of foreign affairs and air force
â despite repeated attempts , the officials of the ndma could not be contacted
the consignment was supplied after receiving orders from pakistan âs ndma
according to hindus belief , eating beef is a religious offence since the cow is a sacred animal and treated on a par with one âs mother
in nepalese â for long the world âs only hindus state â the first royal order officially prohibiting cow slaughter stated that the punishments for the crime were death and confiscation of all property of the offender
the first civil code of nepalese , the muluki ain of 1854 , stated : â this kingdom is the only kingdom in the world where cows , women , and brahmins may not be killed
â it trumpeted nepalese as the â purest hindus kingdom â and simultaneously signaled to nepalese citizens that hindus religious creeds would be the law of the land
but an amendment in 1990 to the civil code made cow slaughter punishable by 12 years in prison
