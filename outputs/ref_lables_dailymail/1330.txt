keenan , 32 , was diagnosed with frostbite six weeks ago after his sister discovered his blackened toes and rushed him to hospital
it came after mr keenan had been living in the tent with his father keith , 62 , following their eviction from their four - bedroom home in skelmersdale , west lancashire borough council , last year when they fell behind with their repayments
mr keenan 's father was also diagnosed with severe health problems including malnourishment , scabies and dementia
mr keenan 's aunt , doyle , 54 , said : ' it 's absolutely outrageous what has happened to my brother and nephew
mr keenan 's toes , which eventually had to be amputated after he caught frostbite from living in a tent during winter after being evicted from his home ' when we saw keenan 's toes we were horrified , that this can happen to people in the 21st century is disgusting
' mr keenan has now been given temporary accommodation by west lancashire borough council and his father keith has been taken in by the stonham housing association
' a department for work and pensions spokesman said : ' mr keenan and his son have never been sanctioned and continue to be supported through benefits and by jobcentre staff
