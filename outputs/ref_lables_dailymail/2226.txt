a flaw in robots designed to perform surgery has been found that lets them be easily hacked , according to researchers
the experts were able to take control of a so - called telerobot during surgery by exploiting a simple programming trick
researchers at the university of washington studied the raven ii ( shown )
they found that robots designed for surgery could be ' easily ' hacked in to
this is because they are operated over public networks which allowed the researchers to access them and stop them working the research was carried out by scientists at the university of washington by toying with a product from their own university - the raven ii teleoperated robotical surgeon
but rather than take place over a secure private network , this takes place over public networks
â due to the open and uncontrollable nature of communication networks , it becomes easy for malicious entities to jam , disrupt , or take over the communication between a robot and a surgeon , â said the researchers
â while this experiment was performed in a controlled environment and not on the operating table ( stock image pictured ) , the researchers said it is clear more stringent security measures are needed during the experiment , an operator was asked to move blocks onto different pegs ( shown ) with the robot , but when the ' hackers ' took control , the task proved difficult - or impossible the researchers note that while their test applies only to raven ii , other surgical robots that use similar teleoperation were likely also at risk
â some of these attacks could have easily been prevented by using well - established and readily - available security mechanisms , including encryption and authentication , â the researchers note
we believe that presented concerns are not unique to teleoperated surgery , but are common to all teleoperated robots
