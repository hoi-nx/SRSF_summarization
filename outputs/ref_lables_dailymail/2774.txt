a builder who wolf - whistled a young woman only to be accused of sexual harassment said today she is a ' silly little girl ' who was ' lucky ' to have received the attention
ian merrett , 28 , is astonished that poppy smart , 23 , did not take it as a compliment , which he says has helped him ' snog loads of girls ' in the past
miss smart , who compared the wolf - whistling to racial discrimination , eventually filmed them and asked west mercia police to investigate alleged sexual harassment
mr ian merrett admits it was probably him whistling but called smart smart a ' silly little girl ' who should never have gone to the police
he said : ' i 'm sure if she walks past again and she is lucky she will get wolf - whistled again
i have wolf - whistled so many girls and got so many birds and snogged so many girls off the back of that , and never had a complaint before
miss smart , a marketing co-ordinator , contacted west mercia police over the regular taunts and the force went to the building site in worcester to warn the men about their conduct
she also filmed the whistles and handed the evidence to officers , who followed up poppy smart 's complaint but had not taken further action , the force said
mr ian merrett , who was branded ' disgraceful ' by the judge when he was convicted for the unprovoked train attack six years ago , said : ' it 's highly likely it was me who did that wolf - whistle
' wolf - whistling is part and parcel of working on a site , it 's complimenting a girl
' i only saw the back of her , i did n't even see her face and you can see in the video the wolf - whistle comes after she had passed the gate
' i did n't even see her face , and i would n't recognise her if i fell over her in the street , so i do n't know how that could possibly be sexual harassment
' mr ian merrett was 23 when he received a 12 - month prison sentence for an unprovoked attack on a malvern to birmingham train in 2009
' ms smart recorded one of the occasions she walked past the building site
there is no suggestion any of the men pictured in the mobile phone footage ( shown left and right ) were involved in the alleged wolf - whistling crime scene : the building yard in worcester where ms smart alleges workman wolf - whistled at her while on her way to work ' disrespectful ' : the 23 - year - old marketing co-ordinator ( pictured ) claimed builders at a construction site wolf - whistled at her every morning as she walked to work in worcester city centre earlier this week , miss smart condemned men who wolf - whistle , claiming it was demeaning and compared it to racism
she decided to take action after the workmen whistled and made disrespectful comments towards her as she walked past the building site on her way to work , making it unbearable for her on her daily commute to worcester city centre
' i eventually contacted the building company and the police when it got so bad i even considered changing my route to work but thought ' why should i do that ? ' ' i remember one of the builders , who was probably 18 or 19 , got right in my face and said ' morning love ' to me when he was stood with an older guy
' miss smart said she decided to film the workmen on her mobile phone and hand the footage to police because ' women should n't have to deal with it
