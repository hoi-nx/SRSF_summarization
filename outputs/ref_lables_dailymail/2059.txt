for inverness the latest chapter in their remarkable story featured not one , but two , plot - changing twists
one featured penalty celtic did n't get for 2 - 0 in which josh meekings handball should have also led to a sending off
the other the spot kick they did , followed by a red card for craig gordon
' i 've not seen it yet , but going by the reaction of the celtic players we got away with a penalty and a sending off and that was probably the turning point in the game , ' acknowledged caley manager john hughes after
inverness 's josh meekings appears to get away with a handball on the line in their win over celtic caley boss john hughes says the break , which could have meant a penalty and red card , was a turning point ' i 've not spoken to josh meekings
i have n't seen it - but going by the media it was definitely a hand ball
we look at the referee behind the line and all that and i know ronny will feel aggrieved - because i certainly would
' but it 's part and parcel of football and you need a wee bit of luck to beat celtic
' this was their biggest game of the season because they will go on and win the league and if they had beaten us today there was a good chance they would have gone on and won the scottish cup
' but when marley watkins was clipped by craig gordon and they were down to 10 men that was advantage inverness
' we were n't going to give celtic the ball back , they had to come and get it and we had to be patient
' celtic equalised with another free kick but it 's typical of inverness that we do n't do anything easy
' john hughes hauled raven , his scouse defender , from his backside as extra-time beckoned
caley players celebrate after upsetting celtic in a scottish cup semi-final 3 - 2 thriller celtic , depleted by games and absentees , were virtually on their knees after a relentless programme of midweek games
in last season 's inverness had been passive and unambitious prior to losing on penalties
' i tried to emphasise to the players they would never have a better time to go on and beat celtic , down to 10 men in the semi final of a cup
we needed to go for it , ' john hughes said
' before raven scored at the back post i was looking to change it
virgil van dijk ( centre ) fired celtic into an early lead with a superb free - kick in the 18th minute ' i did n't realise this is the first time the club have been in the final of the scottish cup and that 's a remarkable achievement given it was only formed 20 years ago
former falkirk captain and manager john hughes will take on his former club in the final ' i had a lot of great times at falkirk
vast swathes of hampden 's west stand were empty , a 12.15 kick - off for the benefit of broadcasters proving unhelpful there will be no ticket rows this time
' i hope this encourages the next generation to follow inverness , ' added john hughes
' in the peer groups it is still celtic and rangers they follow but i hope the next ones will want to support their local club
