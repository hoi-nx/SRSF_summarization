some people like to run with a dog as a companion , while others use a â smart â accessory to keep track of the progress they âve made
called joggobot ( shown ) it is designed to float in front of jogger when they run
the technology could allow it to track the speed and direction of the runner
and it could be used for other sports like cycling and rowing the research , by the royal melbourne institute of technology in australian , reported popular science , was presented at the computer-human interaction conference in seoul
in their paper , the researchers explained how they asked 13 joggers to run for an average of 26 minutes with a drone - specifically a quadcopter - as a companion
the goal was to see if a drone could motivate a runner to keep their pace up , and provide a companion that helped them stay fit
the drone was designed to fly 13ft ( four metres ) in front of the jogger at a height of 10ft ( three metres )
technology has been developed where a drone could lock onto a pattern on a runner âs shirt in order to track their speed and direction , although this has n't been implemented yet
however , technology has been developed where a drone could lock onto a pattern on a runner âs shirt in order to track their speed and direction ( shown ) there were some concerns from the runners , though ; occasionally the quadcopter would deviate from its path , leading them to question their safety
â the researchers think their study could help design flying robots that support joggers , and it could even be used for other sports as well such as cycling , cross-country skiing , rowing or even fun runs
