just another night for an atletico striker
this was mandzukic involved in bust - up after bust - up as he shed blood and sweat against great rivals real madrid at the vicente calderon
when atletico allowed costa to sign for chelsea on july 1 , 2014 , diego simeone may have fretted about losing his street fighter
just nine days later , he bought mandzukic from bayern munich , and the croatia international looked every bit as aggressive on tuesday night
blood pours from mandzukic 's face during the champions league quarter - final first leg in real madrid sergio ramos and atletico striker mandzukic continually clashed on tuesday night during the tie mandzukic proved he is a warrior with his performance against real madrid , just as costa was costa gives john terry , who is now his chelsea team - mate , a stern look during a champions league tie nobody elbowed their way to the top quite like costa â from the streets of brazil , to spain , to england â and the same went for mandzukic in the champions league quarter - final first leg
the 28 - year - old came to blows with defenders sergio ramos and dani carvajal â drawing blood after an elbow to the face from the former , while receiving a punch , and possibly a bite , from the latter
the long - ball tactic by atletico was not working , nor did mandzukic have enough pace to beat a defence boasting raphael varane
so much so that diego simeone â albeit riskily â substituted his partner , antoine griezmann , after 77 minutes instead of the man on thin ice
mandzukic clashed with dani carvajal during the quarter - final first leg and played rough all night mandzukic 's heat map , who had zero shots on or off target , and completed just 18 passes over 90 minutes mandzukic , despite failing to conjure a chance on tuesday night , is a natural striker
all that added to diego simeone feeling mandzukic was next in line at a forward - thinking club that have a history of great strikers which stretches back decades
sergio aguero signed for atletico in 2006 and scored 74 goals in 175 appearances in la liga in five years radamel falcao kept up an impressive 0.76 goals - to - game ratio during his time with atletico from 2011 jimmy floyd hasselbaink proved a great striker for atletico as the club produce top forwards continually no sooner had el nino left in 2007 for liverpool than el nino was replaced at vicente caldero mandzukic 's tattoo on his lower back was on show , and it read : ' what does n't kill you makes you stronger
and so when diego simeone lost costa to chelsea , he signed antoine griezmann and mandzukic
and if the latter 's showing against real madrid is anything to go by , then the atletico manager bought just about the closest thing he could find to replace the barclays premier league 's joint - top goalscorer
mandzukic and sergio ramos exchange words during a heated battle between the real madrid rivals on tuesday night mandzukic shows off his battle wounds during the match between the two great real madrid rivals
