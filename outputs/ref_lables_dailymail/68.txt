eight years ago , after his ac milan team had beaten liverpool to win the champions league final in athens , kaka knelt in the centre circle , spread his arms out wide , tilted his head back and turned his eyes to the skies in a gesture of worship and supplication
the brazilian superstar was wearing a vest on which he had printed the proud statement ' i belong to jesus '
please correct me if i 'm wrong but i ca n't remember anybody screaming that what kaka had done was a ' disgrace '
kaka showed off an ' i belong to jesus ' vest after ac milan 's champions league win against liverpool in 2007 the brazilian midfielder , who is deeply religious , was not mocked or ridiculed for the message on his clothes i ca n't remember public anger being mobilised against him or him being held up as a symbol of a creeping , sinister malaise in our society
i ca n't remember kaka being criticised for his faith
i do n't recall anybody saying they were inflicting their religion on the non-christians among the crowd
the idea that anybody might do that is absurd , right ? i mean , amid all the other things we have to worry and fret about , who could object to something as harmless as that ? and what about the high profile bible group that exists on golf 's pga tour and boasts major winners such as bubba watson and webb simpson among its members ? some members pause midway through their rounds to read from the new testament , meditate on holy scriptures and pray
two - time masters champion bubba watson is part of a bible group on the pga tour webb simpson , pictured in action at the rbc heritage , is another well known christian golfer nobody sees fit to complain about that , surely
whether you follow the same beliefs or not , why would anybody object to sportsmen finding some common ground in religion ? it 's the same in the nfl
just part of players ' rituals
and let 's not forget our own premier league
daniel sturridge , the liverpool forward , talks openly about giving the glory for his deeds to god
what exactly is noteworthy about two men praying on the concourse at anfield during liverpool 's fa cup tie with blackburn rovers last month ? why is it that when another group of supporters did the same thing at a west ham match recently , their actions were met with similar consternation ? you probably remember the video footage of that incident at upton park
a breathless man shouting ' what is this ' as he filmed the men praying as if they were engaged in an act of desecration
dodd took this photograph of asif bodi and abubakar bhula praying at anfield last month let 's be honest about this because there 's a simple answer to the question of what unites these reactions : if you 're christian , it 's ok to pray at a football ground
if you 're muslims , it 's not
that 's the truth , is n't it ? that 's what we 're avoiding
expressions of muslims devotion are described as ' extraordinary scenes '
er , well , what 's wrong with that ? some clubs already have prayer rooms , actually
religion at a sporting event becomes a topic only when it is someone else 's religion
the verse went like this : ' you do n't count the dead when god 's on your side
' failure to end kevin pietersen debate is hurting england it 's a sorry state of affairs when england 's inability to close out the first test against the west indies is seen through the prism of another failure to quell speculation about the return of kevin pietersen
former nlf star aaron hernandez ( second from right ) has been sentenced to life in prison without parole favourite food at a sporting venue ? the eccles cakes they used to serve at anfield take some beating but the garlic fries they serve at dodger stadium in los angeles went to the top of my list this week
