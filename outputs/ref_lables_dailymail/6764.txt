zero - hours worker ? university john-jo enjoys a cigar labour 's efforts to fight off accusations of hypocrisy on zero - hours contracts were in chaos last night
party chiefs had scrambled to shore up support for ed after it emerged that dozens of labour councils and mps employ staff on the controversial contracts , which he has pledged to ban
on wednesday , mr ed vowed to end the â epidemic â of zero - hours contracts â and blasted the tories for failing to protect ordinary workers
but he was accused of â total hypocrisy â on the issue after it emerged 68 of his mps â including shadow chancellor ed balls â had employed staff on that basis in the past two years
labour councils , including mr ed âs own authority in doncaster , have also issued 22,000 of the contracts
as the revelations emerged , party chiefs engineered a letter , signed by 100 workers and employers from â all walks of life â , that was also designed as a riposte to a letter signed by dozens of business leaders who backed the tories this week
but the move backfired spectacularly last night after it emerged the signatories included a benefit fraudster , a boss who has used zero - hours workers , affluent students and a string of union and party activists
they include : benefits fraudster one of the signatories identified herself as someone who had â worked on [ a ] zero - hours contract â , but labour removed her name yesterday after it was revealed she had been convicted of benefit fraud in 2012
boss : fashion designer wayne hemingway , whose firm employed intern on zero - hours contracts , and harrods fan tunji offeyi , from tooting , south london , who had treated himself to some perfume she was caught after she applied for leave to remain in uk on the basis of her â marriage â
in july 2012 she was given a two - year suspended jail sentence and 150 - hour community work order after she pleaded guilty to immigration and fraud charges along with her â husband â who had been working at hmrc as a security officer
a labour spokesman said last night : â more than 6,000 people have now signed our letter from all walks of life across the country
â cigar - smoking students other signatories included 21 - year - old manchester university students john-jo and somerville
facebook pages of the pair â who said they were working zero - hours contracts â included photographs of them smoking cigars whilst dressed in black tie
black tie : somerville , aged 19 , pictured at a university ball mr john-jo , who is studying maths , is registered on the electoral roll at his mother 's Â£ 1million house which is set in woodland near leatherhead , surrey
his mother deirdre , 55 , yesterday said he was â just a kid â who â knows nothing about politics â but had signed the letter after he was asked to by a fellow university student â he vaguely knows â
mr somerville , who is in his final year studying economics , is registered to vote at his mother 's house , in an affluent area of belfast
mr john-jo was also photographed at a party in front of a sign that said â drugz room â , but mrs deirdre pierce said it was just a â joke â sign that was a reference to the us television programme breaking bad
she said : â john-jo has never done drugs in his life
â mr somerville did not respond to a request to comment
mr wayne hemingway , co-founder of the fashion label red or dead , was one of the few business figures willing to put their name to labour âs letter
mr wayne hemingway said the policy had now changed , adding : â it is in the past â we have changed
party chiefs scrambled to shore up support for ed after it emerged dozens of labour councils and mps employ staff on zero - hour contracts his facebook page showed him posing with a harrods shopping bag in december last year
others listed as workers on zero - hours contracts included stacey booth , an administration assistant at leeds council , who is a convenor for the gmb union
labour luvvies the letter claimed to be from people from â all walks of life â but among the signatories were labour councillors and a former mp
