scientists at a polish company that produce body armour systems are working to put a ' magic liquid ' that can harden on impact in their products
the liquid is called shear-thickening fluid ( stf ) , and instantly hardens upon impact at any temperature
in a ' liquid armour ' this provides protection from penetration by high - speed projectiles and additionally dispersing energy over a larger area
instead stf hardens upon impact at any temperature , providing protection from penetration by high - speed projectiles and additionally dispersing energy over a larger area
' this viscosity increases thanks to the subordination of the particles in the liquid structure , therefore they form a barrier against an external penetrating factor , ' said karolina olszewska , who performed tests on the stf for moratex
' we have succeeded , ' said deputy director for research at the moratex institute , struszczyk
' the liquid has been used to create lightweight flexible sheets , which can be placed inside the body armour when hit by a high - speed projectile , a wide area of the stf hardens instantly , causing the usually massive energy to be dispersed away from the wearer 's internal organs
