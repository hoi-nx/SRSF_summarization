there at least 200 billion earth - like planets in our galaxy â and now nasa officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them
' i believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years , ' ellen stofan , chief scientist for nasa , said
' i believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years , ' said ellen stofan , chief scientist for nasa , ( pictured ) at a washington panel discussion ' we know where to look , we know how to look , and in most cases we have the technology
' jeffery newmark , interim director of heliophysics at the agency , added : ' it 's definitely not an if , it 's a when
green , director of planetary science at nasa , noted that a recent study of the mars atmosphere found 50 per cent of the planet 's northern hemisphere once had oceans a mile deep
scientists using the hubble recently provided powerful evidence that jupiter 's ganymede ( pictured ) has a saltwater , sub-surface ocean , likely sandwiched between two layers of ice the same study found that water had been present on the red planet for up to 1.2 billion year
nasa associate administrator john grunsfeld said he is excited about seeing what form life beyond earth may take
now astronomers claim that such exoplanets actually rotate around their stars , and spin at such a speed that they exhibit a day - night cycle similar to earth â increasing the chance of finding alien life
planets with potential oceans could have a climate that is much more similar to earth 's than previously expected , ' said jã©rã©my leconte , a postdoctoral fellow at the canadian institute for theoretical astrophysics ( cita ) at the university of toronto
' ' once we get beyond mars , which formed from the same stuff as earth , the likelihood that life is similar to what we find on this planet is very low , ' he said
jupiter 's moon europa and saturn 's satellite enceladus are also thought to have an ocean of liquid water beneath their surface in contact with mineral - rich rock
nasa next mars rover , scheduled to launch in 2020 , will search for signs of past life and bring samples for a possible return to earth for analysis
the space agency is planning a mission to europa , which may launch as early as 2022 , to find out whether the moon is habitable nasa also hopes to land astronauts on mars in the 2030s , which ellen stofan says is crucial key to the search for mars life
' so i have a bias that it 's eventually going to take humans on the surface of mars â field geologists , astrobiologists , chemists â actually out there looking for that good evidence of life that we can bring back to earth for all the scientists to argue about
