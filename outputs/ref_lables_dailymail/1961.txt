the distinctive patterns on butterfly wings really do help protect the insects by mimicking the eyes of predators
while scientists have long suspected the role played by eye - spots found on the wings of many butterflies were an example of mimicry , it has never been clearly tested
recently researchers suggested that the eye spots may simply scare away predators by confusing them or overloading their senses
owl butterflies ( left ) have eye spots that mimic those of pigmy owls ( right ) to scare off predators like great tits
while scientists have long suspected the role played by eye - spots found on the wings of many butterflies were an example of mimicry , it has never been clearly tested but a new piece of research by biologists at jyv達造skyl達造 university in finland claims to have settled the debate
they say that eye - spots on the wings of butterflies do in fact mimic the eyes of larger and more threatening species , like owls
the team were finally able to test the theory by showing great tits pictures of owl butterflies that had been digitally altered , and watching their reaction
images where the eye spots had been removed from the butterfly wings did not stop the birds from snatching a mealworm snack below the picture
and the researchers found the butterfly eye spots may even be more terrifying to the great tits than the real animal they are mimicking
when shown pictures of a pygmy owl with its eyes open the tits reacted strongly and kept away , but their reaction was not as strong as with the butterfly markings
writing in the journal proceedings of the royal society b , dr johanna mappes and her colleagues said : ' in this study , the presumed model - owl eyes - and the mimic eyespots appeared to elicit similar reactions both in terms of response type - interest versus aversion - and its intensity - startle versus flee - adding support to the eye - mimicry hypothesis
the researchers flashed up digitally manipulated images of an owls face and the owl butterfly to see how great tits reacted
in some images they removed the owls eyes ( far left ) or removed the eye spots ( far right ) eye spots are a common feature on butterfly wings , like the bycyclus anyana butterfly above , but scientists have been divided over whether they were intended to mimic other predators or simply confuse predators ' predator - prey interactions in nature often involve dynamic encounters between the partners , and eye spots are more likely to appear suddenly in front of the predator
images of owl eyes caused the birds to be startled , flee and in some cases give off alarm calls
