hillary clinton is laughing in the face of the accepted retirement age - currently 65 both in the uk and the u.s. - by aiming to become the leader of the free world just months before her 70th birthday
if the former u.s. secretary of state reaches her goal and is sworn in as the 44th president of the united states in january 2017 , then she will not only be the country 's first female president but also the second oldest , behind ronald reagan , ever to open the doors to the white house
clinton certainly seems to be relishing the life experience that her advancing years have given her
age is nothing but a number : hillary clinton who has launched her campaign to be u.s. president ( pictured above , speaking at the women in the world conference on april 23 ) will be 69 when she takes office if successful celebrating her advancing years : a black - and - white photograph showing hillary clinton as a toddler just after the end of the wwii has been posted on her twitter feed a black - and - white image posted on her twitter account this weekend showed a very young clinton pointing at the camera , accompanied by the phrase ' hillary clinton 's counting on you ' , echoing lord kitchener 's famous first world war slogan : ' your country needs you '
it appears the presidential candidate is very much celebrating her age : the image itself would have been shot while clinton was a toddler just after the end of the wwii
elsewhere , clinton 's newfound grandmother status - her daughter chelsea gave birth to a daughter , charlotte , with husband marc mezvinsky in september last year - has seen her able to relate to a whole new section of the voting public
doting ... but could hillary clinton 's recent status as a grandmother be a powerful tool in her bid to win votes ? last week , the politician , currently 67 , posted the hashtag # grandmothersknowbest to her twitter feed the hashtag # grandmothersknowbest used on hillary clinton 's twitter page has attracted other grandmothers to post their own posts using it in a recent twitter posting promoting vaccines for children , clinton ended the appeal with the hashtag # grandmothersknowbest , which has since seen a stream of grannies from across the globe tweeting their own posts using the hashtag
clinton is by no means the only high - profile woman refusing to change gear as she gets older ; there are a raft of successful female figures continuing to put their foot on the gas and power their way into the last quarter of their lives
