north korean officials have traditionally scoured the countryside for pretty teenagers , sometimes as young as 13 - years - old , who are then taken to pyongyang to work as dancers , singers or servants for the country 's leaders
the three - year absence of the ' pleasure troupe ' was due to a complete overhaul of the north korean establishment by kim jong-un following his father 's death
