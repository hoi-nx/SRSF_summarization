but witnesses say that cameron did not himself use a gun â despite his reputation as a skilled marksman
it took place near chipping norton , the oxfordshire town which has given its name to the â chipping norton set â of high - profile local residents from the world of politics , media and showbusiness such as mr cameron and jeremy clarkson
last night , the man who served mr cameron the cocktail said other people on what he described as a â country walk â had no idea there would be a vip guest
brown , master distiller at the london â artisanal â gin company sipsmith , said : â no one but the landowner knew the prime minister would be joining us
â he fought shy of describing the event as a shoot , but added : â i can say with utter certainty that mr cameron did not handle a gun
