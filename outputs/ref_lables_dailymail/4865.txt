it was just after breakfast , only a few short hours after the rampant champagne - fuelled celebrations into the early morning had ended , but carlo ancelotti knew exactly what he was saying
still in real âs five - star tivoli lisboa hotel , the â fat boy with the bowl full of emilian tortellini â ( his own words , not mine ) told an italian journalist friend : â yes we âve made history by winning la decima â but this is real
and of course carlo ancelotti was speaking after real âs two principal teams , sworn enemies , had contested the champions league and he had lifted the â cup with the big ears â for the fifth time as player or coach
carlo ancelotti is starting to feel the strain after recent poor results at real carlo ancelotti was a hero after guiding real to their 10th european cup triumph last year gareth bale celebrates after scoring real 's second goal in extra time during the lisbon final cristiano ronaldo scored his team 's fourth late in extra time to secure the famous victory august 19 - real 1 - 1 atletico spanish supercup , first leg august 22 - atletico 1 - 0 real spanish supercup , second leg september 13 - real 1 - 2 atletico la liga january 7 - atletico 2 - 0 real copa del rey last 16 , first leg january 15 - real 2 - 2 atletico copa del rey last 16 , second leg february 7 - atletico 4 - 0 real la liga not that winning liberated him from the sad truth of his statement
worse is the fact that he is now a black smudge on real âs pristine - white history , having already lost to atletico â the club which was unable to register a single win over real between 1999 and 2013 â four times in a season
perhaps worst of all , the european champions â utterly humiliating 4 - 0 defeat at the ferocious calderon stadium last time these two met , just over two months ago , meant atletico had won all three home â derbis â by a 7 - 0 aggregate this term
in fact , during each of the seven defeats in 11 derbies carlo ancelotti has had to soak up as real manager against simeone âs bruising buccaneers , his team has nât scored once
none of which make carlo ancelotti an idiot
not because if he loses the imminent champions league quarter - final against spanish âs champions carlo ancelotti fears the sack
cristiano ronaldo sits dejected during real 's 4 - 0 la liga defeat to atletico back in february mario mandzukic ( left ) celebrates with fernando torres after scoring in atletico 's 4 - 0 win in february like norman stanley fletcher in porridge , there are some penalties in his chosen profession which â carlo ancelotti â ( wee charlie ) treats as an occupational hazard
a rueful carlo ancelotti walks past the european cup after ac milan surrendered a three - goal lead against liverpool but carlo ancelotti made up for it by beating liverpool in 2007 and gaining revenge for that defeat two years before ac milan european cup 2002 - 03 , 2006 - 07 uefa super cup 2003 , 2007 fifa club world cup 2007 serie a 2003 - 04 coppa italia 2002 - 03 supercoppa italiana 2004 chelsea premier league 2009 - 10 fa cup 2009 - 10 fa community shield 2009 paris saint-germain ligue 1 2012 - 13 real european cup 2013 - 14 uefa super cup 2014 fifa club world cup 2014 copa del rey 2013 - 14 since then , it has been as if simeone and co have soaked up all the anger , all the humiliation , all the impotent rage they felt when cristiano ronaldo venerated his penalty goal ( to kill an already dead match ) for 4 - 1 with his â i âm actually the incredible hulk â celebration
in the drama of that night , and amidst the history of real âs tenth title , it 's often forgotten that when rafael varane kicked the ball at atletico âs argentinian manager with two minutes left in extra-time , simeone chased him onto the pitch then had to be both restrained and persuaded to leave the playing surface before being sent off
but , trust me , that was one of the spurs chafing at simeone âs skin all summer until the spanish supercup second leg when rafael varane was pressed , exposed for awareness and sharpness and mario mandzukic bagged the goal which started atletico âs winning run against real this season
atletico manager simeone rushes on to confront real defender rafael varane in the final simeone also had a go at referee bjorn kuipers as tempers boiled over during the last few minutes atletico were unable to hang on to the lead given to them by diego godin during the lisbon final he was one such , as was simeone , plus luis enrique , guardiola ( and max allegri at a far lower level ) at four of the other eight champions league quarter - finalists
and that âs something else , other than carlo ancelotti âs future employment with real , which is at stake this week
from the moment when elite footballers , and then run - of - the - mill players , began to earn money per season which made them absolutely financially secure for life , the worth of the coach who is only authoritarian was at an end
