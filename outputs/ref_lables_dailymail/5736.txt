mayweather vs pacquiao tickets are the hottest property in town
only 500 were on general sale with the rest distributed by the fighters , promoters , television networks showtime and hbo and the mgm grand
one fan , ade , 34 , from brighton was lucky enough to get hold of a ticket when they were released last week and here he tells us his story and his hopes for the fight
one of my friends , toby , was convinced the fight was going to happen and we needed to book it before it was announced and the prices sky - rocketed
christmas and new year came and went and the fight was not announced
ade ( second right ) and friends at gatwick before jetting off to vegas ade and his friends booked their trip to vegas back in december in anticipation for the big fight the email confirmation that showed ade had bought a ticket for the biggest fight but eventually it was announced late one friday in february and we could not believe it was finally going to happen
even though we had our flights and hotel booked we were not sure if we were going to be able to get tickets as we thought that hardly any would be released and they would be sold to the big companies for the most amount of money
but all four of us had been to vegas before and we always said that if we were to go again then it would have to be for a big event or fight like this , so we thought it was worth going even if we did n't get a ticket
one of my friends in the group had been in vegas for both hatton vs mayweather and hatton vs pacquiao
then it was announced last week that a limited number of tickets would go on sale at 8pm on thursday night
we all agreed to try and get tickets
ade and friends are staying at the cosmopolitan on the vegas strip overlooking the famous fountain in front of the bellagio hotel i put in for four tickets
i 'm not even sure what it is insurance for ! ade and the boys stopped off at the famous wild card gym in hollywood where pacquiao trained for the fight ade and his friends are planning a trip to the hollywood hills in the days before the big fight the group plan to head back to vegas via death valley and the nevada desert then it was all confirmed and i thought it was all too easy , and had i really managed to get a ticket ? or was it a scam and had i been turned over for just over Â£ 5,000 ? but then an email came through from ticketmaster and i could not believe i had managed to get one
the group plan a big night out on friday on the famous vegas strip the mgm grand pool party at the mgm grand is on the agenda for saturday we flew out from gatwick on wednesday and we 're staying at the cosmopolitan hotel just down the vegas from the mgm grand
and then it is fight night ! carl froch beat george groves in front of 80,000 fans at wembely stadium ade had good seats for the carl froch vs george groves fight at wembley in may last year mark wright and james argent were two of the ' celebrities ' at the carl froch vs george groves fight - but a-listers are expected to be in attendance at the mgm grand on saturday night i have been to big events in the past , i was at carl froch vs george groves at wembley and we had good seats for that
ade will be one of 16,000 fans who will pack into the mgm garden arena on saturday night mayweather will face pacquiao in the richest fight in boxing history but already this trip promises to be amazing , the atmosphere in vegas will be amazing ahead of the fight , everyone will be buzzing
in terms of the fight , i would like to see pacquiao win
mayweather is flash and that is liked in america , but around the world the whole money thing is not liked as much
