it 's a common misconception that anyone can swan into their local fast food store and pick up a job serving food , flipping burgers or even mopping up spilled soft drinks
however , as daily mail australia recently discovered , it 's just not that easy , with potential workers required to pass detailed psychological questionnaires before they can secure an interview
kfc 's quiz contains 30 questions , which mostly ask applicants to rank their response from ' strongly agree ' to ' strongly disagree ' to questions which to some , might not have an obvious answer
kfc 's human resources boss , phipps , claimed the test was specially designed to rank the thousands of applications which apply for a job with the company
' in terms of personality or what have you , any personality fits in well at our company and then we teach them skills , but it 's a question of their values around work ethics that will help us , ' he said
we take a norm sample of what success would look like in the output of the questions , and essentially what it does for us is it gives us a better than normal chance of predicting success around work attributes like honesty , work ethic and whether someone is a team player , ' mr phipps said mr phipps said that the test was not anchored to a personality type , but rather different work styles he estimated that only one third of applicants make it through to the interview process , with employee referrals being ' our number one method of recruitment ' - and was unable to estimate how many were hired by the end of the recruitment procedures
' kfc 's quiz also includes a few situational questions such as : ' your manager just told you that you need to work this weekend
what would you do ? ' he estimated that only one third of applicants make it through to the interview process , with employee referrals being ' our number one method of recruitment ' kfc 's quiz also includes a few situational questions , however these are nowhere near as difficult as the scenario questions in mcdonald 's 23 - question multiple choice quiz the fast food giant has a vigorous recruitment procedure in which applicants must pass a 23 question multiple choice quiz online before their application can be submitted contrastingly , some of the scenario questions in mcdonald 's 23 - question multiple choice quiz are far more complicated
while the company says that the questionnaire is designed to ' help mcdonald 's understand the position in our team that suits you best ' , daily mail australia has been told that applicants can easily fail the test
what do you do ? ' questions range from those any job seeker would expect to be asked during an interview , to multiple choice scenarios when asked why they have decided to apply for a job at mcdonaldns s , applicants have the option of selecting ' it 'll make my parents happy ' or ' it 's easy to get a job at macca 's ' more convoluted questions are also included in what appears to be an attempt to determine an applicant 's personality answers range from ' make a meal you are very familiar with ' , ' grab a cookbook or download a new recipe to follow ' or ' be creative and experiment with whatever you find in the kitchen '
