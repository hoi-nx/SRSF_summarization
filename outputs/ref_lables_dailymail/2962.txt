the first dramatic footage of the hatton garden jewellery heist shows how the gang returned twice in three days to continue their audacious robbery - as it is revealed police may have to pay out millions in compensation for ignoring the alarm
the six - strong gang dressed in high - vis jackets were captured on cctv working throughout thursday night having successfully broken into the basement of the building in the heart of london âs jewellery district
shockingly , the footage reveals they returned again on saturday - spending another eight hours cleaning out the jewels and cash left there for safekeeping
scotland yard tonight refused to confirm to mailonline whether they had seen the footage before it was handed to them by the mirror , but it is likely to place even more pressure on police already under fire for not responding to the alarm
each member of the gang is wearing builder âs overalls and high - visibility vests
another , wearing a builder âs hat , has been referred to as mr strong and is seen carrying steel supports that may have been used for the diamond - tipped drill that police say cut through into the vault
at 7.52am on good friday , according to the footage , members of the gang can be seen again
on sunday , at around 6am , the gem thieves can be seen dragging heavy wheelie bins and several black bags back up the stairs
a source told the mirror : ' this was clearly the work of a professional gang who planned this job down to every last detail
' the footage came to light as scotland yard was forced to admit it did not respond to a burglar alarm triggered during the raid - which could make it liable for million in compensation
that failure to investigate immediately left the gang free to work uninterrupted over easter and escape with gems and cash worth â millions and millions â from 70 deposit boxes - as can clearly be seen in the video
last night , jewellers who rent boxes with the hatton garden safe deposit ltd security firm accused the police of incompetence and threatened to sue them and the owners of the deposit company
one jeweller , a 63 - year - old named michael , said : â as far as i âm concerned the police have got a lot to answer for
â a gang of criminals broke into the hatton garden safe deposit ltd over the easter bank holiday weekend another jeweller called ryan , who runs a business with his father in hatton garden , added : â it is just unbelievable that they could ignore a call from an alarm company
â a scotland yard spokesman said : â a grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required
