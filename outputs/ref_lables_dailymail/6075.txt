genealogists have made an error in compiling the family tree of clinton and she is in fact linked to a poor welsh mining family , an expert claimed as she kicks off her bid to enter the white house , clinton could claim that her path to the presidency began some 160 years ago in the little - known welsh parish of ystradyfodwg â if she can pronounce it , that is
for while the us democrat has previously spoken of her british ancestry , a definitive family tree has revealed her links to a poor mining community in the welsh valleys
ystradyfodwg , pronounced ust - rady - vod - ug , was the home of mrs clinton 's great grandmother - a woman who showed a determination , similar to that of the former first lady , to struggle through poverty and eventually emigrate to us with her family
in fact mrs clinton 's steely resolve to get to the white house and make history as the first female president , can be seen in the actions of her female ancestors , who even defied social conventions through the years
us genealogy expert smolenyak has traced mrs clinton âs roots to a mining family from ystradyfodwg , a small community in south welsh
mrs clinton 's great - grandmother griffiths was born in merthyr tydfil in the welsh valleys , and from an early age supported her widowed mother
in a bid for a better life the family made the lengthy journey via ellis island to scranton in pennsylvania , another mining district where they would continue their trade in the early 1880s
hannah jones was one of just four children out of 14 born who survived - an indication of the poverty her traditional mining family lived in
mrs clinton 's grandparents hannah jones ( left ) and hugh rodham eloped to wed in binghampton , new york , and are pictured with their granddaughter , former first lady clinton it was in us that hannah jones - who was to become mrs clinton 's grandmother - met hugh rodham , part of the hugh rodham family who had travelled to us two years earlier from northumberland
hannah jones ' family hailed from a poor mining district which is now part of rhondda in welsh mrs clinton 's family were from ystradyfodwg , close to neath and merthyr tydfil , and now part of rhondda from the family histories of the william jones and rodham families , it appears the pair may have been forced to elope because the rodhams were unlikely to have approved of their son marrying a woman from such a poor family when they had managed to become moderately wealthy after emigrating to us
â mrs clinton announced she was running for president last week and toured the whitney brothers factory if clinton is successful she could make history as the first female president of the us ' if he had nât been bold enough to wander across the state line to marry his sweetheart , clinton âs father would nât have born , erasing her from the scene
' hannah jones rodham , frequently described by mrs clinton as a ' strong willed woman ' gave birth to mrs clinton 's father hugh e rodham in 1911 and died in 1952 when mrs clinton was just five
1850s - griffiths born in merthyr tydfil in welsh to poor family
1882 - 1883 - hannah jones was born , one of 14 children - of which only four survived
1902 - hannah jones eloped to binghampton to marry hugh s rodham
the account appears to be the first definitive family tree for mrs clinton which traces her welsh roots to an area of the valleys
ms smolenyak claimed she discovered a key flaw in how genealogists previously compiled mrs clinton 's family tree in misidentifying hannah jones
she identified a woman born shortly after her family arrived in the us in the 1880s , hannah jones , who then went on to marry hugh rodham in 1902
