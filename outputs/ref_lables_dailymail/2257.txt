this incredible video shows the stomach - churning moment a man performed surgery on himself at the top of the mountain using items from his first aid kit
the russian man , who was filming a documentary in snow - covered mountains , found himself injured and unable to continue the ascent
it is believed the man , whose nickname is ' che ' , was struck by a huge falling icicle , causing a collection of blood under the skin called a haemotoma
first , he decides to use snow as an anaesthetic , and rubs it on his leg to numb the injury
in the original film , which has been edited by mailonline , the man is seen making a deep incision into his leg with a scalpel , and blood is seen flowing out
he reaches into the cut with his fingers and scoops out the coagulated blood â almost black in colour â which had formed into a clot
the man decided to perform a procedure to remove the blood clot himself , rubbing snow on his leg as an anaesthetic he used items in his first aid kit which included a gas lamp , a scalpel , surgical string , a needle holder and a curved needle as well as a hydrogen peroxide antiseptic â we consider that a tiny wound , we will sew it up now , â he said after wiping the cut clean with a tissue
using some surgical string , a needle holder and a curved needle , he then sews up the wound , creating large , rustic - looking stitches
wrapping a bandage around the wound , he stamps his leg on the snow to indicate he can walk again
he cuts a deep incision in his own leg using a scalpel , which he sterilised by heating it with a gas lamp using his own hands he scoops out blood which has coagulated and formed a clot , before sewing the wound up with surgical string incredibly , ten days later the seams were removed and the wound healed completely , leaving barely any scar two weeks later , he is seen casually sitting on an armchair in the snow , having completely recovered
incredibly , the seams were removed in ten days and the wound healed completely
the camera pans in on his leg and , amazingly , he was left with barely any scar
