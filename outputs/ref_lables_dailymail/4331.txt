it is one of the most dangerous sports in the world and one in every 15 bull rides ends in an injury of some sort
but that is n't enough to stop hundreds of child riders , some as young as seven , from taking the hot seat each year
among them is lance , 10 , from fort worth in texas , who has proved so successful that he was crowned world champion in his age group last year
bouncing around : a young bull rider takes on a bullock ( steer ) at a rodeo in fort worth , texas but each time he gets on a bullock , a castrated male , he risks life and limb , and has already been trampled on several times
that , however , is not enough to stop his father tj , himself a former bull rider , from entering lance , his older brother joe , 15 , and his sister jayden , seven , into competitions all over the us
' it âs about taking chances and these kids , that âs what they âre doing , ' he explains in an interview with channel 4 's unreported world
' bull riding is a multi-billion dollar industry in the us and events staged by the pbr , the professional bull riders ' association , are watched by up to half a billion people around the world each year
ouch ! most bull riders are speedily thrown off - a good result is eight seconds hitting the deck : an estimated one in 15 bull rides across all age groups ends in injury of some sort starting small : the youngest children hone their skills on sheep before graduating to calves but as the stakes get higher , pressure to breed bulls that are more athletic , more vicious and bigger than ever before has increased - including in the junior division
for cody custer , a former bull riding world champion , it is becoming too dangerous
' you take a young teenage boy and put him on a bull that âs got a massive pedigree , ' he explains
' another young bull - rider , 16 - year - old trey , who has been knocked out several times by oversized bulls , agrees
all three children started when they were barely more than toddlers , honing their skills on sheep in a sport known colloquially as ' mutton throwing '
not happy : even the calves , such as the one pictured , can pack a hefty punch if enraged moving on : the next step is to ride bullocks ( castrated young males ) before culminating in big bulls tough task : bullocks , who are often approaching the size of a full - grown female , are no easy ride now seven , jayden , the youngest , has graduated onto calves while lance takes on bullocks and joe wrangles bulls
' just think if these bulls are bucking this hard and are this rank right now , what are they going to be like in eight years when he âs there ? ' if it continues the way it is , the sport of rodeo the way it is , it âll no longer be a bull riding , it will be just a bull bucking competition
