on friday night i âll be wearing bath âs no 6 shirt for the second time in a aviva premiership game
the change of position was a decision my head coach , mike ford , made after the european champions cup quarter - final against leinster
he phoned me a day after that game to discuss playing me in the back row to maximize my on - field minutes in our run home , to what i call â the big dance â : that âs the finals
he thought no 6 would suit the way we are trying to play as a team and also suit my personal strengths and i agreed
burgess is set to start at blindside flanker for the second time for bath on friday night bath head coach mike ford believes burgess will make a bigger impact on the game from the backrow burgess is still adapting to the 15 - man code with his ball - carrying technique coming under scrutiny in league , for nine years , my game has been about taking short balls and looking for holes
at bath , that is what our forwards do , so moving into the pack makes sense and allows me more time on the field , which is what i need to keep improving my union brain
we âve got , hopefully , five weeks left in the aviva premiership and if all goes well i will stay at six , but i do nât want to be pigeon - holed
despite enjoying playing at flanker , i have not given up on a centre spot in my future in the game
burgess began his union career in the centre but is set to finish the season as a back rower i find myself on the ball more , but i was disappointed by a few dropped balls
when i was in midfield , i thought that being a back was tougher and now i am in the pack , i realise that the forwards are the ones putting in the hard yards , but i âm sure if i go back into the backline , i âll change my mind again ! it was a great experience to spend time with the england squad
burgess makes a strong carry during bath 's european champions cup clash with montpellier in december it was fantastic for me to rub shoulders with those players and pick up a few tips
i did nât go in there with any mind - set other than to be myself and enjoy spending time with players i would nât normally get to sit down and have a brew with
stuart ( lancaster ) wants me to do well in the game and wants me to be around the top players in that environment as much as possible , which is great
burgess was recently linked with move back to the nrl with manly where his brother luke ( pictured ) plays that âs why i âm here ; to be around that sort of atmosphere and to test myself on the best stage
burgess is a canterbury ambassador and face of the since 1904 fashion collection
