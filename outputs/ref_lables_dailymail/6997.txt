whitington , 63 , from ashford , kent , was made so sick by obesity - related type 2 diabetes that he had been told he may need a leg amputated it is a toe - curling moment that many have faced : the supermarket tantrum
and whitington , pouting and shouting , performs it with aplomb
despite the wobbly bottom lip and huffy , crossed arms , whitington happens to be a 63 - year - old father of four grown - up children
and in this bizarre episode of role - reversal , it is his sons , anthony and ian , who are gently â some might say valiantly â trying to broaden his palate
for years , whitington was ill , made so sick by obesity - related type 2 diabetes that he had been told he may need a leg amputated
and whitington resisted with a passion
anthony and ian have helped their father shed six stone and now , two years after that tantrum in the supermarket , whitington is a man transformed
he loves to cycle , never eats take - aways and counts kale and couscous among his favourite foods
most remarkably , doctors say he is no longer diabetic â and he is off medication
the brothers have a lifelong passion for film â ian , 35 , is a full - time film - maker â so they decided to document their battle to inspire others to do the same
anthony , 37 , says : ' he was n't old , but dad had given up on himself
' luckily for whitington , his sons are just as stubborn as he used to be , and their plan has been a huge success
' the difference in dad is incredible and he is proof that it 's never too late , ' says anthony , a father - of - four from ashford , kent
' physically , he 's gone from having to use crutches to get around to taking on 100 - mile cycle challenges
before his sons intervened , his exercise routine was non-existent and he tipped the scales at 20 stone
anthony , a corporate financial adviser , says : ' he had an old - fashioned mentality that cooking was a woman 's domain , so he 'd opt for something convenient and quick
' whitington 's weight problems were worrying enough , but there was the added complication of his type 2 diabetes , which affects more than 2.7 million britons
whitington was first diagnosed with diabetes in 2003
' dad had an ulcer that was giving him a lot of discomfort , ' anthony says
' he now loves to cycle , never eats take - aways and counts kale and couscous among his favourite foods anthony and ian knew drastic action was needed
' dad obviously had weight issues which we 'd talked about in the past , but we had busy lives so did n't really push it as far as we could have done , ' says anthony
' we wanted him to find a social life and hobby other than work and food â we 've done everything from fishing to t'ai chi , ' anthony says
' in february last year , the sons took their father on a ten - day cycling trip to spain
whitington also tried out a sky - dive simulator ( he 's planning to do one for real later this year ) , and tackled rock - climbing
' step three was transforming whitington into a diabetes champion , so he could convince others to turn their lives around
now a trimmer 14 stone , whitington has taken part in the prudential 100 - mile cycle race , spoken at medical conferences throughout europe and stopped his diabetes in its tracks
whitington believes the doctors had been ' too nice for too long ' , and wishes they had been tougher on him
' fixing whitington 's diabetes has brought the family closer , says anthony
