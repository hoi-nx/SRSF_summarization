mcveigh considered the bombing of the oklahoma city federal building 20 years ago a failure because the structure was still standing after the blast that killed 168 people
mcveigh also viewed himself as a ' paul revere - type messenger ' and even suggested his defense team should receive $ 800,000 from the government , according an archive of documents donated by the convicted bomber 's lead attorney
the estimated one million pages of paper documents from jones now fill 550 file cabinet - sized boxes at the briscoe center at the university of texas
although the blast killed 168 , including 19 children , the examiner concluded that ' in mcveigh 's mind , he believed that he had definitely screwed up because he left the building still standing '
mcveigh was executed by injection in 2001 at age 33
co-conspirator terry nichols was convicted separately and sentenced to life in prison
even as he stood accused of orchestrating what until the sept. 11 attacks was considered the deadliest act of terrorism on us soil , mcveigh appeared to be driven by profit and thought his attorneys should be entitled to ' $ 800,000 ( after fees , taxes )
not for me , but to try to make up for what my family has been put thru , as well as to shell out some ` bonuses ' to my legal team. , ' he wrote in one note to his defense team included in the archive
' mcveigh was identified as a suspect in the bombing of the building , sentenced to death and executed in 2001 medical assistants run from the blast site after being told another bomb had been found on april 19 , 1995 this is one of over 500 boxes of attorney / client documents that were donated by attorney jones an oklahoma city police car decorated with kind words and a small us flag sits near the blast area carleton , executive director of the museum , said jones was n't comfortable putting the material at an oklahoma institution ' because the feelings were so raw ' and his fears the collection could be perceived as ' almost a shrine ' to the convicted bomber
' besides the handwritten notes from mcveigh , the defense case files include reports of investigations , news stories , photos , recordings and trial exhibits
in 2001 , jones published a book suggesting mcveigh and nichols could not have been alone in carrying out the bombing , mcveigh denied any knowledge of another collaborator , or presence of an accomplice who became known in the case as john doe no. 2
but the polygraph examiner , tim domgard , wrote there were ' indications of deception ' in mcveigh 's responses related to questions about others involved
mcveigh provided a first - person account of the bombing during two days of interviews with jones in september 1995

' ' i determined that the best way would be to continue on as the paul revere type messenger instead of the john brown type revolutionary , that you could accomplish maybe two in one , ' mcveigh said
he is serving a life sentence for his role a view from the plaza overlooking the oklahoma city national memorial site from may of 2001 ( file photo ) the entrance to the oklahoma city national memorial is pictured at dusk in oklahoma city in april of 2015 the files have numerous references to media coverage and mcveigh 's sense that jones was too cozy with reporters and tv producers
