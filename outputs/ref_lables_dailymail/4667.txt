england will not be playing in the under 19 european championships this summer after losing 2 - 1 to france in their decisive final qualifier
having beaten denmark and azerbaijan in their opening elite round qualifiers , the young lions had to beat france in saint-lo to advance to july 's finals in greece but goals from sehrou guirassy and gnaly cornet put the hosts in command and a late response from fulham 's patrick roberts was n't enough to rescue sean o'driscoll 's team
patrick roberts was on target for england 's young lions against france but it was n't enough to qualify boosted by the return of tottenham hotspur midfielder harry winks from suspension , sean o'driscoll reverted to the line - up that had beaten denmark 3 - 2 late last week
but england required a further two goals because of their inferior goal difference in the group and there was to be no late drama as their euro 2015 ambitions faded
