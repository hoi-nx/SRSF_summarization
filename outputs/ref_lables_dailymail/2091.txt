starbucks is embroiled in fresh controversy over its tax affairs after it was accused of using a little - known uk company to avoid paying taxes across european
for the first time yesterday , details emerged about the uk company at the heart of the probe , which is focusing on sweetheart tax deals between starbucks and the dutch government
probe : starbucks ran its european division - including the uk - through the dutch , but it paid just Â£ 1.9million in tax to the dutch government , from a reported Â£ 300million profit starbucks ran its european business , including its booming uk division , through the dutch where it paid almost no tax on its profits
by registering its intellectual property â such as its brand and logo â in a uk company called alki lp , it was able to pay hefty sums from its dutch division into uk
its dutch division paid just Â£ 1.9million of tax , despite reporting profits of Â£ 300million â a meagre tax rate of less than 1per cent
schemes used by the company include buying its coffee beans in switzerland and selling them at a 20per cent mark - up to the dutch , where they are then roasted before being sold on again to uk
revealed : it is now claimed the company , which has previously been in the spotlight for its tax practices , may have used a uk company to put hefty sums from its dutch branch into the uk between 1998 and 2012 the company paid just Â£ 8.6million in corporation tax in uk , despite racking up combined sales of more than Â£ 3billion here
a uk - registered holding business called alki lp was set up to house the branding of the business
compliance : a starbucks spokesman said the company complies ' with all relevant tax rules , laws , and oecd guidelines ' but because of the very limited details available , it is impossible to identify how much money the arm received â or whether it paid any tax in the uk
but he was confounded only weeks later when starbucks reported its first ever uk profit of Â£ 1.1million â despite sales being a bumper Â£ 300million
a starbucks spokesman said : â we comply with all relevant tax rules , laws , and oecd guidelines and we continue to cooperate with the european commission âs state aid investigation in the dutch
