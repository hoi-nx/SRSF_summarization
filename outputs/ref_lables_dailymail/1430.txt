the prime minister issued a plea to ukip and lib dems voters to lend their support to the tory to prevent ' miliband , propped up by sturgeon demanding ever more borrowing and more taxes '
' vote for ukip or the lib dems and you take miliband and sturgeon a step closer to downing street â and our government , economy and country a step closer to chaos
' so if you are considering voting ukip or lib dems , i urge you to think of the chaos of a weak miliband , propped up by sturgeon demanding ever more borrowing and more taxes
only a conservative vote in your local constituency will keep miliband and the snp out and secure uk 's future

mr cameron said : ' the snp is a party that does n't want to come to westminster to contribute to a government , it wants to come to westminster to break up our country
