celebrities and dietitians have been promoting back - to - basic diets and warning us off processed foods for years - and the trend is now taking hold in the pet world
three - and - a - half - year - old black labrador labrador baylie swapped sweet treats and processed dog food for a diet of free range raw meat , offal and bones in his quest to lose weight
his owners , margaret and patrick evans from leeds , say he 's now ' a different dog ' after losing a stone and a half in eight weeks through the doggy diet - the weight of four chihuahuas
but he 's a much more lean machine , right , after starting his new weight loss programme the plan was devised by vicky marshall , who runs a natural dog food company and realised that none of her 5,000 customers ' dogs have weight problems
she worked out labrador baylie 's weight and calculated special portions of carefully chosen lean meats in order for him to shed the pounds
' their digestive system , which is very different to the human digestive system , is more than able to handle raw meat , offal and bones
loving life : margaret and patrick evans say labrador baylie is ' a different dog ' since losing a stone and a half on a new doggy diet of raw food
' we avoided beef and lamb and suggested lean raw meat like free range chicken , wild rabbit and turkey
' our treats are pure air - dried liver and dogs do n't need very much to feel like they 've had a treat
we gave labrador baylie a beef knuckle bone to chew on all day and he did n't need anything else to eat
' labrador baylie 's owners believe his life - long weight problem stemmed from them giving him sweet treats to reward good behaviour at puppy training school
' standing tall : labrador baylie struggled with a hip condition common in labradors and poor mobility worsened his weight problems
but losing weight has made him much more mobile after spotting an advert for the trial of a new diet for dogs on facebook , margaret signed labrador baylie up for the new regime - the lucky dog weight loss plan
it meant - just like a human trying to fight the flab - swapping his usual processed food and sweet treats for low fat meats
