no need to tell padraig harrington what a difference a year makes
in short , here âs a three - time major champion who âs got his mojo back
three time major winner padraig harrington has rediscovered his form ahead of the masters the irishman practices during the pro-am before the start of the open in texas the small miracles that occur in this game
a month ago padraig harrington had fallen outside the world âs top 300 when he accepted an invitation to play in the honda classic in sunshine state
he ended up winning his first tournament in america since the 2008 uspga
â last year ? yeah i was devastated , there âs no other word for it , â he admits
â i thought all along i âd do something that would get me to the masters
â it was the first major championship this century for which he âd failed to qualify and he ended up watching it sulking on the sofa at home
â padraig harrington had falled out of the world 's top 300 before accepting an invitation to the honda classic the 43 - year - old ended up winning the tournament after a play - off victory against daniel berger he looked for all the world like he would miss out this year as well until that dramatic play - off victory in the sunshine state
the spoils of success included an invitation to augusta
â padraig harrington was ' devastated ' after failing to qualify for last year 's masters following poor results the dunliner kisses the famous claret jug after winning the 2008 open at royal birkdale padraig harrington 's recent upturn in form began after winning the indonesia open at the end of last year two of his wins together were the open and uspga in 2008
so , as the last player to go to augusta looking for a third straight major victory , how does he rate rory mcilroy âs chances ? â the good thing is that expectation is already at saturation point , so i don â t think that will be an issue , â he said
i think the main issue for rory mcilroy is that so many other players are playing so well
rory mcilroy âs big thing was that he âd hit a driver everywhere while most players would hit three wood
but dustin johnson does the same thing â and he âs 20 yards longer than rory mcilroy
â having said that , rory mcilroy has shown when he has his a game he wins
â padraig harrington , of course , knows all about this mental side of the game , having read every volume on the subject
rory mcilroy heads to augusta looking to complete a grand slam of winning all four majors the world no 1 faces competition from dustin johnson and his mammoth drives last summer he started working with steve peters , the renowned psychologist who helped britain âs cycling team to glory and is now working with liverpool football club and england
padraig harrington was one of the 200,000 people who bought steve peters âs book â the chimp paradox
â he has really helped me out , â said padraig harrington
