my introduction to ferme de montagne did not take place at this boutique hotel âs enviable ski - in , ski - out location in the france resort of les gets â it happened at the bar at the dorchester in london
ferme de montagne proprietors suzanne and her architect husband henry suggested we meet there for cocktails as they were in the capital , pre-winter season , â on business â
a waiter mixes things up at the cocktail bar at ferme de montagne in france suzanne explained : â it exposes them to a five - star environment where exacting standards of service and composure are required at front of house while also learning to cope with the rigours of a slick and intensive behind - the - scenes regime
â and , of course , a fit and happy team that spends a generous amount of time on the mountain will only benefit the clients of her boutique , chalet - style hotel where interaction with guests is integral to the ferme de montagne experience
i finally got to meet the team on site after an easy , 75 - minute transfer by car to les gets from geneva airport
les gets is well placed in the giant portes du soleil area , which has 400 miles of groomed pistes , linked by 14 ski stations across the france / swiss border
ferme de montagne proprietors ensure their staff spend a mandatory week working and gaining experience at the dorchester in mayfair ( pictured ) before the start of each new season it takes a long time to get to know your way around vast ski areas like this so i was delighted to join ferme de montagne âs ski host , rory , who has no need of a piste map
due to a long - running relationship with the local ecole de ski francais , ferme de montagne guests always have high - quality , english - speaking ski instructors for their lessons
hosts such as rory are also trusted to ski with guests , make sure they do nât get lost , point out the rich variety of peaks â such as the magnificent dents du midi cluster from the top of fornet above avoriaz â and crucially , as far as this epicurean skier is concerned , recommend great on - mountain restaurants
