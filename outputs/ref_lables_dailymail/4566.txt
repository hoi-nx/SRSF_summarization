bikram yoga improves mindfulness , flexibility , strength , muscle tone and general fitness , advocates boast
but a new study has warned the practise , which involves performing 26 poses , can raise a person 's body temperature and heart rate to dangerous levels
a typical session lasts for 90 minutes and is performed in a room heated to 40 Â° c ( 105 â° f ) , with 40 per cent humidity
all regularly practised bikram yoga and as such were familiar with the 26 standard poses
before taking part in a session each volunteer swallowed a core body temperature sensor , and was given a heart - rate monitor to wear during the class
scientists advise that the standard 90 - minute class is reduced to just an hour to reduce risks a male participant recorded the highest core temperature of 40 â° c ( 104 Â° f ) , while seven volunteers ' temperature reached 39 Â° c ( 103 â° f ) , the scientists said
they noted that while none of their volunteers exhibited signs or symptoms of heat intolerance , body temperatures such as these can pose a danger for some people
they said the risk for heat - related illness , such as heat stroke , increases at 40 Â° c ( 104 â° f )
dr quandt said while the excessive perspiration experienced by people doing bikram yoga is often cited as a benefit because it releases toxins , the results of the new study show this sweating was insufficient to cool down the body
she advises three ways to improve the safety of bikram yoga classes - duration , temperature and hydration
furthermore , hydration lies at the heart of the controversy surrounding bikram yoga , she said
' exercise leaders must actively encourage hydration , particularly when classes take place in extreme environments like those seen in bikram yoga classes
' he said bikram yoga teachers must be familiar with essential science principles surrounding exercise , including a clear understanding of the physiology of the thermo - regulation
one male study volunteer recorded a core temperature of 40 â° c ( 104 Â° f ) what are the signs of heat exhaustion ? what are the symptoms of heat stroke ? suspected heat stroke should always be treated as a medical emergency , health experts warn , advising an ambulance is called in extreme cases
the researchers concluded : ' exercising in hot and humid environments - whether inside a studio while practising bikram yoga , or outside running during the warm months - can place participants at risk for heat - related illness , especially if those individuals do not adequately hydrate before , during and after exercise
' ' given the popularity of bikram yoga and its proven benefits , it is likely here to stay , ' said dr bryant
