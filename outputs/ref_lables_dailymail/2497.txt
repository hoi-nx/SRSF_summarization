in the heart of yellowstone , a supervolcano releases around 45,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide each day
but the magma chamber lying directly beneath its surface is not considered large enough to produce such levels , so researchers have been searching for an alternative source for years
now , by tracking seismic waves , a team of geophysicists has discovered an enormous secondary chamber deeper underground that 's so large its partly - molten rock could fill the grand canyon 11 times over
a magma chamber beneath the surface is not considered large enough to produce these levels and now researchers have found the source in a secondary magma chamber deeper underground the yellowstone supervolcano is one of the largest active continental silicic volcanic fields in the world
previous research found a relatively small magma chamber , known as the upper - crustal magma reservoir , directly beneath the surface in 2013 that measures 2,500 cubic miles ( 10,420 cubic km )
the remaining 2 per cent is molten rock and is too deep to directly cause an eruption
it sits 12 to 28 miles ( 19 to 45km ) beneath the supervolcano and measures 11,035 cubic miles ( 46,000 cubic km )
previous research found a relatively small magma chamber , known as the upper - crustal magma reservoir , directly beneath the surface in 2013 that measures 2,500 cubic miles ( 10,420 cubic km )
the researchers said in their paper : ' the yellowstone magmatic system from the mantle plume to the upper crust ' , published in the journal science , that the reservoir contains around 98 per cent hot rock
it sits 12 to 28 miles ( 19 to 45km ) beneath the supervolcano and measures 11,035 cubic miles ( 46,000 cubic km )
to put this into perspective , the grand canyon in arizona has a volume of 1,000 cubic miles ( 4,168 cubic km ) meaning the molten rock in the upper chamber would fill it two - and - a - half times , and the rock from the larger lower chamber would fill it 11 times

the latest chamber sits 12 to 28 miles ( 19 to 45km ) beneath the surface and measures 11,035 cubic miles ( 46,000 cubic km ) ( illustrated ) to discover the large chamber ( shown in yellow ) , the university of utah tracked seismic waves from 5,000 earthquakes
the smaller magma chamber is shown in red beneath the supervolcano 's caldera researchers said the upper magma chamber is believed to have been the source of three yellowstone eruptions 2 million , 1.2 million and 640,000 years ago
the paper added that the upper magma chamber is believed to have been the source of three yellowstone eruptions 2 million , 1.2 million and 640,000 years ago
researchers said the upper magma chamber is believed to have been the source of three yellowstone eruptions 2 million , 1.2 million and 640,000 years ago yellowstone spans the midwestern us states of wyoming , idaho and montana ( pictured ) if yellowstone did erupt , estimates from national geographic suggest its immediate effects would kill around 87,000 instantly
' the magma chamber and reservoir are not getting any bigger than they have been , it 's just that we can see them better now using new techniques , ' added co-author jamie farrell , a post-doctoral researcher at the university of utah
for comparison , the grand canyon in arizona ( pictured ) has a volume of 1,000 cubic miles ( 4,168 cubic km ) meaning the molten rock in the upper chamber of yellowstone would fill it two - and - a - half times , and the rock from the larger lower chamber would fill it 11 times if yellowstone ( pictured ) erupted , estimates suggest its immediate effects would kill around 87,000 instantly
