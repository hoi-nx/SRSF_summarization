by 2030 up to 170 million hectares of forest - equivalent to the combined size of germany , france , spain and portugal - could be lost , conservationists have warned
research by wildlife charity the wwf identified 11 ' deforestation fronts ' where 80 per cent of projected global forest losses by 2030 could occur
by 2030 up to 170 million hectares ( 420 million acres ) of forest - equivalent to the combined size of germany , france , spain and portugal - could be lost in just 11 hotspots , including the amazon ( shown ) and eastern australia , conservationists have warned the areas are the amazon , the atlantic forest and gran chaco , and the cerrado in south america , the choco in central america , the congo basin , east africa , eastern australia , the greater mekong in south east asia , borneo , new guinea and sumatra
the fronts , which are at sustained and increased risk of deforestation , are home to indigenous communities that depend them for their livelihoods and endangered species such as orangutans and tigers , the wwf said

the fronts , which are at sustained and increased risk of deforestation , are home to indigenous communities that depend them for their livelihoods and endangered species such as orangutans and tigers , the wwf said
80 per cent of projected losses will occur in just these 11 areas rod taylor , director of the wwf 's global forest programme , said : ' imagine a forest stretching across germany , france , spain and portugal wiped out in just 20 years
' wwf analysis shows that more than 230 million hectares ( 570 million acres ) of forest could vanish by 2050 if no action is taken , with the organisation warning that forest loss must be reduced to near zero by 2020 to avoid dangerous climate change and economic losses
they are being lost to expanding agriculture ( example of a rainforest cleared in the amazon shown ) , including livestock farming , palm oil plantations and soy production , as well as small - scale farmers , the wwf 's latest living forests report warned unsustainable logging and wood fuel collection ( shown in australia ) is also causing forest degradation - while mining , construction of hydroelectric dams and other projects cause roads to be built that open new areas of forest to settlers and agriculture , said the wwf wwf - uk 's chief adviser of forests , will ashley-cantello , said : ' deforestation needs to stop if we are to reverse biodiversity loss and combat climate change - which , if unchecked , will affect our quality of life
