burnley boss dyche insists his team will not resort to diving and cheating in their battle against relegation
dyche says he has been shocked by the amount of simulation he has witnessed during burnley 's first season back in the premier league
dyche is insistent that his burnley players wo n't ever dive or cheat to prosper under him but while dyche accepts his players are naive on such matters , he insists that is the way he likes it and will not be asking them to follow suit , regardless of their situation
burnley are second from bottom with just six games remaining but are only two points from a safe position and have earned many plaudits for their battling displays
i believe the team play in the correct manner
the burnley have established themselves as one of the hardest working teams in the premier league ' at this level we have been naive at times , in the right way
' one prominent manager i am not going to name said to me , ' you are being naive , you should get your players to move with the times '
' with relegation a real possibility , burnley are fighting for their lives at the bottom of the division dyche feels while football gets into a moral tangle over certain high - profile , one - off incidents , this issue of repeated cheating is all too often overlooked
he said : ' it would evaporate out of the game within two , three or four weeks because managers who have some amazing players will say , ' we ca n't be losing you for three games '
dyche was told by another manager to ' get with the times ' and that his team was too naive ' it 's only because i think morally we talk to our kids about fairness and playing the right way , and yet , in one of the most powerful leagues in the world , there are people dropping everywhere
