sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders are more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than others , a recent study claimed the implication is that the potential for committing a sex offence may be written in our genes - but while this is an interesting finding , it is unlikely to help prevent sex crimes or catch offenders
the brothers of men convicted of sex offences are five times more likely than average to commit similar crimes , a study found
johnny savile ( left ) is accused of abusing seven women , while jimmy savile ( right ) raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals during a 24 year reign of abuse the research analysed dna from 21,566 men convicted of sex offences in sweden between 1973 and 2009
it found that sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders were four to five times more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than men in the general population
genetic factors were also found to be stronger for child molestation ( 46 per cent ) than for adult rape ( 19 per cent )
while the study makes an estimate of the heritability of sexual offending , it can not of course pinpoint the genes that might be involved
dr mairi levitt says that genetic material from both parents is passed on , but genetic traits are developed through interaction between genes and the environment putting a figure on the genetic basis for behaviour seems to suggest that these factors are inherited directly by the children from their parents
this is according to a recent study which found that experiences , such as divorce and sexual abuse , could affect gene expressions that control a person 's predisposition to delinquency
' separating nature and nurture may be useful as a model but does not really make sense because research has demonstrated that gene development is affected by the environment
some may welcome the science and see this as confirmation that sex offenders are biologically different from other people and could perhaps be prevented from offending
only about 2.5 per cent of brothers or sons of convicted sex offenders were also convicted so the preventative programmes aimed at at - risk families would mainly target the innocent
so what then might this mean in practical terms ? the discovery could perhaps one day lead to the identification of specific genotypes but could or should this affect the way we deal with sex offenders ? a genotype has already been identified that increases the risk of violent behaviour in specific environments
sex offenders , particularly where children are involved , are probably even more stigmatised than other violent criminals so perhaps a genetic defence would not work in their favour
any research that helps us to understand problem behaviours is to be welcomed , but the headline figure â a genetic link in 40 per cent of cases â does not tell us that sex offenders ' ca n't help it ' or are different from ' normal ' people
