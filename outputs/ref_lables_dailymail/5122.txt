the women 's institute has been told it must pay the royal albert hall thousands of pounds if it wants to serve the cakes to 5,000 women attending centenary celebrations at the venue in june it âs been a gargantuan undertaking , even by the formidable standards of the women 's institute
for days on end , two of its members slaved away baking enough cakes to feed 5,000 women attending the women 's institute âs centenary celebrations at the royal albert hall in june
but the women 's institute has now been told it must pay the venue thousands of pounds to serve the cakes
â it âs outrageous , â said one women 's institute stalwart , who did not wish to be named
â claire hope , 35 , a member of her local women 's institute group in dorking , surrey , added : â it seems rather petty
â the idea was that the 5,000 members attending the national federation of the women 's institute âs agm , which this year celebrates the anniversary , would find a box of centenary cake on their seats
even though the fruitcake has been home - made by two women 's institute star bakers , some of the ingredients were donated by companies including dairy crest , diageo and whitworths , and their contribution is acknowledged on the cake boxes
under the hall âs booking conditions , extra fees are liable if products of commercial sponsors are promoted inside the building
â the royal albert hall declined to confirm the amount of the extra cake charge - but under the hall âs booking conditions , extra fees are liable if products of commercial sponsors are promoted inside the building baking the 44 women 's institute fruitcakes used more than five stone of butter , several hundred eggs and enough rum to paralyse a fleet of pirate ships
but a spokeswoman said : â the hall charges a fee for sponsors â commercial products to be promoted within the building
