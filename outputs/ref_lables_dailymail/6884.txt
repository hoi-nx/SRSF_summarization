simeone is made for england
for that night in st etienne - almost the last time an england team truly thrilled a global audience at the world cup , even if they did so in defeat â is remembered by simeone for more than his notorious role in beckham âs sending off , which left england down to ten men for most of the match
' that game was the best international match i 've played in , ' said simeone , remembering the world cup knock out match , which argentina won on penalties after a 2 - 2 draw
simeone is hoping to lead atletico to second successive champions league final england 's beckham kicks out at former midfielder midfielder simeone during the 1998 world cup ' i love playing against the english , â simeone added
â and as simeone stalked out on to the pitch at the end of the champions league final last year , in full confrontational mode , seeking out raphael varane , who had kicked the ball at the atletico bench in celebration of real madrid âs 4 - 1 win , it was hard to not to get the image of the warrior footballer out of your head
he had come within two minutes of winning that champions league final on a wage bill which was famously less than qpr âs
real madrid were beaten in the spanish super cup over two legs , then knocked out of the copa del rey , also over two legs , by atletico , beaten at the bernebeu and then , most spectacularly , beaten 4 - 0 at the vicente calderon last february
beckham looks towards the referee during the world cup clash between england and argentina the former england man was shown a red card for lashing out at simeone during the knock - out match last week the teams drew 0 - 0 in the first leg of their champions league quarter - final ; on wednesday they resume hostilities at the bernebeu
real madrid may be marginal favourites but under simeone , atletico have gone from the side that could never beat real madrid â they had nât won for 14 years against them â to the side that ( almost ) never loses to them
in his native argentina they always assumed he would be a manager , such was his dominance of the national team as a captain
the atleti boss confronts raphael varane during real madrid 's 4 - 1 champions league final win last year simeone speaks to referee bjorn kuipers during the showpiece final at the estadio da luz he revived his reputation somewhat at catania and racing but when he was given the atletico job in 2011 , it seemed more like the old boys â network at work â he was an iconic player there in the 1990s â than the result of a meticulous recruitment process scouring the best tactical minds in europe of course , the success has been unrelenting , with a trophy every year : the europa league in 2012 ; the copa del rey in 2013 , beating mourinho âs real madrid in the final ; and the extraordinary feat of wining la liga ahead of barcelona and real last season
this year he is comfortably - placed for another champions league spot but the title is out of the question
the 44 - year - old got the better of chelsea boss mourinho during his side 's 3 - 1 victory at stamford bridge he makes a habit of out - witting europe âs best minds
mourinho , too , back in that 2013 cup final and then again last season , when atletico stunned chelsea at stamford bridge
and yet there is something very english about simeone âs style
it âs not just the frequent use of 4 - 4 - 2 , the wide men , the directness of their play at time and the physicality - it âs their fighting spirit which characterises them and which might be stamped : â made in england
â it âs why simeone so related to shearer and ince and their performance in that extraordinary 2 - 2 draw in st etienne
the argentine manager is understandably adored by the atletico faithful despite his team 's combative style the atletico players circle around simeone as they prepare for the champions league clash against real madrid he âs not about to move , having just signed a new contract with atletico until 2020 and we may never see him in the premier league
when man city choose a new manager , it will be someone who can help to bring tiki taka football to the club , from academy to the first team , under the direction of txiki begiristain
perhaps he âs just become too english for the new england atletico and real madrid drew 0 - 0 in the first leg of their champions league quarter - final simeone is tossed in the air by his players as they celebrate their spanish league title last season
