a bizarre new dinosaur with bat - like wings has been discovered by a farmer in china and is now helping to shed new light on the evolution of flight
palaeontologists in china say the impeccably preserved fossil belongs to a small dinosaur thought to have lived 160 million years ago
the strange - looking creature had small stiff feathers on its body and long finger - like bones extending from each wrist that were covered in a membrane like a bat âs wing
the dinosaur may have been able to glide and even flap scientists believe the dinosaur , which they have named yi qi , meaning â strange wing â , may have glided or even flown through the air
the dinosaur from the late jurassic period , around 145 million years ago , is named after the country where it was discovered , and diego suã¡rez , who discovered the bones
these dinosaurs are thought to have been the ancestors of modern birds
but unlike modern birds , yi qi was found to have a strange extra bone extending backwards from its wrist , rather like an entirely separate group of animals that learned to fly - the bats
the yi qi fossil was discovered by a local farmer in mutoudeng , in qinglong county , hebei province in china
there are three main groups of flying vertebrates - the birds , which evolved from dinosaurs , pterosaurs that were flying reptiles that existed alongside the dinosarus , and the bats , which are mammals that evolved after the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago
most winged avian dinosaurs to be discovered so far all have wing structures that are similar to those of modern birds
however , yi qi , which is pronounced ' ee chee ' , appears to be a weird hybrid between a dinosaur and a bat
the strange long bone extending from the wrist was highly unusual this close up of the skull of yi qi , which weighed just 13 ounces ( 380g ) , show oval like feathers near the head analysis by professor xu and his colleagues , which is published in the journal nature , suggest that it is likely the dinosaur glided , perhaps like modern flying squirrels
the dinosaur lacked the strong muscle attachments to the forelimb bones and its bone structure would have interfered with the flapping and rotating movements needed during powered flight
if it did flap its wings it would probably have only been able to fly over short distances
but professor xu said : ' we thought giving this animal a name meaning " strange wing " was appropriate , because no other bird or dinosaur has a wing of the same kind ' we do nât know if yi qi was flapping , or gliding , or both , but it definitely evolved a wing that is unique in the context of the transition from dinosaurs to birds
professor zheng xiaoting , from linyi university in shandong who also took part in the study , said : ' yi qi lived in the jurassic , so it was a pioneer in the evolution of flight on the line to birds
the fossil of yi qi was discovered by a farmer working his fields in mutoudeng in qinglong county in china the diagrams above show how the wing of yi ( a ) compares to other winged tetrapods ( b and c ) and the wing of a bat ( d ) , the wing of a pigeon ( e ) , the wing of a pterosaur ( f ) and the wing of a japanese flying squirrel ( g ) he said : â as for gliding , if yi âs styliform element helped to support a membranous aerofoil , it can be used to reconstruct the planform of the wing , as xu and colleagues have done
â that is clearly the case in the authors â reconstruction of yi qi , but an aerofoil that was swept back more , if anatomically possible , might have mitigated this problem
