common creams used to treat athlete 's foot and eczema could undo the damage of multiple sclerosis , scientists claim
scientists found that the anti-fungal agent miconazole and the steroid clobetasol both restored movement to mice paralysed by a rodent version of multiple sclerosis ( ms )
in laboratory tests , they prompted inactive mouse and human stem cells to regenerate myelin , the protective insulation - like coating around nerve fibres that is destroyed by the disease
common creams used to treat athlete 's foot and eczema could cure multiple sclerosis , scientists claim dr robert miller , of the us team from case western reserve university who carried out the study , said the results marked a significant breakthrough
' the drugs that we identified are able to enhance the regenerative capacity of stem cells in the adult nervous system
' this truly represents a paradigm shift in how we think about restoring function to multiple sclerosis patients
lead scientist professor tesar , from case western reserve school of medicine , said : ' we appreciate that some patients or their families feel they can not wait for the development of specific approved medications , but off - label use of the current forms of these drugs is more likely to increase other health concerns than alleviate multiple sclerosis symptoms
' ms is a condition of the central nervous system , where the coating around nerve fibres ( called myelin ) is damaged , causing a range of symptoms
worldwide , it is estimated that more than 2.5 million people have ms. source : multiple sclerosis trust ms occurs when the immune system attacks myelin , thereby disrupting the passage of nerve signals
one new approach is to focus on special stem cells called oligodendrocyte progenitor cells ( opcs ) that mature into myelin - producing cells
while other scientists have looked at ways of replacing lost stem cells using transplantation techniques , the case western reserve university team set out to find a way of stimulating existing , but inactive , opcs
after screening 727 potential drug candidates , they identified two - miconazole and clobetasol - that coaxed the opcs to form oligodendrocytes and repair nerve fibres stripped of myelin
' we know that there are stem cells throughout the adult nervous system that are capable of repairing the damage caused by multiple sclerosis , but until now , we had no way to direct them to act , ' said prof tesar
' our approach was to find drugs that could catalyse the body 's own stem cells to replace the cells lost in multiple sclerosis
