derby hero jermain defoe was lost for words as he tried to describe the emotion of scoring his stunning winner against newcastle admitting he even had to question that it was even happening
the sunderland hitman smashed home a missile of a left - footed volley in sunday 's 1 - 0 win at the stadium of light to ease the sunderland three points clear of the barclays premier league relegation zone and send wearside into ecstasy
jermain defoe ( centre ) connects beautifully with a left - footed volley to fire sunderland into a 1 - 0 lead newcastle goalkeeper krul was unable to do anything about jermain defoe 's 45th - minute strike the 32 - year - old said : ' it just happened so quickly , but as soon as it left my foot , i knew
' the feeling , it 's hard to even find words to describe that sort of feeling
the 32 - year - old watches on as the strike - his third for sunderland - flies over krul in the magpies goal the striker wheels away in celebration of his brilliant strike just before the half - time whistle was blown ' even from when i was young and you do finishing , i have always practised on my left foot because in games , sometimes you get chances and sometimes it comes on your left foot , so i have always practised over the years from when i was very young so i feel comfortable that when a chance comes , i can not even think about it , i can just hit it like i did
' sunderland might have increased their lead as the game opened up with the visitors launching a desperate late attempt to salvage a point , but in the end , a single goal was enough to leave jermain defoe marvelling at his first experience of the wear-tyne rivalry
jermain defoe seemed overcome with emotion as he fell to the turf shortly after putting sunderland into a 1 - 0 lead the 32 - year - old frontman looked close to tears as both teams left the stadium of light pitch at half - time ' but even travelling to the stadium and seeing all the fans in the streets , seeing all the kids with their shirts on , it was just crazy
that process will continue next weekend when alan pardew 's crystal palace head for the stadium of light-pardew , of course , was newcastle boss for the first four of those five defeats - and jermain defoe is hoping he and his team - mates can use their derby success as a springboard
