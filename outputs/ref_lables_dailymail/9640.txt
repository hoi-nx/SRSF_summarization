robin , now 73 , was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes by chance in 1999 , aged 58 robin ellis shot to fame in the seventies as the original dashing hero ross poldark
in fact , even now at the age of 73 robin has retained the physique that helped make him famous - as he showed in a cameo in the bbc remake
yet even though he has been slim all his life - 12st , which is perfect for his 6ft 1Â½in frame - robin has type 2 diabetes , a condition that many of us associate with being overweight
in type 2 diabetes , the body 's cells fail to react to insulin , causing blood sugar levels to soar which , if uncontrolled , can lead to blindness , kidney damage , heart disease and circulation problems , especially in the feet and legs
robin was diagnosed by chance in 1999 aged 58 after a friend was diagnosed with prostate cancer and he decided to get himself checked
' six months later , i was tested again and told i had type 2 diabetes
so how did he end up with type 2 diabetes ? normally , it occurs in those who are overweight or who have an inactive lifestyle
pictured here in poldark , he was struck by michel montignac 's book , dine out and lose weight , which advocates giving up white ( refined ) carbohydrates rather than counting calories ' because of my poor mum 's history , i was fully aware of what my diagnosis meant , ' he says
type 2 diabetes has a strong genetic element - if a parent has it , there 's a 50 per cent chance their child will , too
however , robin 's mother had type 1 diabetes , which is an entirely different type and so it 's likely to be just a coincidence
in type 1 diabetes , the insulin - producing cells in the pancreas are destroyed , meaning none is released , whereas in type 2 the pancreas may produce decent levels of insulin but the body is resistant to it
the diabetes picture has changed dramatically since robin 's mother 's days
rates of type 2 diabetes have soared , due to rising obesity levels , and it is being diagnosed at a much younger age
in the uk in 2010 there were 3.1 m over- 16s with diabetes , 90 per cent with type 2
' there is an epidemic of type 2 and the myth that this is a milder form of diabetes has been totally busted , ' says dr toms , consultant diabetes specialist at newham university hospital , east london
indeed while complications such as nerve damage to the eyes and feet equally affect both types of diabetes , damage to the large blood vessels in the heart , brain and legs are far more common with type 2
heart disease is a common complication of type 2 diabetes , because high blood sugar can damage the blood vessels and raise the risk of arteries becoming blocked
once he was diagnosed , robin was determined to do everything he could to limit the damage through lifestyle changes
' after being told about diabetes , i read up on it and was struck by michel montignac 's book , dine out and lose weight , which advocates giving up white ( refined ) carbohydrates ( that release sugar quickly into the bloodstream ) rather than counting calories
' robin has since written a number of cookbooks for people with diabetes , as he found there was a lack of recipes available
' i travel with oats , walnuts , dried apricots and prunes to which i add almond milk , which is virtually sugar - free , and then i 'll have rye bread
' robin 's other lifestyle change was to walk the recommended 150 minutes a week , little but often ( he 'd given up running by then )
robin - who lives with his american wife , meredith , in lautrec in south - west france , does have some numbness in his feet , another common complication of diabetes , and sees a chiropodist every three months
