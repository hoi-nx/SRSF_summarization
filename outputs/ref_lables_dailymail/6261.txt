after nearly two years of jockeying with congressional over the irs 's history of discriminating against conservative nonprofit groups , former official lerner wo n't be charged with a crime for defying a congressional subpoena and refusing to answer questions
american attorney machen , on his last day in office , told house speaker john boehner in a seven - page letter that lerner could wrap herself in the american constitution 's fifth amendment , even though she offered a self - serving opening statement before clamming up during a may 22 , 2013 hearing
lerner has long been in the republican 's crosshairs because she led the irs department tasked with approving nonprofit groups ' applications for tax - exempt status
beginning in 2010 , the department gave conservative groups with words like ' patriots ' or ' tea party ' in their names extra scrutiny , slow - walking their applications and keping many in limbo for years
california issa rep. issa , then the oversight 's chairman , told lerner in one hearing that she had ' effectively waived your rights ' by defending herself under oath

' machen told john boehner on tuesday that since lerner had only made ' general claims of innocence , ' she was within her rights to refuse to answer questions
' machen 's march 31 letter arrived on capitol hill just a day before his resignation took effect after a five - year stint as washington , d.c. 's top federal prosecutor inside the doj
' once again , the obama administration has tried to sweep irs targeting of taxpayers for their political beliefs under the rug , ' john boehner spokesman steel told daily mail online

' it is unclear whether the administration directed mr. machen not to prosecute lerner , or whether he was motivated by an ideological kinship with irs âs leadership , ' chaffetz said
