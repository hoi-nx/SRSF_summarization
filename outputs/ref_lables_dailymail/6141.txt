tucked along the coastline of the second smallest country in south america , the tiny fishing village of jose ignacio is almost unknown around the world
staying in shabby chic cottages or sleek hotels overlooking the sea , they converge of the beach - a mass of honeyed limbs and perfect figures stretched out in the sun while planning where to party that night
the tiny village of jose ignacio is an understated getaway for the rich and famous , filed with pretty villas and sleek beach huts rolling stone ronnie wood ( left ) and colombian singer shakira ( right ) are among the stars said to have escaped the spotlight by holidaying in the chic resort of jose ignacio so , what has brought everyone from colombian singer shakira to rolling stone ronnie wood and restaurateur and playboy giuseppe cipriani - the man behind the glamorous giuseppe cipriani restaurants dotted around the world 's most stylish cities - to these shores ? wedged between oversized neighbours argentinian and brazilian , uruguay has largely stayed off the radar for european and us travellers , but has long been a favourite summer spot for south america thanks to its endless golden beaches and low prices
with an area of just 68,000 square miles , the country 's sizeable atlantic coastline is home to pretty villages , two major cities - the capital montevideo and the glorious colonial portuguese town of colonia - while the interior is dotted with little more than estancia farms breeding cattle and growing wine
each summer ( during the us and european winter ) , uruguay 's beaches are taken over by well - heeled brazilian and argentinian looking for good food and sunshine
even the luxury boutiques selling trinkets alongside designer products are designed in the shabby chic beach style la huella is one of the most famous restaurants in jose ignacio and a favourite with holidaymakers for its relaxed beach atmosphere as telenovela ( soap opera ) actresses and latin film stars descended on the coast , one resort in particular became the haunt of the rich and famous

colonia del sacramento is perhaps uruguay 's prettiest town , with cobbled streets and crumbling buildings left over from portuguese and spanish rule colonia del sacramento sits across the rio de la plata from argentinian ( buenos aires is just an hour away by ferry )
tango bars and theatres have combined to give the city a reputation as a true cultural hub in uruguay
if you want to head away from the cities , then travel inland to the various estancias ( ranches ) that dominate the country 's interior
with so many big names rubbing shoulders in one town , it is on wonder the ultra-chic crowd started to head elsewhere for some peace and quiet - which is how they happened upon tiny jose ignacio , just 22 miles east along the coast
the tarmac road gives way to sand at the entrance of the village , pretty clapboard houses probably look more elegant than most , and signs pointing to chic boutiques and eateries are subtle
there are no high rises , no gaudy luxury hotels , just an assortment of those shabby chic - style buildings that make the perfect romantic backdrop for fashion shoots - something which is not lost on the fashion directors of the world 's glossiest magazines , who flock to the area to create stylish beach spreads
the suites sit in individual huts covered in grass and wildflowers and the bedrooms boast spectacular views out to sea from the floor - to - ceiling windows the central titanium and glass structure was designed as a sculpture and the back opens up onto the terrace and infinity pool from the restaurant , guests can stroll out on to the terrace and sit by the pool which blends in with the sea beyond one such sleek addition is playa vik , built by norwegian - born hotelier alex vik , it is a sleek modern design which should n't work with the traditional ambience of the village but somehow does
an additional trip to uruguay can be added into the itinerary at an extra cost
paintings hang on every wall , a cosy library gives way to a grand open room used as a casual restaurant throughout the day and evening , but the showstopper is the missing fourth wall , leading out to decking and a narrow infinity swimming pool , complete with dark tiling , which juts straight out towards the sea and is illuminated with star - like lights at night
by day , guests languidly swim while looking out to sea and across the golden sands and in the evening , the terrace is the perfect place to watch the sun go down while enjoying a glass of uruguay wine
chic beach houses are the order of the day in jose ignacio , with understated clapboard getting a modern twist and beach attire very much on the casual side uruguay painter carlos paez vilaro created this fairy tale home casapueblo in punta del este perched on a clifftop and looking out to sea - visitors can tor the quirky property today and learn more about the artist or stay in the part of it converted into a hotel playa vik has been such a success that down the road estancia vik has recently opened , providing a grander , more traditional atmosphere with its luxurious ' farmhouse ' , but it has a similar atmosphere to its siter hotel , created by spectacular works of art on every wall , fantastic food and a personalised service ( i never meet a member of staff who does n't greet me by name )
