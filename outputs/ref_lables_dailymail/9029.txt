there was uproar on the south coast when cortese sacked local hero nigel adkins and replaced him with the relatively unknown argentine , on english shores at least , pochettino
adkins had led southampton to back - to - back promotions into the premier league and was fighting valiantly to keep them in it
but cortese âs decision proved to be an astute one and pochettino took them to the next level
pochettino spent 16 months as southampton manager before departing to spurs the argentine manager ( right ) embraces ronald koeman ( left ) as he took on his former side in october so much so that 16 months later daniel levy saw him as the ideal man to take spurs on , too
as pochettino prepares to return to st mary âs for the first time since he left , sportsmail takes a look at how his two tenures compare
you do nât win anything with kids â¦ pochettino came to england with a reputation for bringing through young players - at espanyol he handed 25 of their youth products a debut
at southampton he continued to show no fear in throwing them in , giving premier league debuts to calum chambers , who then moved to arsenal for Â£ 16million and has now won senior england caps , and james ward-prowse , who is a first - team regular , star of england under 21s and set for a call up by roy hodgson
pochettino has maintained that approach at spurs
calum chambers ( left ) and james ward-prowse ( right ) both rose to prominence under pochettino harry kane has flourished under him , too , already around the first team before his arrival albeit , but excelling under pochettino âs guidance and scoring a sensational 31 goals in all competitions already this season
harry kane has been in sensational form under the former southampton boss this season - scoring 31 times 2011 - 12 : 4th ( harry redknapp as manager ) 2012 - 13 : 5th ( andre villas-boas as manager ) 2013 - 14 : 6th ( tim sherwood as manager ) 2014 - 15 * currently 7th ( pochettino ) lung - busting training training sessions under pochettino have become almost mythical
at southampton when he first arrived he took the team to a portuguese boot camp and made the players , leading himself by example , walk over hot coals
pochettino ( left ) has deployed strict and grueling training methods at both spurs and southampton it appears there is more of the same at spurs
â passing and pressing philosophy like many managers , pochettino has a certain philosophy and is relentlessly demanding that it is reflected on the pitch
a passing and pressing philosophy has been deployed by pochettino throughout his managerial career when they are not in possession , pressing is expected high up the pitch - hence the punishing pursuit of supreme fitness levels in training
spurs players have taken a while to get used to it , longer than it took southampton players when pochettino was first in charge
enhancing individuals in pochettino âs role as â head coach â as opposed to all - round manager he has more time to work with individuals , if they go to him desiring to improve their game
victor wanyama was a big - money signing from pochettino , but has turned out to be a success equally , at spurs eric dier at Â£ 4m looks like a future england international , whereas ben davies for Â£ 10m could prove too much
broken english pochettino would barely ever speak to the press - in tv , radio or to print journalists - in english while he was at southampton
the spurs boss has spoken in english in his entire press conferences at spurs
