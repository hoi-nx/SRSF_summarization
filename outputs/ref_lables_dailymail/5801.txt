but thanks to the kindness of jason , a manchester business owner who heard about the heartbreaking story on a tv programme , philip , 42 , has been thrown a lifeline
managing director jasen , 30 , said : ' i saw philip was getting a lot of hate from some people saying he was just lazy , and i thought well i 'll give him a job if he really wants one
' philip lost his job as a gardener following a stomach operation and then the pair lost their benefits it became commonplace for the pair to wash in public toilets or at the facilities of local supermarkets and philip , who has been desperately looking for work for months , is proving to be a much - needed asset to the company
' despite things looking up , the pair are still living out of their car but they stay in hotels whenever they can philip could n't believe it when the offer of a job came through , and although the couple still spend some nights living in their van , whenever they can afford it they treat themselves to a bed in a hotel - and hope to get their own flat in the future
philip , 42 , added : ' jasen saw what i was going through , and it 's heart - warming that there are people out there who will do this for a total stranger and i 'm really enjoying the job
