claudia martin , 33 , has been convicted of suffocating her newborn baby daughter a mother - of - five today avoided jail for suffocating her newborn baby daughter by stuffing toilet paper down her throat and hiding the infant 's body in a suitcase
claudia martins , 33 , wept as she walked free after a judge accepted she had a ' momentary abnormality of mental functioning ' which she no longer suffered from
a court heard she was suffering from a condition known as a ' pathological denial of pregnancy ' which continued after giving birth to a baby girl
she ' intended ' to dispose of the tragic baby 's body unnoticed , wrapping it in a plastic bag and towels , but was prevented from doing so when paramedics arrived and whisked her off to hospital
earlier that evening she had complained to her family of a bad back but an ambulance was called when it was noticed she had wrapped herself in blood - soaked towels
before she left her sister 's home in knowle , bristol , on september 12 last year , she was seen rearranging items in a suitcase and placed items on top
when she opened it she found towels soaked in blood and the body of a baby girl , which was between 35 and 36 weeks gestation
martins was cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility
mr justice teare , sentencing martins at winchester crown court , hampshire , to a two year community order with supervision requirements , described her actions as ' wholly out of character '
he said : ' on september 12 last year you gave birth to a baby girl and very shortly afterwards you killed that baby by inserting tissue paper in her mouth
a court heard claudia martins ( pictured ) was suffering from a condition known as a ' pathological denial of pregnancy ' ' immediately thereafter you hid the baby in a suitcase and it was not discovered for three days
' the explanation for your conduct is you were suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning which substantially impaired your judgement
martins ( pictured ) was cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility he continued : ' quite why you developed a pathological denial of pregnancy is unclear but it 's likely to be you living with the pressures of living with two children in cramped conditions without a partner in a foreign country and unable to speak english without any prospect of a job
when she killed her baby daughter she was living at the shared property in knowle with eight other people including her sister
martins avoided jail and was sentenced to a two year community order with supervision requirements when she appeared at winchester crown court ( pictured ) he said : ' she placed the body of the baby in a suitcase , hidden from anyone
