khan believes brook has called him out so that he can have the ' one big payday ' which has so far eluded him during his 10 - and - a - half year career
khan ( left ) , pictured during his last fight against devon alexander , has blasted brook 's motives brook ( right ) shakes hands with british superbike champion shane byrne at donington park on tuesday in an interview with ifl tv , khan said : ' he 's only faced one decent opponent in his whole career , so he has no room to talk
it seems to me that he 's just calling me out for that one big payday
' if he keeps going on like this , that one big payday fight for him will never happen because at the end of the day , he 's just trying to win fans over by mentioning my name when he knows that i ca n't fight then because of ramadan
khan has now denied that he will face chris algieri next month , claiming there are ' some more options ' chris algieri lost every round to pacquiao when he took on the filipino star last november brook is desperate to fight khan but his fellow brit rejected the chance to face him at wembley in june a Â£ 5million clash with brook at wembley on june 13 was also an option but khan rejected the offer as he will not fight during ramadan because of his islamic faith
there 's fighters in boxing who are the a-class fighters , the likes of pacquiao and mayweather , who talk about and mention and say they know who khan is
' when it comes to brook , who knows brook in us ? which fighter , apart from shawn porter , knows brook ? mayweather and pacquiao do n't know who brook is , so i do n't know what he 's going on about trying to say he 's a big name
' brook 's going on like he 's the next guy to fight mayweather when he 's not even a big ticket seller
brook is hoping to fight khan within the next 12 months as he looks to extend his unbeaten streak khan claims that brook is not even a big name in the uk and is not able to face the world 's biggest names ' the way he 's tried to come across to the us public is like he 's a super-big name in the uk
' without me , he 'll never make that big money unless he goes out and fights the top guys like pacquiao , mayweather , and marquez , but i ca n't see him fighting those guys because he 's always scared to get beat by them and lose his title
