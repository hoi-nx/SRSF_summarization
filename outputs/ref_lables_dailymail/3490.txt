probably the most extraordinary thing about the island of st helena is that it was ever found at all
a tiny ten by six mile speck in the south atlantic 1,200 miles from the coast of west africa , it lay undiscovered for around 14 million years able to evolve its own unique flora and fauna untouched by the outside world
jamestown is the capital of the south atlantic island of st helena , discovered by in 1502 by juan de nova it was a key stopping place for the ships of the east india company and other vessels - at its peak it serviced a thousand a year
and it was the place to which napoleon was exiled after his defeat at waterloo
the emperor who had escaped elba was not going to get away so easily from the most isolated place on earth
framed by cragged volcanic cliffs soaring 800 metres ( 2,600 feet ) above sea level , the island is just 122 square kilometres in total the island , which is smaller than central paris has just 4,200 inhabitants - and 850 of them live in the small capital of jamestown early next year a Â£ 218m airport will open and make this british overseas territory no longer quite so isolated
this royal mail ship is the island âs lifeline
early next year , an airport will open on the island
the Â£ 218 million project will make this british overseas territory far more accessible once the airport is open in february 2016 , the ship service - which takes five days from cape town - will be retired here , the runway of the future airport is visible
the upcoming airport will be located in the prosperous bay plain area of the island this means it âs a ship of two halves : the front laden with dozens of huge containers , the back a sun deck where we take dips in the little swimming pool and play quoits , shuffleboard , skittles and passengers v. crew cricket
as it stands , the only way to reach st helena is via ship - the rms st. helena , a royal mail ship that transports all supplies to the island traveller liz describes the ship as a ' ship of two halves ' : the front laden with dozens of huge containers , with a sundeck out back we are fortified in all this by the most enormous hearty meals : there âs even an extra savoury course after the cheese at dinner though i never get that far myself
there is in fact something rather alice-in-wonderland - ish about st helena as if everything has shrunken to produce a geography and a society in miniature
the edge of the runway will offer spectacular views of the blue water , nestled among the jagged rocks of the coastline while visiting , liz climbed the island 's infamous jacob âs ladder : a 699 - step staircase that towers 600 feet in the air so within only 47 square miles of land mass there are barren deserts and lush cloud forests , a black sand beach and towering crags , rolling pastureland and peaks of up to 2,700 feet
the island is full of trails - of varying levels of difficulty - as well as fabulous swimming and diving opportunities as well as there being several ship wrecks to explore , the marine life is another major draw for snorkellers and divers alike by contrast there was a napoleon themed day : a visit to briars pavilion where he stayed briefly when he first arrived , longwood house where he lived for six years until his death in 1821 and his tomb in the pretty valley setting he chose himself
. other experiences included a cookery lesson making tuna fishcakes , pumpkin stew and pilau â pronounced plo â a spicy legacy of st helena âs diversity , which its people made up from arrivals from india , china , madagascar , british and west africa
st helena is also home to the ' world 's most remote distillery ' and the ' world 's remotest coffee plantation , ' both run by british ex-pats then there was the small but excellent museum , the forts , batteries and cannons dotted around the place , the fine collection of st helena prints and drawings at prince âs lodge ( in pre-photography days ships had their own artists on board ) , the boer cemetery ( 6,000 were imprisoned here during the boer war but given freedom to work , trade and organise events ) and the plantation house grounds to see jonathan the tortoise who is at least 182 years old and probably the world âs oldest reptile
