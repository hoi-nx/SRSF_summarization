madrid have n't got going tonight ( i was about to write a post about how barcelona were 5 - 0 up at this point ) but rodriguez produces a bit of individual magic to opening the scoring
the ball bounces up to the colombian who unleashes a stunning left - footed volley , dipping over the goalkeeper and into the top corner at some speed
39mins : as bad as madrid have been , credit must go to almeria
31mins : but still , it 's the visitors who are getting in behind more than madrid
no goals ? come on ronaldo ! first , he runs at the almeria defence but his left - footed strike is straight at the keeper who flicks it behind - and then from the resulting corner he rises highest but that 's ballooned over the bar
3mins : almeria have quite a bit of the ball early on but unsurprisingly it 's madrid who almost force the opening
the sun is shining at the bernabeu , where martin odegaard came out prior to kick - off to take a picture
minutes until kick - off now , madrid will be hoping to follow barcelona 's lead and turn on the style too
under the terms set out by manchester united when they loaned the 26 - year - old to madrid , thursday april 30 marks the end of the spanish club 's ' exclusivity period ' to buy the player
so , will he impress tonight ? madrid have scored 21 goals in their last four games against almeria , including an 8 - 1 victory at the bernabeu two years ago
and on that note ... madrid : navas , arbeloa , pepe , varane , coentrao , kroos , illarramendi , rodriguez , ronaldo , jese , hernandez subs : iker casillas , marcelo , nacho , lucas silva , isco , martin odegaard , mayoral almeria : ruben , ximo , trujillo , mauro , mane , verza , thomas , corona , dubarbier , hemed , edgar subs : julian , casado , jonathan , sanchez , espinosa , marin , azeez referee : ignacio iglesias villanueva it may only be a home clash against lowly almeria , but tonight could be the biggest night of a 16 - year - old 's life
norwegian wonderkid martin odegaard has been named on the bench for this evening 's la liga game and may make his debut
before that though , there is the small matter of madrid closing the gap on archrivals barcelona
pressure is on madrid as they aim to narrow the five - point gap barcelona have opened up at the top of la liga
barcelona hammered getafe 6 - 0 on tuesday to extend their lead at the la liga summit , but madrid will hope to reel in their rivals with victory over a struggling almeria team
carlo ancelotti has named martin odegaard on the madrd bench , with the 16 - year - old set to make his club debut at the bernabeu , so follow sportsmail 's coverage of all the action here .
