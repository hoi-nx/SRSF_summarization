worried : alice dreger attended the class at east lansing high school after her son asked her to sit in on it so she could hear what was going on first hand an outraged mom live tweeted her son 's sex education class after becoming outraged by its abstinence only stance
author alice dreger took to twitter to express her horror at what she heard at east lansing high school , in michigan , when she sat in on a lesson earlier this week
ms alice dreger , a respected professor , began furiously tweeting out the contents of the lesson - which was filled with horror stories about what happened to people who have pre-marital sex
according to the 45 tweets sent by ms alice dreger during the lesson , stories included people who lost all their friends when they became pregnant , people who fell into comas for 11 years after taking drugs and high school dropouts
' the whole lesson here is " sex is part of a terrible lifestyle
drugs , unemployment , failure to finish school -- sex is part of the disaster " , ' tweeted ms alice dreger
she added : ' i feel like raising my hand and saying " can i tell my sexual history , which involves a lot of pleasure before and during marriage ? " ' ms alice dreger also complained of the incorrect information being handed to the students , who are freshmen in high school , by the teacher , who did not normally work at the school
" we are going to roll this dice eight times , ' ms alice dreger reported the teacher as saying
outrage : ms alice dreger 's tweets , above , show just how cross she got during the class earlier this week untrue : the school has denied it only teaches abstinence , saying it just happened to be that day 's lesson the tweets went viral , with people across the world getting involved with the debate over sex education
but the school has denied it only teaches abstinence - saying it was just that day 's lecture which focused on the subject
' abstinence - based instruction teaches that abstinence is the only way to be completely safe , but the curriculum also reviews contraception choices
this parent attended on a day where abstinence was being taught , ' high school principal coby fletcher said in the statement released to the lansing state journal
the school has taken no direct action against ms alice dreger for the tweets
they have , however , banned her from the premises - apart from her son 's events - for swearing at the end of the lesson
@ alicedreger : the kid has invited me to his health class on sex ed to see how bad it is , so i 'm going
they 're teaching " abstinence stories " that worked and non-abstinence " stories that " led to consequences
" @ alicedreger : the visitor - teacher is telling my kid abstinence education reduces premarital sex
@ alicedreger : she 's being completely condescending
" you can look up anything on the internet " then refers him to site on abstinence education ! @ alicedreger : i feel like raising my hand and saying " can i tell my sexual history , which involves a lot of pleasure before and during marriage ? " @ alicedreger : and how i 've had a lot of lovers and have never gotten pregnant by accident ? yes , i had hpv ! and i would get the vaccine ! @ alicedreger : in fact i have had the vaccine ! @ alicedreger : now we 're hearing a horror story about marijuana use
@ alicedreger : the guy telling the " abstinence " story is now telling us about having sex as a teenager
@ alicedreger : now he 's talking about getting a girl preg and them hiding it from their parents
yup , that 's what sexual shame does , dude ! @ alicedreger : preg girl got picked on so her friends desserted her
that 's what happens if you have sex , kids ! yup ! pregnant and no friends ! @ alicedreger : he and the girl both had alcoholic fathers
but somehow he 's not recommending never drinking
@ alicedreger : the whole lesson here is " sex is part of a terrible lifestyle
drugs , unemployment , failure to finish school -- sex is part of the disaster " @ alicedreger : this guy really thinks this story of " i f * * * * * up for years and years " is going to lead to other kids not f * * * * up
@ alicedreger : whereas the lesson i would take is " sometimes it takes years to get your s * * * together , and that 's okay " ? @ alicedreger : oh and of course , now a story about a friend who od'ed and " was a vegetable 11 years
welcome to sex ed. @ alicedreger : this whole story of od 's , people in prison , out - of - marriage pregnancies is ironically a story of this guy 's resilience and normalcy
" @ alicedreger : " i finally met a great girl who was brought up in abstinence , and her life was so much better
" @ alicedreger : " i liked her so much [ i so wanted to * * * * her ] i decided to change my lifestyle and go with abstinence [ until i could f * * * her ]
