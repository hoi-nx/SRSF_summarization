sorry : journalist erdely is expected to apologize for an article she wrote for rolling stone magazine about campus rape the journalist who wrote rolling stone 's flawed account of a campus rape is set to apologize sunday night , when the columbia journalism school publishes a review of what went wrong with her reporting
erdely has been silent since december , when the magazine was forced to issue an apology in the wake of several factual errors highlighted in the piece about a university of virginia student named jackie
in the story , titled ' a rape on campus ' , jackie claims to have been gang raped by seven men at campus fraternity phi kappa psi two years ago
following that , sources tell cnn that erdely will release an apologetic statement and rolling stone will take the story down from their website
while the article initially sparked protests on campus , erdely 's reporting quickly began to fall apart as the washington post and local outlets started following up on the allegations
one mistake of erdely 's previously highlighted , was the fact she agreed not to contact jackie 's alleged attackers
police officials say she refused to be interviewed in the course of their investigation three of jackie 's friends also denied erdely 's assertion that they discouraged the alleged victim from reporting the assault
