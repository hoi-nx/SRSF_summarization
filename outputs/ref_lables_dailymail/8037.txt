the health watchdog that damned the nhs 's first privately run hospital ignored a spot check by its own inspectors that found huge improvements in standards
the vital findings have been suppressed for nearly four months , and have only emerged now after the care quality commission quietly revised its report to rate many of the hospital 's services as ' good '
in january the commission branded hinchingbrooke in cambridgeshire as ' inadequate ' and placed it in special measures , along with a dozen of the worst hospitals in the country
but today the watchdog will upgrade this to ' requires improvement ' and publish a glowing report
in january the commission branded hinchingbrooke in cambridgeshire as ' inadequate ' experts say it is further evidence that the inspection was flawed and a stitch - up by labour party activists and trade unionists who oppose privatisation
crucially , the report â a draft of which has been leaked to the mail â shows that the care quality commission ignored a second , far more positive spot check of the hospital when it published its initial report
in january â a week before the first report came out â inspectors returned to check up on two wards where they had raised concerns about standards of care during a visit in september
today the watchdog will upgrade the ' inadequate ' finding to ' requires improvement ' and publish a glowing report the mail has repeatedly highlighted concerns by mps and doctors that the inspection was flawed and a sabotage attempt by those opposed to privatisation
neither took part in the spot checks a week before january 's report
the evidence has always been that hinchingbrooke was a good hospital , with low mortality rates , low waiting times , and positive reviews from other nhs regulators
