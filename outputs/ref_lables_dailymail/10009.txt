a 10 tonne ' fatberg ' made up of congealed waste has been removed from a sewer underneath one of london 's most exclusive streets
the enormous lump , which was 40 metres long and made up of fat and wet wipes , was so heavy that it caused the 1940s sewer in chelsea to break
utility companies , including thames water , discovered the fatberg when local residents and businesses on draycott avenue and walton street started to complain about the rancid smell coming from the sewer
thames water , have now been forced to repair the old brick sewer , left , at a cost of Â£ 400,000 after it became damaged due to the fatberg ' the original sewer has been so badly abused by fat being chucked down the plughole we 've had to opt for the time consuming and disruptive option of replacing many metres of pipe
the enormous lump , which was 40 metres long and made up of fat and wet wipes , was found beneath draycott avenue and walton street in london , pictured london 's largest ever recorded fatberg , weighing in at 15 tonnes , was found in kingston in august 2013
