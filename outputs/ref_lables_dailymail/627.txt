hernandez made it six goals in eight starts as real kept up their pursuit of barcelona at the top of la liga with a 4 - 2 win over celta vigo
hernandez is currently scoring a goal every 83 minutes with a scoring ratio that is only two minutes short of lionel messi who nets once every 81 minutes
and if his goal at the bernabeu was a tired shot with the goal gaping in the dying minutes , his strikes against celta vigo were of the highest quality and will only serve to ramp up the auction for his services at the end of the season â who knows if his goals bring trophies to the santiago bernabeu , real might even be in the race to sign him permanently

ronaldo was linking well with james rodriguez and hernandez and almost put real ahead but saw his shot come back off the post after another fine pass from hernandez
it was orellana who wend down under a challenge from behind from toni kroos at the start of the second half but the referee was unmoved by the home side âs appeals
now with the season approaching its climax he looks like one of real 's most important players .
