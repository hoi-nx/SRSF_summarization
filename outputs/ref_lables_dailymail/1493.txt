everyone who comes to britain should know how to speak english , labour ed miliband has warned as he admitted labour made mistakes on immigration
the labour leader admitted that in the past his party had been ' too timid ' about making clear that for communities to live together they must use a shared language
speaking in wirral west - a marginal seat held by the conservative employment minister esther mcvey - the labour leader said exploitation drives low skilled migration and holds down wages for britain workers
but he also warned that migrants must learn to speak english , especially in key services like the nhs
mr ed miliband said : ' our communities are changing fast but we do n't cope with change by closing our doors to each other and living our lives in separate worlds
' instead we must find a way to live together across communities
' but we can only build this shared society if we speak the same language
' in his speech in pensby , northern england , mr ed miliband insisted that there was an ' epidemic of exploitation ' he said his own parents had learned to speak english after arriving from belgium in 1940
' it is why i believe in a simple principle : everyone in britain should know how to speak english
' and it is especially important that people who work in public services in public facing roles should be required to speak english
' we all know the crucial contribution that people from overseas play in our nhs
' so in the future all healthcare professionals will be required to speak english to a sufficient standard so they can care effectively for patients
' the labour leader , pictured greeting staff and students at pensby high school , also used the speech to promise labour would do more to secure the borders - with 1,000 extra staff at ports - and help integration mr ed miliband told the audience how his ' parents came to britain to flee the horrors of nazi germany '
labour sent out ' search parties for people ' and under them net migration increased more than five-fold
' but a vote for ed miliband would risk all of that with a labour - snp stitch up
