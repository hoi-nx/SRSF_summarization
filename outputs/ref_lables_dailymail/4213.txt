jurors spent only about an hour deliberating tuesday before convicting an oregon woman of killing two handymen and feeding their bodies to her pigs
the jackson county jury found monica guilty of murdering two men about a year apart , then abusing their corpses by feeding them to the animals at her farm , the medford mail tribune reported
pictured above in court on tuesday floored : monica and her defense team react to hearing a guilty verdict in court on tuesday ' you shot two people and fed them to your pigs , ' the judge told monica
prosecutors said stephen delicino , 59 , was killed in 2012 and robert haney , 56 , died in 2013
victim : robert haney ( pictured ) is one of the two men monica was found guilty of killing
she admitted to shooting robert haney when she found him being attacked by her pigs in 2013 , but jurors did n't buy the story monica 's changing stories about how she shot stephen delicino and robert haney never matched the forensic evidence , smith , senior assistant deputy district attorney , told jurors in closing arguments
she variously claimed that stephen delicino shot himself repeatedly in the head and also that she shot him in self - defense and he was eaten by her pigs before she buried his remains on her 20 - acre farm in southern oregon , smith reminded jurors
monica told investigators robert haney disappeared in the summer of 2013
defense attorney garren pedemonte argued there was no concrete evidence to rebut monica 's claims that she shot stephen delicino in self - defense or to show that robert haney was actually alive when monica shot him
a state police forensic anthropologist , veronica vance , testified that robert haney 's legs had been chopped off with an ax , and the thigh bones showed signs of being gnawed by an animal
gruesome discovery : the remains of the two handymen were found on monica 's farm after investigators noticed she was using one of the men 's food stamps quick : it took a jury just an hour to come to the decision to convict monica of murder
on monday , a cellmate of monica 's testified the defendant signed a birthday card in jail with this phrase : ' from the sweetest murderer in jackson county
as the judge addressed the jury before deliberations tuesday , the newspaper reported that monica stood up , raised her hand and began asking for the chance to give jurors one more demonstration on how she claimed she shot stephen delicino
