pensions minister webb has now urged people to not make rash decisions he is the pensions minister who famously said we should be free to blow our life savings on a lamborghini
but after liberating a nation to spend their money as they wish , webb has now urged people to take their time rather than make rash decisions
yesterday the biggest pension reforms in a century were launched , allowing over- 55s to cash in their pension pots rather than being forced to buy a fixed monthly income
mr webb said over- 55s â do nât have to rush this â and insisted there was â a case for waiting and seeing â
research by consumer group which ? shows that buying a Â£ 228,000 lamborghini aventador would incur a Â£ 126,000 tax bill if you withdrew the cash in one go â enough to buy a porsche 911 turbo
but a study by insurer aegon found that a third of over- 55s were unaware of the tax implications of withdrawing all their money at once
the new reforms will allow 2.1million over- 55s to withdraw all or part of their funds rather than being required to buy an annuity
experts fear pensioners could be vulnerable if they do not receive proper advice regarding pension plans now that over- 55s can cash in their pensions and spend them instead of being forced to buy an annuity ( file image )
