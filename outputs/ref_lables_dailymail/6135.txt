amaral had been on trial over claims he made in a book and a documentary that the couple were involved in their daughter madeleine 's disappearance
in a written verdict , a lisbon court agreed that amaral should pay mr and mrs gerry mccann â¬ 250,000 ( Â£ 179,000 ) each in damages and banned further sales of his book the truth of the lie
the couple 's lawyer isabel duarte also revealed that amaral had been told to pay interest which she said stood at present at â¬ 106,000 ( Â£ 76,000 )
mr amaral , who led the initial investigation into madeleine 's disappearance , released his book three days after the case was closed in 2008
the couple , who accuse amaral of hampering the search for their daughter , had been expected to receive around Â£ 1million in damages
the mccanns told the court last summer they were left ' devastated and crushed ' by his book , which sold around 120,000 copies before it was withdrawn when the couple won an injunction against the ex-police chief
mrs mccann , 47 , said madeleine 's twin siblings sean and amelie , now ten , knew mr amaral had written a book but did n't know the detail
amaral claimed madeleine ( above ) had not been abducted , but had died in an accident in praia da luz she told the court last july after applying to make a statement : ' i believe that 's what 's in mr amaral 's book and the documentary is very distressing to adults
' she went on to accuse amaral , thrown off the investigation in 2007 for criticising british police , of ' consistently smearing ' them
she also claimed they feared the book may have stopped people coming forward with information about their daughter 's whereabouts
