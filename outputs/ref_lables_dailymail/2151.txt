as california struggles with a devastating drought , huge amounts of water are mysteriously vanishing from the sacramento-san joaquin delta â and the prime suspects are farmers whose families have tilled fertile soil there for generations
delta farmers do n't deny using as much water as they need
but they say they 're not stealing it because their history of living at the water 's edge gives them that right
still , they have been asked to report how much water they 're pumping and to prove their legal rights to it
gov. jerry brown has said that if drought continues this system built into california 's legal framework will probably need to be examined
delta farmer mussi says he has senior water rights , putting him in line ahead of those with lower ranking , or junior , water rights
' i do n't want anybody with junior water rights leapfrogging my senior water rights just because they have more money and more political clout
' the fight pitting farmer against farmer is playing out in the delta , the hub of the state 's water system
with no indication of the drought easing , heightened attention is being placed on dwindling water throughout the state , which produces nearly half of the fruits , nuts and vegetables grown in the u.s. a large inland estuary east of san francisco , the delta is fed by rivers of freshwater flowing down from the sierra nevada and northern mountain ranges
some is pumped â or diverted â by delta farmers to irrigate their crops , and some is sent south though canals to central valley farmers and to 25 million people statewide
the drought now in its fourth year has put delta water under close scrutiny
mussi , a second - generation delta farmer , said central valley farmers have long known that in dry years they would get little or no water from state and federal water projects and would need to rely heavily on groundwater in june , the state released water stored for farmers and communities from lake oroville to combat the saltwater intrusion
that in turn prompted a joint letter by the department of water resources and u.s. bureau of reclamation calling for an investigation into how much water delta farmers are taking â and whether the amount exceeds their rights to it
' some 450 farmers who hold 1,061 water rights in the delta and the sacramento-san joaquin delta and san joaquin river river watersheds were told to report their water diversions , and katherine mrowka , state water board enforcement manager , said a vast majority responded
