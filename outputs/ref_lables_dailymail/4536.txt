a new species of monkey has been discovered after scientists learned to distinguish it by the appearance of its penis
the white - cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south - east tibet after researchers set up camera traps
the monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped genitalia found on other species in the area
videos have also revealed that the animal has a distinctive alarm calls compared to other macaques in tibet
he concluded the human penis may have grown so long to make it more conspicuous to potential partners , or even as a way of cooling the body down
dr fan , one of the researchers who discovered the new species and a biologist at dali university , yunnan , in china , said the new macaque had long been misidentified as another species
he said that due to the remoteness of the location in medog of tibet , few biologists had been there
he said : ' medog is surrounded by snow mountains and so far away from the centre of science
' furthermore , it locates in southeastern tibet and close to mcmahon line which is a political sensitive area
' this species has long been identified as assamese macaque ( macaca assamensis ) because no clear photos or good specimens are available
most macaques from that area have arrow shaped penises
scientists noticed some of the macaques captured on by the cameras looked different with shorter tails ( like those above ) and light coloured markings around their face , leading them to identify a new species of primate the images above show the more usual ' arrow - shaped ' genitalia that macaques in the area have videos also revealed that macaca leucogenys produced a far higher frequency squeal when threatened compared to the low pitched bark used by macaca assamensis as an alarm call
they said : ' the white - cheeked macaque is threatened by illegal hunting and the construction of hydropower stations
the white cheeked macaque was discovered in the mountain forests of medog in south east tibet , china the researchers say the whiskers on the side of the face of macaca leucogenys become paler and more prominent with age
infants can be seen in the images a and b while a juvenile is labelled c. adult females are in the image d and adult males are seen on the far right of image e. adults have few dark hairs on their faces ' discovery of this new primate species further highlights the high value for biodiversity conservation of southeastern tibet and calls for more intensive surveys , studies , and environmental protection in this area
' although primates have been intensively studied for decades , two new macaque species ( macaca munzala and m. leucogenys ) were discovered and described in this area in the past 10 years
