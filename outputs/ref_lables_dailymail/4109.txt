the earth experienced its hottest month of march since record - keeping began in 1880
there 's been no break from the globe 's record heat - the first three months of 2015 have all set new high temperature marks
last month 's average temperature soared to 56.4 â° f ( 13.6 Â° c ) , which is 1.5 Â° f ( 0.85 Â° c ) above the average for the 20th century
last month 's average temperature of 56.4 Â° f ( 13.6 â° c ) was the hottest march on record , averaging 1.5 Â° f ( 0.85 Â° c ) above the average for the 20th century
scientists warn that fossil fuel burning is pushing more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere , leading to increased temperatures , melting of polar ice and glaciers , and rising seas
' this was the highest for march in the 1880 - 2015 record , surpassing the previous record of 2010 by 0.09 Â° f ( 0.05 â° c ) , ' said the report
most land areas were warmer to much warmer than average , as shown by the temperature percentiles map on the right , with record warmth in parts of the western united states and canada , various regions in eastern africa , parts of scandinavia and northwestern russia , part of south central china , and an area of northeastern australia noaa scientist blunden blames the heat on el niã±o and climate change
however , in an el niã±o , the winds pushing the water get weaker and cause the warmer water to shift back towards the east
last month , the noaa now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance el niã±o will continue through the summer
for the first three months of the year , the average temperature worldwide was 1.48 Â° f ( 0.82 Â° c ) above the 20th - century average
the first three months of 2015 were nearly a tenth of a degree higher than the old record and four - tenths of a degree warmer than january through march of last year
blunden blames the record heat on a combination of el niã±o , a blob of record hot water in the northeast pacific ocean and human - caused climate change
last month , the noaa now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance el niã±o will continue through the summer
some meteorologists , however , have warned that this el niã±o could combine with another slow movement of water temperature in the pacific called the pdo ( pdo )
the pdo reached record levels in december last year and january this year , and should it stay strong , it may combine with el niã±o to increase global temperatures
as is typical , precipitation anomalies during march 2015 varied significantly around the world mike halpert , deputy director of noaa 's climate prediction centre , said : ' based on the persistent observations of above - average sea surface temperatures across the western and central equatorial pacific and consistent pattern of sea level pressure , we can now say that el niã±o is here
' the arrival of this el niã±o is considered to be late after scientists last year predicted they were expecting one last year , but the conditions failed to materialise
