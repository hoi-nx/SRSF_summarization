a 63 - year - old former air hostess has won a Â£ 14.5m london mansion from her ' immensely wealthy ' 90 - year - old saudi ex-husband following a legal battle based on a victorian law
the property , in north west london , which has ' superb views ' over a london park , was one of five properties which the successful property developer bought during the couple 's 14 - year marriage
the couple 's main marital home had been a Â£ 26m ' palatial residence ' in jeddah , saudi , for which 40 members of staff were employed to keep it ticking over
a 63 - year - old former air hostess has won a Â£ 14.5m london mansion from her ' immensely wealthy ' 90 - year - old saudi ex-husband following a legal battle at the high court ( pictured ) but , after their divorce , the woman - who did not have any financial input into the properties - moved into the townhouse , claiming her right to live there as one of their matrimonial homes
despite her husband 's attempts to evict her from the home , and force the sale of the heavily - mortgaged property , the wife has now been allowed to keep it as part of a complex legal settlement
the ' opulent ' maisonette - which was originally three flats converted into one large home - was at one point worth Â£ 22m , but is now worth a ' disappointing ' Â£ 14.5m , the court heard
the husband , who is said to be worth Â£ 600m and blows up to Â£ 10m per year , was also made to give his wife their ' holiday ' property in cannes , which is worth 17m euros
the judge ruled that she should be awarded around Â£ 10m on a ' needs light ' basis
that was based on Â£ 3.5m for london housing , Â£ 2.25 million for a replacement holiday home and a further Â£ 500,000 to cover the outgoings on both properties
the court heard that both homes had significant mortgages , meaning they would have respective equities of Â£ 3.5m and Â£ 5.2m if they are sold
but the judge refused to grant the woman the Â£ 205,014 she was seeking annually to spend on jewellery , handbags and cars
the woman had claimed she needed Â£ 566,045 per year for her Â£ 75,000 wardrobe , as well as Â£ 25,000 to spend on jewellery
' the judge also pointed out that , had it been an entirely english case , the woman would have been entitled to Â£ 44million - the figure she originally sought - out of total Â£ 287.5million in assets
the woman , from lebanon , took the legal action against the businessman at the high court in london
but she was allowed to bring the case in london because the family had spent most summers during their marriage in the capital to escape the ' intolerable ' saudi heat , making it one of their matrimonial homes
the court heard that the husband , said to be a member of several london clubs , had indeed transferred different properties to other members of his family , including his wife
but the judge rejected the claim that he would have promised to transfer his wife any properties for any other reason than tax , insisting he was still the ' beneficial owner ' of the property
