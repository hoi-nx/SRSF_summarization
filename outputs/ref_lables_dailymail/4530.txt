a connecticut teenager with cancer who took her fight to stop her chemotherapy treatments to the state 's supreme court must remain in custody of the state even though her disease has gone into remission , a judge ruled on wednesday
superior court judge taylor in middletown , connecticut , denied requests made last month by attorneys for both cassandra and her mother , fortin , that the 17 - year - old be released from the temporary custody of the state department , or that her mother be permitted to visit her in the hospital
the judge ruled on wednesday she must remain in department custody until completing court - ordered chemotherapy for hodgkin 's lymphoma , a type of blood cancer , at connecticut children 's medical center in hartford
but after she was declared by doctors to be in remission in march , her lawyer joshua michtom and attorneys for her mother appealed at a closed - door court hearing seeking permission to allow her to go home to complete treatments , or at least to permit her mother to visit her in the hospital

treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy , chemotherapy and drugs including steroids
department commissioner joette katz said in a statement wednesday her agency is ' looking forward to the day later this month when cassandra can happily return home after her treatment is completed and the doctors are confident that she has beaten the cancer
michael taylor , an attorney for the teen 's mother , fortin , said if the judge will not lift the temporary custody order , they would like for the teen at least to be able to visit with her mother at the hospital
ms fortinh said department has prohibited her from having contact with her mother
' after ms fortin was diagnosed with high - risk hodgkin lymphoma in september , she and her mother missed several appointments , prompting doctors to notify the department , court documents say
a trial court in november granted department temporary custody of ms fortin
lawyers for cassandra and her mother then sought an injunction prohibiting medical treatment but failed
the case went to the state supreme court , which ruled in january that the state was n't violating ms fortin 's rights by forcing her to undergo chemotherapy
ms fortin told people.com that she did not want to undergo chemotherapy and that when she was taken into care the state tried to prevent her mother from paying a visit
on the day before her chemotherapy , hospital staff were forced to restrain her before they could administer an anaesthetic
a judge has ruled against the 17 - year - old girl who originally refused chemotherapy , and she will have to finish her treatments at the hospital instead of going home she said : ' when a nurse came in and i told myself just to fight
' ms fortin spent two hours arguing with a doctor trying to convince them to suspend her treatment
i felt like i was being treated like an animal
