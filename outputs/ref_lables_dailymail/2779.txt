an israel geologist claims he has â confirmed â the existence and authenticity of a tomb belonging to jesus and his son in jerusalem
after extensive chemical tests , dr shimron says he has linked the james ossuary â a 1st - century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of jesus ' brother â to the long disputed â jesus family tomb â in the city âs talpiot neighbourhood
the research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that jesus was married , fathered a child and that a physical resurrection did not take place
bones were discovered inside ossuaries , including one that bore the inscription , â jesus , son of joseph '
others included the names maria , joseph , mary , yose , matthew and most controversially , â judah , son of jesus â
joseph , mary and jesus were all common names at the time and a statistician from the university of toronto said that they each made up eight per cent of the population
dr shimron âs work has renewed the controversy over the talpiot tomb , which was found in 1980 and dates back to the second temple period and the time of jesus ( a portrait is pictured ) the long - disputed long disputed â jesus family tomb â in the city âs talpiot neighbourhood ( marked ) and is now sealed beneath a concrete slab after building work took place some years ago probing this connection , dr shimron and documentary maker jacobovici looked closer at the ossuaries , including the james ossuary , which is held by a private owner and bears the inscription , â james , son of joseph , brother of jesus â
the james ossuary is a first century chalk example of a box that was used to hold the bones of the dead
but it stands out because it bears the inscription ' james , son of joseph , brother of jesus ' on one side
the inscription is considered significant because it may provide archaeological evidence of jesus , the existence of the ossuary was announced in 2002 , but its authenticity was immediately challenged
now , dr shimron claims the chemical signature on the â crust â of the box matches that of a tomb in jerusalem known as the â jesus family tomb â where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of jesus and mary as well as â judah , son of jesus â
other experts and archaeologists have rejected the claim that the jerusalem tomb is connected with jesus at all
he ran around 150 tests on the chemistry of samples from 25 different ossuaries â 15 of which were from unrelated tombs â and found that traces of magnesium , iron and silicon from the james ossuary matched the chemical signature of talpiot tomb
the talpiot ossuaries were covered in a thick layer of â rendzina â soil , which is characteristic of the hills of jerusalem when they were found and has a unique chemistry
soil that seeped into the box matched that found in the talpiot ossuaries , indicating that it had lain for years alongside others in the â holy â location
bones were discovered there in ossuaries , or chalk boxes , including one that bears the inscription , â jesus , son of joseph ' with others bearing the names of maria , joseph , mary , yose , matthew and most controversially , â judah , son of jesus â
here an inscription that says ' yoseph ' on an ossuary because bones were found in the ossuaries , it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection ( portrayed in this tapestry ) which is the belief of more traditional christians , while others accept the event was spiritual jesus was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals , according to a writer and leading atheist activist
' jacobovici told the jerusalem post : â this find illustrates that the james ossuary is authentic and the jesus family tomb indeed belongs to the family of jesus
â dr shumron told the new york times : â i think i âve got really powerful , virtually unequivocal evidence that the james ossuary spent most of its lifetime , or death time , in the talpiot tomb
