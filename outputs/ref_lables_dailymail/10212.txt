finding discounted flights tends to be hit or miss for most vacationers , but one savvy traveler has managed to plan out an entire two - month trip that will barely cost him a cent
scott keyes , a 28 - year - old writer for think progress , is about to travel 20,000miles on 21 flights , stopping by 13 countries along the way in europe and south and north america while enjoying first class service
so he rounded up all his airline miles , and the points he had acquired on his 25 credit cards
in the end , he was able to book a vacation with stops in mexico , nicaragua , trinidad , st. lucia , grenada , germany , czech republic , ukraine , bulgaria , greece , macedonia , lithuania , and finland without having to pay more than a few dollars on any of the flights
in the end he spent somewhere between 10 and 15 hours putting the entire trip together , which also includes free hotels , at a cost of 136,500 frequent flyer miles
the young man posts photos from his trips on his instagram account keyes is seen posing in front of the famed materhorn on a previous trip , which straddles the border of switzerland and italy striking up a pose : keyes at a mexican wrestling match ( left ) and enjoying a hike ( right ) keyes poses while rafting down sumidero canyon which is located near the city of chiapa de corzo in mexico wading into the waters of hierve el agua in oaxaca , mexico , rock formations and the remnants of old geysers this strategy has certainly worked for the young man as he has logged an impressive 354,000 miles in the sky while visiting 30 countries over the course of his lifetime
this next trip will increase that number to 42 countries
' but the good news is that because if you do a little bit of leg work â learn how to get a few miles and how to use them well â you can start to travel really , really well
