arizona is leading the way with plans to create artificial rain clouds by flying planes over the rockies , and seeding the sky with silver iodide the process of cloud seeding was first proposed in the 1940s at the general electric labs in schenectady , new york
two decades later , the central arizona project and the salt river project invested in research to make it a reality
since 2007 , central arizona project has put about $ 1 million toward research happening in other states to increase the supply of water in the colorado river system
water in the air , even in dry areas , can be transformed into ice crystals by using planes to seed the atmosphere with chemicals such as silver iodide or dry ice if it seems like it never stops raining , blame the russians

but some scientists are concerned about silver building up in river basins , as well as legal uncertainties over who should get the additional water
compared to other alternatives , such as desalinating seawater , cloud seeding is the cheapest option , though it is n't going to be a drought - buster on its own
but selover , the state climatologist , told cronkite news that the trickiest part of cloud seeding is measuring whether an area got more rainfall
