hardly a day passes without a spurious new survey which lists our supposedly favourite things
an example of this banality last week was one about what makes us most happy
among the feel - good experiences were said to be fresh sheets and popping bubble wrap
reading this idiotic list made me extremely depressed
you can not reduce life to a catchphrase or a ranking like a best - buy at morrison âs
experiences which bring us true pleasure are being with loved ones , enjoying warm weather , eating wonderful home - cooked food and just laughing uncontrollably
surely a far more useful exercise is to list every aspect of modern life that makes us unhappy
here âs my list of pet hates â which gets longer by the day : in the face of an increasing number of surveys claiming to reveal what makes us most happy , janet street-porter reveals her list of the things that are making her unhappy - which is getting longer by the day ! trendy men with bushy beards is there anything less attractive than a man âs chin covered by a thick mat of hair ? god forbid you get close enough to snog anyone sprouting a beard that makes them look like a sixties folk singer or an extra from a remake of moses
secret face - lifts every september , i encounter women whose faces look suspiciously taut , whose saggy chins have vanished and who have managed to eradicate the bags under their eyes
although they put this good health down to a â wonderfully restful holiday â , the truth is they âve had a face - lift
vouchers past use - by dates as a dedicated bargain - hunter , it causes deep pain to discover at the till that my carefully - collected discount vouchers have expired
janet street-porter is a self - confessed bargain hunter who hates it when she discovers her vouchers are out of date anything called â an experience â shopping has become a pastime , like making raffia mats or embroidery , and addicts dignify this mindless activity by talking about the â experience â
slugs , snails , mice is there anything more soul - destroying than lovingly nurturing broad beans , peas and lettuces from seed , only to go away for the weekend and return to find they have been destroyed by these vile creatures
dieting celebrities nothing makes me crosser than celebrities â claims that any weight - loss is due to â eating healthily â
pay - by - phone car parking what âs wrong with cash ? this drives people crazy â especially older people who find it a big hassle to try to use a phone to pay for 20 minutes in a car park so you can get your shopping in boots
janet street-porter remains baffled by pay - by - phone car parking , what 's wrong with cash ? queue - jumpers at airports after patiently waiting my turn , i could murder anyone who suddenly appears out of the blue and joins a â friend â in the queue in front on me
phoney words started when ordinary people started being called â stake - holders â
re-sealable bags of rice whoever invented the â re-sealable â bag for rice , nuts , pasta etc , i want to go around to their house and shout : â it does nât work ! â â re-sealable â bag for rice , nuts , pasta just do n't make sense to janet street-porter juicers the devil âs gadgets
paying bills online having to remember all the ruddy passwords to log on to your account takes longer than writing an old - fashioned cheque and sticking it in an envelope
limp and lifeless yorkshire puddings are also something that janet street-porter 's added to her list of annoyances getting my name wrong do nât ever call me janice ! in america , i âm routinely called miss street or mrs janet street-porter
traditional pubs often seem to have landlords who think they can fob you off with just a bag of crisps , according to janet street-porter ( stock image ) unnecessary insurance i am bombarded with leaflets and emails offering special insurance for my gutters , my roof , the central heating , the drains , the pipework , the pet , and my holidays
men and shopping lists what is it about men and supermarkets ? why do they have to go off - piste ? instead of getting the essentials you âve carefully written down for them , they buy their own favourites : a nasty can of hot dogs , a huge pot of english mustard and a jumbo bag of crisps
janet street-porter ca n't stand it when people go around flashing pictures of their new - born children ( stock image ) public eating we âve become a nation of scoffers totally unembarrassed about gorging while we walk , dropping chips and spraying crumbs as we chat on our mobile phones
ugh ! train announcements every journey nowadays seems to be blighted by the guard ( now called a â train manager â ! ) making endless useless announcements about the next station , the cause of a delay or the availability of a full range of snacks ( i.e. just crisps ) in the buffet car ( now re-named the â on - board cafÃ© â
