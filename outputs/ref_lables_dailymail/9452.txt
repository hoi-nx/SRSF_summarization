what was supposed to be a gentle splash around in the shallows suddenly turned into a much scarier prospect when holiday - makers came face to face with a shark in new zealand on saturday
papamoa beach , a popular bay of plenty destination , was an idyllic haven for swimmers until a shark came into the shore , swimming around in only a few feet of water
but before long the shark had seen enough and turned back out to sea
the shark soon had enough of all the attention and swam back out to sea in the last fatal shark attack in new zealand waters , auckland film - maker adam strange , 47 , was killed at muriwai on auckland 's west coast in february 2013 .
