a good samaritan was given a parking ticket after he pulled over to help an elderly woman he thought was dying
student hollinshead , 21 , stopped in the first space available when he saw the pensioner collapse on the pavement
but as he helped her for less than a minute , a traffic warden put a Â£ 70 ticket on his car â because mr hollinshead had pulled into a bay for disabled drivers
' it 's ridiculous ' : when he was slapped with the ticket on his windscreen mr hollinshead initially tore it up and threw it in the bin before later going back to pick it up yesterday mr hollinshead said the way he had been treated was ridiculous and said the council warden could see what was happening
he was driving through bournemouth when he saw the woman fall to the pavement
after discovering she was all right and helping her to her feet , he returned to the car only to find the warden printing the ticket
â i stopped in the disabled bay as it was the nearest place to where the old lady was , â he said
angry : mr hollinshead , who is studying marketing and advertising at bournemouth university , said he was punished for trying to do something good â there was a space for about four cars and it was completely empty , so it was nât like somebody was waiting to use it
he pulled into the disabled bay shown above good samaritan : hollinshead , 21 , was given a parking fine after stopping to help an elderly woman he at first tore up the ticket and threw it in a bin but later retrieved it
â bournemouth council posted a message to mr hollinshead on twitter suggesting how he could challenge the ticket
