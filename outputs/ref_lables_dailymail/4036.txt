how neanderthals met their demise remains a long standing mystery for historians
one theory is that early modern humans ' bullied ' their neanderthals cousins to the point of extinction because they had better tools to survive
but a new study of ancient stone tools contradicts this theory by suggesting human weapons were no better than those created by neanderthals
the researchers studied stone tools that were used by people in the early ahmarian culture and the protoaurignacian culture , living in south and west europe and west south asia around 40,000 years ago
they found the human tools ( pictured ) were no more effective than neanderthals - created tools of the same era researchers say the discovery means we may need to rethink the reasons humans survived neanderthals - and that we may not have behaved as differently as we thought
but the new study by nagoya university and the university of tokyo in japanese argues neanderthals were just as well - equipped as their human counterparts
' we 're not so special , i do n't think we survived neanderthals simply because of technological competence , ' said dr kadowaki , first author of the study from nagoya university , japanese
neanderthals ( reconstruction right ) may not have been as dim - witted as first believe , claims the study the early ahmarian culture used small stone points as tips for hunting weapons like throwing spears
researchers previously considered these to be an important innovation - one that helped the humans migrate from west south asia to europe , where neanderthals were living early modern humans expanded the geographic area they inhabited out of east africa during a period of time 55,000 - 40,000 years ago

many researchers believe the differences between the two human species are not enough on their own to account for the demise of the neanderthals
