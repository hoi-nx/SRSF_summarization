cup hero warren has called for a change to the ' ridiculous ' rule that will see him banned from a second final in successive seasons
warren picked up his second booking of the competition in sunday 's scottish cup semi-final win over celtic â meaning automatic suspension for the season finale on may 30
but the central defender , who also missed last year 's league cup final for the same reason , says either the threshold should be raised â or all cards should be wiped from the record for any show - piece final
cup defender warren will miss the scottish cup final after picking up his second yellow card warren was shown a yellow card for this challenge on celtic 's james forrest ( right ) during the semi-final ' having two bookings ( as the limit ) in a cup competition is ridiculous , ' said warren
' especially being a defender , it means you ca n't tackle - and that 's part and parcel of being a defender , making challenges , making interceptions , making blocks
' warren knew instantly that he 'd miss the final when ref steven mclean rightly showed him a yellow card for hauling back james forrest
warren feels that the rule to have players suspended for amassing just two yellows is ' ridiculous ' celtic 's adam matthews ( right ) slides in with a challenge on nick ross ( left ) during the scottish cup semi-final ' after missing last year 's final , i 'm gutted again
' warren says he will definitely not be doing a john terry and turning up in full kit to take part in any celebrations should caley thistle beat falkirk in the final , saying : ' no , that 's not me at all , no chance
for the size of cup , as a small club , to get to a final for a second successive year is an unbelievable achievement
