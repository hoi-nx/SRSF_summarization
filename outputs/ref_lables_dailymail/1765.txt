the scouts ' new york chapter said thursday that it has hired the nation 's first openly gay eagle scout as a summer camp leader , which is in public contrast to the national scouting organization 's ban on openly gay adult members
the boy scouts ' greater new york councils said they hired tessier , an 18 - year - old eagle scout who has been a vocal advocate of opening the 105 - year - old organization to gay scouts and leaders
board member mason said the councils see tessier as ' an exemplary candidate for employment as a camp leader
on thursday the boy scouts new york chapter announced it hired tessier as the nation 's first openly gay eagle scout as a summer camp leader ' we welcome him , ' mason said in a statement
the national organization changed its policy in 2013 to allow openly gay kids as scouts , but not adults as leaders , after a bitter debate over its membership policy
' tessier 's hiring is in contrast to the national scouting organizationÃ­s ban on openly gay adult members but it has expelled adults who were open about it , including a gay troop leader in seattle who was removed last year after he disclosed his orientation during a tv interview
the 103 - year - old new york group says it has never denied membership to a youth or adult based on sexual orientation , and it did n't want its policy to be affected by the national group 's stance
tessier achieved scouting 's highest rank last year after being one of the most prominent openly gay scouts speaking out to change the ban on gay participation
