apology : clydesdale chief debbie crosbie whose rogue staff misled the financial ombudsman a high street bank has been hit with a record Â£ 21million fine after being caught falsifying documents to avoid compensating victims of mis - selling
now there are calls for criminal charges to be brought over an extraordinary cover - up lasting more than two years at clydesdale and banks
rogue staff misled the financial ombudsman â deliberately obstructing its investigation into payment protection insurance complaints
they deleted records and tampered with evidence to make it look like the customer was never sold ppi , or they lied about not being able to trace documents
politicians called for a police investigation into the wrong - doing , which took place between may 2011 and july 2013
â labour âs john mann said those who falsified documents could be guilty of fraud or forgery
according to the city watchdog , the worst of the cover - up â which lasted from may 2012 to june 2013 â resulted in up to 42,200 ppi complaints being rejected unfairly and up to 50,900 customers receiving inadequate compensation
in one case a married couple were cheated out of a Â£ 5,100 pay - out because the lender lied to the ombudsman that it had not been able to trace records of them having bought ppi
the fca said the bank had an â inappropriate policy â for its complaints handling in 2011 â instructing staff not to search for ppi complaints relating to loans and mortgages that had been repaid more than seven years prior to the complaint
clydesdale also failed to trawl back through credit card statements dating before 2000 for customers mis - sold ppi alongside a credit card
but the wrongdoing escalated in may 2012 when a team of staff started to provide false information to the financial ombudsman when it was investigating complaints on old ppi policies
fined : the fca investigation found ' serious failings ' in the way clydesdale handled its ppi complaints â the fact that clydesdale misled the financial ombudsman by providing false information about the information it held is particularly serious and this is reflected in the size of the fine
â clydesdale and yorkshire âs failings were so serious that the Â£ 20.7million fine dwarfs the next biggest penalty handed out for ppi , which was Â£ 7million imposed on alliance & leicester in 2008
labour 's john mann said those who falsified documents could be guilty of fraud or forgery but they were widely sold to customers who would never have been able to claim â including the elderly and those with existing medical conditions
the cost of ppi mis - selling is expected to spiral as complaints continue to flood in
the financial ombusdman continues to be swamped by 4,000 complaints a week , but banks complain that claims management firms â which bombard customers with nuisance text messages and phone calls â are driving many people to make bogus ppi complaints
