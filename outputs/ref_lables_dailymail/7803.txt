almost 20,000 years ago a woman was buried deep within a cave on the iberian peninsula , stained in sparkling red paint and adorned in yellow flowers
her grave provides the first evidence of an ancient magdalenian burial in the region and an engraved stone found near her remains appears to have been a makeshift tombstone
but the reasons why the female - dubbed ' the red lady of el mirã³n ' - was buried in such an elaborate tomb , close to an area where her peers would have lived day - to - day , continues to baffle archaeologists
the red lady 's remains ( burial site pictured ) were found in the el mirã³n cave in cantabria , spain
when the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material , later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal during the upper paleolithic period the magdalenian culture occupied much of western europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 bc. magdalenian hunters lived in caves , but sites have been found that consisted of shelters made from bones and animals skins
the red lady 's remains were first uncovered in 2010 during excavations of such a cave called el mirã³n cave in cantabria between santander and bilbao
after discovering a range of individual bones , researchers from the university of new mexico led by lawrence straus , unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave

' herself and her peers would have used stone tools , needles made from bones and projectile tips fashioned from the antlers of the deer and the cave would have been used for shelter and living quarters

' could these be indicators of the presence of the woman buried behind the block ? ' said the researchers in their paper ' " the red lady of el mirã³n "
her body was interred at the rear of the cave ( pictured ) where her peers would have lived and slept haematite comes from the greek for ' blood ' and red ochre ( pictured ) is often used as a pigment , particularly in cave paintings
but , they have speculated it was likely a burial ritual the eastern face of the block was additionally ' intensely stained ' with red ochre in the area near where the bones were found , creating a link between the block and body
' the burial is one of the most complex features of the magdalenian record in el mirã³n
' because many of the bones are stained with red ochre , it is possible that either the woman 's clothes had been stained with this material - for decoration and / or hide preservation - or her corpse was stained as part of a burial ritual
' anthropologists from the university of new mexico said : ' the burial is one of the most complex features of the magdalenian record in el mirã³n
the corpse was probably tightly flexed in fetal position [ and ] seems to have been laid on her left side with her back toward the block and chest toward the cave wall ' the cave site of el mirã³n is in the rio asã³n valley of cantabria , spain ( marked )
its opening is around 850ft ( 260 metres ) above sea level and the inside is around 100ft ( 30 metres ) deep , 52ft ( 16 metres wide ) the cave site of el mirã³n is in the rio asã³n valley of cantabria , spain
during the upper paleolithic the magdalenian culture occupied much of western europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 bc. magdalenian hunters lived in caves , but sites have been found that consisted of shelters made from bones and animals skins
in addition to el mirã³n , magdalenian sites have been found from portugal in the west to as far east as poland
the eastern face of the block ( shown on the left of this map ) was also stained ' with red ochre after discovering a series of individual bones ( plotted by red dots ) , researchers unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave
' using detailed mineralogical maps of the region , it is thought the magdalenian people mined the distinctive ochre from an outcrop in the modern - day city of santoã±a , situated around 12 miles ( 20km ) from the cave
' although lacking in clear grave offerings , the amounts of red ochre on the bones and in the burial infilling and the apparent association with rock art - both engravings and red ochre on the block against which the corpse 's back had probably rested - the evidence points to a ritualized interment , ' concluded the researchers
