a simple breath test that could help detect the early stages of stomach cancer has been developed by scientists
the screening system spots chemical signals in exhaled air that are linked to tumour development
about 7,000 people develop stomach cancer in the uk each year and most of these cases are in the advanced stages when they are diagnosed
â breathe : the tscreening system spots chemical signals in exhaled air that are linked to tumour development ( stock image ) previous research has found that other methods could be used to identify stomach cancer , but none looked at detecting pre-cancerous changes
in the study published online in the journal gut , breath samples were taken from 484 people , including 99 already diagnosed with stomach cancer
they were analysed by so - called nanomaterial sensors , which are able to read a chemical signal or pattern linked with stomach cancer based on very small particles in a patient âs breath
a large trial involving thousands of patients , including those with stomach cancer or pre-cancerous changes , is currently under way in europe to test the technology âs suitability as a screening method , they add
professor franceschi , of the university of michigan , said it paves the way for a â warning light â that signals how dangerous the cancer is
prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men , with 40,000 diagnosed in uk every year
