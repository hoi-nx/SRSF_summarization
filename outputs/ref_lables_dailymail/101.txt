stranded residents of last week 's devastating floods , who were unable to cross the water to attend an anzac day memorial service , were thrilled after a cornet player treated them to a rendition of the last post from the water 's edge
maitland local karen newton , a teacher and former professional musician , had just finished playing at the kurri kurri dawn service and was on her way to gillieston heights to deliver food to the victims of the floods
when she got to the water 's edge at testers hollow , ms karen newton plucked her cornet from the car and began playing the bugle call once again , across the water to the isolated residents in a goosebump - inducing moment
winter , who filmed the video and posted it online , said that ms karen newton 's act is what anzac day is all about
' after attending the dawn service at kurri kurri , i drove toward testers hollow , as i could see it was going to be a beautiful and rare sunrise , ' ms winter told daily mail australia
' it was serene , with the bird life abundant , a peaceful , calm , unhurried moment with the sound of the last post drifting along the water to what seemed an endless lake
' the flood could n't stop gillieston heights paying our respects ! thank you to all who have made today 's services happen out here ! lest we forget , ' the user said
the residents were separated from the town by massive flood water and were holding their own unplanned service the moment was all the more poignant and emotional as the residents of the isolated town remembered gillieston heights woman jarmain , who lost her life in the floods last week
ms karen newton faced the five residents who had come out to see the sun rising on anzac day and remembered flood victim jarmain around ten people immediately ran into the water , with four people stripping off and swimming frantically through the icy , fast - moving water
' speaking to the newcastle herald , bugle player ms karen newton said she thought of the soldiers who died in gallipoli and ms jarmain as she played the moving song
