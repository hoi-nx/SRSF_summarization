the sheriff who had former new england patriots player hernandez in custody for more than 18 months said tuesday that he 's a master manipulator and will probably do fine in prison now that he has been sentenced to life for murder
bristol county sheriff hodgson said hernandez knows how to use his charm and manipulate better than anyone he has ever seen , adding that the former football star is generally affable and polite and would try to use those qualities to get what he wanted at the bristol county house of corrections
hernandez was convicted april 15 of the 2013 killing of odin lloyd , who was dating the sister of hernandez 's fiancee
a lawyer for hernandez did not immediately return messages seeking comment on the sheriff 's remarks
after the verdict was delivered , staff from bristol county brought hernandez to a state prison not far from gillette stadium , where hernandez used to play football in front of tens of thousands of cheering fans
' hodgson said the 25 - year - old hernandez has an ability to compartmentalize things and lock out the negative
asked how he thinks hernandez will do in prison , hodgson said he thought he 'd be ok
he 'll be able to talk his way through everything , ' hodgson said , adding that disrespect is a ' hot - button ' issue for hernandez
hodgson said he had many conversations with hernandez about his father , who died unexpectedly when hernandez was 16 , with hernandez telling him how his father commanded respect whenever he walked into a room
