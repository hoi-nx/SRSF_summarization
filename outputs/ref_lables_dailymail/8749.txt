facebook has launched a new app called hello designed to give you more control over who can call you and how their details appear - even if their number is n't stored in your contacts book
it pulls in any publicly - shared data from a user 's facebook profile and lets you easily block unwanted callers
it pulls in any publicly - shared data from a user 's facebook profile and lets you easily block unwanted callers the free app is currently in testing and is only available on android devices in the us
' billions of calls are made everyday on mobile phones and people often have very little information about who âs calling them , ' explained facebook 's product manager andrea vaccari in a blog post
' hello connects with facebook so you can see who âs calling , block unwanted calls and search for people and places
' when a user receives a call , hello shows them info about who âs calling , even if they do nât have that number saved
users will only see information that people have already shared on facebook , and not everyone links their mobile number to their account so this could be the app 's downfall
from the settings menu in hello people can block specific numbers and adjust whether they want to automatically block calls from commonly blocked numbers
when a user receives a call hello shows them info about who âs calling , even if they do nât have that number saved ( pictured left )
if a call is made and the number is n't linked to a facebook account , hello simply shows the number like a traditional caller id
elsewhere , when users search for people and businesses on facebook they can call them with one tap when hello is installed
