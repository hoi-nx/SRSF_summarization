a mere 53 hours to kick - off and all is serene at the training base of qpr
mowers clip along on distant pitches as the sun beats down and the whitewashed pavilion is brightened by pots of forget - me - nots , a flower which could be adopted as the emblem of relegation
qpr boss ramsey ( centre ) is one of seven managers trying to keep their club in the premier league ramsey 's side host west ham on saturday as they look to climb out of the relegation zone with four games left cesc fabregas ' 88th minute strike saw chelsea grab a late 1 - 0 win at qpr earlier this month it will be the same at newcastle , aston villa , leicester city , sunderland and hull
even at burnley , where dyche was keen on thursday to stress his club feel no pressure because their financial commitments are so much less than their rivals
these everyday , human anxieties trouble premier league footballers , too
â four of the bottom seven did not play in the premier league last weekend and watched helplessly as leicester city won again , tightening the pack
burnley manager dyche says his side have had to compete with the smallest wage budget in the league newcastle swansea ( home ) - april 25 leicester city ( away ) - may 2 west bromwich albion ( home ) - may 9 qpr ( away ) - may 16 west ham ( home ) - may 24 aston villa manchester city ( away ) - april 25 everton ( home ) - may 2 west ham ( home ) - may 9 southampton ( away ) - may 16 burnley ( home ) - may 24 sunderland stoke ( away ) - april 25 southampton ( home ) - may 2 everton ( away ) - may 9 leicester city ( home ) - may 16 arsenal ( away ) - may 20 chelsea ( away ) - may 24 hull crystal palace ( away ) - april 25 liverpool ( home ) - april 28 arsenal ( home ) - may 2 burnley ( home ) - may 9 tottenham ( away ) - may 16 manchester united ( home ) - may 24 leicester city burnley ( away ) - april 25 chelsea ( home ) - april 29 newcastle ( home ) - may 2 southampton ( home ) - may 9 sunderland ( away ) - may 16 qpr ( home ) - may 24 qpr west ham ( home ) - april 25 liverpool ( away ) - may 2 manchester city ( away ) - may 9 newcastle ( home ) - may 16 leicester city ( away ) - may 24 burnley leicester city ( home ) - april 25 west ham ( away ) - may 2 hull ( away ) - may 9 stoke ( home ) - may 16 aston villa ( away ) - may 24 note : fixtures in may subject to change for television schedule
now , off the bottom at last , it will get tense again as they head for turf moor
it âs a very difficult feat to achieve for any side , let alone one on the foot of the table
but we âre not in a position to sit back and enjoy it
â my perspective is that we âre still in the bottom three
â sunderland âs dick advocaat and qpr âs ramsey have fixed their survival targets at 35 points
at newcastle , carver has 35 and is still uneasy
leonardo ulloa was on the scoresheet as leicester city beat swansea 2 - 0 in the premier league on april 18 that win elevated pearson 's ( right ) side off the bottom of the table and into 18th in the premier league newcastle manager carver believes his team need four points from five games to avoid relegation how the league form table looks like as of april 23 â you can never tell , â said carver
â for me , we need four points from five games
â sunderland were last year âs houdini : bottom with six to play and doomed according to many by virtue of a daunting fixture list
they lost the last game and still finished in 14th , five points clear , helped by connor wickham âs burst of five goals in three games
connor wickham has scored only four since - no - one at sunderland has more in the premier league this season â and these acts of escapology are more difficult without a goal supply
â for him to be at a club fighting at the bottom is a mismatch , â said tim sherwood , but aston villa still require points as they head to manchester city
will he be enough ? burnley have danny ings , almost out of contract and without a goal in more than two months
connor wickham scored five goals in three games last season to help sunderland avoid relegation â we normally say promotion is worth Â£ 100 - 120m , â said professor wilson
clubs wo nât get the full tv rights payment which is about Â£ 80m but they will get parachute payments
sponsors pay a premium for the premier league and those deals will end and salaries can quickly eat up this smaller revenue if there are no clauses to reduce wages or allow a quick sale
â fates unknown , clubs sketch out alternative recruitment strategies
charlie austin has scored 17 goals in the league for qpr this season - but they still find themselves in 19th relegated clubs will receive a parachute payment of Â£ 25m next season , followed by Â£ 20m in 2016 - 17 and two more of Â£ 10m if they do not go back up , as fewer seem to do
â it 's truly squeaky bum time in the premier league relegation battle as just nine points separates the bottom seven teams
ramsey ( qpr ) ' if we win three games i think we will stay up
' qpr manager ramsey ( centre ) feels they will avoid relegation if they win three more league games tim sherwood ( aston villa ) ' i do n't know how many points it will take
but as far as i 'm concerned it 's about making sure we 're back to business when we play burnley
' leicester city manager pearson ( right ) hopes his side can continue their momentum against burnley dyche ( burnley ) ' the biggest psychological difference is that others are talking about relegation
our fuel is about staying in the premier league
we are actually looking for the goal of being in the premier league
