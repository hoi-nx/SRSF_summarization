liverpool 's fa cup semi-final defeat has put the club under scrutiny and guaranteed this campaign will be judged a failure
the burning ambition at anfield is for liverpool to be champions league regulars with the potential to win the barclays premier league
are liverpool heading for mediocrity ? or is there sufficient talent to ensure the mistakes are corrected and progress can be resumed ? a huge summer beckons and there is no margin for error
philippe coutinho opens the scoring for liverpool against villa with a smart chipped finish at wembley christian benteke ( centre ) scores for villa to make it 1 - 1 and start tim sherwood 's side 's recovery england midfielder fabian delph fires in villa 's second goal to win the game and book a place in the fa cup final for all the praise that came rodgers â way last season , when he masterminded an unexpected and thrilling challenge for the title , the manager must accept criticism
it was smart to change liverpool âs formation to 3 - 4 - 3 , sparking an impressive 13 - game unbeaten run in the league
he switched systems ( from 3 - 4 - 2 - 1 to 4 - 3 - 3 to 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) but liverpool never found a rhythm
changes had to be made after a poor start during the 1 - 1 draw with basle that led to liverpool âs exit from the champions league
he was outwitted by louis van gaal when manchester united visited in march â it was a mistake not to start gerrard â and balotelli âs signing has given rodgers a problem that he has not been able to solve all season
rodgers is innovative , thorough and , crucially , still learning his trade

fabio borini has no anfield future and nor does balotelli
raheem sterling is at loggerheads with liverpool over the new deal he has been offered
liverpool have agreed a new deal with henderson but skrtel is thinking about what he has been offered
rodgers did not want another window like last summer âs , with a raft of new faces , but that looks unavoidable
in the past two years , liverpool have tried to sign henrikh mkhitaryan , diego costa , willian , yevhen konoplyanka and alexis sanchez without success
sami khedira âs wages are out of liverpool âs range
can he do it next season ? he has the ability and goalscoring instinct but he will be no use to rodgers if he is not fit for the major games
balotelli ( centre ) is one of a number of liverpool signings that have failed to impress this season glen johnson was sent on as a late sub for joe allen on sunday is expected to leave the club this summer rodgers is keen for milner , pictured in 2012 , to help fill the void left by the outgoing gerrard and finally there is the squad âs spirit and attitude
daniel sturridge has spent much of the season watching from the stands due to a succession of injuries liverpool 's players , including their captain , were outclassed by villa at wembley and deservedly lost
