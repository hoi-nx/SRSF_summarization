chelsea welcome manchester united on saturday tea - time with the stakes sky - high for the premier league rivals
louis van gaal 's manchester united , meanwhile , have hit top gear and it appears that all roads lead to the champions league
here , sportsmail asks 10 key questions ahead of this weekend âs big match â¦ premier league leaders chelsea host a resurgent manchester united in the premier league on saturday blues veteran didier drogba celebrates after handing chelsea the lead at old trafford in their previous clash robin van persie rescued a draw with an injury time equaliser in the game in october 2014 will angel di maria get a look in ? manchester united have won four on the spin in which di maria has not started
angel di maria is likely to start another game on the bench after losing his first team place the argentina international 's form has slumped since making a bright start to his premier league career sports analysts bsports predict that a chelsea win is easily the most likely outcome at stamford bridge will juan mata make chelsea pay ? keeping di maria out of the side is juan mata , and deservedly so
juan mata has been an integral part of manchester united 's rise since scoring a sensational brace against liverpool the spain international could return to haunt his former club after being pushed out at stamford bridge ( left ) will a manchester united victory blow open the title race ? yes
it would leave chelsea seven points clear of arsenal â having both played 32 - with a trip to the emirates on the horizon
but perhaps manchester united â who would be five points behind having played a game more were they to win â represent the biggest danger to chelsea âs crown
not all colombians are as good as tino asprillia it would appear â¦ radamel falcao 's ( right ) role at manchester united has been reduced to that of substitute both colombians have failed to live up to expectations following big money deals to sign them will jose mourinho meet his match in louis ? jose mourinho has long since ruled the roost in the premier league , rival after rival lining up to lay praise at the feet of the special one
louis van gaal ( left ) and jose mourinho will see two of the biggest egos in football collide on saturday jose mourinho and van gaal embrace after their first meeting in october , will there be smiles again ? will wayne rooney remind chelsea what they missed out on in 2013 ? it was during the summer of 2013 that jose mourinho attempted to lure manchester united âs star to stamford bridge â and boy did he come close
jose mourinho holds manchester united âs skipper in the highest regard and must still regret not seeing home a transfer which had looked very much on the cards
wayne rooney came close to signing for chelsea in 2013 before being convinced to stay by david moyes the england captain has been the inspiration behind manchester united 's six - game winning run will cesc fabregas remind manchester united what they missed out on in 2014 ? it was a no - brainer , was nât it ? with fabregas desperate for a return to england and manchester united in desperate need of guile in the middle of the park , surely they would pull out all of the stops to bring cesc fabregas to old trafford ? instead , he went to chelsea and has been inspirational as the blues have eased to within touching distance of the title
cesc fabregas has been clocking up the assists at chelsea after being snubbed by manchester united last summer the spaniard would have formed a formidable midfield partnership with michael carrick at old trafford can chelsea cope without diego costa ? the spaniard âs form had stuttered before his injury , with just three goals in 10
didier drogba is far from the force he once was and manchester united âs defence will be grateful that diego costa is not in opposition
diego costa is escorted off the field against stoke and has been ruled out of the match on saturday the spain international was on fire at the start of the season but has tailed off in recent months who will come out on top in the pfa player of the year nominees â eden hazard or david de gea ? hazard , it seems , is a shoo - in for the prestigious prize , and with good reason
eden hazard ( right ) has arguably been the blues most influential player in the title chase hazard is competing with united no 1 david de gea for the pfa player of the year award the manchester united custodian has kept 13 clean sheets and , having matured into the goalkeeper sir alex ferguson always thought he would do , it is little surprise real madrid are courting spain âs no.1
were chelsea to get a penalty â pitching eden hazard against de gea â it would certainly prove a fascinating duel
