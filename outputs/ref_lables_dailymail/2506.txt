the inquiry into the iraq war , lead by sir john chilcot , began in 2009 , stopped taking evidence in 2011 , but will not report until 2016 , a source said the findings of a long - awaited inquiry into the iraq war are unlikely to be unveiled this year
further delays to sir john chilcot âs inquiry into the war were reported by bbc âs newsnight and will fuel claims those criticised over the war are trying to bury bad news
but it has now been suggested the findings of the inquiry , which began in 2009 , will not be published until 2016
the inquiry - which stopped taking evidence in 2011 - was also set back by the death of one of its members and staff losses
the publication of the report was expected to be delayed until after the election as it is thought to be highly critical of senior political figures , including tony blair , but will likely not report until even later
