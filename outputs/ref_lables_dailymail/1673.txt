teachers can judge the behaviour of black students more harshly than while pupils , new research has suggested
a study by researchers at stanford university examined the reaction of secondary and primary school teachers in the us to student race
they found that the teachers were more likely to view youngsters who they thought were black as troublemakers than those they thought were white
teachers tend to see black pupils as more likely to cause trouble in the future if they have misbehaved in the past , according to new research that attempted to examine the impact of racial stereotypes in us schools the researchers say this may go someway towards explaining why black children are often disciplined more at schools compared to other pupils
professor eberhardt , a psychologist at stanford university , said : ' the fact that black children are disproportionately disciplined in school is behind dispute
and now a new study has found that people really do have a tendency to become more racist during a recession
in four experiments , involving 285 non-black us , scientists david amodio and amy krosch found people see faces different during an economic downturn
the researchers found that racial stereotypes had little impact on the teachers ' views of the pupils after one infraction
however , the second piece of misbehaviour was seen as ' more troubling ' when committed by a black student rather than a white one
the researchers examined the views of both primary and secondary school teachers to see if their opinions of fictional pupils were altered by racial stereotypes and found they tended to judge black students more harshly in the us black students are disproportionately punished for misbehaviour compared to white students the teachers also tended to want to discipline black students more harshly as they were more likely to see the misbehaviour as part of a pattern
' the researchers suggest that psychological interventions could be used to help change the stereotypes of black students influencing the way teachers treat pupils
