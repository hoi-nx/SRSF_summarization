a recent college graduate diagnosed with genital herpes is stepping into the limelight in attempt to destigmatize sti
ella dawson , a recent graduate of wesleyan who resides in new york city , was diagnosed with herpes two years ago and says she 's been dropping the ' herpes bomb ' about six months after she had her first outbreak
i have herpes : ella dawson has genital herpes and she is sharing her story so that less people with the virus can feel the guilt and shame that sometimes accompanies the common skin condition ' do nât worry , ' she remembers him saying
because i have genital herpes
dawson said that even though herpes is often the bud of the joke in popular culture , it 's a real issue affecting at least one in six americans
dawson said that she felt empowered after telling someone she had herpes because it humanized the sti in a way that made it less of a stigma
' because when a real person â a woman you know and respect â casually mentions having herpes , it stops being a punchline and starts being someone 's reality
' do n't strain : dawson says that people who have herpes should not feel ' dirty or wrong ' and should be aware that the virus is manageable and more common than people would expect according to the cdc about 17 per cent of people ages 14 - 19 have genital herpes caused by hsv2
that percentage is only of people who choose to get tested and the actual number of people who have the virus is likely much higher
' courage : ella dawson has the courage to tell people about her virus because it will humanize the problem for sufferers worldwide ' herpes was seen as this marker of being promiscuous or bad or evil , ' he said
a study in the journal of health psychology conducted in 2011 found several survey respondents with sti reported feelings like ' less of a person
do n't sit in the dark : dawson says that people should communicate openly about herpes since so many people have it
