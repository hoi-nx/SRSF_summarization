nicola sturgeon was hailed the shock winner of last night âs tv debate according to one snap poll , inflicting a damaging blow to miliband âs election hopes
in a nightmare for labour , which is battling to fend off an snp landslide in its traditional scotland heartlands , miss sturgeon was deemed well ahead â with mr miliband trailing cameron and farage
overall , an average of four polls of viewers put mr cameron just ahead â and to the tories â delight , he also emerged with a clear lead on who is seen â most capable of leading the country â
peeping out : the conservative poster depicting miliband in nicola sturgeon 's pocket the tories rushed out a poster depicting miliband in nicola sturgeon âs pocket last night â saying the snp leader had â dominated â him in the debate
a hapless - looking labour leader was seen peering out of the top pocket of a contented miss sturgeon , who triumphed in one of the main post-debate polls
if labour fails to win a majority in the election , it is expected that mr miliband may have to come to a deal with the scottish nationalists if he is to get into number 10
the poster follows a similar one released last month showing mr miliband in the pocket of former snp leader alex salmond , who has declared that he will help write the labour budget

in the key moments in last night âs two hour , seven - way clash : miss nicola sturgeon , a veteran of tv debates in the scotland referendum campaign , repeatedly left the labour leader discomforted â and forced him to suggest that labour is not now committed to plans to find another Â£ 30billion through tax rises and spending cuts , which he voted for earlier this year
but miss nicola sturgeon also gave mr cameron and clegg a rough ride , saying it was time to â break the old boys â network at westminster â
in an early intervention , she mocked the coalition leaders for arguing about their future spending plans , saying : â it is really interesting watching cameron and clegg attack each other , when they have been working hand in glove for the past five years
challenging the labour leader directly , she said : â we need to invest and grow our way out of austerity â why did you vote for Â£ 30billion of cuts ? â as mr cameron looked on smiling , mr miliband responded weakly : â that was nât what the vote was for
â mr clegg ambushed the prime minister at the first opportunity after five years of coalition , saying : â i believe you need to make the necessary cuts because you have to
â mr cameron retorted : â i defend all our decisions â you have a pick - and - mix approach
