because , since monday , the family have been sharing their home with arguably los angeles ' most famous mountain lion , p-22
the cougar , the other name for the species , has made his home in the crawlspace under the house in the hilly los feliz neighborhood - and has so far resisted all attempts to get him to move out
ten hours later - despite animal welfare officers using a prod , and even firing tennis balls and bean bags at it - he was still refusing to move
it is thought the lion crossed the 405 and 101 freeways more than three years ago , as he travelled from his home in the santa monica mountains
he has been living in nearby griffith park ever since - where scientists managed to catch and tag him
but his fame reached new heights after national geographic photographer steve winter managed to capture him walking in front of the hollywood sign in 2013
fame : p-22 is best - known for being pictured in front of the hollywood sign in 2013 hiding : it is thought the lion crossed two freeways to get to his home in griffith park , but it is not known how long he has been living in the crawl space in the los feliz hills beanbags : the animal rescue workers have even resorted to using beanbags to move the lion however , all this is nothing to the furore surrounding his latest move
they continued with their attempts to dislodge p-22 , starting with poking him gently with a long prod , but that did little â other than temporarily lose the pricey gopro camera they 'd attached to the end of it that fell off
