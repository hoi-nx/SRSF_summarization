miliband is pressing on with his controversial cap rents , despite warnings from experts that plans will backfire labour 's plans to impose rent controls are â economically illiterate â and will slash investment in new housing , leading to more tenants being evicted by their landlords , experts warned last night
miliband yesterday confirmed he would press on with controversial plans to cap rents despite warnings from housing experts , business and even labour figures that they will backfire
he said rent controls â demanded by the militant unite union that bankrolls labour â would give millions of â forgotten â renters a fairer deal by helping those stuck in so - called generation rent by soaring house prices
but the generation rent campaign group said his plans were â riddled with loopholes â and may make tenants â lives worse
under the proposals , landlords would have to offer three - year tenancies and would be banned from raising rent above inflation during this time
alex hilton , director of generation rent , said long tenancies were welcome but the proposal would give landlords an incentive to evict their tenants and would not keep rent down , adding : â this is because they have no plans to limit rent rises between tenancies â or after your first three years are up
â worse than this , labour âs planning new ways for landlords to evict you within that period , for example to sell your home or get it back for other reasons
these loopholes are scary when you think they âre attached to a big financial incentive to use them â because that âs the only way they will be able to put rent up in the first three years
senior tories called the proposal â drivel â and said it would suppress house building and push rents up
the confederation of british industry said the way to tackle the housing crisis was to build more homes , and warned the plans could discourage investment , thereby forcing up rents in the long term

housing spokesman emma reynolds was forced on the back foot yesterday after footage emerged of her in 2013 saying : â i do nât think rent controls are going to work in practice
â yesterday , she said she meant â seventies - style controls â and said labour âs plan was different
he said they would give landlords a huge incentive to raise rents at the start of a tenancy , adding : â labour has unwittingly announced a policy that could devastate cities and exacerbate the housing crisis
â the institute of economic affairs said the proposal â would result in higher rents , a reduction in the quality of rented property and in the supply of homes to rent without improving affordability â
