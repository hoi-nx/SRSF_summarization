ian bell insists england did not underestimate the west indies ahead of the first test , despite some injudicious comments from the incoming chairman of the ecb
outgoing yorkshire chairman colin graves , who starts work as giles clarke 's successor next month , upped the stakes before the tour started by declaring the hosts ' mediocre ' and promised ' some inquiries ' if england did not win the series
the west indies hung on for a draw on an unresponsive pitch in antigua last week and the prospect of a similar deck in grenada on tuesday means fulfilling colin graves ' expectations could be a tough task
ian bell says he never expected england to win the series in the west indies without a struggle but ian bell , after 106 tests and 11 years on the international circuit , never expected anything different
' we 're not in control of those comments ( from colin graves ) , but we know and respect this west indies side incredibly , ' said the 33 - year - old
you never expect that in any international cricket , let alone a test team
' there 's some good young players in that west indies side
' ian bell may have said all the right things but west indies opener devon smith , who will become the first grenadan to play test on the island , revealed that colin graves ' comments had not gone unnoticed
ian bell scored a magnificent hundred in the first test , but england failed to see out the win ' they said in the press they would win three to love , that 's the first one down and we 're looking forward to the next two to come , ' he said
england have the pressure because they are looking for the victory
that places the onus on england to move the matches forward , but ian bell believes the west indies are harbouring their own hopes of victory
ian bell was full of praise for jason holder ( right ) who dug in to help save the test for the west indies ' would we be disappointed if it was 0 - 0 going home ? yes of course we would
while the exiled kevin pietersen attempts to force his way back into the test side with surrey , ian bell is focused on the young talents who are currently wearing the three lions
west indian batsman devon smith admitted his side were inspired by colin graves ' comments ' mo is a quality batter and a quality bowler so we will have to fit him in somewhere
