lee will leave new york with his head held high and a burgeoning reputation firmly intact
a dramatic , frenetic 12 rounds here saw the irishman sent sprawling in the very first against the dangerous quillin , the man who vacated the wbo middleweight title lee won so gloriously in las vegas last december before the result was deemed a draw
it was the first time the reigning champion had gone the distance
no mean feat considering he fought for a lengthy period with a strained biceps muscle in his left arm

yet this was still one hell of a contest and when the judges correctly called it a tie , no - one was really arguing
while it was scored 113 - 112 , 112 - 113 , 113 - 113 , the statistics told a different story lee threw more punches ( 299 - 267 ) and connected with greater frequency ( 113 - 103 )
not maybe enough to have destroyed quillin 's unbeaten record , but impressively solid and energetic
lee , however , was hard on himself
another meeting with quillin , although intriguing with the title on the line , is highly unlikely
lee was knocked to the canvas by quillin during the very first round of the contest in new york lee admitted he had been ' lazy ' in the early stages of the fight , leading to his knockdown and standing count quillin is ordered to the corner after lee falls later in the bout ' if my next fight is quillin it should be in ireland

a razor - sharp combination had lee reeling again but the limerick man is a true warrior
a far better third saw quillin on the backfoot for the first time as , after such a frenetic start , everything began to calm somewhat
lee went down again and although it was originally scored as a knockdown it later emerged quillin had stepped on his foot
heading into the sixth , quillin was ahead in the eyes of the judges
quillin connects with lee 's cheek with a crunching right quillin again makes contact but over the course of the whole fight , he landed fewer punches the comeback came at the end of the seventh , a crunching right leaving a very open quillin tumbling
and when the last bell rang , lee and the amiable quillin hugged and showed a deep admiration towards each other which has been evident all week
