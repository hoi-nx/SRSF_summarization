clarkson last night launched into a bizarre rant about being sacked from the bbc , saying the upside meant he could now swear without being reprimanded
the former top gear presenter made his comments when he was guest of honour at a charity auction in the cotswolds
he also joked about ' trawling the job centre ' for a hosting job when he spotted an opening for the charity auction
in a typical clarkson moment , he mistook a male bidder for a female but responded by saying : ' i have worked with james may , it is easy to get confused in these situations
