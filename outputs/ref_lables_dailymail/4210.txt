doing so could put the economic recovery at risk by allowing labour back into power , said the tory leader
cameron tonight issued an impassioned plea for ukip voters to ' come back home ' to the conservatives mr cameron also conceded that he understood the â frustrations â of ukip voters

a poll in tory - held thanet south â where mr nigel farage is running for parliament â shows him in second place , and pollsters now believe ukip will win just a handful of seats
cameron 's hopes of staying in number 10 have been buoyed by opinion polls showing a steady squeeze in support for ukip

mr nigel farage is on 30 per cent , with labour in third on 29 per cent
the prime minister was joined by george osborne for a speech at the bristol and bath science park this evening but there are deep concerns that support for ukip , fuelled by the tory â failure to meet their pledge to cut immigration to â tens of thousands â , could swing enough votes in other seats to hand ed miliband a victory
mr cameron , who also promised a referendum on europe , said the government had turned around the economy and cut taxes for working people
mr cameron has previously accused nigel farage supporters of being ' fruitcakes and loonies ' â to keep generating the jobs and the growth our country needs , come back to us , come back home to us , â he pleaded
mr cameron said the prospect of a minority labour government held in power by the snp was a â nightmare scenario â and said the tory â need â ukip support
â mr nigel farage immediately attacked the prime minister and said he would not win ukip voters back
