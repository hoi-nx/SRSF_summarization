mother - of - two anna survived after spending four days in intensive care with blood poisoning , pictured with her son harry patients â lives are at risk from blood poisoning because hospitals are not implementing a standard treatment that can double their chances of survival , experts have warned
sepsis , previously known as septicaemia , affects more than 100,000 britons a year and kills 37,000 â more than breast , bowel and prostate cancer combined
now a snapshot nhs study reveals that on one surgical ward at a leading teaching hospital , 90 per cent of patients failed to get the correct treatment , involving a simple set of lifesaving measures known as sepsis six
sepsis six involves blood tests to check for infection ; testing the level of lactate , a chemical produced when cells are starved of oxygen ; giving oxygen and iv fluids to protect organs and raise dangerously low blood pressure ; checking urine hourly to monitor fluid levels and kidney function ; and administering antibiotics to clear any underlying infection
the study of 23 patients with sepsis at edinburgh royal infirmary revealed just one in ten had their lactate levels tested
dr ron daniels , chief executive of the uk sepsis trust who helped devise sepsis six , warns that , despite being a small sample , the finding of the study was far from unusual
â sadly this and other studies show patients are not getting access to a treatment that saves lives
â some 90 per cent of patients were not given correct treatment to prevent blood poisoning on a surgical ward at edinburgh royal infirmary , an nhs study revealed sepsis occurs when the immune system overreacts to an infection , causing multiple organ failure if not treated quickly
â delays in the identification and treatment of sepsis can have serious consequences for patients , â says dr seng wong , who carried out the edinburgh royal infirmary audit
his research also found sepsis six awareness improved after a three - month staff training and a poster campaign
more than half of subsequent patients had their lactate measured , 60 per cent were given oxygen and 90 per cent had their urine measured
