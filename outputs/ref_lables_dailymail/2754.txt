a new model for hiv progression shows that it spreads in a similar way to some computer ' worms '
hiv specialists and network security experts at ucl ( ucl ) made the disovery after creating a simulation of how the virus spreads they worked together to build a model for this ' hybrid spreading ' which accurately predicted patients ' progression from hiv to aids in a major clinical trial - and say early treatment is key to staving off aids
as hiv progresses , it reduces the number of active t - cells in the body until the immune system can not function correctly , a state known as ' acquired immune deficiency syndrome ' or aids
however , the new model predicts that treatment should start as soon as possible after infection to prevent aids from developing in the long term
the teams noticed that the spread of hiv through the body using two methods - via the bloodstream and directly between cells - was similar to how some computer worms spread through both the internet and local networks respectively to infect as many computers as possible
the model was inspired by similarities between hiv and computer worms such as the highly damaging ' conficker ' worm , first detected in 2008 , which has infected military and police computer networks across europe and is still active today
lead author changwang , of ucl , said : ' hiv and conficker have a lot in common
' detailed sample data from 17 hiv patients from london were used to verify the model , showing that hybrid spreading provides the best explanation for hiv progression and highlighting the benefits of early treatment
co-senior author professor benny chain , of ucl , said : ' the number of hiv cells in the bloodstream is always relatively low , and our model shows that hiv spread through the bloodstream alone would not be enough to cause aids
the model was inspired by similarities between hiv and computer worms such as the highly damaging ' conficker ' worm , first detected in 2008 , which has infected military and police computer networks across europe and is still active today
as such , if hiv has already spread to an area rich in t - cells by the time treatment begins , preventing its spread through the bloodstream will not stop aids
