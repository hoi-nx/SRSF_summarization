a pregnant meteorologist has called out the bullies who viciously attacked her appearance by reading their hateful messages on air - before admitting that their cruel words had taken their toll on her
kristi gordon , of british columbia 's news channel global bc , was joined by her fellow anchors robin and squire as they reflected upon the degrading comments the mom has received about her second pregnancy on an episode of the online - only news segment news hour plus - with her reading some of the message aloud
' nowhere on north america tv have we seen a weather reader so gross as you ( sic ) , ' kristi gordon read from one of the messages
' kristi gordon , who is due to give birth in three months , explained that she received the harsh message the day before she taped the march 26 segment and admitted that it ' kicked off a bit of a conversation '
she and her co-anchors laughed the comments off , particularly the group 's misspelling of the word global bc
' first of all , if you are going to diss us , please learn how to spell , ' squire noted , before he explained that global bc is spelled with an ' a ' - not an ' e ' like the group had written
and while they joked about the bizarre jibe , it was n't the only scathing message kristi gordon had received regarding her pregnancy and her wardrobe
' harsh words : kristi gordon , who can be seen giving a weather report , was also criticized for wearing form - fitting clothing because ' looser tops would look more professional ' after kristi gordon finished reading the messages , squire joked : ' haters gon na hate as some rapper may have said , ' before robin interjected : ' taylor swift , i think actually said that
' kristi gordon revealed that she was actually expecting these types of messages because she had received a similar level of hateful jibes during her first pregnancy
' but kristi gordon went on to say that , subconsciously , her critics ' hurtful words had gotten to her
