the prospect of a ' blukip ' alliance between cameron and farage is now just as likely as a coalition between the snp and labour , clegg claimed today
mr clegg 's remarks come after mr farage held out an olive branch to the prime minister last night - as he said he wanted to work with him to prevent a possible labour government
the lib dem released a new campaign poster this morning warning of the danger of a ' blukip ' alliance between the tories and ukip the ukip leader called on tory to vote tactically for him in seats where they can not win in order to help keep the tory leader as prime minister
and in the strongest hint yet that they could work together , mr farage dropped his demand that the tories ditch mr cameron before any post election deal
' mr clegg added : ' everyone knows that cameron and miliband wo n't win this general election outright
' the deputy prime minister said there was a ' very real danger ' that ukip and northern ireland 's dup could hold mr cameron to ' ransom ' in the event of a second hung parliament but he added : ' what 's equally possible is an alliance that will drag britain further and further to the right : blukip â a bloc of right wingers from ukip , the conservatives and the dup that could hold the balance of power
mr farage also revealed that he has already held informal discussions with tories about potential post-election arrangements
yesterday , as he launched his party 's manifesto , mr farage called on mr cameron to join with him to lock miliband and the snp 's salmond out of downing street
the lib dem leader 's remarks come after mr farage ( right ) held out an olive branch to the prime minister ( pictured in glasgow this morning left ) last night - as he said he wanted to work with him to prevent a possible labour government ukip has reduced its list of targets to just ten seats as it has been squeezed in the polls , but mr farage believes in seats such as great grimsby and dudley north it has a better chance than the tories at snatching them from labour
asked if it was time that conservative supporters realised that ukip could help them stop a labour government , mr farage said they needed to vote tactically
' mr farage previously said that mr cameron would need to step down as tory leader before he could do any sort of post-election deal
' mr cameron a fortnight ago urged tory supporters who have defected to ukip to ' come home ' and pleaded with them not to use their vote in the general election as a ' protest '
yesterday asked what his message was to tory voters , mr farage called on them to work with him to bring forward the referendum mr cameron has promised on eu membership by 2017
' mr farage said he would also want the tories to match his commitment to nato 's target of spending 2 per cent of national income on defence
