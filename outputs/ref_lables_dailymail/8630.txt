fabregas was booed by large portions of the arsenal supporters upon his return to the emirates stadium fabregas was cheered - albeit sarcastically - by the same set of fans when he was booked for diving however when the chelsea midfielder was substituted in the dying moments he was given an applause hull ( away ) - may 4 swansea ( home ) - may 11 manchester united ( away ) - may 17 sunderland ( home ) may 20 west brom ( home ) - may 24 there have been genuine signs of promise in n5 and reasons for optimism in 2015 , even if wenger was unable to add what would have been a significant other by ending his winless run against mourinho
â it âs about our club and our team , not about me , â said wenger
arsenal are third in the premier league , level on points with manchester city but with a game in hand â we want to finish the season well
â to finish as runners - up , for the first time in a decade , and successfully defend the fa cup , can be framed as progress
more significant is the development of hector bellerin , francis coquelin and nacho monreal
together with a philosophical tweak , it has made arsenal a more solid defensive unit , capable of taking points from manchester city and chelsea and winning at manchester united in the fa cup
francis coquelin and nacho monreal were both ready to make smart fouls at the expense of yellow cards to stop the visitors as they sought to counter quickly
hector bellerin has been outstanding and few have contained hazard this season as effectively as the teenager did on sunday , but arsenal need more defensive protection and plan to prioritise a defensive midfielder and a new goalkeeper in the summer
â we have closed the gap since the start of the season , â said wenger
â with five to play , arsenal trail the champions - elect by 10 points and must concentrate on catching chelsea in the knowledge their rivals from the capital âs west will strengthen again in the summer
spanish defender hector bellerin ( left ) has come on leaps and bounds for the gunners this season francis coquelin of arsenal evades fabregas of chelsea during the 0 - 0 draw at emirates stadium on sunday ozil had glimpses of goal , but branislav ivanovic did to alexis sanchez what hector bellerin did to hazard
in the sky sports studio , arsenal legend thierry henry questioned the quality of 18 - goal striker olivier giroud
â wenger has to strengthen , â said thierry henry
nacho monreal ( left ) is among the gunners players who have impressed recently and did so against chelsea â chelsea struggled last year but they went out to buy ( thibaut ) courtois , fabregas , matic and ( diego ) costa
thierry henry said arsenal will not win the premier league if they do not buy another striker but chelsea do have individuals who would offer extra physical presence and match - winning know - how which would provide a platform for those like ozil , alexis sanchez and cazorla to deliver
the arsenal manager has two more years on what could be his final contract
