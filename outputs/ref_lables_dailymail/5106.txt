real madrid âs Â£ 2.3m , 16 - year - old wonderkid odegaard has been dropped from the club 's b - team castilla because results drastically improve when he is not on the pitch
castilla , managed by first - team coach in waiting zidane , were top of their regional third division when odegaard arrived at the club in january , but after he made his debut the team âs form dipped dramatically and following a run of four straight defeats , they dropped to seventh place , four points off the lead
odegaard , pictured in training with the real madrid first team , has been dropped by the castilla side odegaard is said to be on a different wavelength to his castilla team - mates as he rarely trains with them zidane ( with odegaard behind him , right ) dropped the norwegian as he looks to secure promotion odegaard was chased by a host of top european clubs before he left stromsgodset for real madrid
age : 16 ( d.o.b. 17/12/98 ) born : drammen , norway position : attacking midfielder clubs : stromsgodset ( 2014 - 15 ) , real madrid ( 2015 - castilla appearances : 7 castilla goals : 1 international appearances : 3 international goals : 0 there have been suggestions that other b - team players resented the fact that odegaard was training with the first team three times a week and then starting castilla games very much on a different wavelength to his team - mates
the norway international might be benefiting from training with cristiano ronaldo and gareth bale but it was not helping him become a cohesive part of the castilla side
the teenager was involved with norway on international duty last week and castilla prospered without him if castilla fail to go up to the second division then odegaard will be loaned out next season odegaard signed for real madrid in a Â£ 2.3m deal in january as carlo ancelotti placed his trust in the 16 - year - old the norwegian âs future is also tied to whether or not promotion is achieved
