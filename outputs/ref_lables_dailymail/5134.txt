even when the cricket is torpid and the scoring rate is barely more than two an over , life with england will never be dull while stokes is around
stokes was at the centre of everything on a hard - fought first day of the second test as england strove to set up the victory that is essential to their wellbeing
first the durham all - rounder injured himself , then he struck immediately when he came on to bowl and finally became embroiled in a heated dispute with samuels that led to him being admonished by umpire steve davis
stokes athletically fields a shot from samuels off his own bowling at the grenada in saint george 's australian umpire steve davis reprimands england 's stokes after he exchanged words with samuels stokes went wicketless in 32 overs in the first test , even throwing away a dismissal for the second time by overstepping , and ended up in a strident twitter debate with his critics
thankfully stokes was able to continue after treatment but was still feeling the injury when he came on to bowl , with england battling for the wickets they desperately needed to justify cook âs decision to insert west indies
kraigg brathwaite is first to fall as james anderson bowls the west indies opener with a massive in - swinger stokes races in to celebrate with james anderson after the opening bowler makes the breakthrough with a sensational delivery james anderson 's 84mph huge in - swinger bamboozled kraigg brathwaite ( left ) and the batsman falls over having played a line way outside off stump replays show devon smith clearly misses the ball before being dismissed caught behind off jordan devon smith declines his option to review the decision which would have likely been reversed with hotspot not available in this test series devon smith is given out as england players celebrate their second wicket of a rain - shortened first session it was just what cook needed from a gifted but raw all - rounder who seemingly will always flirt with the self - destruct button but who has the ability to become a key figure in england âs future
it was james anderson , fresh from breaking sir ian botham âs record to become england âs leading wicket - taker in test cricket , who began the day by producing an unplayable inswinger to demolish kraigg brathwaite
the first grenadian to play test cricket on his home island was given out by australian umpire steve davis for what seemed a regulation edge after devon smith had played a wild shot at jordan
trouble was , replays showed devon smith was nowhere near it and the sound that both steve davis and presumably he heard was his bat hitting the ground
yet samuels , despite being dropped by cook off jordan on 32 , and blackwood made life hard again with the help of that annoying 22 yards of turf
jordan celebrates his first wicket of this match , devon smith , as the west indies went to lunch 36 for two west indies batsman blackwood leaps as he avoids a bouncer from the bowling of james anderson samuels flashes a drives through the covers which cook has no interest in being collected by as he jumps out of the way samuels hits moeen ali , who came in for james tredwell , through the covers as cook leaps out of the way umpire steve davis had another uncomfortable moment when he ruled blackwood not out when jordan , who would have been the man to miss out had england plumped for a second spinner here in adil rashid , appealed loudly for lbw
but cook âs miss of samuels began to look costly when he opened his shoulders in partnership with denesh ramdin after taking 141 balls to reach 50
the calm was broken when samuels , who has a far better record against england than any other team and names nasser hussain as his ultimate batting hero , wound up stokes , who had been sledging him constantly
bravo got a start of 35 from 81 balls before he was caught at first slip by cook off the bowling of stuart broad to put the west indies 65 - 3 bravo shows his frustration after edging a routine delivery from stuart broad outside off stump , which followed some loose bowling england celebrate the key wicket of west indies most experienced batsman shivnarine chanderpaul cheaply for one cook is on his hands and knees after dropping a catch from the edge of samuels , who put up the greatest resistance for the hosts samuels finds himself on his back after a bouncer from stuart broad , who was criticised for bowling too short on day one stokes overcame an injury scare after falling awkwardly but required a period of treatment from the england medical staff on the field
