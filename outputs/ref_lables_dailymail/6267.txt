the vaccine , known as rts , s , took 30 years to develop but it is now hoped it can be used to save millions of lives a new jab against malaria could prevent millions of cases , scientists claim
drug firm glaxosmithkline has applied for a licence from the ema ( ema ) for the rts , s vaccine
the news is significant because rts , s is the first malaria vaccine to reach advanced trials
among those who had three doses of rts , s and a booster shot , the number of clinical cases of malaria â those confirmed by a doctor â was reduced by 36 per cent after four years
there is no licensed vaccine against malaria anywhere in the world and researchers say they are hopeful the results will be sufficient for rts , s to gain a licence from the world health organisation could then recommend its use by october this year
professor brian greenwood , the study âs author and professor of clinical tropical medicine at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , said : â despite the falling efficacy over time , there is still a clear benefit from rts , s. â given that there were an estimated 198million malaria cases in 2013 , this level of efficacy potentially translates into millions of cases of malaria in children being prevented
â the shot , which is designed to be used by children in africa , could be approved by october , making it the first approved vaccine for the world 's most deadly disease the disease is difficult to treat because the malaria parasite has a complicated life cycle and has learned how to evade the human immune system over hundreds of years
