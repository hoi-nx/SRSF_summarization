it 's official : alcohol makes you more attractive to the opposite sex
scientists at the university of bristol found that having ' one large glass of wine ' increases ' facial flushing ' and ' confidence ' , making the drinker ' more attractive ' to others and more likely to ' get lucky '
a study of 40 men and women found drinking a glass of wine makes you more attractive to the opposite sex ... ... but too much booze leads to ' excessive and unattractive ' changes in facial expressions , like bridget jones the study found that tipsy people , who had downed one large 250ml glass of 14 per cent wine - that 's one - third of the bottle - were consistently voted as the ' most attractive '
academics have previously confirmed the existence of the ' beer goggles ' phenomenon - in which boozers find other people more attractive after several drinks
this new study , however , is the first time it had been shown that the drinker themselves actually ' becomes more attractive ' to others , in an experiment dubbed ' reverse beer goggles '
it states that booze ' mimics ' how a person 's body ' demonstrates it is healthy and attractive to attract potential mates ' and that facial flushing is perceived by others as ' healthy and attractive '
the study states : ' in addition to perceiving others as more attractive , an alcohol consumer may also be perceived by others as more attractive , and therefore receive greater sexual interest from potential mates
' the study found alcohol has ' positive pulling power ' but only if the person is n't too intoxicated the study said , however , that too much booze led to ' changes in facial expressions which were excessive and unattractive ' - leading to a decrease in ' pulling power '
' professor marcus munafo , a senior researcher on the university of bristol study , said : ' the people who had consumed a small amount of alcohol had a slightly rosier complexion than they did in their sober and high - dose photos
' in a previous study last year , again at the university of bristol , it was found that ' beer goggles ' - in which booze makes others seems more attractive - was a proven phenomena
