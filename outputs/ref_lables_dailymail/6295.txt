sweeping is a tedious task but now a new â smart bin â could help save you from all that bending down with a dust pan
the bruno smartcan is said to be the first internet connected combined kitchen bin and vacuum cleaner
using sensors on the front of the bin , it is able to sense when dust and debris from the kitchen floor is swept towards it with a brush , turning on a vacuum to suck up the offending mess
the bruno smartcan ( pictured ) uses sensors to detect when you want the lid to open or when dirt has been swept close so it can activate its integrated vacuum
it also has an integrated bag store and charging cord bruno smartcan comes with an integrated bag dispenser that additionally sends alerts to a smartphone when the owner is getting low on bags , and it can send reminders when it is time to take out the rubbish
it also features a motion sensitive hands - free lid that opens automatically
â no more stopping , no more scooping , just place the broom in front of the vacuum inlet to start the suction and bruno smartcan will do the rest
â bruno smartcan will also remind you to take the trash out on trash day , and alert you when you are low on bruno bags
dust swept close to the base of the bruno smartcan activates the vacuum , which sucks it directly into the bin
