a mother - of - two who lost her eye to skin cancer is warning people against the dangers of wearing cheap sunglasses
deborah kane , from tyldesley , manchester , had her right eye removed three years ago in a life - saving nine - hour operation to stop the cancer spreading to her brain
the 46 - year - old teaching assistant believes her cancer developed from getting badly burned on holiday in lanzarote when she was 15 - where she also bought cheap sunglasses without proper uv protection
the decision cost me my eye
' but i know i âve been lucky , because through losing my eye , my life was saved
debbie âs problems first began when she was 24 and had a cancerous mole removed from her neck
she was eventually diagnosed with a malignant melanoma behind her right eye
debbie says : ' my mind immediately went back to a teenage holiday in lanzarote when i had been badly sunburned
i had blistered very badly on my neck , which was exactly the same place where i âd first had skin cancer
' i had scrimped on sunglasses too ; i bought cheap ones because they were trendy â but they did nât protect my eyes at all
' her eye had to be removed , to stop the cancer spreading to her brain , but her consultant had never done that type of surgery before
in 2013 , she found a cancerous lump in her leg , which also had to be removed
her consultant believes that debbie âs eye and leg tumours were both caused by rogue cells from the original tumour in her neck
to celebrate her recovery , debbie held an aptly named â eye ball â ( pictured ) and named each table after a part of the eye she hopes to repeat the event annually and has so far raised over Â£ 10,000 for the royal manchester eye hospital where she was treated she is now cancer - free but has to stay out of the sun , and wears a patch over her eye , as she 's never felt comfortable with a prosthetic eye
