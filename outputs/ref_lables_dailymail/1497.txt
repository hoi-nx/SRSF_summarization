an identical twin whose sister was murdered by her stalker ex-boyfriend has revealed she wishes she had done more to save her
grieving nikki , from south wales , says she wants to turn back the clock and tell jenna that she did n't have to ' put up ' with her former partner 's obsessive behaviour , including bombarding her with hundreds of calls and texts a day
but jenna , who was strangled to death by philip packer in a jealous rage in 2008 , never reported his behaviour to police - and paid the ultimate price
as part of stalking awareness week , nikki , from north cornelly , â­ appeared on today 's this morning in honour of her sister
she told presenters phillip schofield and amanda holden how jenna had started a relationship with philip packer , who was 28 years older than she was , when she was a teenager
however , nikki said he then would n't leave her sister - then aged 21 - alone
he would ring 300 - 400 times a day and that was just phone calls
there were also texts and visits
' jenna was strangled to death by philip packer , pictured , who used to hound her with calls and messages nikki said neither she or jenna realised how far philip packer would go and ' kind ' jenna did n't consider reporting him to the police
' nikki said philip packer would often turn up unannounced at jenna 's house to drive her to work , or if she was waiting at the bus stop , he could pull over and offer her a lift
after offering her a lift , philip packer , then aged 49 , took her to a layby and strangled her to death
nikki now wishes she had urged her sister to put a stop to philip packer 's stalking behaviour
nikki said : ' if we could turn back the clock i 'd tell her you do n't have to put up with this
