the new 4g mobile phone services in the uk are not as super-fast as the industry promised - and could get worse
the mobile phone companies boasted that 4g services would be â five times faster â than the existing 3g networks when they launched in the autumn of 2012
however , a new official study puts the real figure at an average of 2.5 times faster - 14.7 megabits per second compared to 5.9mbit/s per second on the 3g service that most people use
a study by ofcom says 4g speeds in the uk are slower than promised
mobile phone companies boasted 4g would be five times faster than 3g
but the actual figure is actually only 2.5 times faster - 14.7 megabits per second
despite this , the figures make clear the step change has not been as remarkable as the major networks - ee , o2 , vodafone and three - promised
second fastest was vodafone with 16.4 for 4g versus 6.6 for 3g
o2 came next at 13.9 versus 6.6 , followed by three at a relatively slow 8.5 for 4g which was not very impressive against the 5.4 for 3g
ee was also fastest on this measure at 17.6mbit/s , followed by o2 on 13.2 , vodafone on 13.1 and three with 9.4
the three network was the fastest to load a web page at 0.63 seconds , compared to 0.71 for o2 , 0.76 for vodafone and 0.77 for ee
ee âs 4g network , which covers 81 per cent of homes and businesses , delivered the fastest average download speed of 18.6mbit/s the ofcom figures are based on 120,000 smartphone tests in five sample towns and cities - edinburgh , leeds , london , newcastle and poole / bournemouth - between october and december
