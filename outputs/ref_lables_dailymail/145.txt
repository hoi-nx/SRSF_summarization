victim : dr king the fbi repeatedly deceived congress by destroying vital files relating to the assassination of king , a new book claims
leading king historian wexler said that the bureau chose to cover up the potential role of a high level informant in the killing rather than tell the truth
wexler said that it could have been one of the greatest scandals in the history of the fbi - but now we may never know what happened
by destroying the files the fbi disobeyed a direct order not to do so from a congressional which had been set up to investigate the killing of king and former president kennedy
wexler told daily mail online that the bureau 's actions were ' disturbing ' and that his research had left him suspecting that agents had mounted a deliberate operation to bury the truth forever
king was shot dead by ray on 4 april 1968 at the lorraine motel in memphis tennessee in a killing which galvanized the civil rights movement
power : dr king 's leadership of the civil rights movement was demonstrated in the i have a dream speech in 1963
his death on 4 april 1968 shocked a nation already scarred by the deaths of president kennedy - and the civil leader 's murder was followed by that of robert kennedy guard : the balcony at the lorraine motel in memphis tennessee , tennessee , where dr king was shot
milteer ( right ) was a racist known for a covertly recorded interview in 1963 in which he spoke of the kennedy and king assassinations before they happened interest in king 's life has been renewed since the release of the oscar - winning film ' selma ' , about the historic march from the alabama town , which was 50 years ago this year
the fbi plot began when the house committee on assassinations was set up in 1976 - it would finish its inquiries into the killing of king and kennedy in 1978
wexler said that , according to his research , in 1977 the murkin ( murder of king ) files were destroyed from the fbi field offices in miami and mobile , alabama
crucially , both had information on tommy tarrants , a former high ranking klan member from mississippi
wexler said that something in that file made the fbi upgrade tommy tarrants from a little - known racist activist to major player in the king assassination to the point where they showed his picture to witnesses at major crime scenes
also destroyed from the miami field office was the the file on milteer , a well - known racist who is known for a covertly recorded interview he gave in 1963 in which he talks about the kennedy assassination and the king assassination before they happened
wexler said : ' it 's entirely possible that milteer was raising the bounty money for king 's assassination
' the destruction of the files broke a key rule of the fbi 's record keeping ; that it does n't get rid of information on people who are still alive
according to wexler , every other field office investigation of the king murder was preserved , just as congress ordered , and eventually transferred to the national archives and records administration
mississippi kkk : tommy tarrants was a figure in the mississippi kkk and seemed initially marginal to the investigation into the king murder but was suddenly made a significant figure
was it because of his links to another more senior figure that files were destroyed ? in charge : hoover , the fbi chief , had condemned dr king and had a mantra that protecting the bureau 's reputation was all that mattered
ray told the panel he did not kill king ' by that point tommy tarrants had already made a conversion away from radical racist christianity - he is now a preacher
also known as l.e. matthews , was due to take over as head of the klan there and laude matthews was a big time deep cover agent for the fbi
wexler said that the fbi could still go some way to salvaging its reputation ; one way of doing so would be to give king 's case to the justice department 's civil rights cold case team , which has looked as more than one hundred civil rights crimes , mostly from the 1960s
