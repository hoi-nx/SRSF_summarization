the tears have dried but for how long ? it âs been almost a year to the day since clarke cracked in front of the cameras as he explained how bristol rovers fell out of the league for the first time since 1920
rovers had spent less than an hour in the league two relegation zone all season but , crucially , it was the last hour of the campaign
the music stopped , mansfield had beaten them 1 - 0 , the two other teams that needed to win had won , and bristol rovers were left without a seat
the tears came , Â£ 1million from the playing budget went and bristol rovers were a conference side , three years after being in league one
but , if nothing else , it taught clarke that anything can happen on the final day
a year ago , bristol rovers lost their place in the league for the first time since 1920 clarke was distraught at the end of last season , but there could be tears of joy this time around he needs that hope now , when the battle for the conference title is wrapped up
it âs between second - placed bristol rovers , who play alfreton , and barnet , who hold a one - point lead and a vastly better goal difference going into their game against gateshead
â it âs a pretty big weekend for us , â clarke told sportsmail
it âs not quite the championship race for Â£ 120m â the financial boost available here is roughly Â£ 600,000 â but the real - world difference between league and the rest is every bit as significant
barnet are heavy favourites to take the one automatic spot , by virtue of their lead and the fact gateshead are safe in mid-table
â if they do , and barnet lose or draw , it will be a remarkable achievement and a rare one , considering no side have returned to the league at the first time of asking since carlisle in 2005
if bristol rovers go up , they will be the first team to go straight back up since carlisle in 2005 carlisle won the conference play - off in 2005 and bristol rovers will hope to match their promotion success the upheaval that followed bristol rovers â demise was dramatic
â clarke 's rovers had a difficult start to the season but have now only lost once in the last 27 league matches it was a slow start
