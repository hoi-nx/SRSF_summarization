new nhs guidelines urge gps to draw up end - of - life plans for over- 75s and say it will improve their care the nhs says the guidance will improve patients ' end - of - life care , but medical professionals say it is ' blatantly wrong ' and will frighten the elderly into thinking they are being ' written off '
in some surgeries , nurses are cold - calling patients over 75 or with long - term conditions and asking them over the phone if they have ' thought about resuscitation '
other patients have spoken of the shock of going in for a routine check - up and being asked about resuscitation
the guidelines â which also recommend patients should be asked if they want to die at home â have been drawn up by experts advising england , the organisation which runs the health service
patients have spoken of the shock of going in for a routine check - up and being asked about resuscitation one expert last night said the guidance was ' the thin end of the wedge of assisted suicide '
professor patrick pullicino , who spearheaded the campaign against the lcp , said : ' what is most blatantly wrong is trying to get someone to agree to a ' do not resuscitate ' order before they are even sick

doctors estimate that only 10 to 15 per cent of patients are brought back to life and some suffer permanent brain damage

patients are usually also given a ' do not resuscitate ' order , instructing doctors not to attempt to restart their hearts should they suffer a cardiac arrest
but earlier this year nurses and cancer charities told mps on the health select committee that the pathway was still being used by hospitals â although not by that name
one nurse warned that the ' abuse ' suffered by patients under the lcp may still be happening in the nhs , a prospect she described as ' horrifically worrying ' .
