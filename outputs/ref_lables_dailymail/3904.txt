psychologists and wellness experts have long - known that we 're at our happiest when we 're doing the things we love
but , according to one new study , a third of australian women are not finding time for their hobbies and passions
the survey of 1,025 australian parents , conducted by officeworks , found that more women had foregone personal interests for work commitments or to finance ' more important ' things in the last week , than had men
according to a recent study of more than 1,000 australian parents , a third of australian women are not finding time for their hobbies , choosing work and ' more important things ' over their passions ' we know that we tend to gravitate towards hobbies and interests that use our best strengths but a lot of the other things we do in our lives , including work , do not , ' dr watkins told daily mail australia
' this is why it 's so important for us to consciously do more of the things that bring us joy
' clinical psychologist and happiness institute wellness expert dr watkins says its important to create space for the things we love to be happy one interesting finding to come out of the recent survey , dr watkins says , is that twenty per cent of women are inspired to start new hobbies through social media
' ' what we 're seeing is that women could actually be more inspired than ever before , right at the time that we 're also more time poor
' so how can we create more space in our lives for the things we love ? dr watkins says its important to be pragmatic
' spending time doing things you love with friends has the advantage of the ' accountability ' factor , dr watkins says
' next time an unexpected pocket of free time opens up , you can take advantage of it if you 've got the craft stuff you need at hand , for example , or your runners under your desk at work
' other tips include spending more time sharing your passions with friends - this has the added ' accountability factor ' - and giving to others , perhaps by volunteering your time to others
' make a list , then pick one or pick two things you love â you can shelve the other stuff for another time - it âs there , the seed has been planted , ' dr watkins says finally , dr watkins says women should include their ' little people ' in the things they love because hobbies and passions are created in childhood
another worrying statistic that was revealed in the officeworks survey is that 85 per cent of younger australian , specifically geny respondents , said they have also stopped pursing interests that they are passionate about because they feel they should be spending money on ' more important things ' or using their time to complete work or home duties
according to dr watkins , the current situation of parents failing to pursue the things they love is concerning for generations to come because it sets a dangerous cultural norm in australian
lighten your load prioritising your commitments and saying â no â occasionally can free up your time
prioritise passions focus your efforts on one or two interests at a time
make it work with only 9 % of australian admitting they âre very happy at work , it âs time to get creative and find ways to enhance your workplace
when you commit your time to others , you âre more likely to leave work on time and prioritise your hobbies .
