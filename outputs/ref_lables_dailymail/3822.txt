the queen âs staff will take industrial action for the first time in history over their â ridiculously low â wages
wardens at windsor castle say they are expected to carry out extra duties , including giving guided tours to visitors , for no extra money
wardens at windsor castle ( pictured here collecting flowers laid by well - wishers following the death of the queen mother ) have voted for industrial action in a dispute over pay their main role includes meeting and greeting visitors , conducting security searches , telling people about the history of the windsor castle , and handing out free audio guides
but the public and commercial services union ( pcs ) said staff are also asked to perform extra duties for free , such as leading paid - for tours , carrying out first aid and speaking foreign languages to overseas visitors
now , staff have voted â overwhelmingly â in favour of industrial action after complaining they have suffered â years of pay restraint â
the wardens work for the royal collection trust , a charity which presides over one of the world âs largest and most important works of art , jewels and artefacts
â staff claim they receive poor salaries and perform extra duties such as guiding visitors around windsor castle for no additional money the union has proposed that wardens receive an extra Â£ 150 a year for speaking a foreign language to visitors and an allowance for every day they conduct tours
but following failed negotiations , non-strike industrial action could now start from the end of april
â the royal collection trust said that only nine wardens were required to conduct tours every day out of an average of 85 wardens in work , and that the industrial action should have â no impact â on visitors
but the pcs complained that the living wage officially rose last november and that this wage hike should therefore be back - dated â a condition the royal collection trust has now agreed to .
