one of the less celebrated aspects of benaud âs remarkable career were his regular appearances in that part of the press box which houses the written journalists
benaud was first and foremost a television broadcaster , a man of unusually wry wit who once responded on air to colleague chris broad âs malapropism ( â honestly , you run out of expletives when describing the fielding of jonty rhodes â ) without skipping a beat : â which particular one did you have in mind ? â but benaud also penned a regular column for the news of the world , taking his place among the hacks â not all tv men take the trouble â to craft his copy whenever a test match was going on
benaud , pictured in january 2013 , has died at the age of 84 after a battle with skin cancer benaud was one of cricket 's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge tributes are seen at the statue of benaud at the sydney cricket ground after his passing it was said he would regularly file 700 or 800 words , of which maybe 150 or 200 would see the light of day
but , a professional to his core , benaud kept on filing
it was often an understated era , typified by jim laker âs steadfast refusal to celebrate any of the 19 wickets he took against australia at old trafford in 1956 ( benaud c laker 0 ; benaud b laker 18 )
benaud did his best to change all that
he âd whoop and skip and jump : take a look on youtube at him enjoying bob simpson âs slip catch at old trafford in 1961 , where his leg - breaks spirited australia to a come - from - behind win
but benaud was their spiritual forefather
benaud âs involvement and influence were central to that
it was as a tv commentator that benaud came into his own
â when benaud welcomed viewers , they were able to relax : the cricket was about to begin
â benaud was australia captain and the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in tests after his playing career , benaud forged an incredibly successful career as a cricket commentator benaud ( right ) in discussion with england 's michael vaughan ahead of a test match in 2004 that last tip has been cheerfully taken on board by the current generation of channel nine commentators in australia
and if they have been less adept at putting their brains into gear before opening their mouths , then that also reflects the almost impossibly high standards set by benaud himself
