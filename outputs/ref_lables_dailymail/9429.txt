landmark developments ltd tore down a derelict property in bath city centre and replaced it with a modern block of 14 flats
but residents complained that the development was three feet higher and four feet wider than the plans approved by the council
a brand new Â£ 4million apartment block in bath and north east somerset council ( pictured ) is facing demolition - because it is four feet wider than approved bath and north east somerset council says the developer has committed a ' breach of planning control ' and ordered the building to be bulldozed
' but architect david hadfield claimed the building was 1.5ft higher and just under three feet wider in some places than the approved plans
planning permission for the development at 43 upper oldfield park was granted in 2009 following three rejections since 2007 bath and north east somerset council says the developer has committed a ' breach of planning control ' and ordered the building ( right ) to be bulldozed the average price of a two - bedroom flat in the area is Â£ 289,000 , meaning the 14 flats would be worth at least Â£ 3.9million on the open market
in october last year - as the building neared completion - residents complained that it differed from the approved plans
landmark development is appealing against the decision and a meeting will be held next week
marc willis , who is the developer 's planning consultant , described the council 's decision as ' unreasonable '
' the planning officers said the plans were okay , but the council said no. the idea that they have ignored the officers is just wrong
' there are 14 flats which should be on the market now , but you ca n't move in without planning permission
