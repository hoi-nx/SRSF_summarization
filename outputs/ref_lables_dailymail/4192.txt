following heavy defeats at tikrit in iraqi and the appalling costly siege of kobane , islamic state have launched their own social media rules to censor coverage on its recent defeats
the image of the rules began to circulate on social media , two weeks after islamic state was forced to abandon the iraqi city of tikrit
some isis supporters on social media appear to be exasperated by the apparent leaking of information and discussions of the defeat at tikrit
' whilst it remains unknown how islamic state will manage to enforce these rules , the jihadi group has previously struggled to keep any control of its fighters and supporters on social media

british terror twin halane ( left ) and kiwi fighter mark taylor ( right ) , have both been criticised by isis supporters for giving away information on fighters and locations
in particular female jihadis have been criticized by fellow isis supporters for their loose lipped attitude on social media
one of the british terror twins , halane , has previously broken the rules by announcing the death of her husband on social media
