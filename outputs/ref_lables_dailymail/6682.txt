for the first time this year , nasa âs mars reconnaissance orbiter has spotted its robotic companion on the surface of the red planet
but interestingly , the rover âs tracks are not visible - possibly because they have been swept away by the martian weather
the rover is parked over dark sand in a valley with light - toned outcrops of rock the image was taken using the hirise ( hirise ) camera on the martian satellite , from a height of 187 miles ( 300km ) above the surface
the rover 's top speed is 1.5 inches ( 3.8 centimetres ) per second
curiosity is the fourth rover to visit martian
they are the lowest exposed rocks of mount sharp - also known as mount sharp - which nasa is planning to send curiosity up at some point
in the image the rover had recently completed a drive of about 75ft ( 23 metres ) during its 949th day on martian - also known as a sol. north is towards the top in the image , with the entire view spanning about 1,640ft ( 500 metres ) across
nasa scientists in california have revealed a distant image of curiosity ( shown )
it was taken by the mars reconnaissance orbiter from 187 miles up
one interesting aspect is that the rover 's tracks can not be seen
this may be due to martian weather or they blend in with the surface here 's the view from the surface : curiosity took this image of artist 's drive around a similar time that the mars reconnaissance orbiter spacecraft spotted it from orbit
it may be that martian wind has swept them away , or it could be that the dark sand dug up by the wheels as they move is a similar colour to the surface , and thus indistinguishable
