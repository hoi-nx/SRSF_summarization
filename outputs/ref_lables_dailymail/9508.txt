everyone loves a bargain , even in the mega-rich territory of the premier league
yet it can be a case of hit and miss. here , sportsmail looks at examples of players who have represented the lower leagues well in the premier league , and others who can do so too
aaron cresswell ( ipswich to west ham in july 2014 â Â£ 2million ) the full - back is one of just five outfield players to play every minute of his team 's premier league games this season aaron cresswell began at tranmere rovers , making his debut in november 2008
from there , he moved to ipswich in june 2011 , apparently turning down west bromwich albion and doncaster rovers
yet it was west ham who signed the left - back on a five - year contract , spending just Â£ 2m in doing so
aaron cresswell has made 32 appearances in the premier league since , and his impressive performances have reportedly caught the eye of manchester city and chelsea
both clubs need to add more home - grown talent to their squads , and the west ham regular would add to that batch
aaron cresswell has proved a good fit for the premier league since signing for west ham in july 2014 john stones ( barnsley to everton in january 2013 - Â£ 3m ) stones has the best passing accuracy of any everton player this season - 90.8 % a barnsley youth product , stones made 25 appearances in the championship for the club , before leaving for everton on a five - and - a - half - year deal
it reportedly cost them Â£ 3m , and he has made 38 appearances in the premier league since
despite an ankle injury which ruled him out for 10 - 14 weeks , stones was nominated for the golden boy 2014 award alongside gerard deulofeu , calum chambers , raheem sterling and luke shaw
john stones signed for everton from barnsley in january 2013 for just Â£ 3m and has been a good addition andrew robertson ( dundee to hull in july 2014 - Â£ 2.85m ) andrew robertson has made 40 dribbles this year , 17 more than any other hull defender no disrespect to dundee or the scottish premiership , but it is widely assumed that the premier league is somewhat of a step up
steve bruce , the hull manager , admits he has already had calls from clubs interested in the glasgow - born left - back , who has made 21 appearances in the premier league
andrew robertson joined hull from dundee in july 2014 and is pictured a month after signing leonardo ulloa ( brighton to leicester in july 2014 - Â£ 8m ) the striker is the foxes ' top scorer in the league this season ( 7 ) while no other leicester player has had a hand in more goals ( scored seven , assisted two ) leonardo ulloa did n't come cheap
yet just because a player costs a handsome fee does not guarantee he will be cut out for the premier league
the argentinian with no caps cost Â£ 8m and had plenty to prove as he told former club brighton he felt he had to leave to try his luck in the premier league
leonardo ulloa did n't come cheap for leicester and must help them survive to avoid dropping down a league dwight gayle ( peterborough to crystal palace in july 2013 - Â£ 4.5m ) after netting five in his first 15 premier league appearances , dwight gayle has now gone eight games without a goal for crystal palace dwight gayle really had to rise through the ranks to join the premier league
dwight gayle really had to rise through the ranks to join the premier league with crystal palace nathaniel clyne ( crystal palace to southampton in july 2012 - Â£ 2.15m ) the england man has made 99 tackles , the third - highest total in the premier league this season and the most by a defender nathaniel clyne was a crystal palace youth product , and made his professional debut in october 2008
after four years at selhurst park in the championship , winning the player of the year award in his final season , nathaniel clyne moved to southampton for Â£ 2.15m
the right - back is a regular at st mary 's , and even made his debut for england in october 2014
nathaniel clyne was a crystal palace youth product but signed for southampton after their promotion dele alli ( mk dons to tottenham hotspur in february 2015 - Â£ 5m â to join next season ) alli has netted 14 goals for the mk dons this season , more than any other midfielder for a single club bit of a cheat this one
dele alli signed for tottenham hotspur from mk dons for Â£ 5m before being sent back on loan so , who could be next to move up to the premier league ? matt ritchie ( bournemouth ) position : winger
though left - footed , matt ritchie operates on the right and his energy and eye for a goal sum up eddie howe 's attacking side
norwich did well to hang on to bradley johnson after being relegated last summer and if they do n't make an immediate return he will surely still be back in the premier league , where he proved a reliable performer for the three seasons prior to this
making his debut as a 17 - year - old , the elegant left - footed midfielder has already played more than 130 times for derby and has no shortage of admirers among the premier league 's elite
when bakary sako moved to wolves for Â£ 4m from st etienne he would have had hopes of playing in the premier league before too long
to his credit though , he stayed and spearheaded wolves ' romp to the league one title last year and has been the key man in their bid to make it back - to - back promotions
