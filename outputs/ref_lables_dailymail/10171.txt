nicola sturgeon was booed last night as she refused to rule out holding a second independence vote in the next few years â despite having earlier claimed 2014 âs referendum was a â once in a generation â event
â but last night , in an election debate on stv , she said she respected last year âs result , and said she would not call for another plebiscite in the snp manifesto for the westminster election in may
i do n't want to see the tories in downing street ' power : the result of the election this may is set to put ms nicola sturgeon in a powerful position at westminster , with the chance of choosing which party can form a government
above , the snp leader at tonight 's debate she said she would not rule out such a call in the manifesto for the 2016 scottish parliament election , saying : â that âs another matter
the scottish first minister was accused of holding great britain to â ransom â after she said she was â offering to make ed miliband prime minister â
she said she wanted to wanted to do a deal with mr ed miliband so she can influence the policies of a labour government and keep it â honest â
reacting to miss sturgeon âs offer to prop up mr ed miliband , labour âs leader in scottish , murphy , said : â nicola sturgeon , we do nât need your help
reacting to miss sturgeon âs offer to prop up mr ed miliband , labour âs leader in scottish , murphy , said : â nicola sturgeon , we do nât need your help
â what we need is people north and south of the border , people in scottish , people in england and people in across wales coming together to kick out an out of touch government
â he pleaded with the audience to claim that labour can only beat the conservatives if people vote for mr ed miliband in scottish

speaking in the debate for stv , miss sturgeon said wanted scottish to vote snp rather than labour because â if there âs a strong block of snp mps , we can make sure labour keeps its promises
above , ms nicola sturgeon , second from right , during the debate tonight â we need to send a strong team to make sure labour get it ; so we can keep labour honest
â i stood on a platform last week in the uk leaders debate with ed miliband and i heard ed miliband say if labour is elected and left to their own devices there will be further spending reductions
â asked by mr murphy where she â wanted â mr ed miliband to be prime minister , she said : â i â do nât want david cameron to be prime minister ; i âm offering to help make ed miliband prime minister
â any seat that labour loses in scottish reduces the chances of ed miliband becoming prime minister
â scottish conservative leader ruth davidson said the snp âs position â urging scottish to vote against labour and also promising to prop up a labour government â was illogical
and last night was no different as a man wearing a fake moustache during the scottish leaders â debate caused twitter to erupt
moustache man : the man , dressed in fake facial hair and a fedora , was spotted in the debate audience social media frenzy : one twitter user re-imagined the debate with an audience full of moustache wearers rumbled : the joker 's identity was later revealed as the father of jack mcafee , named as danny mcafee time for a picture : after the debate , he was seen posing with snp leader nicola sturgeon , pictured above
