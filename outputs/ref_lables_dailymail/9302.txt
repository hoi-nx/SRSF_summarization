earlier this week , brazilian commuter nelson was deeply offended by a scene he witnessed on a train platform
he proceeded to take a photo , and express his disapproval on facebook , after which the image was shared more than 100,000 times in 24 hours
in the picture , taken on a train platform in rio de janeiro , two women hug and gaze into each others ' eyes , but the source of his outrage soon becomes clear in a post that cleverly spoofs conservative attitudes
brazilian man , nelson posted this image , expressing his disapproval at the ' scene '
the viewer believes he is conducting a homophobic rant , as he mentions : ' they are challenging social conventions , and this can be dangerous ' in his facebook post , nelson stated : ' i am not prejudiced , i think everyone does what they want out of your life
continuing with what the unknowing reader assumes at this point is a homophobic rant , the next part of the post starts to become confusing
suddenly it becomes clear what nelson , who works at the catholic university of rio de janeiro , is really warning against - with his tongue firmly in this cheek
nelson warns others not to follow in the delinquent man 's footsteps
