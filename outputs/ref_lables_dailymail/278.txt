if a picture is worth a thousand words , then jonathon keats figures a picture can also span a thousand years
jonathon keats , a san francisco writer and self - described experimental philosopher and conceptual artist , has designed a ' millennium camera ' that he intends to mount in a churchless steeple on a college campus
he hopes the resulting photograph will chronicle climate change by taking a 1,000 - year exposure of a western massachusetts mountain range
jonathon keats , an experimental philosopher , hopes to capture 1,000 years of changes at a mountain range in massachusetts with his ' millennium camera ' the camera , which is made of cooper and allows light to enter through a tiny hole and change paint inside , will create one image that jonathon keats says will display centuries of changes to the environment if it seems far - fetched , consider that some of jonathon keats ' previous endeavors include selling tracts of real estate in the theoretical extra dimensions of space - time and opening a photosynthetic restaurant that serves gourmet sunlight to plants
even at his quirkiest , jonathon keats notes he always has a serious message to deliver
' but will it work ? the camera will be place on the stearns steeple , and the mead art museum at amherst college plans on holding an exhibition to show the resulting photo in the 3015 jonathon keats hopes that the long - term photograph will make people think about time frames longer than their lives , such as the centuries that it takes for nature such as the holyoke mountain range ( pictured ) to transform even jonathon keats ca n't say for sure
the camera , jonathon keats explains , is very simple , so simple that nothing mechanically should fail
it begins as the old science fair standby , the pinhole camera , which allows light to enter through a tiny aperture
but since pinhole cameras are n't designed to last a thousand years , jonathon keats made his of copper because of its resistance to corrosion
to capture the exposure , jonathon keats adapted a renaissance art technique by using rose madder , a sturdy , organic - based oil paint , applied directly to the copper in the back of the camera
' all you have to do is open up the camera and you 'll see the image , ' jonathon keats says
that image will be of the holyoke range , a modest but picturesque mountain chain that scientists believe has existed for 200 million years
stearns steeple at bucolic amherst college , where jonathon keats studied philosophy in the 1990s , will serve as the camera 's tripod of sorts
above , he explains his project at amherst college the philosopher and journalist hopes that citizens of the 31st century will look at his image taken from a camera on stearns steeple at amherst college once part of stearns church , the gothic revival steeple was retained as a freestanding structure after the church was demolished in 1949
jonathon keats hopes such resiliency bodes well for its long - term survival
' later this spring , jonathon keats will ascend a harrowing set of wooden stairs inside the dusty steeple , position the camera and open its shutter , beginning what he believes will be history 's longest exposure
the philosopher set up a similar 1,000 - year camera at the arizona 's sculpture garden as part of an effort to capture how the next millennium change tempe , arizona
