a family overheard a terrifying message on their young son 's baby monitor after the device and its camera were hacked
when the washington couple 's three - year - old had first began complaining of someone talking to him at night , his parents had put it down to their toddler 's over-active imagination , reported cbs new york
that was until one night when they heard a strange man 's voice come over the monitor to tell their son : ' wake up little boy , daddy 's looking for you
' a couple heard the terrifying message : ' wake up little boy , daddy 's looking for you ' come through their 3 - year - old son 's baby monitor ( stock image ) and the horrified parents , who do not want to be named for fear the unknown man could track them down , believe it is not just the audio monitor that has been hacked
technology experts have now warned that it is becoming easier for hackers to infiltrate family 's baby monitors as many of the newer devices connect to the internet
because some new baby monitors connect to the internet and come with a smartphone app , it has become easier for hackers to infiltrate them and listen in or speak to children ' if somebody else has your login information , they can go to that same app , and log into your webcam , which is what happened here , ' ulanoff said
earlier this month , another couple - this time from rochester , minnesota - discovered their baby monitors and cameras had been infiltrated after they found footage from the nanny cam posted online , according to redbook
