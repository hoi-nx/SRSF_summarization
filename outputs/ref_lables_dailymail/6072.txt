drinking two cups of coffee a day could halve the risk of breast cancer returning , a study found
a cancer - killing cocktail of the hormone drug tamoxifen and two coffees every day was found to reduce the risk of tumours returning by 50 per cent in women recovering from the disease , researchers said
tamoxifen kills off cancer cells or stunts their growth by blocking the cancer - causing hormone oestrogen from reaching diseased cells
women who have suffered from breast cancer can slash the chances of the cancer returning by half - if they enjoy two cups of coffee a day , as well as taking hormone drug tamoxifen ( picture posed by model ) it is the main drug given to women who have not been through the menopause , and is usually taken for five years or longer after breast cancer treatment
â the study also found that breast cancer cells react with caffeine and caffeic acid , which are both found in the hot drink
â researches found caffeine causes breast cancer cells to divide less frequently and divide more often taking prescribed medicine is still vitally important to treating cancer , clinicians have stressed despite their findings , the study âs researchers were keen to stress the importance of prescribed medication in treating cancer â they are incredibly important , but if you like coffee and are also taking tamoxifen , there is no reason to stop drinking it
