the four - year - old hound seemed to think he was being chased and had dilated pupils and bloodshot eyes after eating the drugs near the village bus stop
fisher , 31 , from leintwardine , shropshire , said his bedlington lurcher twiglet ( pictured ) was left behaving strangely after eating the drugs he found at a bus stop while on a walk near their home last monday twiglet seemed to think he was being chased and had dilated pupils and bloodshot eyes after eating the drug but after 45 minutes of drooling at the mouth uncontrollably , shaking and walking into walls twiglet seemed back to normal following his ' trip '
today mr fisher , a veterinary surgeon , said : ' we had been taking twiglet out for a walk as we normally do
' we went past the bus stop which is just like a seat around an oak tree
the bus stop in leintwardine , shorpshire , where twiglet found and consumed the unidentified narcotics after drooling at the mouth uncontrollably , shaking and walking into walls he seems to be back to normal ' he had his tail between his legs and his head down , which he only does when he is being chased around by our other dogs
' because of twiglet 's symptoms mr fisher believes his dog may have ingested something hallucinogenic the father - of - one said he phoned the nurse at his surgery in ludlow , shropshire , to come and take a blood sample and made twiglet vomit
twiglet 's scavenging days would appear to be over following the unfortunate incident last week ' he would have been quite an unlucky dog to have had all those symptoms and for it to be anything else
' i have only seen one similar case in which we found a dog had swallowed a bag of marijuana - we just want other owners to be careful in future
' wife karen , 33 , a farm consultant , added : ' it led to a 45 minute episode in which twiglet showed symptoms of being under the influence of narcotics
' symptoms include hallucinating , partial seizures , tremors , hyper salivating , in - coordination and collapsing
