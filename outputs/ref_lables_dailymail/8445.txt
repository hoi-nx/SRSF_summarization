farage has proclaimed that he will ' smash apart ' labour 's ' one - party state ' in the north at the election
the ukip leader said that his party is now the ' serious challenger ' to labour in northern seats
he accused the party of making claims ukip is racist because it is ' running scared '
â mr farage called on conservative party supporters to vote tactically to help ukip beat labour in its target seats
in an article for mailonline , he wrote : ' the truth is , labour are running scared , and it 's not the conservative party making great inroads into their vote
' mr farage accused labour of ' sneering ' at people who raised issues about immigration and claimed ukip has now ' emerged as the party of the working man '
he added : ' across the north , ukip are now the serious challengers to labour
' mr farage accused labour 's shadow business secretary chuka umunna of making ' tired and old claims ' after he said at the weekend that ukip is infected with the ' virus of racism '
he wrote : ' while most people pay no heed when they hear these claims nowadays , it is interesting to think about why labour chiefs are attacking ukip , when they really should be focusing on mr cameron 's conservatives by this point in the campaign
the seat has been put on ukip 's list of top ten targets
proud : ukip 's strategists believe the party could come second in at least 100 seats in the north however , the party suffered a blow on monday when a poll by conservative party peer lord ashcroft showed the party was 17 points behind labour in great grimsby
ukip 's strategists believe the party could come second in at least 100 seats in the north
in 2010 , ukip took just seven per cent of the vote and labour 's iain wright retained the seat with a 5,509 majority
â have you noticed how in the past few days labour has started to attack me and ukip , just as the polls suggest that more and more labour voters are going to be voting for us on may 7th ? polls have shown a sharply rising proportion of ukip supporters drawn from people who voted labour in 2010
labour 's chuka umunna has again repeated a tired old claim about ukip and race
worried : mr farage said labour are ' running scared ' of his ukip while most people pay no heed when they hear these claims nowadays , it is interesting to think about why labour chiefs are attacking ukip , when they really should be focusing on mr cameron 's conservatives by this point in the campaign
the truth is , labour are running scared , and it 's not the conservative party making great inroads into their vote
sneering : mr farage said chuka umunna continued to ' sneer ' at his party on immigration and attacked a ' whopping majority of britons ' and far from the party of old , gin - soaked half colonels that some would like ukip to be , we have emerged as the party of the working man and woman of this country , with a health policy welcomed by the alzheimer 's society , a housing policy endorsed by the royal institute of chartered surveyors , and an immigration policy that 77 per cent of the britons public agree with
but mr chuka umunna and the london labourites continue to sneer at people over the issues they want answers on
across the north , ukip are now the serious challengers to labour
instead , trust in your judgement , and help us smash apart labour 's one party state in the north
ukip has several target seats in the north , which i now believe we 're in with a chance of winning
