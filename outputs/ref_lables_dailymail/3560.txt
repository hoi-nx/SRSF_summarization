after acknowledging his supposed blunder again , the recorded version of mr matthew weathers on the video screen suddenly halts his virtual lesson to confront the teacher in the classroom
â pretending to question his sanity , the teacher says : â wait , you âre just a video , how could i come over ? â as the virtual teacher begins telling him off , the real teacher leans out and ' pushes ' the screen back the many pupils in the class can then be heard laughing in astonishment as his virtual counterpart begins pushing the side of the screen and shuffling towards the teacher
as the virtual teacher begins telling him off , the real teacher leans out and pushes the screen back to where it was originally
wearing a baseball cap sideways , the rogue teacher closes the video causing the top - half of the real teacher to disappear before heading over to the legs â that dangle from beneath the screen â and attaching himself to them
