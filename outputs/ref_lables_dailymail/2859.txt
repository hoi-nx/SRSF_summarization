it is a simplification , of course , but perhaps a useful way of understanding why , as we survey the champions league quarter finals , there are no premier league clubs troubling the scorers
bayern munich take on porto on wednesday night and even though they are contending with an injury crisis which leaves them without bastian schweinsteiger , franck ribery and arjen robben among others you might anticipate a sixth champions league semi-final for guardiola in his six years of management
of course guardiola is n't alone responsible for the decline of the premier league in europe ; nor is it really down to st andrews , though the iconic town with its genteel ambience played its part in continental europe overhauling the english clubs
guardiola prepares his side for their champions league quarter - final first leg against porto the bayern munich boss gives instructions to his goalkeeper manuel neuer at a training session on tuesday something happened back in 2008 when guardiola took over at barcelona and it was n't that the barcelona team changed
there lionel messi was a distracted individual , sometimes sneering at guardiola 's insistence on organisation and pressing , according to guillem balague 's account in his biographies of lionel messi and guardiola
but a breakthrough came when guardiola stuck up for lionel messi in his battle with the club to play for argentina in the beijing olympics
guardiola is bidding to reach his sixth champions league semi-final in his six years as a manager guardiola got lionel messi on side in 2008 after standing up for him in battle to represent argentina at the beijing olympics lionel messi , the precocious star , suddenly felt he had an ally in guardiola
and , as a result , he began to buy into guardiola 's idea of relentless pressing to supplement the tiki taka football , which was already a template at barcelona
what guardiola added to barcelona âs game was the intensity , drive and sheer energy which had wilted under rijkaard and then moulded it with overwhelming possession
so , rather than ask ' why are we so bad now ? ' it useful to identify why were we so good between 2005 - 2009 ? ' guardiola led barcelona to champions league glory in 2009 and 2011 ( pictured ) the former barcelona manager is thrown into the air by his players as they celebrate the 2011 success for chelsea fans pointing to the 2012 triumph , that it was indeed a victory of rare courage amidst adversity but the decline of english clubs had already begun and that win is effectively an outlier , bucking the established trend
between 2005 - 2009 the premier league provided 12 out of the potential 20 semi finalists for the champions league ; between 2010 to 2015 it has provided three out of 24
manchester united won the champions league in 2008 when english clubs were dominating the latter stages chelsea were an exception to the rule in 2012 when they won the tournament against all the odds rising to the challenge of mourinho and benitez , sir ferguson was tactically at his peak in that period , playing without a recognised centre foward at times in 2008 before guardiola and others made it fashionable
manchester city were eliminated in the last 16 this season at the hands of barcelona chelsea exited at the same stage as england have no representatives in the quarter - finals when jurgen klinsmann spoke about the tactical revolution he was attempting to forge in germany in 2006 - a style of play which has since evolved at dortmund and bayern munich - he explicitly referenced the premier league and its pace
conversely , it was guardiola - and others , such as jurgen klopp , louis van gaal , jupp heynckes - surpassing that intensity which in turn overhauled the premier league
clubs such as barcelona , bayern munich , dortmund have retained their technical superiority over english clubs but they are now likely to out - run them and out - press them
and , guardiola 's obsession with pressing is rooted in an admiration for south american football and especially marcelo bielsa , rather than the premier league
and when guardiola put his arm around lionel messi at st andrews back in the summer of 2008 and convinced his young protege to buy into that pressing game , european football changed forever .
