jonjo o'neill hosted a media stable visit on thursday at his jackdaws castle yard in gloucestershire and said he could not be happier with favourite for the crabbie 's grand national , shutthefrontdoor
he trains shutthefrontdoor for his principal patron mcmanus , who owns jackdaws castle and retains ap mccoy , the record - breaking jump jockey who is about to gain his 20th consecutive jockeys ' championship and retire
ap mccoy has not decided yet whether he is riding shutthefrontdoor in the Â£ 1million crabbie 's grand national at aintree on april 11 , but everything points to him doing so
jonjo o'neill hopes jockey ap mccoy rides shutthefrontdoor to grand national success later this month jonjo o'neill told betfred : ' shutthefrontdoor is in great form
i would have liked to have got a run into him ( before the grand national ) but he had an abscess on his sinus in january / february time which took a while to find out where it was
he is going to aintree fresh and well
' you need to have a good classy horse for the grand national
aintree has done a great job with the track and the fences are first class
' i do n't bet so it does not make any difference to me what price he is - i am just training the horse as though he was going for a little race at stratford or whatever ! this year 's grand national will be ap mccoy 's last - ever at aintree before his retirement at the end of the season ' hopefully , ap is going to ride shutthefrontdoor and the public will want to back him , looking for a fairytale story
' the only pressure ( on me ) is that shutthefrontdoor gets there safe and sound
if he does n't win , we can blame whoever rides him ! ' i 'd love good ground at aintree - he is a well - balanced horse and a great mover
they make a good job of the ground at aintree - we just do n't want the heavens to open
he is as good as any horse in the grand national
' we are going there full of confidence , but you have got to be realistic - it is the grand national
' do n't push it gave jonjo o'neill , mcmanus and ap mccoy their first grand national victory in 2010
jonjo o'neill continued : ' this preparation has gone better than do n't push it 's
shutthefrontdoor , pictured with jonjo o'neill ( right ) is the favourite for the race on april 11 ' shutthefrontdoor is a lovely horse - a real old pet - and loves racing , while the other horse was half - mad , a character
the grand national fences are now really inviting
' the grand national grips you and is magic to be involved in
' jonjo o'neill envisages a team of between eight and 12 running at aintree during the three days of the crabbie 's grand national festival ( april 9 - 11 )
