just over a year ago , johnson sat in a room with journalists at the stadium of light and talked about england and the forthcoming world cup
johnson â scorer of seven goals in as many matches for sunderland â believed he was worthy of a recall , 21 months on from a five - minute cameo in norway âs ullevaal stadium during a euro 2012 warm - up friendly
johnson ( right ) was accompanied by his lawyer as he was charged with three counts of sexual activity with an underage girl and one of grooming johnson , an england international , was considered a prospect for roy hodgson as recently as a year ago johnson ( right ) was wearing a black tracksuit as he arrived at peterlee police station on thursday at 26 , was it plausible that johnson had rediscovered the fearless form many suspected he had left behind on teesside when he quit boro â the club who had expertly nurtured him â for manchester city in a Â£ 7million deal four years earlier ? for at the etihad , amid the millionaires and the silverware , johnson may have become a richer man , but he emerged a poorer player
in february of last year , however , and on the eve of a capital one cup final against the club at which his career had stalled , johnson spoke of playing his â best ever football â and was nât joking when he revealed summer holiday plans were on hold in the hope of adding to his 12 caps in brazil
johnson scored seven times in seven games during a run last season , and was still an england prospect johnson leaves the peterlee police station after learning of the charges against him johnson leaves peterlee police station after being charged with three offences of sexual activity the call never materialised and sunderland â beaten by manchester city at wembley â finished the season fighting relegation , johnson scoring just one goal in 16 matches as his form dipped
in fact , johnson âs form has never recovered
five goals from 31 appearances this season may well make him sunderland âs top scorer , but that masks what have been subdued and often sluggish performances , even if he remains their likeliest match - winner
he made a mockery of full backs and , indeed , those who had likened him to downing , for it quickly became apparent that johnson had the potential to be better than his boro team - mate
and so johnson was forgiven his uninspiring two - and - a - half years in manchester when he signed for boyhood club sunderland for Â£ 10million in the summer of 2012
last year , he reflected on his time at manchester city
â the winger played 81 minutes of sunderland 's 2 - 0 defeat by manchester united shortly before being arrested johnson has scored 20 goals for the sunderland since signing for the club in 2012 but perhaps mancini was sound in his judgment
for although , during three seasons on wearside , johnson âs three goals in a trio of victories at north east rivals newcastle have undoubtedly been the highlight , affording him terrace adulation , sunderland had expected far more when they laid down an eight - figure sum and wages of Â£ 50,000 per week
the future of both sunderland and their star player hang in the balance
