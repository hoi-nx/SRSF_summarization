tuesday night against italy could be the most important england game carrick has ever played
when carrick came on , england started to play
we have always had a major problem keeping the ball , but carrick keeps the game simple
hodgson âs team against italy looked like he had one eye on the future , but the only future england need to be focusing on is euro 2016
if that means going with a 34 - year - old carrick in the heart of midfield , so be it
tuesday night 's friendly clash with italy could prove to be carrick 's most important england game england international carrick keeps the game simple but has been unappreciated in this country carrick congratulates andros townsend following the tottenham wideman 's equaliser against italy in turin wayne rooney â the best player on the pitch by a mile was carrick
â sir alex ferguson ( in december ) â i still think carrick is the best central midfield player in english football , i really do
if i were england manager , that âs just what i âd do
his passing tore england apart at the world cup and he is worshipped in italy
why ca nât we love carrick in the same way ? the fact he has been ignored by england for so long is a sad indictment of where we have been going wrong for so many years
we love all - action players like steven gerrard and frank lampard but that âs why men like carrick can be left frustrated
at united in particular , carrick has had to deal with â keane syndrome â â because he âs not keane

it âs the same with andres iniesta and luka modric â they keep things ticking over , as does carrick
the midfield that started in turin was powerful and athletic , but sometimes you need a bit of guile
in a way , it was a good job the first half was so poor as it meant carrick could come on and really show what he can do
friendlies might be a good time to experiment but that first half in italy made for some uncomfortable viewing
phil jones has had a decent season at centre back but looked awkward in midfield and england âs passing was too slow and square
england were fluid and found more room to move against a tough opponent
when he gets possession , carrick quickly gets the ball out of his feet and tries to slide passes forward
they know that if anyone can pick out a pass , it âs carrick
carrick takes on midfield rival roberto soriano during england 's 1 - 1 draw with italy at the juventus stadium xavi and nemanja matic are two of the world 's best deep - lying midfielders and both have an eye for a pass carrick 's introduction against italy changed the game , the tempo and saw england become more fluid i âve said it before but carrick has a nasty habit of passing to his own players
it âs still not too late to make sure england have a pass master in place for euro 2016
carrick , who made his debut in 2001 ( right ) , could become england 's third - longest serving player at the euros
