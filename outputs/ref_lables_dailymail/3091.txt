stubbs hailed the bravery of his hibs players after they ruined hearts â easter road title party with a 2 - 0 derby win
he saw his men hold on to second place in the scottish championship with a second straight win , building momentum after a run of three consecutive defeats â and setting them up for saturday âs scottish cup semi-final against falkirk
stubbs , who had seen his team play well but fail to beat hearts in three previous outings this season , said his players had answered those who asked if they had the bottle to win at the business end of the season
â two weeks ago we were being questioned , â said stubbs after goals from jason cummings and farid el alagui saw them remain level on points with rangers , who have a game in hand
â people were asking if this was the wobble and was this hibs ; season ending again
stubbs saw his side record a win in the edinburgh derby to put hearts ' promotion party on hold â football can change very quickly
â stubbs singled out el alagui for special praise
the striker â not long back from seven months out with an achilles injury â played brilliantly before securing victory with his injury - time finish
â i âm absolutely delighted for him , â said the hibs manager
i do nât think people understood just how bad the injury was and the fact he is back playing now is all credit to him
hearts captain danny wilson picks the ball out of the back of the net after his side concede a second goal â the surgeon deserves praise for the procedure he did and it âs great to have him back , because he is something we have missed
the hibs fans were in good spirits at full - time after getting one over their city rivals â it âs probably the most important derby win i âve been involved in
