the worry for virgil van dijk is obvious
holland âs national team have already conceded more goals in five euro 2016 qualifiers than they lost in the entire qualifying campaign for the last world cup
the celtic defender made it into two squads last year
when the dutch were drawing 1 - 1 with turkey the other night he was sunning himself in the arabian gulf and bumping into club - mates instead
virgil van dijk has been in fine form for celtic but was n't rewarded with a call - up to the holland national team van dijk 's last call - up to the dutch side came last year though he has never been capped by his country â i saw stuart armstrong and callum mcgregor , â he says in deadpan fashion
â a holiday in dubai is rarely a cause of self - pity
yet van virgil van dijk âs gripe is obvious
his breakthrough to the national squad was short - lived and he ca nât shake the nagging belief that he might have a better chance of playing for his country if he performed in a more respected league than the spfl
celtic boss ronny deila denies this , using jason denayer âs belgium debut against israel by way of a counter argument
â i do nât know the level of the other central defenders in holland , but they must be very , very good to be better than virgil van dijk , in my opinion
but they play in italy , portugal or holland
all three leagues have a better reputation than the spfl and the worry for celtic is that virgil van dijk knows it
van dijk says he was happy for team - mate jason denayer , who made his debut for belgium against israel â yes , i think that âs maybe one of the big reasons , â says the defender
â they do nât take the ( scottish ) league too serious
for me , the only thing i can do is play well for celtic , work hard and prove myself day in and day out
but until that day will come , it âs just for me to work hard and win games for celtic and prove myself
i âve never played so many games in a season as i have this year so far and the travelling is also quite hard at time , mentally
i âve been to dubai and got some nice sun and relaxation
â ronny deila believes the standard of scottish football makes no difference to holland 's decision - making there is no envy of his friend and defensive partner jason denayer
the 20 - year - old was called into the fray for belgium after vincent kompany was sent off in midweek , playing half an hour for his homeland
â i âm very happy for him , â insists virgil van dijk
â he is a good friend of mine now and i âm very happy he made his debut
â whether either player will still be at celtic next season is impossible to say
â van dijk leaves the field after being sent off against inter milan in the europa league in february like virgil van dijk , his coach ronny deila also took a holiday ahead of friday night âs clash with st mirren in paisley and the final stretch of the domestic season
