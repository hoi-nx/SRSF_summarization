the damage was just part of the destruction caused by cowboy builders who had been called in to fix a leak in the beckle-raymond 's three bedroom property in london
instead , they left parents phillip , his wife gaby and their two young children , orion and aurielle , in an unsafe building with no roof while they ran off with Â£ 17,000 of their money
' for six months , the family were forced to live in one room of the house as they could n't afford to get the problems fixed straight away , having already shelled out to the cowboy builders who left them in the lurch
parents phillip , a civil servant , said : ' the house was crumbling around us , we had to turn off the lights as water was getting into electricity , it was that time of year when it was getting dark at 4pm , it was miserable
' parents phillip and gaby had used all their savings to buy the property five years before for Â£ 325,000
as a result , rain got into the property causing ceilings to collapse the parents say they are devastated at being ' taken for a ride '
when they sprung a small leak in part of the roof , they called in a builder who recommended they re-tile the roof at a cost of about Â£ 3,000
he suggested they use the opportunity to expand their home and add value to the property by adding a loft conversion
the couple thought it was great idea and decided to use a sub contractor their builder recommended and pay a Â£ 7,000 deposit for the work
the family had to live in one room for six months as they could n't afford the repairs so far the couple had paid the first builder Â£ 10,000 in total - and had a home with no roof to show for it
after the sub contractor began to work on their home , the first builder then disappeared
parents phillip said : ' we heard from sub contractor that the builder 's uncle was sick in ireland so he was going there - we never hard from him again
' meanwhile , the sub contractor began work on their loft conversion after asking for Â£ 7,000 for materials and labour
gaby said : ' he was trying to build a loft conversion without steel supports - which we had paid for
' shocking : the collapse of the roof left their home filled with rubble daylight : with the tiles gone , the family were left with bare rafters and no protection from the elements the couple were unable to contact the first builder and have reported the sub contractor to trading standards
they have been left devastated by the state of their home - as well as Â£ 17,000 out of pocket
' we have lost the home we have been building over the last few years , our whole house has been destroyed , it 's been a living nightmare
unsafe : the family are devastated that they have been left to live in an unsafe home damage : a local builder darren louis has been helping the family to clear up the mess left behind a local builder , darren louis , has been working on the property at weekends - so far without payment - so the family have a roof over their heads again
