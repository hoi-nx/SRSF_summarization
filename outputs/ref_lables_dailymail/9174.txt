fifa vice-president jim boyce claimed on wednesday night that the sfa were â entirely wrong â in their move to ban meekings from the cup
meekings was charged over the handball that thwarted a leigh griffiths effort in their semi-final victory - an incident which also prompted celtic to write to the sfa seeking â an understanding â of why no penalty and red card followed
inverness defender meekings ' arm blocks the ball and prevents a goal to celtic on sunday meekings has been retrospectively suspended for one match , the punishment he would have got if sent off but northern irishman boyce , who is also chairman of fifa âs referees committee , believes the only potential punishment should be levelled at match referee steven mclean and his assistants
â fifa 's head of referees jim boyce says the suspension of a player for an unpunished handball is wrong inverness is appealing the ruling that , if upheld , will deny meekings ( right ) a place in the cup final the sfa âs disciplinary rules provide scope for action against sending - off offences not seen by the referee , including denying the opposition a goal or an obvious goalscoring opportunity
meekings ( right ) celebrates inverness 's 3 - 2 win over celtic in their cup semi-final â i suppose it âs natural to feel sympathetic for a player who is potentially missing out on a place in the cup , which might be a once - in - a - lifetime chance
â but if steven mclean had seen it at the time , he âd have been sent off and he âd be missing the final had inverness gone on to win ; and if he ( meekings ) had nât done it , celtic would have scored and there âs a good chance they would have gone on to win , so again meekings would have missed the final
