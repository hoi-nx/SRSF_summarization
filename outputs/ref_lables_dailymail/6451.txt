davion only , 16 , became the face of adoption and an example of all the struggles faced by many teenagers in the system when in 2013 he stood up in a suit and told worshipers at florida 's st mark missionary baptist church ; ' my name is davion and i 've been in foster care since i was born
' most of all , davion said he just wanted a family that would ' love him forever
' millions of people around the country soon head about davion 's story , and the young boy was even interviewed by barbara walters on the view , which all eventually led to him being adopted by a minister in ohio and his family
that is until davion got into a fight with one of the other children , and the minister sent him back to florida , and back to live in the foster care system
' making matters worse , davion and miss connie , as he calls her , did not speak when he came back to florida
then , one night last july , davion called up miss connie and asked her the question he had been asking since they first met when he was only a little boy
the 52 - year - old had three children of her own , one adopted and two biological daughters , and was a single mother , but she was no longer davion 's case worker , which made the process easier
davion ( above ) called and asked miss connie if she would adopt him last july ' i guess i always thought of you as my mom , ' davion ( above in 2013 ) said to going last december davion got his first bedroom , his first set of siblings , and , most importantly , the one thing he had been hoping for all along
' i guess i always thought of you as my mom , ' davion said to going last december
' only now i get to call you that for real , right ? ' going is set to officially become davion 's mother on april 22 , and she will admit it has not been an easy task
davion officially became part of the family in february however , when after he and going celebrated their birthdays , which fall on the same date , they went home and sat around the table for cake with his three siblings and signed the court papers
