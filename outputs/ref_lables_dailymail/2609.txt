condemned staffordshire terrier izzy is set to be destroyed after she bit a woman in august 2012 after escaping from her owner isbester 's backyard in the basin , east melbourne , victoria
the woman who izzy bit suffered a 1.5cm to her finger on august 4 in 2012 , which is deemed as a ' serious injury ' under the domestic animal act in victoria law , and izzy was seized by the council in june 2013
this is the first time a dog on death row is having its case heard in australia 's highest court
condemned staffordshire terrier izzy is set to be destroyed but could be saved by a final high court bid richard kendall qc , representing ms isbester , argued a member of the panel which determined izzy 's fate had a conflict of interest
hughes investigated the attack izzy made in august 2012 and presented evidence at a later magistrates court hearing in which ms isbester pleaded guilty
in 2013 she pleaded guilty to a charge relating to an 1.5cm cut allegedly caused by izzy on the middle finger of a woman trying to pull the dog away from her daughters
a dog on death row will for the first time in history have its case heard in the high court of australia the dog has been housed by the rspca since it was seized two years ago , sparking a lengthy legal battle
lawyers representing the dog at no cost to the client say the local council that is fighting for izzy 's destruction in the high court is wasting public money by perusing the case
city of city of knox council has refused rspca australia 's offer to rehabilitate the pet and assume all liability for her at no extra cost from the time of collection
' the council is prepared to spend a six figure sum fighting to kill a dog when they might lose in the high court , ' barrister mcewen , founder of the barristers animal welfare panel told daily mail australia
in normal circumstances izzy 's case would never have made it to the high court but her fate has taken an unusual twist due to the manner in which the local council made in administrative decision for her to be put down
in a letter to the city of knox council , the ceo of rspca sa tim vasudeva , wrote an offer to assess and then possibly rehabilitate and rehome izzy at no cost to the council instead of seeing her destroyed
' in september 2013 , izzy 's owner ms isbester pleaded guilty to charges of her dog causing ' serious injury ' at ringwood magistrates court but the local council , the city of knox , did not apply for a destruction order on izzy from the magistrate at that time
instead , the council ruled that the dog should be destroyed during a council panel meeting
the team of barristers fighting izzy 's case from the barristers animal welfare panel , including richard kendall qc and andrew felkel , is now challenging the decision that the panel came to based on administrative law grounds
' in a letter to the city of knox council , the ceo of rspca sa tim vasudeva , wrote an offer to assess and then possibly rehabilitate and rehome her at no cost to the council instead of seeing her destroyed
