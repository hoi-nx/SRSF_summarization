manziel has been released from rehab
after checking into a facility on january 28 and stating that he wanted to ' be a better family member , friend and teammate , ' the cleveland browns quarterback is out and ready to begin offseason workouts with the team , which begin on april 20
now comes the real test however , as he will be forced to compete with josh mccown for the starting quarterback position , who just signed a $ 14 million contract with the team that covers the next three seasons
this after a rookie season in which he saw limited game time and suffered difficult losses in his only two starts , manziel was no doubt hoping to step out of the spotlight following the end of the cleveland browns season last december , but talk soon turned to whether or not the accomplished footballer might have a problem
especially after one incident last year when , after partying until well past midnight , manziel , who is suffering from an injured hamstring , skipped out on a saturday morning team treatment session because he overslept , and in turn was fined by the cleveland browns
' and while his season may have been over at that time , many believed manziel would still tone things down for a bit in the wake of that controversy , which made it all the more shocking when he was spotted partying at fdr lounge at the delano in miami on over the new year holiday , alongside the likes of lebron james and ryan phillippe , and then seen chugging champagne straight from the bottle while sitting poolside with girlfriend colleen crowley and some buddies poolside at the delano
at this point , some in the sports world , chief among them columnist bayless , began to suggest that the heisman trophy winner needed to get help for his drinking
' manziel was known for his partying while at texas a&m , but said he was a changed man during the 2014 nfl draft , noting that he had ' grown up , ' before being selected 22nd overall by cleveland browns
a source told cleveland.com at the time ; ' team officials had bought into manziel 's pre-draft promises to tone down the partying and leave his frat - boy lifestyle back in college station , texas , and they 've been stunned by his non-stop antics
' a photo snapped of manziel before the start of the season and later posted to instagram showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter manziel while the 2013 heisman trophy as the quarterback of the texas a&m university aggies also causing some alarm before the season even began was a photo snapped of manziel and later posted to instagram that showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter , leading some to suggest that he might have been snorting cocaine
manziel is now set to begin offseason workouts with the cleveland browns on april 20 as for his future with the cleveland browns , that is a little unclear
some , including espn 's pat mcmanamon , have called on the cleveland browns to fire manziel after he overslept for his treatment last year , saying he and fellow player gordon have a ' complete lack of professionalism
currently , manziel has a four year contract with the cleveland browns worth about $ 8.25 million
