amid the horror of a nazi concentration camp , liberated by the british army 70 years ago this week , love blossomed against all the odds between an emaciated inmate and one of the soldiers sent to arrest her ss guards
but the love between british soldier , sergeant norman , 24 at the time , and teenage polish girl gena , 20 , was only kindled because of the generosity and kindness of the camp 's british commander leonard berney
this week survivors and liberators of the notorious belsen camp in northern germany gathered to commemorate the day british soldiers entered its gates and began the task of saving as many of the 60,000 starving inmates as was possible
gena and norman were married two months short of their golden wedding anniversary of 50 years , pictured before his passing in 1995 norman pictured as a young soldier in the british intelligence corps in his early 20s ( l ) and gena turgel as a young girl ( r ) gena , weighing only a few pounds was , like many others in the camp , a walking skeleton , for whom certain death was only days away
before long norman had fallen in love with the young jewish girl who at last was being fed proper food and was being given clothes to wear again
anne frank , whose diaries of persecution at the hands of the nazis became the defining account of the holocaust , was just one of belsen 's many victims
anne frank , and her sister margot , were taken to belsen , where they died of typhus in february 1945 , just months before the allies liberated it
belsen 's ss commandant , the cruel and tyrannical joseph kramer , was among those norman helped to round up and capture
norman became so besotted with gena that he told her he was going to marry her one day
he played cupid for soldier norman and gena
major berney , now 95 and living in retirement , took a personal interest in their unlikely romance , making sure messages to each other reached their destination in the chaos of the post-liberation activity
' historic : as a crowd of people watch on , british troops burn the buildings to the ground horrific : around 500 people were dying per day of typhus and starvation when the allies arrived the camp , which became the final resting place of 50,000 jews , gypsies , homosexuals , nazi opponents and those with disabilities , is burned to the ground after liberation in 1945 once gena had been released from her living hell and been restored to health , norman and she married and started lived in london
he passed away a few years ago but gena was prominent this week in the anniversary of belsen 's liberation
gena at a book launch with major berney 's son , john wood , who said : ' my father gave the young couple permission to hold an engagement party and they were grateful for ever for his personal interventions ' she said : ' today it is hard to imagine what it was like in the camp , people so thin and so defeated that it was hard to tell if they were men or women
he was a wonderful man and made sure that norman and i kept our romance alive in the most testing conditions
