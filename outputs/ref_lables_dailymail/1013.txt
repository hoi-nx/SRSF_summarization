hibernian , hearts and rangers united in condemnation of the spfl 's decision to move the ibrox club 's final game of the championship season back 24 hours
in a move designed to accommodate broadcasters , rangers will face champions hearts at tynecastle on may 3 â 24 hours after hibernian and promotion rivals falkirk and queen of the south play
adamant the final round of fixtures should be played at the same time to avert any competitive advantage for mccall 's side , easter road chief executive leanne dempster and hearts chairwoman ann budge have lodged formal complaints with the league
in a staggering misjudgment of the public mood , however , the spfl issued a statement expressing surprise at the fuss before rangers boss mccall compounded their woe by revealing he also backed hibernian ' stance
hibernian are upset that rangers ' final game of the season has been pushed back for tv purposes ramping up the pressure on spfl chief executive neil doncaster , hibernian counterpart leanne dempster said : ' in previous seasons , the league has ensured that all of the final round fixtures are played at the same time
' i have been in contact with the spfl following its announcement that one final - round fixture would kick off after all the other results are known
' on a day when the relationship between broadcasters and scottish football came under unprecedented scrutiny , hearts majority shareholder budge backed up her city rivals
in a statement , budge also queried the ' sporting integrity ' of rangers playing 24 hours after their rivals given they are engaged in a dogfight with hibernian for second place
' this has been done following selection of the game for a live tv broadcast , ' she said
' while we all knew that this was likely to be a strong candidate for televising and that the time might well change , we did not for one minute think that at this late stage , it would be moved to the sunday , especially given our belief that all championship games would require to be played at the same time
rangers will play hearts at tynecastle in their final game of the season on may 3 ' being given 17 days ' notice of this change is extremely disruptive and potentially very expensive for the fans , the sponsors and indeed the club
on this weekend , the hearts v rangers match is scheduled for sunday 3 may to be broadcast on television and it is not clear to us why this has caused so much surprise
hearts are already promoted from the championship , but they too condemned the fixture change ' it is unreasonable to expect all championship fixtures that weekend to move to the sunday when a number of them will be unaffected by the hearts v rangers tie
' to date , we have had no request from hibernian to move its fixture to the sunday at the time of writing ( 8.45pm , wednesday 15 april )
' we also note speculation that police scotland expressed concern to the spfl about the scheduling of the hearts v rangers match
' after his side drew with livingston last night , however , ibrox manager mccall gave his view , saying : ' first and foremost , we 've not asked for the game to be changed
i think every game on the last day of the season should be played at the same time
i would imagine that it will be changed over the next 24 or 48 hours to play at the same time
