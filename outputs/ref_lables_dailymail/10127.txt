chelsea 's eden hazard and arsenal 's cazorla are set to reach a premier league milestone this weekend when they each make their 100th appearance
both players have been hugely influential since they moved to london in the summer of 2012 , but who has been the most exciting import to watch ? here , sportsmail 's reporters choose the player they most enjoy seeing in action
eden hazard ( l ) and cazorla are both set to make their 100th premier league appearance this weekend lee clayton cazorla has wonderful balance
cazorla is two - footed
so , while there is not a lot to choose between them and eden hazard is likely to get the most picks in this article , i am going for cazorla
verdict : cazorla cazorla , pictured in action against burnley , has been an influential part of arsenal 's midfield this season ian ladyman i remember when manchester city baulked at paying eden hazard 's wages when the belgium was up for grabs in 2012
roll forward to 2015 , however , and the 24 - year - old has developed in to one of the most important players in the premier league
he would get in every team in the premier league and is one of the reasons chelsea will win the title this season
i saw him play for lille twice in the season before he joined chelsea â once against st etienne , the other was what proved to be his final appearance against nancy
verdict : hazard hazard celebrates after scoring a fine individual goal in chelsea 's 3 - 2 win against hull in march nick harris now this is a tricky one because while eden hazard will frequently embark on a dribble or dink in a pass that will make you nod in appreciation , he 'll also miss a penalty and make you groan
whereas the older cazorla , less flashy but no less of a technical master , is to my mind more of a fulcrum , more important relatively to the sum of arsenal 's parts than eden hazard is to chelsea
you 'll gasp at hazard but cazorla 's wow factor is richer
forced to pick though , it 's cazorla , for his consistency and crucially doing it in the biggest games
exhibit a would be manchester city 0 arsenal 2 in january ; goal , assist , all - round brilliance , against a big team , at an important time
verdict : cazorla cazorla scores from the penalty spot in arsena 's 2 - 0 away win at manchester city in january riath al - samarrai eden hazard for me
cazorla is an utter delight , a little pinball of a man who is probably the most two - footed player i 've seen
but eden hazard is the top player in the premier league , in my opinion
this is the sixth of his eight seasons as a professional where he has reached double figures and yet he offers so much more than goals ( 36 in 99 in the premier league for chelsea )
verdict : hazard belgium international hazard scores a header past west ham goalkeeper adrian at upton park sami mokbel both are marvellous players , but i could watch cazorla all day
hazard is a phenomenon , but aesthetically no on can touch cazorla in the premier league
verdict : cazorla cazorla grins after scoring arsenal 's fourth goal against aston villa at the emirates in february jack gaughan from a purely artistic sense , cazorla is probably the most graceful individual on the ball in the entire premier league
cazorla can excite at times , but he is nowhere near consistently reaching eden hazard 's level
verdict : hazard hazard tucks home yet another penalty during chelsea 2 - 1 win against stoke city last weekend craig hope i would far rather have hazard in my team , but i ca n't help but feel the excitement has been stripped from him under mourinho
verdict : hazard result : hazard 7 - 3 cazorla hazard has been voted as a more exciting player than cazorla in sportsmail 's survey
