last year it was ' dare to zlatan ' and 12 months on it seems to be ' zlatan , ' following the launch of a brand new website
zlatan has made the headlines throughout his trophy - laden career but it appears a novel way has been created to find any information purely about the maverick 32 - year - old striker
search engine zlaaatan.com has immortalised the psg forward with the site totally devoted to the french giants ' no 10
zlatan has had a search engine website created in his honour called zlaaatan.com the website has an identical style to google with users given the option to ' zlatan search ' or ' i 'm feeling zlatan ' in a house style that is identical to google , and operates just like the search engine , users have the option to ' zlatan search ' or ' i 'm feeling zlatan
' the click of the former button takes users to articles about zlatan on google , while the latter directs them to his wikipedia page
in addition any results from the search bar will automatically add ' zlatan ' to the front - meaning he will forever be at the forefront of the news
it must be said though that website is neither affiliated with zlatan nor google
the website though has no affliation with the psg no 10 ( left ) nor google creative director of sweetpop , the agency that came up with the website idea , andreas killander hopes the search engine will bring a smile to the sweden international
' our search engine is linked to google but all the searches are zlatanified
all the results have some link to zlatan ... if you type in ferrari , you 'll get stuff about zlatan 's ferrari ; if you want a recipe , you 'll get the zlatan burger
' zlatan is an idol
' sweetpop , the agency that came up with the website idea , hope that zlatan ( left ) will find it amusing as memorable as he can be with his feet , zlatan can also do likewise with his tongue
' zlatan may not have been named on the shortlist for the 2012 ballon d'or award , but it clearly did n't affect the striker 's confidence in his own ability
' zlatan came up against cristiano ronaldo in the play - off to reach the world cup in brazil last summer , but it was sweden that were on the losing side and the psg forward let everyone know there was n't much point in watching a tournament that did n't feature himself
' zlatan tried to pass the blame to former juventus team - mate david trezeguet after reports of excessive behaviour following the club 's serie a title success
' after mario balotelli , a former team - mate of zlatan 's at inter milan , set fire to his bathroom when he let fireworks of out the window , the psg hitman admitted his like for fireworks
' zlatan 's short and tumultuous stint in la liga with barcelona was riddled with arguments and falling outs , particularly with manager pep guardiola and the 33 - year - old was not happy with his role in the team .
