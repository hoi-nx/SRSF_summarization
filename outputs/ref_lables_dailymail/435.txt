it 's a charged scene
a woman wearing just a bra and a flared mini skirt sashays across a room , where a smartly dressed man awaits
it could be an outtake from a film noir movie of yesteryear or even a discarded scene from the hit recent film 50 shades of grey
in fact , it 's an advert from cosmetics giant revlon for their latest lipstick
the stylish ad is filmed entirely in black and white , with just a slick of pink visible on the woman 's lips
revlon uk 's new global tag line , love is on , is the label 's first major relaunch in more than a decade
love is by far and away the most powerful and most positive ... truly , l-o-v-e is at the heart of the word revlon
we see her apply lipstick several times throughout the clip she wears just a bra and flared mini skirt , while her love interest is clad in shirt and tie the woman later pushes him back onto the couch and removes his tie she gently ties it around his eyes creating a blindfold crackling with romance and play , the pair 's private encounter is bound to get you all hot and bothered the woman whispers something incomprehensible in his ear through lipsticked lips , and leaves the man removes the blindfold and laughs to find she 's drawn a heart in the mirror and left a lipstick kiss
