a milk price war is set to break out following a landmark decision by the eu to scrap quotas restricting production a milk price war is set to break out following a landmark decision by the eu to scrap quotas restricting production
the quota system was abolished today after 30 years - allowing dairy farmers to produce as much milk as they like without suffering a financial penalty
the move is expected to drive a spike in production , particularly in countries like ireland , germany and the netherlands , who plan to boost exports of milk and other dairy products to the uk
however , british farmers are likely to find the price they are paid by supermarkets is driven down , which will be particularly difficult for smaller family businesses
farmers who produced above their quota were hit with punishing cash penalties
the new free - for - all will promote dairy factory farms , where super-size holstein cows have been bred to produce more milk than any calf could drink in order to cut production costs
the average milk production from holstein dairy cows , which have been labelled â udders on legs â , has risen by 55per cent to 7,327 litres per animal per year â around 12,900 pints
dairy farmers have been under severe pressure in the past year as the result of a global glut in milk and a supermarket price war that drove down the price of a pint , making it cheaper than some bottled water
some dairy processors have starting to raise farm gate prices recently , however farmers remain concerned the end of quotas could bring enormous price swings
with milk prices yet to show any strong signs of recovery , this could push farmgate milk prices down further in the eu , and stall any recovery in the dairy markets

the european milk board , a federation of dairy farmers with member organisations from 13 countries , said it was likely that the market would not be able to cope with significantly expanded production in a reasonable way
â prices will be rock - bottom , as europe âs farmers will have even less market power to achieve a cost - covering milk price in the future
â irish dairy farmers have embarked on a massive expansion plan and will be looking to make big in - roads to the british market
