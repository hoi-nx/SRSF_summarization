many californians are taking extreme measures to conserve water in the face of the state 's historic drought
water - conscious residents have turned to techniques that utilize so - called ' gray water ' to help them meet the unprecedented new water - use restrictions imposed by governor jerry brown last week
those techniques may appear weird to some - like the toilet that doubles as a sink and used washing machine water used to water fruit trees - but these californians maintain it 's the inevitable future of water conservation
