ironing may be the marmite of household chores
british company swan , which sold its first iron in 1933 , has just released a top - of - the - range steam generator iron , for Â£ 279.99
but does it really make things easier ? tessa cunningham finds out
super steamer swan si9031n steam generator iron , Â£ 279.99 , swan - brand.co.uk if you loathe ironing enough to splash out almost Â£ 300 , then swan âs luxury model could be the one for you
it âs usually my least favouite chore , but when testing this one , i got to work in front of poldark and was done within 20 minutes
because all the water is in the separate 1,000ml generator tank , the iron itself is lightweight
the steam is forced out of the generator through a hose into the iron , shooting out at 90g per minute â twice as fast as conventional steam irons ( think of the difference in power between jet - washing and using a hosepipe ) â cutting through creases quicker
as well as being more powerful , it also produces twice as much steam , making shorter work of wrinkles
3/5 precision perfect philips easy speed plus , Â£ 29.50 , amazon.co.uk the big selling point of this pretty aqua blue iron is the precision tip , which means you can get really sharp creases flat with minimum elbow grease , making it perfect for shirts and trousers
i also love the vertical steam option , which means you can smooth creases from hanging fabrics , such as curtains , by holding the iron vertically 2 in away and pressing the steam button
steam output is 35g per minute â with a boost function of up to 120g to blast at stubborn creases

and while the dolphin - shaped nose helps me reach tricky areas , such as around shirt buttons , it makes the iron look downright ugly
