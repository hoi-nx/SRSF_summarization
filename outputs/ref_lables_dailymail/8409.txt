dear lord hall , my jeans are too tight , my hairstyle is an exercise in holding back the years , my friends are all incredibly right - wing and i âve got hog - whimperingly drunk in the presence of david cameron on more than one occasion
but none of these are the reasons why i want you to give me jeremy clarkson âs job
i know many men may baulk at the suggestion that a woman can take jeremy clarkson âs place
just look at what happened to sue perkins this week , who received a barrage of abuse on twitter when her name was mentioned for the role , along the lines of : â men do cars , women do cake
â but i think i âm perfect for the job , and my principal qualification is entirely basic
why ? because women love cars just as much men ! i like the big ones with leather seats and walnut dashboards
i like the mad ones with three types of suspension
i like the small , nippy ones with exciting turning circles
i like the old - fashioned ones with manual chokes
i even like those weird french ones with the hydraulic suspension that feel and handle like ocean - liners
all the most memorable moments in my life feature the internal combustion engine
as a baby , the only way my parents could get me to go to sleep was to drive me round the block in their mini
once i âd nodded off , they âd reward themselves with a pint and a packet of crisps , leaving me happily slumbering in the pub car park
those were more laissez - faire times
when i was four , we emigrated to italy and the mini was sold
just like jeremy clarkson , ' my jeans are too tight and my hairstyle is an exercise in holding back the years , ' says sarah vine , but that 's not the reason she believes she 'd be perfect for the vacant role on top gear here they made everything you can possibly imagine on wheels , from the great iveco trucks to flashy ferraris
cars were the lifeblood of the city
and i âm no car snob either : over the years i owned cars of all pedigrees and prices , from my first , a burgundy mini van bought for Â£ 500 , through various follies to a 1967 karmann ghia that burnt more oil than it ever did petrol
by the time i returned from calling the aa from the phone booth â this was before mobile phones â the square had been closed off , the car surrounded by police cars and bomb disposal experts were preparing to carry out a controlled explosion on it
despite being the size of a peanut , it has six gears ( i hate point - and - press automatics , they take all the fun out of driving ) and a special button that says â sport â on it
if i press it , the exhaust makes a pleasing â vroom , vroom â noise , and my right foot itches to go all the way to the floor
i âm not one of those women who pootles along at a constant 70 in the middle lane of a motorway , rummaging around in her bag for lipstick , or surreptitiously checking her texts
sue perkins ( pictured ) received a barrage of abuse on twitter this week after her name was mentioned in association with presenting top gear perhaps it âs the fact that i learnt to drive in italy , where every other driver is either a drunk or a lunatic , but i never take my eyes off the road
yours hopefully , sarah vine ( aka mrs toad ) ps. i have a full , clean driving licence .
