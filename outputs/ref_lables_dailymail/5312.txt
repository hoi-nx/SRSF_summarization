chip shop boss john clarkson has created a new answer to the creme question of ' how do you eat yours ? ' - by turning the chocolate into a pie to serve with chips
eschewing the savoury favourites of sausage and egg or mince pies , mr john clarkson decided to wrap the easter delicacies in pastry before they were battered and deep - fried
the pie was created by blind - baking the casing as the egg would otherwise melt down , then one - and - a - half creme eggs were popped in as a filling
a lid is put on to seal the dish before the pie is battered and fried until golden , and if the timings are expertly observed , the chocolate will just begin to soften in the middle
mr john clarkson , who runs mr eaters fish and chips in preston , lancashire , said : ' i love easter and i love creme eggs but i thought it would be fun to try and put my own spin on them
' everyone has heard of battered mars bars by now so i thought , " what would be the next step up ? " mr john clarkson rolls out the pie casing ( left ) before stuffing one and a half creme eggs into it ( right ) the pie is then covered with a lid and dipped in batter ( left ) before being quickly deep fried ( right ) ' creme eggs are just the right size and shape to be placed in a pie , so i thought ' why not ? ' ' it 's a laugh and i always like seeing what i can conjure up next for customers that might be seen as a bit strange or unusual
