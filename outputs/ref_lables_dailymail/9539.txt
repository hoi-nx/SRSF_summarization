has this brilliant 79th masters got one final twist to reveal come the final round on sunday ? no - one would be surprised following the dramatic events of the third round , when the three biggest names in the sport combined with justin rose to throw the veritable kitchen sink at the cool 21 year old texan jordan spieth
the young american coped so adeptly he gave up just one shot of his five stroke halfway lead and will partner rose in the final round armed with a useful advantage
jordan spieth is the third player his age to take a healthy lead into the final round
it worked out perfectly for tiger woods in 1997 but not so well for rory mcilroy in 2011 , who collapsed under the pressure over the final nine holes
â i think jordan will cope better than i did because he was in the final group last year , â said rory mcilroy
â jordan spieth carded a double bogey on the 17th but still set a new 54 - hole scoring record at the masters at 16 under par , jordan spieth broke the record shared by ray floyd and tiger woods by a single shot the other thing jordan spieth has in his favour is that this is the fourth tournament in a row when he has been in the final group in the final round
if he wins , he will go to number two in the world and the rivalry with rory mcilroy that might dominate golf for the next decade will have begun
jordan spieth looked to have taken the tournament beyond everyone else when he went seven strokes clear with just two holes to play
but while rose finished off with a staggering fifth birdie in his last six holes , jordan spieth was running up his first double bogey of the tournament at the 17th
and at the last there was a horrible fanned approach that threatened to trim the lead to just three , before jordan spieth conjured up a remarkable up and down to give him momentum heading into what promises to be another momentous masters sunday
plucky journeyman charley hoffman lies fourth while tiger woods and rory mcilroy both shot 68 to be tied fifth and will play together on sunday
pick of the quintet of birdies came at the par three 16th , where he holed a spectacular bunker shot
â world no 1 rory mcilroy and 14 - time major winner tiger woods were in a five - way tie for fifth finally , the real rory mcilroy showed upon the par fives at augusta on saturday what a day we had on saturday
â for those who thought the runaway halfway leader had merely to turn up to claim the green jacket , we had rory mcilroy playing like the world number one and tiger woods confounding the sceptics with a bravura display that made you feel the last 12 months had all been a bad dream
how would you like to see all that taking place in your rear view mirror , at this of all courses ? in short , for five simply incredible hours the roars were echoing all over this sacred property and for most of that time they were funnelling in jordan spieth âs direction
tiger woods put on a vintage show , he was astonishing , electric , inspired and charismatic tiger woods ' girlfriend lindsey vonn showed her support during the third round on saturday the previous 54 hole standard of 15 under was set by ray floyd in 1976 and tiger woods in 1997
but the youngest first round leader in masters history and the man who set a new low mark for 36 holes on friday had reached 16 under after a 70
when things like this happen here it âs so easy for the mind to unravel but jordan spieth kept his composure
jordan spieth knocked his approach to 6ft and holed that one as well to turn in 35 shots
mickelson played like the masters specialist to finish the third round on 11 under justin rose reeled off five birdies in the last six holes to move into second place on 12 under as he made his way down the 15th fairway , first mickelson and then rose made amazing birdies at the 16th to send the crowd into raptures
rory mcilroy , tiger woods and mickelson all shot sumptuous front nines of 32 shots
add rory mcilroy âs wonderful back nine 31 from friday afternoon to his front nine 32 yesterday , and you would have a round that equalled the course record of 63
â finally , the real rory mcilroy showed up on the par fives , those scoring holes that have given him such problems in recent years
he birdied the long 8th plus the 13th and 15th for his best - ever return on the par fives during a single round at the masters
