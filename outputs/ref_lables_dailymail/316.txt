now scientists have unraveled how octopuses manage to keep track of all of their flailing limbs as they crawl over objects
the video above , recorded by researchers at the hebrew university of jerusalem , shows how that despite its body orientation ( green arrow ) the octopus can crawl in any direction ( blue arrow ) thanks to its flexible arms using high speed videos of octopuses as they negotiated obstacles , biologists at the hebrew university of jerusalem in israel studied the cephlopods movement
they found that the orientation of the creature 's body and the crawling direction are controlled independently in the brain
it is the first time scientists have been able to fully understand how octopuses are able to control their movements without a rigid skeleton
the findings may help scientists develop new ways for soft robots to move around and can also shed some light on how octopuses evolved in the first place
professor binyamin hochner , who led the research , said : ' octopuses use unique locomotion strategies that are different from those found in other animals
the octopus was found to move by pushing with its legs rather than pulling while it could move in any direction regardless of the position of its body - something that humans find extremely difficult to do without falling over dr levy , a neurobiologist who also took part in the research at the hebrew university of jerusalem , said : ' during evolution , octopuses lost their heavy protective shells and became more maneuverable on the one hand , but also more vulnerable on the other hand
' the researchers , whose work is published in the journal current biology , found that despite their large number of arms , octopuses do not move them in any rhythmical pattern like insects and millipedes do , for example
speaking to the bbc , dr levy said the findings could help develop robots that can squeeze into difficult to reach spaces
