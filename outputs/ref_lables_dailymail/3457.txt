still employed : rolling stone is not expected to take any action against erdely , whose reporting was roundly discredited an independent review of rolling stone 's story about an alleged violent gang rape at the university of virginia said the story fell apart because of ' basic , even routine ' failures of journalism
professors at the columbia journalism school issued a 12,000 - word autopsy of the discredited story sunday night , going through its shortcomings step by step
rolling stone bosses commissioned the review after the story , by contributing editor erdely , was called into serious question
her piece credulously recounted the story of an anonymous student - referred to as jackie - who said she was lured to the phi kappa psi house and raped by a gang of seven men
it described the ordeal , during which jackie said she was passed from man to man in an excruciating three hours of pain , during which she was also supposedly penetrated with a beer bottle upstairs during a pledging event
the article recounted the event in vivid , graphic detail based on jackie 's account
' the review spelled out extensive contact between erdely and jackie , spanning eight interviews
erdely wrote 405 pages of notes about the story
jackie also spent four hours speaking to a rolling stone fact - checker
police officials say she refused to be interviewed in the course of their investigation erdely had asked repeatedly for the name of the supposed attacker , but jackie said she was not ' comfortable ' with the idea of him being contacted for the story
erdely asked jackie again for the name once the public interrogation of her account began
they said that had they reached out to some people named - specifically friends whom jackie spoke to immediately after the supposed rape - her credibility would have collapsed in time to ditch the story
erdely asked to speak to one of the friends - fellow student duffin - using jackie as a go - between
jackie told erdely he refused and was ' incredulous ' at the request , calling the rolling stone article a 's * * * show '
erdely admitted that if she had spoken to duffin and realized the inconsistency , she would likely have dropped jackie 's story
claims : the story published in november focused on a university of virginia student named jackie who claimed to have been gang raped by seven men at the campus ' phi kappa psi fraternity two years ago
the review concluded : ' rolling stone 's repudiation of the main narrative in a rape on campus is a story of journalistic failure that was avoidable
' the magazine set aside or rationalized as unnecessary essential practices of reporting that , if pursued , would likely have led the magazine 's editors to reconsider publishing jackie 's narrative so prominently , if at all
sean woods , one of jackie 's editors , described the scandal over the article as ' it 's been an extraordinarily painful and humbling experience '
' i want to offer my deepest apologies : to rolling stone 's readers , to my rolling stone editors and colleagues , to the university of virginia community , and to any victims of sexual assault who may feel fearful as a resolut of my article
' i allowed my concern for jackie 's well - being , my fear of re-traumatizing her , and my confidence in her credibility to take the place of more questioning and more facts
