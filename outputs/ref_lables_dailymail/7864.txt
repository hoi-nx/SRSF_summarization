numbers of the reds , popularly illustrated in the beatrix potter squirrel nutkin books , have been rapidly dwindling thanks in large part to the squirrel pox virus carried by greys
but now , red squirrels have been spotted in windermere , in the picturesque lake district

since 1952 , 95 % of red squirrels have been wiped out in england and wales
but bob cartwright , of charity westmorland red squirrels , said they are returning to woods in the area - and some have even been spotted in the town centre
he said : ' so far this year there have been seven sightings , including just a few weeks ago a red seen bouncing around in ellerthwaite square right in the centre of windermere
recent britain studies of 300 woodlands have also shown red squirrels are battling against the greys with numbers rising steadily

more than 700 red squirrels are now thought to live on anglesey , with many crossing the menai strait to settle in bangor
rachel miller , red squirrel field officer at the wildlife trust for lancashire and north merseyside , said : ' it could be a few years down the line until we know for sure if red squirrels have any long - term immunity or not , as there is much more research that needs to be done

numbers are now increasing with red squirrel sightings reported across the region
