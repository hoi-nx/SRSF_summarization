with just a point separating them in third and fourth , the stage is set for a battle of high intensity
manuel pellegrini said : ' it is difficult to have a more intense match than you have in the premier league every week but of course you add a little bit more for a derby of the city
' city have held the edge over united in recent contests and could register a fifth successive derby win for the first time in their history with victory this weekend

' united are a big team that like to play - especially with van gaal
