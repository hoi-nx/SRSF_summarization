an artist who turns dead animals into unique works of art has recently come under fire for his bizzare sculptures
sean crawford , from carterton , new zealand , said he picked up his distinctive style after his family taught him about hunting and taxidermy on the farm he grew up on
â while some religious folk have taken issue with the fact mr sean crawford is ' manipulating the animal ' by using animal parts in his work , he maintains that he âs only used parts that would have otherwise gone to waste
they are a product of hunting for meat or pest control
mr sean crawford said he âs been influenced by gothic revival architecture and literature that dealt with themes of being dismantled and put back together taxidermy : â it âs one of those things that people either like or they do nât â mr sean crawford has three animal sculptures currently on display at traffic jam galleries at neutral bay on sydney 's lower north shore
sean crawford said his interest in taxidermy started at a very young age as he watched his family hunt on their farm he chose a running rabbit , a standing rabbit and a small bird enclosed in a metal cage for the australia exhibition called ' untitled '
mr sean crawford travelled to sydney from his new zealand home to personally deliver three of his controversial sculptures , where he said he got â quite a reaction â on opening night
mr sean crawford said he spends a lot of time studying the anatomy and posture of each animal to make sure his ' twist ' on classical sculpting is as authentic as possible â i am building the surface , not out of stone , but through an accurate mapping of the rest of the animal â sotiris sotiriou , a curator at traffic jam galleries , said his clients have had a great response to the unique â amalgam of sculpture and taxidermy â
mr sean crawford uses animals that have been killed during hunting for meat or pest control â to be honest all of our clients have quite enjoyed it , people can be grossed out a bit but i think they are more interested in the end
