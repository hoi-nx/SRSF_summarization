as any parent will know , children 's feet will often grow faster than it is possible to buy them new shoes to keep them shod
the shoe that grows uses adjustable buckles and a strap on the toe to expand by five sizes
kenton lee , from nampa , idaho , came up with the idea while working in nairobi in kenya after seeing children running around barefoot and in shoes several sizes too small kenton lee , from nampa , idaho , came up with the idea while working in nairobi in kenya after seeing children running around barefoot and in shoes several sizes too small
he said : ' it got me asking questions and finally all these questions led to an idea - what if there were a shoe that could adjust and expand ? self - tying shoelaces could become a reality after engineers designed a shoe that can automatically lace up , adjusting itself to the shape of your foot
' children 's feet grow incredibly quickly with those aged between two and six years old going up a size almost every few months
however , for those living in developing countries where buying new shoes every few months is not an option , the risk of running around barefoot can be severe
it currently comes in two different size ranges - small and large and a single pair costs $ 30 ( Â£ 20 ) but buying 100 pairs reduces the cost to $ 12 ( Â£ 8 ) the shoe has a tough rubber sole and a leather upper that is designed to last five years , the maker say
poppers on the side allow the width to be adjusted as the child 's feet expand while a strap on the toe can be moved to make the shoe longer.a buckle on the back also can be ajusted to help make the shoes fit better poppers on the size allow the width to be adjusted as the child 's feet expand while a strap on the toe can be moved to make the shoe longer
mr kenton lee said the shoes were designed to grow five sizes and last five years
