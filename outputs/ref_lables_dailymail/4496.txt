ed miliband has been getting a lot of praise for admitting that he â blubbed â while watching pride , a british film released last year
it âs a rose - tinted , nostalgic look back at a critical moment in 20th - century british history
ed miliband received a lot of praise for admitting that he had a weep what a surprise that such a storyline led the labour leader to exclaim : â justine [ his wife ] and i watched it recently and blubbed
â i âm sure pride is nât the only british film that the right - on milibands will have cried their way through
in truth , these movies â pride , billy elliot ( also a piece of miners â strike propaganda that depicted thatcher as the devil incarnate ) , made in dagenham ( about a car factory strike ) and the full monty ( about a group of redundant sheffield steelworkers forced to strip naked to make money ) â might as well have been party political broadcasts for labour
for the keystone of these left - wing propaganda films is a pernicious rewriting of history , portraying british âs recent past as a battle between heroic trade unionists , fighting to defend the poor and the vulnerable , and unfeeling bosses , bulldozing everything in their path in the ruthless pursuit of making money for their capitalist overlords
there is no acknowledgment by the film - makers that the unions â greed and bully - boy tactics all but destroyed the british economy , or that their beloved welfare state ( which has actually created a terrible dependency culture in many parts of the country ) relies on a strong , unsabotaged economy to keep it afloat
the film pride achieves a double whammy by venerating not one but two sacred cows of the left : bolshie unions and minorities ( in this case , homosexuals )
naturally , it does nât take long for the union bosses to recognise that the life - and - death struggle faced by gays and lesbians is very similar to that of their welsh colliery members
strangely absent from the story , of course , is any reference to the role the num played in bringing down successive british governments â both tory and labour alike â and its contribution to the terrible industrial unrest that gripped british in the seventies and culminated in the winter of discontent
billy elliott is another film about â brave and downtrodden â workers whose lives are made miserable by the tories the same historical revisionism is exhibited in made in dagenham , about women workers walking out on strike at the ford car factory in east london in 1968 , demanding equal pay with male employees
but in so many left - inspired british films of the past 25 years , whether brassed off ( about a colliery band facing the closure of their coalmine by a tory government ) , the full monty or billy elliot , thatcher is portrayed as a wrecking ball determined to destroy traditional working - class communities and replace nice left - wing values with nasty right - wing ones
is it any wonder that such films make ed miliband , brought up by a marxist academic father , â blub â ? the only exception to this disgraceful series of truth - twisting films was the iron lady , in which british âs first female prime minister was shown in a more nuanced light , almost in spite of its makers â left - wing instincts
not surprisingly , the iron lady was condemned by many in the british film establishment for being â shallow â and â superficial â , an example of â self - important â film - making
the iron lady was condemned by many in the british film establishment for being â shallow â and â superficial â , an example of â self - important â film - making the truth is , it âs the left that does nât understand contemporary british
could nât we have just one home - grown film that celebrates the miracle that is modern british and brings a tear of pride to us all , rather than left - wing drivel that triggers â blubbing â from ed miliband ?
