it is the oldest known and the best preserved cave decorated by man , but is not open to the public and is only seen by a handful of experts every year , in order to keep the precious works of art safe
now experts have scanned the original drawings using 3d modelling techniques to capture each marking and position them correctly on the bumpy replica walls to the millimetres
