but some like to add a few extra luxury touches to their trips to perfect them - such as a live - in tailor to make the ski gear , two grand pianos flown in for entertainment and a horse and carriage on stand - by 24 hours a day
these are just some of the requests made by guests staying with high - end ski - tour company haute montagne
luxury ski company bramble ski created a private ice bar for guests at one of its chalets in verbier ( stock image ) the live - in tailor was demanded to make all the ski and apres ski outfits to a group of guests â personal tastes and cost Â£ 1,700 to hire
it cost Â£ 3,700 for the grand pianos to be delivered - but the guests were keen on their trip being noteworthy so did n't mind splashing out
the horse and carriage was nât cheap either â that drained the customer âs account of Â£ 20,000
haute montagne âs slightly less luxurious sister company bramble ski has also met some pricey â and very exacting - guest requirements
one set of male guests requested larger versions of bramble ski âs heidi - style pinafore uniforms for a party â at a cost of Â£ 700 each .
