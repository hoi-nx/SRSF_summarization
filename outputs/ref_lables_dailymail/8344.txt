the case between ms chernae noonan and benefit was heard in the australian trade marks office earlier this year in february and ruled in the queensland woman 's favour
benefit is owned by luxury goods company lvmh , which is run by the world 's 13th richest billionaire , bernard arnault ( pictured ) she said customers would confuse her business , the brow bar , with benefit brow bar at myer stores in western australia , new south wales , australian capital territory , queensland , south australia and victoria
she added the addition of the word ' benefit ' to ' brow bar ' also did not help differentiate the cosmetic giant 's services from ms chernae noonan 's business
