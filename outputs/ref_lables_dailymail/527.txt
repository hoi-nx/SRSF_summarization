the earthquake disaster in nepal has highlighted how earth 's land masses are already in the process of forming a new supercontinent
that 's according to one researcher who travelled to the country to study how the india and eurasia plates are moving together
earth 's continents are slowly moving together ( left ) , and in 50 to 200 million years they are expected to form a new supercontinent called amasia ( right )
recent evidence is revealing how this will compare to the ancient supercontinents rodinia and pangea the idea that earth is set to form a new supercontinent - dubbed amasia - is not new
but , as reported by peter spinks from the sydney morning herald , curtin university geologist dr li travelled to nepal to study the collision of the india and eurasia plates
the idea that earth is set to form a new supercontinent - dubbed amasia - is not new
they said the changes would occur in 50 to 200 million years
despite already being attached to eurasia , the india plate is continuing to move americas at a few centimetres per year - causing tectonic activity
the pacific ocean is narrowing at a few centimetres per year , which will ultimately cause america to collide with eurasia , while australia is also moving towards asia by 2.8 inches ( 7cm ) a year and will join amasia
â it would take at least tens of millions more years - perhaps several hundred million years - before the new supercontinent is fully formed , â dr li told the sydney morning herald
for example , they can compare them to previous supercontinents rodinia and pangea , which formed one billion and 300 million years ago respectively
the pacific ocean is narrowing at a few centimetres per year , which will ultimately cause america to collide with eurasia , while australia is also moving towards asia by 2.8 inches ( 7cm ) a year and will join amasia this map shows how nepal is situated near the border of india and asia , where two tectonic plates are moving into one another
the india plate is continuing to move americas at a few centimetres per year - causing tectonic activity , which in turn can lead to tremors and devastating earthquakes the un says 8 million people have been affected by the weekend earthquake in nepal that killed nearly 4,400 people and 1.4 million people are in need of food assistance
they said the changes would occur in 50 to 200 million years
the most recent supercontinent , pangea ( which is greek for â all lands â ) , formed about 300 million years ago with africa at its centre
it began breaking apart into the seven continents of today with the birth of the atlantic ocean about 100 million years later
