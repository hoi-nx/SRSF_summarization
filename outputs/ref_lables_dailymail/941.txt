can lambert sue for restraint of trade ? brendan rodgers has killed off lambert 's career and you 've got to feel sorry for the player
you ca n't blame him for joining liverpool â why would he turn that down ? at the time he was a confident striker â playing regularly in the premier league and scoring goals for southampton
lambert has scarcely been given a chance since joining liverpool despite their striking problems brendan rodgers ' decision to ignore lambert , in favour of balotelli , is completely illogical this time last year lambert was about to play at a world cup for england but his stock has fallen since for brendan rodgers to ignore him when they have desperately needed goals is illogical
i 'm well aware lambert is n't luis suarez , i know he 's not a world - class striker
lambert has enjoyed the opportunity to score for his boyhood team but he deserves more football when he has started in the premier league or champions league , lambert and liverpool have impressed on his first premier league start for liverpool he scored , and when he played 90 minutes in four consecutive games he scored in the first game , liverpool won the next two , and drew the fourth
he has to go down as liverpool 's worst - ever signing â at least the club won a trophy when andy carroll was at anfield
ultimately it 'd be wrong to suggest lambert was going to be the man to spearhead liverpool 's charge to the title and a champions league challenge
balotelli , no matter which way you look at it , has been useless , and lambert should be picked ahead of him balotelli was given more time on the pitch than lambert in liverpool 's fa cup semi-final defeat by aston villa lambert scored 20 goals for southampton - he may not be world class , but he is better than the alternatives lambert should have joined aston villa in january
