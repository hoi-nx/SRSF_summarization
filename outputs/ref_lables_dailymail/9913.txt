former rangers manager smith has praised mccall for making an impact at ibrox - but he maintains ally mccoist was given little chance of succeeding
mccall has put rangers in the driving seat for second place in the scottish championship and a place in the semi-finals of the play - offs after taking over from reluctant caretaker kenny mcdowall
ally mccoist was put on gardening leave just before christmas after handing in his notice following three - and - a - half difficult seasons in charge under the chaotic reigns of the likes of craig whyte and then green and his allies
smith ( right ) spent two spells in charge as manager of rangers and has hailed mccall 's impact smith ( right ) attended a john hartson foundation golf day to raise money for testicular cancer awareness smith was chairman for some of that period after accepting green 's offer to join the board - a decision he soon regretted - and insists the club was too badly run to ensure true success on the park
' the problems have been well documented and now they have got to concentrate on doing what they do , and that 's rangers getting back to the premiership first and foremost and then trying to settle into a position where they can get back to being a winning team
' mccall played under smith for seven seasons , winning six titles in the process , and the 67 - year - old was pleased to see the former motherwell boss take over , despite his pain at the exits of former assistants ally mccoist and kenny mcdowall
mccall was appointed rangers manager in march until the summer as a replacement for kenny mcdowall ' i 'm not happy to see it because it cost friends of mine their job , ' he said
rangers have won five out of nine scottish championship matches since mccall 's arrival at ibrox ' performances have been brighter and hopefully he will keep that going until the end of the season
' however , smith has warned that rangers fans might have to be patient in their desire to see the club competing at the very top of scottish football , despite power now lying in the hands of the likes of paul murray and dave king following last month 's general meeting
smith did , however , open up about ally mccoist 's departure and admitted it was n't easy to see ' it will obviously take a bit of time but they will be able to handle that aspect of it
' i have been fortunate enough to be at rangers for a long time and be there at successful times and it 's not a period i can look back on with any great pleasure
