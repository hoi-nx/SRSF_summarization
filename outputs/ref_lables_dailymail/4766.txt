murray jumps for joy after putting crystal palace 1 - 0 up against manchester city on monday night barcelona and spain defender pique once conceded three against murray in a reserve match in 2005 their careers have taken wholly different paths in the last decade but after a man - of - the - match display which all but ended the premier league champions ' title defence in a match viewed by millions around the world , murray now gets a little taste of the limelight that pique has basked in at barcelona for years
murray now boasts the fifth - best goals - per - minute ratio in europe 's top five leagues
