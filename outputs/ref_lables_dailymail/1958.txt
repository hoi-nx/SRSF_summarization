a former bomb disposal expert has won his battle with the bulge after shedding half his bodyweight after undergoing gastric bypass surgery
steve tempest-mitchell , from bradford , west yorkshire , lost a whopping 16st after the surgery 14 months ago , which caused his stomach to shrink to the size of a tennis ball
the 56 - year - old said he decided to go through with the operation after hitting 32st and struggling to control his type 2 diabetes
' at 32st , it was not an easy decision as i had been turned down for the surgery two and a half years previously ' it had got to a point where something had to be done because i was slowly killing myself
' although he never indulged in binge - eating , mr tempest-mitchell says he would eat smaller portions at regular intervals and was drinking around eight cans of cola a day
helping hand : the former bomb disposal expert said he needed to be pushed in a wheelchair to board a plane ' we were very lucky as one of the bases we were stationed at was attacked by a rocket launcher just weeks after we left
at one point , i was having between six to eight cans a day
i have had to completely cut coke out of my life as well as other fizzy drinks
' the father - of - three said his weight affected his self confidence and esteem as a result of the weight gain , mr tempest-mitchell almost became housebound at his heaviest and was forced to plan every trip out
i had to be taken to the plane by a buggy or wheelchair
' fed up , he took the plunge and opted for surgery - a decision that coincided with him finding that he was about to become a grandfather
' my one daughter came to see me while i was recovering from the operation and broke the news that she was pregnant , ' said mr tempest-mitchell , who also has a 34 - year - old son
although he never indulged in eating too many snacks , he said he would drink up to eight cans of coke a day ' i was so thrilled as i knew the success of the surgery would allow me to be more active and enjoy spending time with them as they are growing up
