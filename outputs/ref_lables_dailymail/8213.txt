a woman in her 70s may be forced to sell her childhood home to fund her elderly mother âs care after losing a landmark court case that could have implications for families across britain
theatre director glen walford has been told by judges that the house , where she has recently invested Â£ 40,000 in renovations , was not her home at the time when her mother went into care because she rents a flat in london
miss walford , 75 , has spent two years fighting worcestershire county council over whether the Â£ 205,000 house should be used to recover the cost of her mother âs care
glen walford ( left ) has been embroiled in a legal battle with worcestershire county council since her mother mary ( right ) moved to a care home in 2006
the theatre director intended to retire to the property now the council has won the right to force miss walford to use the equity in the house , where she intended to retire , for care home fees , which can be up to Â£ 600 a week
â when her mother walford , now aged 100 , was admitted into care in 2006 , the council agreed that the house in stourport should not be taken into account during means testing
frustrated by the u-turn , miss walford became embroiled in a legal battle with the council which was taken to the high court in january 2014
miss walford said she had always planned to retire to her mother 's house in stourpour - upon - severn ( above ) there , a judge ruled that her home should not be taken into account when means testing was carried out on her mother âs finances
yesterday miss walford said : â i am now in a position where i will almost certainly have to sell my home to pay for my mother âs care bills which will leave me homeless
earlier the high court ( above ) had sided with the walford family â it is quite simply my home and it is going to be sold from underneath me
by saying that the house would have been miss walford âs residence had she not worked in london , the council was discouraging people over the age of 60 from working , mr campbell argued
lord justice mccombe , who rejected the council âs appeal , said he saw â no reason â to assess whether the property was miss walford âs home based on a â historic â date
