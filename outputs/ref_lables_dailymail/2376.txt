the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man fleeing from a police officer has stirred outrage around the nation , but people in this south carolina city are n't surprised
there is almost nothing in slager 's police personnel file to suggest that his bosses considered him a rogue officer capable of murdering a man he just pulled over for a broken tail light
above , a friend of scott 's at a memorial the officer who shot scott , michael slager , had little in his file to suggest excessive force
above , two men pray at the memorial ' we 've had through the years numerous similar complaints , and they all seem to be taken lightly and dismissed without any obvious investigation , ' the rev. darby , vice president of the charleston branch of the national association for the advancement of colored people , said thursday
the mostly black neighborhood in north charleston where slager fired eight shots at the back of walter lamer scott on saturday is far from unique in this regard , said tucker , a former fbi agent and police chief in four southern cities who often testifies in police misconduct cases
' both slager , 33 , and scott , 55 , were coast guard veteran
slager had the dismissed excessive force complaint and scott had been jailed repeatedly for failing to pay child support , but neither man had a record of violence
video captured by a bystander to the shooting showed slager fire eight shots at the back of scott as he ran away original statements from slager said that he felt threatened by scott , though video released appears to contradict the police account of the incident a dash cam video from police shows scott running away from his car during a traffic stop for a broken tail light slager consistently earned positive reviews in his five years with the north charleston police
his new attorney , andy savage , said thursday that he 's conducting his own investigation , and that it 's ' far too early for us to be saying what we think
' slager 's first attorney said he followed all proper procedures before using deadly force , but swiftly dropped him after the dead man 's family released a bystander 's video of the shooting
many said police in south carolina 's third - largest city routinely dismiss complaints of petty brutality and harassment , even when eyewitnesses can attest to police misbehavior

slager is being held without bond on a murder charge police version police officer michael slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with scott began at around 9.30am on saturday
at that point , the officer fired at scott several times because he ' felt threatened , ' slager 's statement said
what the video shows slager 's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting scott in the back
the video shows slager handcuffing scott 's lifeless body
footage then appears to show slager jogging back to the point where the taser fell to the ground , bringing it over to scott 's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him
it is only after two - and - a - half minutes that slager is seen placing his hand on scott 's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse
slager 's file includes a single excessive use - of - force complaint , from 2013 : a man said slager used his stun gun against him without reason
' mario givens , the man who accused slager of excessive force in 2013 , told the ap that slager woke him before dawn by loudly banging on his front door , and saying ' come outside or i 'll tase you ! ' ' i did n't want that to happen to me , so i raised my arms over my head , and when i did , he tased me in my stomach anyway , ' mario givens said
mario givens ( pictured ) filed an excessive force complaint against slager in 2013 , but he was not interviewed and no witnesses were questioned ' they never told me how they reached the conclusion
' mario givens said he 's convinced scott 's death could have been prevented if slager had been disciplined in his case
darby also wonders if saturday 's fatal shooting might have turned out differently had the department thoroughly investigated the 2013 taser complaint
