bale pulled up with a calf strain after just two minutes of madrid âs league game on saturday and will almost certainly miss the second leg of the champions league against atletico on wednesday
one year and two days , after one of his greatest moments at madrid when he ran half the length of the pitch to score the winner in the copa del rey final , bale broke down with a muscle pull against malaga
bale went down injured after less than five minutes at the bernabeu on saturday evening the welsh forward was forced off and faces a race to be fit for madrid 's champions league quarter - final cristiano ronaldo was the first player to go across to bale as he sat waiting for treatment and the welshman âs expression spoke volumes â he knew he would not be able to carry on and could now miss out on madrid âs most important game of the season
that will be ancelotti âs selection for the game on wednesday if benzema recovers from the knee knock that kept him out of saturday âs meeting with malaga
