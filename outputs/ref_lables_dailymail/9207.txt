the majority of heatwaves and almost a fifth of extreme rain storms can be blamed on human activity , a new study has warned
researchers say that three quarters of extreme hot weather and 18 per cent of heavy precipitation is being driven by global warming that has occurred due to man - made emissions
they warn that as climate change pushes global temperatures higher over the coming decades , humans will become responsible for 40 per cent of extreme rainfall events
researchers say 75 % of extreme hot weather and 18 % of heavy precipitation is being driven by global warming as a result of man - made emissions
they warn that as climate change pushes global temperatures higher , humans will be responsible for 40 % of extreme rainfall events ( floods in somerset in 2014 are shown ) the scientists claim it is the rarest and most destructive events that seem to be the most responsive to human influence
dr erich fischer , from the institute for atmospheric and climate science at the swiss federal institute of technology who led the study , said : ' climate change includes not only changes in mean climate but also in weather extremes
global temperatures were the highest since records began in 1880 , according to scientists
' with every degree of warming it is the rarest and the most extreme events and thereby the ones with typically the highest socio - economic impacts for which the largest fraction is due to human - induced greenhouse gas emissions
' the researchers , whose work is published in the journal nature climate change , examined the probability that heatwaves and heavy rainfall events could be attributed to humans using 25 climate models
they then used the models to look at predictions of extreme weather between 2006 and 2100 under an emissions scenario that is expected to lead to 2 Â° c of warming around the world
while attributing individual extreme weather events such as hurricanes , floods and heatwaves to climate change is notoriously difficult , climate scientists have predicted they will become more common as the world warms
dr fischer and his colleague professor reto knutti , also based at the swiss federal institute of technology , said taking a more global perspective made it easier to examine the role that human activity was having on such events
they say their research demonstrated a strong signal for human influence in the extreme weather that is having impacts around the world today
if global temperatures increase as predicted , as a result of climate change , this becomes more pronounced , explained the researchers california is in the grip of its worst drought on record , causing lake beds to dry up ( as above )
around three quarters of heatwaves can now be attributed to human activity and it is likely to worsen as the climate warms dr fischer said : ' a warmer and moister atmosphere does clearly favour more frequent hot and wet extremes
' professor peter stott , a scientist at the met office 's hadley centre in the uk , pointed to the extreme weather that has happened in the past year - one of the warmest on record
he added that human - caused climate change had ' loaded the dice ' in favour of heatwaves like the one that hit europe in 2003 and the flooding that hit the uk in autumn 2000
