benteke has revealed a secret

i have only taken one before for villa , against swansea , and i hit the post
â what happens should a chance come from similar range against liverpool ? â i âll take it
eight goals in his last six games , the latest a towering header to take all three points at spurs , benteke is bang in form and relishing the prospect of an fa cup semi-final
sitting to discuss the match in a dressing room at villa âs bodymoor training complex , he looks as if he would like to be on wembley âs turf post-haste
he has been rejuvenated under tim sherwood , scoring a goal every 87 minutes since the new villa manager took over

it was april 3 , 2014 , when a loud crack was heard across bodymoor âs training pitches signalling benteke âs ruptured achilles
his world cup dream was over
six months of rehabilitation followed before benteke âs return last october

â benteke is grateful to lambert for bringing him to villa from genk in 2012 but acknowledges it was the correct call to sack the manager

i came back to belgium and my family helped get me through
â they said i was nât ready because the level between belgium and england is really high and i should stay one more season
