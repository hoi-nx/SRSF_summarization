hassan , one of two teenagers feared to have crossed into syria to join isis , is believed to be a relative of hammaad munshi the families of two teenage boys who are thought to have traveled to syria are ' in a state of profound shock ' and deeply worried about the safety of their ' ordinary west yorkshire lads '
the boys who have been named as 17 - year - olds hassan and talha asmal are believed to have traveled to the embattled country after heading to turkish on march 31
hassan is supposedly related to hammaad munshi , who was arrested by counter-terrorism police at the age of 15 back in 2006
a statement released on behalf of the two families said : ' both families are devastated by the events of the last few days and in particular , we are extremely concerned about the safety and well - being of our loved ones
' our number one priority is to get hassan and talha asmal back home with their families and we implore anyone who may have any information whatsoever to get in contact with the police
hassan 's alleged relative hammaad munshi was only 15 - years - old when he joined a terrifying islamic state faction who were targeting the royal family
hammaad munshi was arrested on his way home from a chemistry exam in 2006 and found with two bags of ball - bearings - key material for a suicide vest
' both hassan and talha asmal had a promising future as an apprentice and an a-level student respectively , and we are praying they will be back with us soon and are able to realise that future
' we would implore all parents to be extra vigilant , although as we found , it 's near impossible to know your children have been groomed and brainwashed
' syria is a frightening war - torn place and we need to urgently educate our young children about the dangers posed by those who prey on impressionable teenagers
' the choice of returning home from syria is often taken away from those that come under the control of islamic state , leaving their families in the britons devastated and with very few options to secure their safe return
' the force said it has been supporting the missing teenagers ' families and carrying out extensive inquiries alongside the north east counter terrorism unit
hammaad munshi 's family comes from dewsbury in west yorkshire , where his grandfather yakub munshi ran the town 's sharia court
hammaad munshi had painstakingly scoured the internet for details on how to make napalm and grenades
