didier drogba was utterly exhausted and emotionally drained as he and john terry held each other up through a post-match flash interview
it was as if these two warriors might collapse on camera if either of them moved , so they clung on and spoke happily if wearily after supplying the goals which fuelled this fight - back at leicester
didier drogba is into his 38th year and could be doing something a little more leisurely than leading the line through 90 minutes at the sharp end of the season

but he and john terry are not shaped that way and the pride burned through their yellow shirts as they led their team - mates to salute three thousand noisy chelsea supporters in the corner of the king power stadium
they had trailed to a goal from marc albrighton after a slightly lethargic first - half display but came out inspired and soon levelled through didier drogba , before john terry put the londoners ahead , 12 minutes from time , and ramires curled the third into the top corner
the strike by ramires triggered an ironic chorus of ' chelsea ' from the visiting fans and they sang long into the night , aware that their team can be crowned champions on sunday at stamford bridge if they beat crystal palace

john terry scored his seventh of the season , forcing the ball in from close range after schmeichel had saved from gary cahill at a corner
chelsea dominated from midway through the first half but that did not prevent leicester from taking the lead on the break when matty james released vardy down the left

but didier drogba soon punctured those hopes when he reacted swiftly to beat substitute ritchie de laet to a low cross from branislav ivanovic and hooked it past schmeichel
didier drogba fired one chance over and another wide but john terry produced the second , just as it seemed mourinho would have to settle for a point
