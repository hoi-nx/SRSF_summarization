the actress and her fiance kutcher responded to the impending lawsuit with a tongue - in - cheek video , claiming they were going to file a lawsuit against the accuser kristina karo , because of injuries suffered while being forced to watch her music video
on wednesday the story broke that the 31 - year - old was being sued for $ 5,000 by a woman claiming to be her former childhood friend , who said she suffered emotional trauma when a seven - year - old kunis stole her pet foul
fight fire with fire : kunis has responded to kristina karo 's accusations she stole her chicken as a child , with a video claiming she will counter-sue for injuries sustained while watching karo 's music video but within hours kutcher had posted a video - obtained by tmz - pointing out some of the holes in karo 's story
not only did she have a conversation at one - month old in ukraine , she was speaking english ! this is the smartest girl i 've ever heard of ! ' kunis herself appears on the clip pointing out that it must be ' just coincidental ' he accuser has a new music video out , and is trying to launch a singing career here in la
foul play : the reason for karo 's lawsuit 25 years after the ' theft ' is that moving to la , which is where kunis also lives , has brought back memories of losing ' doggie ' for karo and forced her back into therapy ' i was devastated
i would like to launch a counter $ 5,000 lawsuit for making me sit there and watch you music video , shamelessly
' not a bad egg : kunis , seen here with partner kutcher in los angeles , had being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from karo
kutcher pointed out in their response video that their accuser was also one - month old at the time and apparently fluent in english and ukranian pollo loco : in her suit , karo alleges that when ' doggie ' disappeared , kunis confessed to the crime and told her ' kristina karo , you can have any other chicken as a pet , you have a whole chicken farm ' ( stock image ) karo had alleged that she was a classmate of kunis , who moved to the u.s. from ukraine in 1991 , and that the pair were ' inseparable ' growing up
in her lawsuit , karo states that ms kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north - west ukraine where she lived , and play with the hen , called ' doggie ' , tmz reported
karo , who has moved to los angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer , says the theft of her pet chicken traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist
interestingly enough , karo 's self - penned online bio describes her as being ' born and raised in the small village berezhnytsia ' , which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away - from chernivtsi , where kunis lived before moving to the u.s. aged seven
