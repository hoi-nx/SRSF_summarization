floyd mayweather jr vs manny pacquiao will be the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant this century
where money man vs manny pacquiao comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the mgm grand garden arena
here is the second of my 12 most significant fights in boxing âs history
the fight against the nazis yankee stadium , new york june 22 , 1938 joe louis vs max schmeling joe louis ( left ) knocks out max schmeling in the first round to win the heavyweight title on june 22 , 1938 although hitler was trumpeting max schmeling as a hero of the third reich following his knock - out victory over joe louis two years earlier , the german was anti-nazi and remained so during world war ii which was imminent at the time of the re-match
joe louis had come back from that shock to win the world heavyweight title by defeating james j braddock but announced he would not consider himself the true champion until he avenged the loss to max schmeling
yet such was max schmeling âs distaste for being exploited by hitler âs propaganda machine â and his loyal refusal to sack his jewish manager â that his wife and mother were refused permission to travel to new york to support him in case he defected to the america the social picture was clouded further by black america âs belief in joe louis as a high - profile campaigner for civil rights

louis is pictured jumping aside as max schmeling falls after the knock - out joe louis had been tactically out - thought in their first fight so decided to go for broke from the first bell
joe louis switched his attack to the head , dropping max schmeling twice , and donovan called a halt only two minutes and 40 seconds into the fight
