education secretary nicky morgan today signalled she would quit the cabinet if the tories entered a power - sharing deal with ukip
the senior tory said farage is ' not my cup of tea ' and would question whether she was ' happy to serve ' with the ukip leader
cameron has urged ukip supporters to ' come home ' to the tory , but has stopped short of ruling out having to rely on the eurosceptic party if he falls short of a majority
the ukip leader was greeted with silence in the hall when he said during the debate about the national health service that of the 7,000 diagnosed with hiv , 60 per cent were born abroad
after saying this was something the other leaders would be ' mortified that i dare to even talk about it ' , he said : ' you can come to uk from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with hiv and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to Â£ 25,000 per year per patient
ukip leader farage , who spent today on a boat in grimsby with reality tv star joey essex , has said he is not seeking ministerial office in a coalition
however , recent polls have suggested support for ukip is slipping and mr farage might struggle to win his own seat in thanet south
mr farage yesterday admitted ukip has ' slipped back a bit ' in the polls as the sense of euphoria among the party 's supporters has waned
the ukip leader has seen support for his party drop from 16.75 per cent in november to just 12.25 per cent today , with voters appearing to switch to the tories in the run up to the election
' we won the european elections , we found that level and we did have a rally in the autumn through the remarkable events of first clacton and then perhaps more remarkably the rochester by - election ' we 've slipped back a bit since then , there are 30 days to go and i think the issues ukip is campaigning on are back in play
' cameron has urged ukip supporters to ' come home ' to the tory , but has stopped short of ruling out having to rely on the eurosceptic party if he falls short of a majority mrs morgan is the only senior tory minister defending a marginal seat , in loughborough
her rejection of the idea of power - sharing with ukip comes after weeks of contradictory statements from senior conservatives
