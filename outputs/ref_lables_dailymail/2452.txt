the man remains good humoured throughout the 40 - second - clip as another man comes around to the back of the truck to survey the situation the man bangs on the side of the truck in an attempt to scare the baboon away and eventually it re-emerges before long the monkey re-emerges and to the surprise of everyone watching carries snacks in both its hands and its mouth
the monkey appears to taunt the driver before scarpering with more than a handful of snacks from the truck the group of thieves reconvene and run off together into the bushes to the sound of spectators laughing the other monkeys run towards it to greet it and the group , clearly pleased with their haul , disappear into the shrubbery
