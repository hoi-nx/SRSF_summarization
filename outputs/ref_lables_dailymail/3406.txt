residents living yards from the scene of the Â£ 60million hatton garden heist have revealed how they were hit by ' peculiar ' power cuts on the weekend before the daring crime
they also claim to have heard â drilling â noises on the evening of good friday , but thought at the time that this was simply a continuation of road works that had been taking place in recent weeks
meanwhile it has also been alleged that the thieves returned a day after the initial robbery in central london to steal more loot after becoming ' greedy '
residents on greville street - near the scene close to farringdon station - say they had suspicious power outages a full week before the heist , which they now think could be linked
begum , 19 , who lives in a flat just a ten - second walk from the raided premises , added : â my mum actually heard drilling on the [ good ] friday night , it was probably about 9pm or 9.30pm
protection : one of the gang members carries a large plastic bag past the camera to help obscure his face vehicle : a white transit van used to transport the gang and their loot pulls away from outside the building â but she did think it was quite weird that they would be drilling at that time
also , about two weeks ago , so the weekend before it happened , there was an electrical cut
' miss begum added : â it was over that weekend , so before the holborn fire [ under kingsway on april 1 ] as well
it happened on either the friday or the saturday , it was just a bit peculiar
â career criminal : smith , who has 58 convictions and spent 32 years in prison , said the group was likely brought together by a ' mr big ' another local resident , data scientist john han , 26 , said : â we heard some type of loud noise which woke us up
it was late at night on the friday or saturday
but i did think to myself why would somebody be doing road works at that time ? â former bank robber smith - who was responsible for more than 200 bank robberies during his criminal career - believes the group made an unplanned return to the scene after their initial break - in when they realised their robbery had not been discovered
mr smith , speaking after having analysed video footage of the raid , told daily mirror the organised criminals would be aware of the huge risk involved in returning for more spoils , but the rewards outweighed the danger
on saturday night , police released dramatic cctv images of the raid in the hope of a breakthrough in the investigation
the gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault the group left the jewellers on good friday after having first appeared on camera the day before
but one of the thieves then reappeared on camera late saturday night - a move mr smith described as a ' huge risk '
saturday , march 28 thursday , april 2 friday , april 3 saturday , april 4 sunday , april 5 tuesday , april 7 mr smith told reporter david collins , writing for the daily mirror : ' he could be out the country by now spending the rest of his life a very rich man
at 9.23pm on the thursday , just minutes after employees left for the easter bank holiday weekend , a red - haired man wearing a baseball cap was the first to arrive and headed downstairs to the vault
on good friday , at 7.51am the raiders emerged through the basement side door with holdalls , tools and the bins , now believed to be filled with diamonds , cash and jewellery
at 10.17pm on saturday , the cameras showed three of the men returning with holdalls and tool boxes
scotland yard was branded as ' incompetent ' last week after admitting it got a call at 0.20am on the friday from a company who monitors alarms across the south east , but instead of acting on it , deemed it ' no police response required '
a police spokesman said : ' the call stated that a confirmed intruder alarm had been activated at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd. ' the call was recorded and transferred to the police 's ( computer ) system
' in response to whether officers had spoken to residents about the power cuts and ' drilling ' noises , a police spokesman declined to comment
the 58 - year - old made headlines last week when it emerged that police want to question him after a report that he tried to woo potential voters with refreshments at a party event
whoever their buyer , it is agreed by police , former robbers and crime experts that the gems are likely to have already left the country - and probably very soon after the raid
