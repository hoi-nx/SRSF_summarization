she 's won the london marathon three times but this weekend paula says she 'll be happy to finish at all regardless of her position
the 41 - year - old mother - of - two has battled back from injury to take part in the 26.2 mile race in the capital and a result wo n't be running with the other female elites but with the masses
it will be an emotional run for paula who will be presented with the the inaugural john disley lifetime achievement award in honour of her achievements , which include setting a still unbeaten world record time of 2 hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds in london in 2003
so as she prepares to run the marathon - supposedly for the last time - femail looks back on the career of the inspirational running super mother ... paula started running for bedford and county from a young age , left , and won numerous races as a junior before progressing to take the european cross-country in 1998 , right the gb vests kept coming but she missed out on a medal at the sydney olympic games in 2000 paula gave her all at the sydney olympic games but was out - sprinted in the final moments and finished fourth paula 's talent for running was evident from a young age and , under the coaching guidance of alex stanton at bedford and county athletics club , she became accustomed to winning races on the domestic circuit
at the world championships in edmonton in 2001 she was determined to make the podium - but after front - running she was again out - kicked in the final lap. this disappointment was her most famous as it led to a very public row with gary - who criticised her race tactics when many thought he should have been consoling her
despite this , she 's also had to face accusations that she could n't have achieved her marathon world record clean - as it 's a time that has n't been surpassed in 12 years
in 2003 she smashed the marathon world record as she won in london in 2003 her form on the roads continued as she set also world records over 5k and 10k but at the athens olympics , she was forced to drop out of the race despite being favourite to win paula was devastated she could n't finish the olympics marathon as her body was depleted by medication she had to take following a collision with a bike in training beforehand the athlete felt she 'd let everyone down and cried at the press conference ' it makes you think we have to put a system in place that protects clean athletes
' paula bounced back from the disappointment in edmonton to have a victorious year in 2002 over all terrain
she won the world cross country championships and the london marathon and finally took gold medals on the track at the commonwealth games and then the european championships
she bounced back from the olympics disappointment to take victory at the london marathon again in 2005 but the race will be remembered for the toilet stop she took en route she also won a gold medal at the world champs in 2005 over the marathon distance her popularity soared as she was awarded an mbe in june 2002 and later that year was voted the bbc
in 2003 she ran her incredible world record marathon time pushing the pace from start to finish without another competitor in sight
she also set world records over 10k and 5k on the roads in the same year
in training before the race , an collision with a cyclist led to an injury for which she had to take anti-inflammatory medication
the following year her success winning the london marathon again was overshadowed by the fact she had to stop for a very public loo break on the side of the road
later that year , she won another gold medal in the world championships over the marathon distance
less than a year later , paula was back to winning ways taking victory at the new york marathon
daughter isla was born in 2007 and months later , paula won the new york marathon but in 2008 , she was disappointed to finish 23rd in the beijing olympics as her training was interrupted by injury in the build up
in 2008 , paula lined up at the olympics again but injury in the build - up to the race meant she missed vital training and she was n't fit enough to compete with the best on the day
in 2012 , paula had surgery on a long - standing foot problem in the hope it would mean she could run again the surgery worked and paula will now return to run the streets of london this weekend the athlete said she 's delighted to be back in the capital and sunday 's race will be ' really special ' a foot problem meant running in the london 2012 olympics was out of the question - in fact doctors were worried she may never run again
she said of sunday 's race : ' i know i am not going to be competitive but to get the chance to take part in this race one more time is something that is really special
