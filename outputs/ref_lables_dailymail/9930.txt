8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer noreen was reassured when the results of her latest mammogram were normal
noreen , then 68 , had the scan as part of the nhs breast cancer screening programme , and as she says : ' as always , getting the all - clear was a big relief
' but 18 months later , shortly before her 70th birthday , the mother - of - three from derbyshire developed intermittent pain in her left side , just below her breast
and although noreen , a former administrator , was n't concerned , her daughter , a radiographer , insisted she see a gp
despite finding nothing abnormal , the gp referred noreen for a mammogram
this revealed three lumps on her left breast , which were all tumours
noreen is adamant : ' that gp appointment saved my life
' breast cancer screening was introduced in 1988 , with women aged 50 to 64 invited for a mammogram every three years
' i did n't realise it at the time , but at 68 i 'd already had my last official mammogram , ' says noreen
' noreen was one of the lucky ones
mps are warning that women will die as a result of the screening age limit
and while more are diagnosed at a younger age - 12,800 in their 60s and 10,600 in their 50s - more than half of the 12,000 women who die from breast cancer every year are over 70
so , extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis for those over 70 and more lives saved , the mps said
in fact , the upper age limit is due to change
from the end of 2016 , all women up to 73 will be invited for screening
in 2013 , they called for the age limit to be raised to at least 76 , and possibly to 79
' extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis and more lives saved ' ' while some progress has been made , there is still a lot of work to do in ensuring that older people with breast cancer receive the care , treatment and support most appropriate to them , ' says steve brine , the conservative mp for winchester and co-chair of the parliamentary group
a study from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , published in the british journal of cancer , reported that women over 70 are 12 per cent less likely to survive breast cancer after three years than women of the same age in sweden , where screening in most of the country continues to 74
â yet the benefits of extending screening are not clear - cut , for there is a risk of women undergoing unnecessary treatment
a dutch study , published in the bmj in august 2014 , suggested that inviting all women over the age of 70 for screening could result in ' over- diagnosis and overtreatment '
researchers monitored 25,500 women aged 70 to 75 diagnosed with the disease after 1995 , when breast cancer screening in the dutch was extended from 69 to 75
' for noreen , however , there is no question in her mind that screening should be extended
' the treatment was murderous , ' says noreen
in fact , women are entitled to request mammograms at any age - it 's just the invitations that stop
women are entitled to request mammograms at any age an added complication is that older women are likely to be less ' breast aware ' and more cautious about bothering their gp , the all-party parliamentary group pointed out previously
rather than simply ending screening , the dutch researchers who suggested that extending the programme to all older women could do more harm than good , say the decision whether to continue scans should be personalised to each woman
