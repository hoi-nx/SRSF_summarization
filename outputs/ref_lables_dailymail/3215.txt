a canadian firm has given new meaning to the phrase ' beauty sleep ' by creating a pillowcase which is being touted as the latest way to keep wrinkles at bay
the $ 40 ( Â£ 26 ) cloth cover - which comes with a lifetime guarantee - is said to hydrate the face and prevent lines while you sleep
and unlike a normal cotton pillowcase , which apparently sucks moisture from the skin , the wrinkle preventing pillowcase 's special blend of ' hydrophobic fibres ' keeps the complexion hydrated all night
the wrinkle preventing pillowcase has ' a blend of hydrophobic fibres that help skin retain moisture ' the infused special fibres are said to fight wrinkles like a face cream , redirecting moisture back into the skin the pillowcase , made by hammacher schlemmer , in canadian , was developed by a dermatologist and contains no creams or chemicals
but the wrinkle preventing version is ' therapeutic and extra-smooth ' , redirecting moisture back into the skin for a more vibrant , healthier - looking appearance in the morning
the microfibre cover zips off for machine washing for $ 60 ( Â£ 40 ) it is contoured like a butterfly with strategically placed cutouts on either side
