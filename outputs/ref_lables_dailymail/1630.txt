former prime minister sir john major will today ignore warnings from his former scottish secretary against talking up the threat posed by the snp cameron 's campaign attacks on the snp risk undermining the future of the british , senior conservative peer lord forsyth has claimed
the former scottish secretary said talking up the threat posed by the scottish nationalists was ' short - term and dangerous '
the stark warning came as the former prime minister john major launched a stinging attack on the threat posed by an snp
sir john major will say a labour deal with the separatists would mean higher taxes , more debt and fewer jobs - as well as another independence referendum
cameron yesterday warned that the prospect of a deal between ed miliband and sturgeon was ' a match made in hell for the british economy ' after the snp unveiled its manifesto in edinburgh yesterday
the extraordinary manifesto launch by snp leader sturgeon included massive spending increases , new taxes , more welfare and the end of british 's nuclear deterrent
sir john major , who is the last tory to win an election outright , warned that ed miliband would face a ' daily dose of blackmail ' from miss sturgeon , whose party may win 50 commons seats
the former john major said : ' if labour were to accept an offer of support from the snp , it could put the country on course to a government held to ransom on a vote - by - vote basis
we would all pay for the snp 's ransom in our daily lives â through higher taxes , fewer jobs , and more and more debt
' sir john major ( pictured at a tory campaign rally today ) , who is the last tory to win an election outright , said ed miliband would face a ' daily dose of blackmail ' from the snp 's sturgeon senior figures in ed miliband 's ( right ) labour have appeared to soften their stance on a potential deal with the snp and sturgeon ( left ) in a hung parliament

he insisted there would be no coalition with the snp and denied sturgeon 's party would hold the whip hand on policy
he told bbc 's breakfast : ' a labour government led by me , what happens in that labour government will be decided by me , not by the snp
' labour had ' fundamental differences ' with the snp , such as the nationalist party 's desire for a second independence referendum within five years , he said , adding : ' i 'm not having that
' mr ed miliband said mr cameron had been ' talking up ' the snp in the hope that it would take votes and seats from labour north of the border and allow him to ' crawl back ' into 10 downing street
' i think cameron is playing fast and loose with the british , ' said the labour leader
' sir john major added : ' the snp 's driving ambition is an independent scottish and â as the price for their support â they will demand policies that favour scottish
' but the tory tactic of talking up the threat posed by the snp was slammed by sir john major 's former scottish secretary lord forsyth last night
the tory peer said : ' we 've had the dilemma for conservatives , which is they want to be the largest party at westminster and therefore some see the fact that the nationalists are going to take seats in scottish will be helpful
' he said mr cameron 's call for ' english votes for english laws ' in the aftermath of last year 's scottish independence referendum vote had ' shattered the unionist alliance against the break - up of the british '
