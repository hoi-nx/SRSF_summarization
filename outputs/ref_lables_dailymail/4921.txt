what jason holder did in antigua and marlon samuels managed here will do much for the culture simmons is trying to create as new west indies coach
they will inspire their team - mates with their discipline , character and application , just as mike atherton inspired me with the way he batted to save a tests in johannesburg and in his famous battle with allan donald at trent bridge
this is an era in which west indies are losing players to the easier option of the ipl and it is understandable because of the money that can be made there
why should nât they cash in ? marlon samuels ( right ) celebrates reaching his century for west indies in second test but marlon samuels has taken the difficult road
he will remember his duel with ben stokes , the way he saw off a newish ball and how he took the attack to england on the first evening
he did finally fall to jimmy anderson after a loose shot but by that time marlon samuels had grafted his way to 103
the england won in the dark of karachi was remembered for years because it was the ultimate conclusion to three hard tests
i can see a lot of our england side of 2000 in this west indies team
west indies batsman samuels grafted his way to 103 against england in the second test we had to stay in games , instil a bit of pride and discipline before we could think about being positive and that âs what simmons is trying to do here
the first step is to take tests into five days and once that is achieved then west indies can think about moving on and hopefully keeping their best players
this is not to denigrate twenty20 or what we saw at the world cup but there is something fulfilling about seeing a match go to the fifth day as in antigua , with england bowling 130 overs and trying to find different ways to take 10 wickets
ben stokes was admonished by umpire steve davis following clash with marlon samuels i find the mental side of test cricket to be unparalleled
