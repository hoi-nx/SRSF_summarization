at first glance , it appears to be any ordinary play - date for two young girls at primary school
â if we say you are not pretty or good looking , do nât get offended , â pipes up eleanor , issuing the standard disclaimer for videos of this kind
â hot or not ! â the girls immediately exclaim in unison
i âve discovered that these kinds of scenes are being played out in children âs bedrooms across the country
in just a few days , the clip gets 120 views , suggesting no one in their class â or perhaps their school â has missed it
but what people will miss is the sight of the stricken faces of the children so cruelly dismissed , the tears shed into pillows , and the bravery needed to go to school the next day
of course , cruelty among children has existed since the words â no , you ca nât play with us â were first uttered
but this is a new , more public humiliation
scroll through youtube and you âll find â hot - or - not â videos by girls who look no older than nine
she âs had 2,000 views so far
as a parenting expert who âs written five books on raising children , i know the effect this could have on those deemed â not hot â
the fact â hot - or - not â videos are so public increases a young person âs feelings of shame and powerlessness about how they look
feeling unattractive and worthless can have a devastating impact on their chances of success : study after study has found that the grades of such children go down
the fact â hot - or - not â videos are so public increases a young person âs feelings of shame and powerlessness about how they look
feeling unattractive and worthless can have a devastating impact on their chances of success : study after study has found that the grades of such children go down ( picture posed by models ) and if they feel they do not belong , they often start to avoid school
indeed , more than six out of ten children who have been bullied said it had a detrimental effect on their education , according to a survey by charity ditch the label
even worse , almost one in three bullied children goes on to self - harm , with 10 per cent attempting to kill themselves
alannya , who lives near yeovil , somerset , has been on the receiving end of some of the judgments passed down in the 50 or so videos made by fellow pupils at her school , an oversubscribed academy rated â good with outstanding features â by ofsted
although she has been mainly rated â hot â , she has also been dismissed as â not â in some clips
but it âs humiliating because it âs so public
there are loads of these videos
â â hot or not â started off as an american phenomenon , where young women would put a picture of themselves online and be rated by other users
some youngsters justify these videos by saying classmates can put themselves forward to be rated by â liking â a status announcement saying someone at their school is planning to film one
sadly , it âs often the most insecure youngsters , aching to be accepted by the pretty girls who make these videos , who volunteer
in a world where girls grow up feeling like they are in a constant beauty contest â half of three to six - year - olds say they worry about being fat , and a fifth of those under 11 have already been on a diet â these â hot - or - not â videos should hardly surprise us
and middle - class girls are most likely to post these videos , as their families more often own ipads and computers
but in an age where children spend longer in front of a screen than with friends , one result is that they âre not learning social skills or empathy
â you are showing children that it âs entertaining to you â that normalises it , â says rosalind wiseman , author of self - help book queen bees and wannabes
what is the point of doing these videos ? â asks one
