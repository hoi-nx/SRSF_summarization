angela spent many years wearing high heel shoes four years ago , a shopping trip was torture for angela kelly , 67
in fact , she was suffering from the painful legacy of a lifetime wearing high heels
most women are well aware that wearing high heels for any length of time can result in sore feet , pinched toes and tight calf muscles
but a worrying new study by researchers in the u.s. suggests high heels can also put dangerous pressure on knee joints , wearing away cartilage - the body 's built - in shock absorber - and increasing the risk of osteoarthritis
some women need invasive knee replacement surgery
they found that in high heels , women 's knees are held in such an awkward , bent position that their joints looked and performed like aged or damaged joints - increasing the risk of osteoarthritis
physiotherapist and osteopath tim allardyce is n't surprised : patients with postural problems caused or exacerbated by heels are common at his croydon clinic
' even the first twinge of arthritis , which began in her right knee in her early 30s , could n't persuade her to kick her heel habit - instead , she gritted her teeth and controlled the pain with anti- inflammatories , until it suddenly worsened four years ago
she had almost no cartilage left in her knee and needed to have a titanium knee replacement ' i was struggling to get out of bed or in and out of the car , ' she says
' tests showed that i had almost no cartilage left in my knee and it became obvious that i needed to have a titanium knee replacement , which involved major surgery and a lengthy recovery period
after following the advice of her doctor and physiotherapist to swear off heels altogether , to avoid damaging her new , artificial knee , she is fitter than ever
the average woman spends Â£ 136.52 on five new pairs of shoes a year the knee op was n't her only surgery
' i had to have a bunion surgically removed from my left foot last year , too , which was caused - or certainly worsened - by years of wearing tight , pointy stilettos
retired teacher susan , 61 , has also suffered life - changing knee problems from wearing heels since she was a teenager
' my husband and i go on a lot of cruises , and recently took up ballroom dancing , which call for lots of dressing up and wearing high - heels for hours on end , ' she says
susan has also suffered life - changing knee problems from wearing heels ' at first , i just put the pain down to ageing and tried to soldier on , but as time went on , over-the - counter painkillers stopped working and the niggling , arthritic pains were keeping me awake at night , ' she says
they really helped in the short term , but i still found i could n't wear heels when we went out or on holiday - it was just too painful
' susan had to undergo arthroscopies - keyhole surgery to remove damaged cartilage - on both knees before a right knee replacement by orthopaedic surgeon shivanand geeranavar at bmi edgbaston hospital improved things
' of course , arthritis and bunions are not the only problems that can be caused by high heels - squeezing feet into too - tight points can lead to misshapen hammer toes , and regular wearers of 3 in heels may suffer from tendonitis , where the achilles tendon shrinks and tightens painfully
tim allardyce says wearing high heels regularly can also be at the root of a raft of excruciatingly painful back , hip and even neck problems
' high heels have always been considered part of a female tv presenter 's uniform , ' she says
' i was told to stick to flats or shoes with a very low heel and to spend as much time barefoot as possible to help correct my posture , which had been thrown out of alignment by wearing heels day in and day out , ' she says
' for high - heel lovers not yet suffering painful problems , podiatrist michael ratcliffe advises picking shoes carefully
if you 're wearing a pair of heels over 2 in high , limit the time spent wearing them to two hours maximum
' interestingly , consultant knee surgeon marcus green , at the bmi priory hospital in birmingham , has even more hope for those who ca n't bear to part with their favourite footwear - he is not convinced the link between high heels and arthritis in the knees has been proved
' there 's no doubt that high heels change the forces on the knee joint , but none of the long - term studies i 've seen suggest they go on to cause serious knee problems , ' he says
