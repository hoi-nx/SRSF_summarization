exeter has been dubbed ' too posh for monopoly ' after game makers were told there is nowhere low - rent enough to fill the space of old kent road it 's the most popular board game in the world , with hundreds of versions springing up in far - flung cities across the globe
but monopoly - makers planning a special exeter edition have been told there is nowhere low - rent enough to fill the space of old kent road
high - end game zones have been easily filled with locations like the city 's gothic cathedral , exeter castle , the guildhall and modern shopping centre
game - makers say they have developed boards for cities across the country but have never come across the current dilemma
exeter city council leader pete edwards said there were no areas suitable for the brown spots , which are taken up in london by old kent road and whitechapel road
he said : ' i think they will have a problem - there is nowhere cheap in exeter that would be suitable for the old kent road spot
thousands of voters have suggested landmarks across exeter to fill the more expensive slots , such as the cathedral no one has come forward with ideas for which streets should fill the brown sections of the board , which cost $ 60 in monopoly money ' the board was designed on the streets of london and it is a nigh on impossible task to replicate that in exeter
' exeter city council leader pete edwards said there were no areas suitable for the brown monopoly ( board game pictured ) spots , which are taken up in london by old kent road and whitechapel road the makers of the game have launched a second appeal for recommendations for any exeter landmark that can replace old kent road , and bosses were sent to the city today to hunt a location down
