comments sections and social networks across the web are littered with antisocial users who repeatedly abuse and provoke people to get a reaction
but now a team of researchers has studied millions of such online posts to identify common traits among these users
and it has built an algorithm that can recognise a potential troll with an accuracy of 80 per cent by scanning their comments
experts studied 40 million posts by 1.7 millions users on news site cnn , political news site breitbart.com and gaming site ign
the researchers then divided users into those most likely to be banned , called future-banned users ( fbus ) , and other users dubbed never - banned users ( nbus ) the research was carried out by phd students from stanford and cornell university , led by justin chang , in a paper called antisocial behavior in online discussion communities
over an 18 - month period , the team studied the content and deletion rates of 40 million posts and 100 million votes posted by 1.7 million users across these sites
posts made by antisocial web users , or trolls , are less readable in terms of language and coherency
trolls were also more likely to have had posts deleted than other users and over the 18 month study period , the number of deleted posts by fbus increased
people who , over the course of the study , were subsequently banned from the sites , or were likely to be , were classified as future-banned users ( fbus )
users who were n't banned during the study , and did n't exhibit signs that suggested they would be in the future , were known as never - banned users ( nbus )
once these users were split up the researchers looked at four features to identify common traits among the fbus and nbus
' we find that the average text similarity of posts written by fbus is significantly lower than that of nbus , suggesting that fbus make less of an effort to integrate or stay on - topic , ' said researchers
the team also found that while there was no consistent trend with respect to the use of words containing negative emotion among posts made by fbus , they are less likely to use positive words
posts made by antisocial web users , or trolls , are less readable ( centre ) in terms of language and coherency and are more likely to veer off - topic and have fewer similarities than posts by other users ( left )
trolls were also more likely to have had posts deleted than other users and over the 18 - month study period , the number of deleted posts by fbus increased
these traits are unlikely to help recognise a troll in their own right , but when combined , the researchers found they could be used to identify a troll with 80 % accuracy fbus contribute significantly more posts per thread they participate in , according to the results
' our initial explorations suggest that fbus cause discussions to veer off - topic : replies to fbus were significantly less similar to preceding posts in a thread than replies to nbus
