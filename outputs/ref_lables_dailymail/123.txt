veteran bbc commentator alliss has said that the corporation should have tried harder to win the rights to the open and that attempts to give women equal rights in golf have ' caused mayhem '
recent legislation has given women more rights in golf clubs , while st andrews and royal st george 's have both voted to admit female members for the first time
but alliss told the radio times magazine that equality for women had ' b * * * * * * * up the game for a lot of people '
veteran broadcaster alliss ( second right ) claimed gender equality laws have â b * * * * * ed up the game â the commentator also claimed the bbc should have done more to secure the open coverage ' there 's been a hell of a row because four golf courses that hold the open did n't have women members , ' he said
' i 'm told the ladies golf union has lost 150,000 members since equality for women came in
' all of the wives of members at these clubs could have used the facilities for free
when i was at muirfield a couple of years ago talking to a few of the lady members , i said , " what about this equality ? you must be happy about that ? " " god no , " they said
' alliss ' comments come as the 2016 open will be the last to be broadcast live on the bbc before sky takes over
the former professional golfer , 84 , told the magazine : ' i very much regret that the bbc has lost the open , but i said it might do 10 years ago
' he admitted that the bbc could not compete with sky 's deep pockets but added : ' i do n't think there were enough people at the bbc dealing with the negotiations who cared enough
' alliss defended his style from critics , saying : ' i think they just do n't like my delivery
i was a bbc man through - and - through and they paid me well enough , ' he said
' alliss added : ' i was watching golf from dubai a couple of weeks ago
' he said that he had ' thought about leaving ' the bbc
the bbc keep saying to me , ' stay as long as you like
