rosberg feels he may have handed lewis hamilton a psychological advantage with his post-chinese grand prix outburst
rosberg , however , concedes he would not do anything differently under the circumstances that materialised at the shanghai international circuit on sunday
to make a complaint about lewis hamilton 's slow driving was understandable given the situation , but to turn on his mercedes team - mate during the post-race media conference was a sign the briton has got under rosberg 's skin
rosberg has claimed that team - mate lewis hamilton has the mental edge over him after his outburst damon hill , the 1996 world champion , upon hearing rosberg 's comments remarked the german had shot himself in the foot by publicly airing his grievances
it was a sign of weakness from rosberg , who on thursday conceded he had probably provided lewis hamilton with additional psychological ammunition
' maybe , because i 'm standing here and i have to answer all these questions , ' said rosberg in the middle of a barrage from the press ahead of this weekend 's bahrain grand prix
' the british driver won the chinese gp but came under fire from rosberg for allegedly slowing on purpose the matter was resolved in a post-race debrief involving the drivers and the team 's top brass in motorsport boss wolff and executive technical director paddy lowe
but as to what would transpire should the same scenario occur again in the future , rosberg said : ' it 's so difficult because it 's not a thing that 's black or white
' so the more annoying a ferrari becomes , the more likely those measures will be used - just like in chinese when lewis hamilton was told to speed up
for his part , lewis hamilton has remained unruffled by rosberg 's comments , and does not feel there is any lingering animosity
rosberg is yet to better lewis hamilton this season but insists he 's already forgotten about their recent spat ' there 's no issue between me and rosberg
' there is no doubt lewis hamilton has rosberg rattled as the former has now beaten the latter in nine of the last 10 races stretching back into last year
