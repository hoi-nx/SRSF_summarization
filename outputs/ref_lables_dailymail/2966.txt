cook was both proactive and imaginative for much of that first test but he is a captain who leads mainly by example and simply has to break a run that now sees him without a test century for 33 innings
in 21 of those 33 innings he has not passed 25 and his test average of 45.65 is lower than at any time since the 2010 - 11 ashes
the only way for cook to stop the questions about his lack of a big innings is to replicate the form he has been showing in practice here with his new slightly open stance and go back to churning out the runs
