the slip has nât happened and liverpool are looking strong
they are top of the league with six games to go and only city are better placed , theoretically , with two games in hand to make up a four - point deficit
dejected city players during their 4 - 2 derby defeat to man united on sunday liverpool players celebrate raheem sterling 's opening goal against newcastle on monday city currently have a four - point lead over liverpool in the race for the final champions league place today , the last meaningful race among the top teams is between liverpool and city
city lead liverpool by four points and each has played 32 games
the stakes are astonishing , but only because the champions league is an extremely big deal and they are currently in a pursuit for that last spot in the top four
these days it is liverpool doing the chasing
so , what of city ? the numbers are woefully inadequate
some examples : city have nine points fewer than at this stage last season ; their 4 - 2 defeat against man united saw them concede four for the first time since 2009 ; they have lost four of their past six premier league games and five in 2015 , which is one more than in the whole of 2014
city profited from a liverpool collapse to claim the premier league title last season steven gerrard 's infamous slip against chelsea was the moment the title pendulum swung towards city liverpool 's surrender of a three - goal lead at crystal palace also cost them the title last season april 19 west ham ( h ) april 25 aston villa ( h ) may 3 tottenham ( a ) may 10 qpr ( h ) may 17 swansea ( a ) may 24 southampton ( h ) april 25 west brom ( a ) april 28 hull ( a ) may 2 qpr ( h ) may 10 chelsea ( a ) may 16 crystal palace ( h ) may 24 stoke ( a ) when they fell behind against man united they collapsed
that , perhaps more than the result , could be what crushes manuel pellegrini in the final analysis
which brings us back to liverpool , a team that had far less of a choice in its major change to personnel last summer
liverpool fell , but liverpool climbed again and here they are
but they found ways to win and , as such , will contest an fa cup semi-final and hold an outside chance of a top - four place in the league
manuel pellegrini has come under mounting pressure following a poor run of results influential players such as yaya toure could be going through the etihad exit door in the summer rodgers has masterminded liverpool 's return to form at the perfect time rodgers will hope the controversies over raheem sterling 's contract and hippy crack taking do not affect the youngster 's performances and liverpool 's run - in but what he has proven again is that he can inspire this dressing room ; he can still generate motivation in a group that has had a mediocre season and among whom is a leading player unhappy with his contract situation
four of those league games are away from anfield , but like city , it is not a run - in that would have one cursing their luck
