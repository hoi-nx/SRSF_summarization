tesla founder musk has unveiled a ' revolutionary ' $ 3,000 battery which he claims can run an entire home for eight hours
musk introduced the powerwall device at a press conference in california last night and said the technology could ' change the world '
the device , which could be in homes by the end of summer , will be able to store electricity at night when it is cheaper

powerwall can be used as back up power in the case of an emergency , or be used to hold power from renewable energy sources
the ' daily use ' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt - hours , which is around a quarter of a home 's daily usage
the average u.s. home uses 10,908 kilowatt - hours of energy per year , or just short of 30 per day
the ' daily use ' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt - hours , which is around a quarter of a home 's daily usage
department of energy figures state that the average u.s. home uses 10,908 kilowatt - hours of energy per year , or just short of 30 per day
according to that figure , a single , fully - charged powerwall device would be able to meet a quarter of a home 's energy needs on any given day
musk said that the devices can be stacked together to provide more energy
the system would let homeowners with solar panels or other sources of renewable energy easily store their energy at home , rather than the current model whereby they sell power back to energy suppliers as it is produced , then buy it again during peak times
it could also let savvy consumers take advantage of power companies ' lower rates during the night and use the cheaper , stored energy during peak periods
according to tech site mashable , musk told attendees at the event : ' our goal is to fundamentally change the way the world uses energy
pictured is a utility - scale version of powerwall that can be used by businesses and scaled up for more power the ' daily use ' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt - hours , which is around a quarter of a home 's daily usage tesla also unveiled the ' powerpack ' , which is the big brother of the powerwall
it describes it as an ' infinitely scalable system ' that can work for businesses , in industrial applications , and public utility companies
' as well as the daily - use model , tesla will also launch a 10 kilowatt - hour backup battery , designed to tide homes over during power blackouts , such as those caused by storms
marketing material for the device , published late thursday on tesla 's website , says : ' powerwall is a home battery that charges using electricity generated from solar panels , or when utility rates are low , and powers your home in the evening
musk ( right ) describes it as an ' infinitely scalable system ' that comes in 100 kwh battery blocks that can scale from 500 kwh up to 10 mwh and higher the technology could let savvy consumers take advantage of power companies ' lower rates during the night and use the cheaper , stored energy during peak periods
in the past he has said such early batteries ' suck ' tesla also unveiled the ' powerpack ' , which is the larger scale version of the powerwall
it describes it as an ' infinitely scalable system ' that can work for businesses , in industrial applications and public utility companies
tesla said the factory will cut current battery production costs by up to 30 per cent , and will be powered predominantly by renewable energy sources , such as wind and solar
