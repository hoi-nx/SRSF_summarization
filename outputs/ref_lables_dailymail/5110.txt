ed miliband 's claim to crackdown on the super-rich unravelled today after it emerged balls has warned the idea of scrapping non-dom rules would cost the country money
the labour leader used a speech to say he will ' abolish ' the 200 - year - old rule for non-doms , which applies to around 116,000 people , claiming they make uk an ' offshore tax haven for a few ' and can ' no longer be justified '
but in january mr balls , the shadow chancellor , said : ' i think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing uk money because there will be some people who will then leave the country
but mr ed miliband argues that non-dom tests ' are not very rigorous ' and can be granted to people who have a burial plot or property abroad
in a speech in warwick today , mr ed miliband said that everyone who has made uk their permanent home should pay full uk tax on all their income and gains
he pledged to abolish the non-dom status from april 2016
the next labour government will abolish the non-dom rule
' and we will replace it with a clear principle : anyone permanently resident in the uk will pay tax in the same way
but everyone else will have to pay tax on their worldwide income
' the status , which is unique to the uk having been introduced by william pitt the younger in the late 18th century , is used by more than 110,000 wealthy people
in january shadow chancellor balls warned : ' i think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing uk money because there will be some people who will then leave the country
' mr ed miliband said non-dom status results from a discredited belief that ' anything goes for those at the top and that what is good for the rich is always good for uk '
' there are now 116,000 non-doms , costing hundreds of millions of pounds to our country â it can no longer be justified , and it makes uk an offshore tax haven for a few
' non-dom status is often inherited through the father so can apply to people who were born in uk
newspaper reports overnight suggested that non-dom rules would be scrapped by labour altogether
but today it emerged labour would allow ' real temporary residents ' to take advantage of the rules - with the time limit to be consulted on should they take power in the general election on may 7
mr ed miliband said on twitter that ' we should all pay taxes by the same rules ' ahead of his speech in coventry ex-dragons ' den star duncan bannatyne backed the labour tax crackdown entrepreneur and ex-dragons ' den star duncan bannatyne has backed ed miliband over the labour leader 's plan to scrap non-dom tax status
he tweeted : ' ed miliband says he will abolish non-dom status in uk
but it emerged that when he was a treasury minister in the last labour government , mr balls insisted that ' the majority of non-domiciled individuals who had already left the uk spent no more than five years here '
and in a january interview mr balls said : ' i think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing uk money because there will be some people who will then leave the country
' asked by bbc radio leeds at the time if he would scrap the status , he said he was looking at tightening the system to ' make sure the non-dom rules work in a fair way '
chancellor osborne said labour 's proposals amounted to ' tinkering around the edges ' not an outright ban
the lib dems said the number non-dom numbers ' exploded ' under the last labour government and more than doubled while mr ed miliband was an adviser in the treasury tory chancellor osborne warned the plan could cost uk ' hundreds of millions of pounds ' and stopped short of scrapping the rules , despite labour 's claims nick clegg 's party said it would rack up existing fees for non don status as high as Â£ 150,000 a year the lib dems were bounced into announcing their own crackdown on non doms by the labour pledge
the lib dems would also ban people from inheriting non-dom status from their parent
