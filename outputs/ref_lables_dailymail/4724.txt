england had a good day on tuesday at the start of this second test in conditions that suited them
england can be happy they are good enough to take wickets at home and when the ball is swinging and conditions are in their favour - like here
if that âs the case then carry on as you are , but a position of strength is often a good one from which to take a long hard look at yourself and say â how can we improve ? â alastair cook needs something different to draw on in his same - same pace bowling attack alastair cook is frustrated after dropping a catch off marlon samuel , who was on 32 and finished the day 94 not out alastair cook and coach peter moores are under pressure to produce a result after drawing the first test the biggest reason england have not won away from home since 2012 is that they are lacking something different in their attack
the whole of england âs bowling psyche is about containment , it âs about bowling maidens and building pressure , as we saw for much of the first day here in grenada until west indies started to crack
leg - spinner adil rashid could offer what is needed but by all accounts he has nât been bowling well enough alastair cook speaks with paceman mark wood , who could be what is needed with comparisons to jones the one i would keep an eye on is mark wood
from what i âve seen of him there is a bit of jones about him and the welshman was a key element of england âs best attack of the last 20 years - the 2005 ashes line - up
jones learnt a lot of the skills that made him the 2005 trump card on the caribbean tour a year earlier , for instance the ability to gain skiddy reverse swing on flat pitches , and mark wood might have done that now
moeen ali is a good spinner for england , even though he looked rusty after being recalled for grenada mark wood seems to have that different trajectory which should suit overseas pitches on which england struggle in england we do nât produce enough of that sort of bowler and when we do get one we can hold them back a bit because they can be considered a luxury , or too much of a gamble
ben stokes , the pick of england 's bowlers on day one , athletically fields a shot from his own bowling umpire steve davis reprimands england 's ben stokes after he exchanged words with marlon samuels yes , at times england bowled a bit short
this england attack might be good enough for grenada on a day like tuesday but they must seek that little bit more .
