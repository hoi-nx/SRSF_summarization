â the furious victim wormald â who was left with the imprint of shaun smith âs shoe on his forehead â said it was wrong that the pair had got off so lightly and that there was no excuse for what had happened
with one of their victims motionless on the ground the pair begin to chase the second across the main road near their barracks at catterick garrison in north yorkshire reaching for his neck , collins tries to grab the man before the pair chase him round a tree and back onto the road after dragging the man onto the ground collins is seen raising his fists and punching him repeatedly in the face the pair earlier claimed they had been followed out of a nightclub by the victims who threatened to stab them
