from bargain bath mats and kitchen utensils to fun knick - knacks like silly straws and children âs stick - on jewellery , hundreds of products sold at discount retailers have been found to contain toxic levels of harmful metals , plastics and chemicals that have been linked to cancers and diseases ( stock picture ) australian author and ceo of the australian college of environmental studies , nicole bijlsma , told daily mail australia that an investigation into products sold at australian two dollar stores could produce similar results
australian author and ceo of the australian college of environmental studies nicole bijlsma said the chemicals in these products are easily absorbed through ingestion and skin ' based on the amount of products that have been recalled over the years and studies which have found the levels of industrial chemicals are rising in younger generations , there 's definitely a history to indicate that they [ products at discount stores ] could contain chemicals that cause adverse health affect , ' ms nicole bijlsma said
' it depends on the type of chemical , but a lot of these things are absorbed through ingestion and dermal exposure
kids have a very high hand to mouth ratio and are putting things in their mouth all the time
' a set of children 's necklaces examined by the study were found to have high levels of bromine , chlorine and lead
dozens of other products were also listed as having harmful chemicals , including silly straws which were found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates which have been linked to birth defects , reduced fertility , cancer , learning disabilities , diabetes , and other health issues , according to the report
she said that a recent study of four major discount retailers in the us , which found 133 out of 164 products tested contained at least one hazardous chemical ' above levels of concern ' , would find similar results in australian additional harmful substances found in the products included polyvinyl chloride plastic ( also known as pvc or vinyl ) and packaging chemical bisphenol - a ( also known as bpa )
leave your shoes outside : take them off before you go inside and trek dust and pesticides from outside into your home ms nicole bijlsma , a building biologist , who assess people 's homes - including measuring chemicals in their water , air , building materials and household products - to see what 's making them sick , said that while discount stores were the focus of negative attention , harmful chemicals can be found in any product which is manufactured outside of australian
they 're manufactured in asia and imported products are not regulated in the same way as they are here and that 's where the problem lies , ' ms nicole bijlsma said
' bpa is a good example because people got wind that it was affecting children 's behaviour and had an increased risk of breast cancer - so the manufacturer changed it and replaced it with bisphenol - s which has shown to be worse
a non-slip bath tub mat was found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates ( stock pictures ) ' it 's about generating profits for industry and so they get cheap products in , but they neglect safety standards
it assured that the accc had an active chemical inspection program and that the products supplied to discount variety stores are ' often included in analytical surveys and surveillance activities conducted by the accc ' and other product safety regulators
' stock image : children 's stick - on earnings sold at the stores were found to contain high levels of bromine and chlorine and medium levels of tin latex coated gloves were found to have high levels of chlorine and medium levels of antimony while silly straws were found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates ( stock pictures ) ms nicole bijlsma said not enough was being done by the accc , which she said only completes occasional spot checks , with thousands of shipping containers going unchecked
