all eyes were on terry this afternoon as he made the short trip across london to face qpr in the west london derby
loftus road was the place where the chelsea skipper racially abused then qpr defender anton ferdinand in october 2011
terry , who has been a crucial part of jose mourinho 's premier league title bid this season , played the full 90 minutes however as chelsea scraped a 1 - 0 win , but how did he get on ... terry ( centre ) celebrates at the final whistle with didier drogba ( left ) and branislav ivanovic reception there was a hostile introduction for terry as the teams lined up , before a cacophony of boos rang out around the ground as he touched the ball in the opening minute
terry experienced a hostile atmosphere at loftus road , but put in a good display at the back for chelsea temperament it was a moment to cherish for the qpr fans as austin responded to an arm across the chest by shoving terry to the ground off the ball
the chelsea captain was made to stretch occasionally , but he and gary cahil dealt with qpr 's threat well conduct despite an obvious attempt from austin to get under the skin of terry , he largely ignored the attention surrounding him and focused solely on leading his side to an important win while handling the occasion with maturity
