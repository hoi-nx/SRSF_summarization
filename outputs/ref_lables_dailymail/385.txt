they were young men from stable families who believed they were stuck in dead end jobs and looked on with jealousy at the flashy lifestyles of others who had girls , money and fast cars at their fingertips
what chan , then aged 21 , and sukumaran , 24 , came to have in common was the belief that smuggling drugs would provide them with a short cut to the life of ease and glamour and - their biggest mistake - that they could get away with it
chan , the youngest of four children and the son of chinese immigrants , once described himself as the black sheep of his family
he worked as a supervisor for the catering company eurest , where he first met renae lawrence , martin stephens and matthew norman , who he would later recruit into the drug smuggling roles that landed them in various indonesia prisons
sukumaran , a university drop - out and the eldest of three , still lived with his parents while working in a mail room
the bali nine trials began in october 2005 at denpasar district court : top row ( from l-r ) sukumaran , chan and martin eric stephens , 2nd row ( from l-r ) chen si yi , nguyen and matthew norman , and 3rd row ( from l-r ) rush , czugaj and renae lawrence both men , who first met at a party in 2002 despite attending the same sydney high school , had one thing in common ; they were disillusioned by their jobs and had been won over by the riches and lifestyle that selling drugs promised
i do n't think , you know , i was achieving too much , even though i had a stable job and all â¦ i was a drug user , ' chan told dateline in a 2010 interview in which sukumaran also admitted : ' i did n't see myself working in the mail room for the next 50 years of my life '
chan was intercepted at denpasar airport along with rush , czugaj , lawrence and martin stephens who had heroin strapped to their stomach and legs , while sukumaran was found at the melasti beach bungalows hotel on kuta beach with nguyen , chen and matthew norman

the latter group were found with 334g of heroin along with materials for smuggling including elastoplast , scales and plastic wrap it 's difficult to imagine the two men , now in their 30s and swearing by their rehabilitation , as the gangster thugs that threatened the lives of their drug mules
by october , the trials had begun for the bali nine at denpasar district court and within just five months on february 14 in 2006 , chan and sukumaran were sentenced to death by firing squad
although the indonesia courts concluded that it could not be proven , rush and lawrence both claimed that chan had threatened their families lives if they did not follow his orders it 's difficult to imagine the two men , now in their 30s and swearing by their rehabilitation , as the gangster thugs that threatened the lives of their drug mules renae lawrence is the only bali nine member who was given a reduced sentence of 20 years , while the other six ( chan and sukumaran excluded ) were sentenced to life in prison
chan and sukumaran 's death sentence on the other hand , would never budge
they fought a long battle with prosecutors as their verdicts wavered between death and life in prison several trips : panel beater turned drug mule renae lawrence made two successful trips for chan from bali with heroin strapped to her body , but was caught on the third , in april 2005 , and sentenced to 20 years former wollongong bartender , martin stephens ( left ) and sydney catering worker matthew norman ( right ) , pictured at kerobokan jail , bali , in 2007 , two years after they were duped by chan who had promised them quick riches by acting as heroin mules in bali skumaran meanwhile , had obtained an associate degree in fine art from curtin university in perth and became known for his haunting paintings
the first four months of 2015 has proved to be a complete nightmare for chan and sukumaran and their families
handcuffed and shackled , chan cut a bleak figure as he was transferred from bali to central java and a prison cell on ' death island ' utter despair was etched on sukumaran 's face as he was led away to be transferred to nusakambangan where he is due to face the death penalty it began with the rejection of their clemency and the announcement that they would be amongst those next executed
