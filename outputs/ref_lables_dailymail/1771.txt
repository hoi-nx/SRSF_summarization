the second act of ap mccoy 's life
on saturday he will dismount from the bay gelding box office after the 4.25pm at sandown â the bet365 handicap hurdle â and it will begin
perhaps it will not quite sink in , at first , amid the cheers and roars , the hoopla and a presentation from ian wright , an arsenal hero , as befits ap mccoy 's club allegiance
yet the following morning , when ap mccoy awakes an ex-jockey , he will understand there are no more competitive rides , no more races , no more cheltenhams or aintrees or even modest little handicap hurdles to separate him from the field
ap mccoy will race at sandown on saturday for the last time before he retires after a successful career to date , ap mccoy has 4,357 winning memories
it can not be said that ap mccoy has courted celebrity , or that he will ever be regarded as a little man by racegoers , yet as he scurries to his new life , minus its thrills , spills and the snap of broken bones , one can not help but ask : why ? to be a jockey is to live a life of denial , early nights , early mornings , restraint at the dinner table , water at the bar , long , hot baths to sweat out the weight that , in ap mccoy 's case , lowered his sperm count
yet not one of ap mccoy 's thoughts on retiring has centred greatly on the inconveniences or even the pain of injury
ap mccoy will host a party at home on sunday for family , friends and his closest racing colleagues , and the next day travel to the punchestown festival with jp mcmanus , as a spectator
ap mccoy simply reiterates he would still like to be riding
ap mccoy ( left ) and wife chanelle will host a party at home on sunday for family and friends and why would he need a mask ? that is the puzzle of ap mccoy 's decision : the fear that appears to be at the heart of it
yet , another year of ap mccoy ? another year of the man who currently leads the jump jockeys championship by an insurmountable margin ? random misfortune aside , we know full well what would happen if he stayed on another year
he would be champion jockey a 21st time
to put this view into perspective , the gap between ap mccoy and scudamore , who is in second place in the jockey 's table , is 82 wins , while the gap between scudamore and third - placed johnson is two
there is no margin anywhere comparable to the distance ap mccoy and the rest
there is no - one on his shoulder , no - one breathing down his neck , no - one gaining on him up the hill

ap mccoy is unnerved by the thought of staying too long , of not going out a winner yet ap mccoy 's farewell is almost troubling
ap mccoy , almost certainly , will find a berth in racing where his expertise will be valued , no doubt with jp mcmanus
yet it still wo n't be fakenham on a wet thursday â it wo n't be the weatherbys novice hurdle at towcester , in which ap mccoy piloted his 4,000th winner , mountain tunes
for an athlete at the top as ap mccoy has been for so long , nothing can quite compare to the thrill of competition
for ap mccoy , any competition
the sheer number of times he took a race on sets him apart
in 2001 - 02 , he rode over 1,000 times in britain alone and since richard dunwoody claimed 160 winners to be crowned champion jump jockey in 1994 - 95 , ap mccoy has surpassed that total in each of his 20 seasons
there will never be another like him â a fact he wanted to make sure of before retiring
whatever ap mccoy 's place in the world from here , it can not compare to the thrill of the chase
that is why punters loved him , why his farewell at sandown has long been a sell - out
this is a jockey who â on at least two occasions â rode winners that had drifted to 999 - 1 on betfair at the midway stage

maybe , deep down , even ap mccoy himself wondered how long he could continue to dodge the big one â the fall that might challenge his champion status
' ap mccoy has been trying to prepare himself for that moment all week
he turned down rides at perth to give him the feel of spare time before sundown at sandown
' a lot of people wanted me to go to perth , ' ap mccoy said , ' but if i went to perth i could think ' why not do one more week at punchestown ? ' a lot of days i wish i was n't doing it , that i had n't said it
