a mother who spent months feeling unwell was horrified to discover she probably had cancer - after spotting all her symptoms on a facebook post
laura everley , 36 , had experienced bloating , lower back pain and constipation over a three - month period
but having previously suffered irritable bowel syndrome and endometriosis , she put the symptoms down to those conditions
it was only when she stumbled across a post on her facebook timeline , which detailed all the same symptoms , that she realised it could be cancer
tests later revealed she had an aggressive ovarian tumour - and the disease had begun to spread
she had been suffering from bloating , back pain , constipation and frequently needing the loo in october 2014 , mrs laura everley underwent a hysterectomy to remove her womb and her ovaries
she is pictured with husband mark , and her five - year - old son , harry , before being diagnosed with cancer after performing a hysterectomy to remove her womb as well as her ovaries , surgeons revealed the cancer had already begun to spread
mrs laura everley is now undergoing chemotherapy and doctors are confident she can beat the disease
she hopes her story will raise awareness to the symptoms of ovarian cancer , prompting other women to see their doctor if they are worried
this is because they are often the same as symptoms of other less serious conditions , such as irritable bowel syndrome ( ibs ) or pre-menstrual syndrome ( pms )
mrs laura everley said : ' the symptoms are the same , so i thought it could have been irritable bowel syndrome ' i went down the gluten free route but that did n't make any difference
the symptoms of ovarian cancer can be difficult to recognise , particularly in its early stages
this is because they are often the same as symptoms of other less serious conditions , such as irritable bowel syndrome ( ibs ) or pre-menstrual syndrome ( pms )
however , three main symptoms are more frequent in women diagnosed with ovarian cancer
they are : other symptoms , such as back pain , needing to pass urine more frequently than usual , and pain during sex may be the result of other conditions in the pelvic area
however , they may be present in some women with ovarian cancer
source : nhs choices idly scrolling facebook one evening , she noticed a post raising awareness of ovarian cancer
' a friend had shared a post from a friend of theirs about her experiences of cancer and what she 'd been through , ' said mrs laura everley
' medics confirmed mrs laura everley had a cyst , which was removed and sent away for a biopsy
finally , it dawned on me that it was a type of ovarian cancer
he knows i have ovarian cancer , but he 's only five so he does n't quite understand what cancer means
after the hysterectomy , mrs laura everley underwent a course of chemotherapy , with each round leaving her sick for a week afterwards
she also lost her hair - which she says was an emotional experience ' i 'd have needed the hysterectomy eventually anyway
' now , mrs laura everley is nearing the end of her course of chemotherapy and doctors are confident she can be cured
she is also keen for women to be more aware of the symptoms of ovarian cancer
' there 's no screening for ovarian cancer like there is with the smear test for cervical
' clear cell carcinoma is normally treated with a hysterectomy operation clear cell cancer of the ovary is an uncommon type of ovarian cancer
epithelial ovarian cancer means the cancer started in the surface layer covering the ovary
it accounts for 3 to 5 per cent of patients with ovarian cancer in the western world and 20 per cent in the far east
the first treatment is the same as for the common form of epithelial ovarian cancer â a hysterectomy
