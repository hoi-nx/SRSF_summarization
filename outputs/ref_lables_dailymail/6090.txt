but there is another form of the deadly gas , dubbed abiotic methane , that is created by chemical reactions in the crust beneath the seafloor
now scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane â a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide
serpentinisation occurs when seawater reacts with hot mantle rocks exhumed along large faults within the seafloor the reservoirs are secure , and scientists do n't believe they will impact climate change
' this ultraslow spreading ridge shows that the arctic environment is ideal for this type of methane production , ' said johnson associate professor at the university of new hampshire
scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane â a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide
' but this estimate is not accounting for abiotic methane
the gas is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat and is currently being targeted by government in an attempt to mitigate global warming
the obama administration points to studies that show that methane pollution is projected to increase to a level equivalent to over 620 million tonnes of carbon dioxide pollution in 2030 , if no action is taken
' in other known settings the abiotic methane escapes into the ocean , where it potentially influences ocean chemistry , ' says johnson
rather than causing a concern , the study claims that active tectonic environments may serve as a stable area for long - term storage of methane carbon in deep - marine sediments
but other types of methane in the arctic are causing a concern for scientists
he tweeted : ' if even a small fraction of arctic sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere , we 're f 'd ' the scientist , based at the geological survey of denmark and greenland , tweeted the provocative statement after a swedish study found methane leaking beneath the arctic
some of this methane â which is over 20 times more potent than co2 at trapping heat - is now making it to the ocean 's surface
samples of the gas hydrates will provide more knowledge on abiotic methane
