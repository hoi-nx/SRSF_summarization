prince george 's birth in 2013 sparked a Â£ 247m sales bonanza for makers of royal memorabilia but experts say the second royal baby is unlikely to have the same effect
a more modest sales increase of between Â£ 60 and Â£ 70m is predicted , with most of that spent on champagne and cake rather than royal souvenirs
however , the baby is expected to make more of an impact in the long term - especially if the child turns out to be a girl
bonanza : the birth of prince george sparked a Â£ 247m sales boom between the 1st july and 31st august 13 prince of sales : since then , george has gone on to replicate his mother 's impact on clothing sales the new baby 's grandfather prince of wales is also hoping for a baby - related boost to his charity coffers via products sold in his highgrove shop
the flurry of royal baby memorabilia echoes that sparked by the birth of prince george , when the market was flooded by everything from bibs to books
other items included royal - themed potties , dummies featuring crowns , bibs proclaiming ' i love aunty pippa ' and a book entitled shhh ! do nât wake the royal baby ! while there 's no shortage of choice this time around , professor bamfield says the baby 's long - term impact on retail will be more significant than the initial flurry
making his mark : outfits worn by prince george such as these rachel riley dungarees , sell out new baby , new coin : the royal mint is producing a series of coins to mark the new royal birth ' the impact of the baby is going to be over a longer period , particularly if it âs a girl
the royal mint is also to produce a celebratory Â£ 5 coin - again repeating the routine after prince george 's birth when it produced 10,000 silver crown - sized Â£ 5 coins
