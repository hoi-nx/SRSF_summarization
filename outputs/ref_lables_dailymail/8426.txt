their study finds the cracking is caused by the rapid formation of a gas - filled cavity within a slippery substance called synovial fluid that lubricates the space between the finger bones
research found that the cracking is caused by the rapid formation of a gas - filled cavity within a slippery substance called synovial fluid that lubricates the space between the finger bones the study also found that the knuckle cracks in less than 310 milliseconds and that immediately before the popping sound there is a white flash , believed to be from water rushing together
the experiment was made possible by magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) â which provides detailed images of internal body structures â and was humorously dubbed by those involved as the â pull my finger study
â biomedical engineering professor richard thompson said : â rapid imaging with mri was ideal for these studies because it allowed clear visualization of the bones and fluids surrounding them , and critically , the formation of the air cavity
the experiment was made possible by magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and a study co-author 's finger his fingers were individually inserted into a tube linked to a cable that was pulled until his joint cracked and the results were captured on the mri video
