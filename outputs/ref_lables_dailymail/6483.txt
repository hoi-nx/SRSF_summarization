amid the flurry of tributes that followed kellock âs announcement he was retiring at the end of the season , one from another old warhorse stood out
â so my friend and foe kellock calls time on a great career , â tweeted scotland and saracens lock hamilton
â as he suggested , hamilton had stood toe to toe with his countryman as opponents when their respective teams , edinburgh rugby and glasgow , clashed
but , in the second row for scotland , they would have each other âs backs as they fought â normally against the odds â for their country
kellock will retire at the end of the season and take up a new role with the scottish rugby on thursday , at the home of glasgow , it was announced that this fierce warrior would be standing down from active service after a career that truly boasted blood , sweat and toil for both club and country
at 33 and having amassed 56 international caps and made over 200 appearances for glasgow and edinburgh rugby , kellock has decided that his body and mind have been put through enough
no one could deny that he deserves nothing but praise and admiration , although lifting the pro12 title at the end of the season would also be a more than fitting send - off
as he reflected upon his career yesterday , kellock admitted that the odds were stacked against him even being a rugby player as he grew up in football - mad bishopbriggs
the record books will show that he skippered scotland to their first ever test series win in the southern hemisphere and led glasgow warriors into their first ever play - off final
â to retire as glasgow captain is good enough but if i could go out as the glasgow captain who wins the pro12 for the first time in our history would be fairy - tale stuff , â said kellock , who played his 150th game as skipper in the 34 - 34 draw at leinster last friday
kellock amassed 56 international caps and made over 200 appearances for glasgow and edinburgh rugby â when i was starting out , i was one of very few people at my school who dreamed of playing at murrayfield
all my school friends wanted to play at hampden and , do nât get me wrong , as a west of scotland guy i played an awful lot of football , too
â we only played rugby in a three - week block in pe once a year and during one of them , my teachers said i had potential and took me to allan glen âs
kellock âs senior scotland debut was in a non-cap tour game against queensland reds in 2004
later that year he won the first of his 56 caps against australia at murrayfield
â it was dreadful telling everyone i was retiring and it was a reflective time for me , â said kellock
i have had four knee operations and knew i needed to make one big , last push to try to help glasgow to win the league this season and then call it quits
â i know how well the young lads are playing but training will still have an edge to it , probably more of an edge , as i want to get a starting place and retire after lifting some silverware with glasgow
he will also be involved in learning about the commercial and business aspects of the governing body and will also work with the players at glasgow , such as young lock jonny
â there are some top second - row players at the club like jonny , who is a grafter and would run into a brick wall for the glasgow cause
â kellock has been instrumental in glasgow âs rise over the past five or six years and he âs been an excellent role model for our values , with the work he does to improve himself , his team - mates and the club , â said townsend â he is very passionate about rugby in glasgow and it âs great that he âs moving into an important role with scottish rugby and glasgow warriors when he retires
â kellock has put his body on the line a lot during his nine years with the club and he âs still competing very hard with the other second - rows to be selected ahead of them
