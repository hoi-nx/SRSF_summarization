mcilroy could become just the sixth man to win the grand slam at augusta national on sunday , and while that represents the pinnacle of on - course achievement , he has designs on not just filling his trophy cabinet but becoming the true figurehead of his sport
that is the view of mcginley , europe âs ryder cup captain extraordinaire , who sums up the attitude in this neat way : mcilroy is no jose mourinho
â is it all about winning titles , is it all about the jose mourinho way of â i âm going to get as many medals and titles as i can â ? â ponders mcginley
â or is it , i âm the no 1 player in the world , i represent the game of golf , am i going to become somebody like tiger woods did , an iconic figure in world sport , and try to introduce and propel the game forward ? mcilroy has designs on becoming the true figurehead of his sport , says mcginley
mcilroy goes into this week 's masters at augusta national as favourite but he 's aiming for more than trophies mcginley says mcilroy 's ambitions are unlike chelsea 's relentless win - at - all - costs manager jose mourinho mcginley , mcilroy 's ryder cup - winning coach , says the world no 1 aims to be an iconic figure in world sport â my hunch knowing mcilroy is that it âs more about representing that no 1 position , and bringing as many titles along with it as he can
â mcginley , by the way , is a die - hard west ham fan
fellow sons of the emerald isle , mcginley helped coax arguably the greatest round of mcilroy âs life , the utter demolition of america âs own golden boy , rickie , 5 & 4 at gleneagles last year
mcginley speaks glowingly of mcilroy from their time together on the winning ryder cup team there were signs before the ryder cup that mcilroy was not just in single - minded pursuit of greatness , but had his eyes on the greater good
mcginley wanted to give short and sharp tips to his young charge on how to prepare for gleneagles ; but mcilroy simply would nât shut up about it
â i swear , i honestly could not have asked for one per cent more out of mcilroy , in the whole two years of ryder cup , â enthuses mcginley
he must stand firm on the slippery slopes of augusta national âs rolling fairways and conquer the course that has beaten him up on two excruciating occasions , and where his best finish was eighth last year
what tiger woods has done in his career is a yardstick , mcilroy is still evolving towards that and every year he is getting better and better , but he still has a long way to go to meet the standards that tiger woods set
â mcginley , who will be at the masters in augusta national commentating for sky sports , the only place to watch all four days live , cites tiger woods âs supreme patience as the hallmark of a true great â mcilroy glaringly lacked the latter during his final - round horror show in 2011
mcginley walks with graeme mcdowell and mcilroy as they prepared for the 2014 ryder cup mcginley will be watching his former charges at the masters closely as a pundit for sky sports four years on , however , mcilroy âs rivals know they are battling to contain a different beast
â the one thing that mcilroy has proved is that he âs able to learn from his mistakes and move on , â says mcginley , who talks now of an â aura â surrounding the man who will be going for his third major in a row after his open and us pga championship victories last summer
â the men most likely to challenge mcilroy âs bid for immortality are most likely to be a number of old ryder cup foes â although tiger woods will surely not be among them
mcilroy is intimidating for his opponents when he 's hitting the ball as he can , says mcginley tiger woods returns to the fold for the masters but is n't expected to be challenging mcilroy for the green jacket masters defending champion spieth ( left ) and a reformed and refocused spieth spieth , the extraordinary texan 21 - year - old , is also considered among the 2015 title contenders â a rival will be good for mcilroy , â insists mcginley
â that âs why it âs always handy to have a man like captain mcginley around , to help fan those flames
