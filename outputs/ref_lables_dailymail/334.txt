an amazing map revealed by nasa has shown where lightning occurs most on earth
the map reveals average yearly counts of lightning flashes per square kilometre from 1995 to 2013
and the results show that the highest amounts of lightning flashes occur in the far eastern democratic republic of congo and lake maracaibo in northwestern venezuela
areas with the fewest number of flashes each year are grey and purple ; areas with the largest number of lightning flashes - as many as 150 per year per square kilometer ( 0.4 square miles ) - are bright pink
the democratic republic of congo was found to have the most over the period the map was created using data from nasa âs tropical rainfall measuring mission satellite , and the orbview-1/microlab satellite
according to the satellite observations , lightning occurs more often over land than it does over oceans
