our willingness to learn - or lack thereof - is significantly influenced by our genes , according to a large study
the researchers found that 40 to 50 per cent of the differences in children âs motivation to learn could be explained by their genetic inheritance from their parents
our willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes , according to a study by goldsmiths university in london and ohio state university
more than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 took part in the research ( stock image shown ) psychologists from goldsmiths university of london , and ohio state university in the us studied more than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 from six countries , including the uk , canada , japan , germany , russia and the us
instead , genetics and non-shared - environment factors had the largest effect on the children âs motivation to learn , whereas the shared environment had negligible impact
genetics and non-shared - environment factors were found to have the largest effect on the children âs motivation to learn , whereas the shared environment had negligible impact ( stock image shown ) a review of 308 studies involving more than 1.1 million children has now completely overturned this long - held stereotype
â the results do nât mean there is a specific gene for how much children enjoy learning , he added , but they suggest a complex process , involving many genes and gene - environment interactions that help influence a child âs motivation to learn
