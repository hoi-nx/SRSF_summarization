a mum has come under fire for sending out invitations to her son 's first birthday in which she lists very specific requests - including some quite large and expensive gifts
the invite was shared on reddit the recipient of the email , who deleted the child 's name from the email , labelled the post ' most demanding 1st birthday invite ever ' , sparking an online backlash against the pushy mum
the invitation reads : ' when we return items without receipts , we only get about 50 % of the value , so it 's like throwing away money if you do n't include a receipt with the gifts
' we 're asking for gifts only from grandparents and the direct aunt / uncle for [ retracted ] 's birthday party , and similar to christmas , would like to restrict it to 2 items total per household
' the mother also asks that the gifts do not have her son 's name on them , claiming that personalised goods attract kidnappers
' clothing with names is the # 1 thing that leads to kidnapping , so we do n't need to broadcast [ retracted ] 's name on clothing or toys
' the mother requests guests buy this play tunnel and this tent from ikea the only option that will do : the mom also very specifically requests this water table from walmart because of how the water drains the mother demands receipts for each gift so she can get the full value back if she returns them , and asks that the gifts do not have her son 's name on them , claiming that personalised goods attract kidnappers and she adds that her son does not need any more books than he already has
' by the way , a formal invite from [ retracted ] will be arriving in your mailboxes soon ... ' the email has been viewed more than a million times on reddit , with web users voicing their outrage in the comments section
