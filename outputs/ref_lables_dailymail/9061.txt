little zane died at home â in the middle of the night â after being poisoned by gas
for months after his death , police and other official agencies ruled out fears that the deadly fumes had come from a nearby landfill site
instead , they insisted carbon monoxide from a faulty pump hired by his family had caused his death
but now mail on sunday can reveal the damning evidence that proves the authorities have known for 14 months that hydrogen cyanide gas capable of killing zane had leaked into the family 's home as it was engulfed by floodwater
but zane 's grieving parents kye and nicole have faced a ' wall of silence ' , leading to claims of a cover - up while public agencies repeatedly insisted the boy died from carbon monoxide poisoning and that there was no risk to the wider public
dr ivan vince , an expert in landfill gases , said last night that it was possible the cyanide gas had leached from a nearby landfill site ( pictured ) ' they are hoping it will go away â but it wo n't
' we have said all along that they found hydrogen cyanide at kye and nicole 's house and here is the proof
' just hours after the tragedy , despite the fact that police were in constant communication with fire chiefs , surrey police chief superintendent dave miller declared that landfill gases were ' not one of our lines of inquiry ' into zane 's death
the force spent the next 11 months investigating carbon monoxide poisoning as the cause , before dropping its case in january on advice from the crown prosecution service that there was no case to answer in relation to a hired petrol - powered pump in the family 's home which they insist was never switched on
nicole and kye gbangbola also needed hospital treatment because of hydrogen cyanide exposure on the night of their son 's death
for months after his death , police and other official agencies ruled out fears that the deadly fumes had come from a nearby landfill site kye , 48 , has been permanently paralysed from the waist down because of the gas , which was used to murder millions in the nazi death camps
a commanding officer 's statement to police says : ' as we were about to leave the premises , one of the gas detectors went into an amber alarm indicating hydrogen cyanide had been detected at levels of ten parts per million
' the officer says the level of gas in the house is considered dangerous if inhaled for more than 15 minutes
fire crews fled the riverside home in chertsey , surrey ( pictured ) for their own safety after their specialist gas detectors sounded the alarm for dangerous levels of hydrogen cyanide the reading was taken at 7.29am â four hours after zane 's mother found him unconscious in a bedroom above the hallway and rang 999
the firefighters double - checked their equipment and re-entered the house on two more occasions to confirm that hydrogen cyanide was in the property at ' concentrated levels ' , according to their incident log
' another statement seen by this newspaper says the gas detectors used by the fire service had been tested and certified as working correctly four days before zane 's death
' dr ivan vince , an expert in landfill gases , said last night that it was possible the cyanide gas had leached from the landfill site
' this newspaper asked surrey police why the force had not disclosed that it knew hydrogen cyanide had been detected in the family 's home hours after zane had died
