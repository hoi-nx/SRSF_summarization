defender mertesacker believes arsenal have become a stronger unit from their fa cup success of last season , but can not allow themselves any sense of complacency against reading at wembley in saturday 's fa cup semi-final
the gunners head into the tie on the back of a superb run of form , which has seen them win 16 from 18 matches in all competitions and up into second place in the premier league
the atmosphere around the club is certainly a world way from the tense finale to the 2013/14 campaign , when arsenal were under extreme pressure in the quest to finally end a near decade wait for silverware as well as finish in the top four of the premier league once again , not to mention the uncertainty around the future of manager arsene wenger

you need to be focused 100 per cent reading , so it is going to be a tough one for us , ' said the german , who will again lead the team out at wembley with captain mikel arteta still not fit
' we are on a good level of confidence , but there will be pressure on us because we are super favourites and can we handle that during the game ? ' mertesacker added : ' it is going to be reading 's biggest game of the season , so to mentally prepare for that is going to be difficult , not just to match their physicality and mental strength , but to do more , to be on the ball from the start , to show them respect , but no fear for the pressure
