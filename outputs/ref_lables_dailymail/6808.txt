curle tells the kind of stories about management that might explain why retiring players are stampeding towards the pundits â couch
the carlisle manager loves a job that over the years has seen him break and rebuild a toilet , man a hose and pay salaries from his own pocket
â but there is no escaping the fact that curle is in a shrinking minority , being one of only four managers in the country âs top 92 clubs who has played for england
the drain of leading english players to television rather than management was the key finding of a sportsmail study
it seems that talking about the game is more appealing to former players than a life orchestrating it â easier money , less time and pressure
many ex-players simply have no financial need to work but for curle , money has only ever been just a part of it
curle insists football management was always his priority after ending his playing career curle has taken charge of carlisle after learning his trade in the lower league backwaters â football was all i had and all i wanted , â he said
i have done a bit for sky and i really enjoyed it but first and foremost i am a coach and manager
â few are better placed to illustrate the challenge of management than curle
he won three england caps but has spent most of the past 13 years in places where tv rights do not sell for billions
he started at mansfield and went on to chester , torquay and notts county before joining league two carlisle united last september after nearly five years coaching crystal palace and qpr under neil warnock
curle ( right ) is one of only four former england players to currently manage in the football league the well - travelled defender played for a total of 10 clubs during his career , including manchester city curle claims to have caught the management bug after playing for wolves under colin lee and john the 51 - year - old âs days are long and his experiences would not seem such fond memories to everyone
â at chester , i drove around looking for places to train , â curle said
â at mansfield , we had a toilet in the middle of the changing room so i helped knock it down and rehouse it
â it was at mansfield that curle used a fireman âs hose to water the training pitch
being in carlisle that âs a lot of time in the car , getting home after midnight
that âs what keeps managers like curle hooked
curle started his management career at mansfield where he missed out on promotion to division two curle returned to former club torquay as manager but could not save them from relegation in 2007 curle tooks notts county on a run of 22 consecutive away games without defeat before being sacked â winning matches is what i love , â curle said
â the 51 - year - old spent five years working as a coach under neil warnock at crystal palace and then qpr curle believes there is no better feeling than developing a player to reach their targets and nothing worse than getting the sack
it has already happened to curle and will probably happen again
