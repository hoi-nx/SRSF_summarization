older workers are suffering dismal pay rises while those awarded to the youngest workers have gone up by nine times as much
the under - 25s saw their wages rise more than eight times faster than the over- 50s , as they quickly climbed the rungs of the career ladder last year , workers aged 18 to 24 received bumper 10.6 per cent pay rises , falling to 3.8 per cent for people aged 25 to 34 and to 2 per cent for workers aged 36 to 49
for workers aged 50 to 64 , pay rises plunge to a meagre 1.2 per cent , official figures show â significantly below the britain average of 2.1 per cent
the ons revealed in its latest economic review that the under - 25s are five times as likely to have moved jobs in the past three months than workers over- 50
but while younger workers often receive greater pay rises because they move jobs more frequently , official data shows that the gap is widening
in the last three months of 2014 , 5.4 per cent of 18 - 25 - year - olds changed jobs , compared to only 1.2 per cent of 50 - 64 - year - olds experts said the growing gulf between the generations could signal a reluctance by employers to train and promote older members of staff
