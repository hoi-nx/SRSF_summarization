sainsbury 's is set to revolutionise how we do our weekly shop by letting us scan items in our home as they run out
its latest app lets homeowners gradually build up a list of items they need over the course of a week or fortnight , for example
and when that shopper enters a local store , a map will appear on the phone showing the customer where their groceries are to save them time trawling the aisles
the sainsbury 's app is in development and will be trialled in wandsworth later this year
as customers scan their household items , a live pricing tool will show their list with current store prices
