dundee boss paul hartley has warned that mcgowan may not feature in any of the team 's remaining six games this season because he fears playing the troubled midfielder could see him break his police curfew and end up in prison
after his third conviction last week for assaulting a police officer , mcgowan escaped a jail sentence but was placed under a restriction of liberty order and confined to his home from 7pm to 7am for 16 weeks
that has already ruled him out of the evening matches with celtic at dens park on wednesday and at parkhead on friday may 1 , but paul hartley fears that even playing in the three remaining games in the city of discovery , which kick off at 3pm , could leave the player at risk of breaching his order
dundee rogue mcgowan has been handed his third conviction after assaulting a police officer dundee manager paul hartley says he will not risk playing the troubled midfielder again this season paul hartley is worried that if mcgowan was , for example , called up for after - match drug testing , required hospital treatment for an injury or was caught in traffic on the 80 - mile journey back to his home in coatbridge , he would run perilously close to his 7pm curfew
and he admits the only game in which mcgowan would be able to safely feature is the final - day derby at tannadice which kicks off at 12.30pm on may 24 , but even then he may not be risked
' mcgowan is available for selection but there is no guarantee he will play , ' conceded paul hartley yesterday
' mcgowan stays in the central belt so there are times when the journey could take longer than an hour and a half
and the last thing we want to see is mcgowan getting into trouble because he misses his time zone
' mcgowan has been fitted with an electronic tag on his ankle and , if selected by paul hartley , it 's understood the match - day referee would need to inspect the device before each game to ensure there are no health and safety risks
' meanwhile , dundee have agreed a pre-contract to sign aberdeen midfielder nicky on a three - year deal
