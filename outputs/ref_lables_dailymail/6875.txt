runner : a short story about a long run by hawker waiting nervously at the starting line of her first 155 km race around mont blanc , 29 - year - old hawker looked down at her holey long johns , clumpy trail shoes and the poorly fitting rucksack she had borrowed , then up at the elite lycra kit of her fellow competitors
she had entered the 2005 ultra-trail du mont-blanc ( utmb ) on a whim â but now , the reality of the challenge ahead began to sink in
some 26 hours , 51 minutes and 51 seconds later , hawker surprised herself , and everyone else , by becoming the first woman to cross the dark , wet , alpine finish line that year , coming 24th overall
hawker entered the 2005 ultra-trail du mont-blanc ( pictured ) on a whim and she 's since gone on to become britain âs most distinctive female â ultra runner â she would go on to become britain âs most distinctive female â ultra runner â , coming first in the utmb five times , taking gold in the women âs 100km world championships in korea in 2006 , setting a new women âs world record for 24 hours on the road in the 2011 commonwealth championships and a new course record at the sunbaked 246 km spartathlon in 2012
but hawker âs inspirational memoir does not focus on the figures
raised in upminster , east london , hawker says she always felt a profound connection to nature
hawker feels the same about running
but after that first utmb triumph , hawker knew she had found her calling and she renounced the world of employment
though running makes hawker feel â beautifully empowered â , it has left her with â unbeautiful â feet
