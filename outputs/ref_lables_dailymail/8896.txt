a mysterious â warm blob â of water off the west coast of the us could explain why states like california are experiencing their worst ever drought , while the east is battered by freezing weather
the blob in the ocean was discovered last year , with temperatures one to four degrees celsius ( two to seven degrees fahrenheit ) above surrounding â normal â water
and the blob has now extended about 1,000 miles ( 1,600km ) offshore , from new mexico up to alaska , and could herald a warmer summer for some regions
it has been present since 2013 and causing fish to seek shelter elsewhere
and a new university of washington study says it could be responsible for droughts a new study by the university of washington found that a high - pressure ridge could be causing the blob , by trapping heat in the water
in june of last year , the huge patch of water stretched 1,000 miles ( 1,600km ) in each direction , and was 300ft ( 90 metres ) deep
dr bond , a climate scientist at the university of washington , coined the term â the blob â in june
and scientists in california have warned that the region may be experiencing a century - long ' mega-drought '
â in the fall of 2013 and early 2014 we started to notice a big , almost circular mass of water that just did n't cool off as much as it usually did , so by spring of 2014 it was warmer than we had ever seen it for that time of year , â said dr bond
but exactly how this area of warmer water has formed , or how long it will stay , remains a mystery
fish have been spotted in unusual places , supporting recent reports that west coast marine ecosystems are suffering and the food web is being disrupted by warm , less nutrient - rich pacific ocean water
