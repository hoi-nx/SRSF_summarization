eating fast food after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements , a study has claimed
performance remained the same after resting for several hours , while levels of glycogen - used by muscles as â fuel â - were actually slightly higher after fast food was eaten as a recovery food
research led by the university of montana has found that eating fast food ( stock image shown ) after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements
researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise , it did nât matter what food was eaten the research , published in the international journal of sport nutrition and exercise metabolism , was led by university of montana graduate student michael cramer
each meal eaten by the participants was roughly equal in calories , carbohydrates and protein - although the fast food had more sodium and slightly more fat
they were then given meals of either fast food or supplements
two hours after the second meal , all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles on a stationary bike - and performance for all was the same also , levels of glycogen across the two groups were almost the same - with the fast food group being slightly higher
â these data indicate that short - term food options to initiate glycogen resynthesis can include dietary options not typically marketed as sports nutrition products such as fast food menu items , â the researchers wrote
however , the researchers said that the experiment included a fairly small sample , and the long - term effects on workout recovery of eating fast food over other , healthier sources of food are not known .
