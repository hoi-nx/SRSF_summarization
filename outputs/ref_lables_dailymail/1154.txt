all an illusion ? researchers claim that older buildings where hauntings ( illustrated by a stock image ) are usually reported , often have poor air quality from pollutants like toxic mould , which can affect our brains â experiences reported in many hauntings are similar to mental or neurological symptoms reported by individuals exposed to toxic moulds , â said professor shane rogers of clarkson university in potsdam , new york
â psychoactive effects of some fungi are well - known , whereas the effects of others such as indoor moulds are less researched
â reports of psychiatric symptoms including mood swings , hyperactivity , and irrational anger , as well as cognitive impairment are prevalent among those exposed to moulds
brain drain : exposure to the mould can cause mood swings , irrational anger and cognitive impairment , among other problems
a stock image of toxic mould in the firm of stachybotrys chartarum spores , is shown ' ghosts ' tend to be sighted in old buildings , which are often more likely to have damp and mould problems
but spores have been linked with mood swings , hyperactivity , and irrational anger , as well as cognitive impairment
a team of researchers are exploring whether the mould may cause people to think they have seen ghosts , by comparing conditions in ' haunted ' and non-haunted old buildings
â the real ghost busters : here , undergraduate environmental engineering students ( from left to right ) thomas o'rourke and daniel c. schwab work with professor shane rogers to sample air quality in buildings associated with alleged ghost activity the team have only just begun their investigations , but have been to a handful of â haunted â buildings to collect samples , as well as properties with mould , but no connection to ghosts
