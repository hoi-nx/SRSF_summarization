alliss , 84 , has said that legislation designed to stop golf clubs from discriminating against female members has instead prompted a decline in women âs membership
some clubs had previously only allowed female members if they played at restricted times in return for a discounted membership fee
but the equality act , drafted by the previous labour government , ruled that this was illegal discrimination , which means that women must now have equal access to the course â and pay the same membership rates as men
â i âm told the ladies â golf has lost 150,000 members since equality for women came in , â mr alliss told the radio times
â hundreds of women have left golf clubs because they âve gone from paying half fare to full fare
â but sam burton , finance director at the ladies â golf , said there has only been a decline of 30,000 women since the law came into force , taking membership down to 159,000 by last year
â the equality act applies to clubs with mixed memberships
male - only golf clubs are still legal
mr alliss became a professional golfer in 1947 , represented britain in the ryder cup eight times and won 21 tournaments in his career
