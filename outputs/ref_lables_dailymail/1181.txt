since it was revealed that lubitz â the co-pilot who purposefully crashed germanwings flight 9525 , killing 150 people â had been treated for psychiatric illness , a debate has ensued over whether privacy laws regarding medical records should be less strict when it comes to professions that carry special responsibilities
it has been widely argued that germany 's privacy laws were to blame for the tragedy
' similarly , another article published in time said : ' german privacy laws let pilot ' hide ' his illness from employers
' while dirk fischer , german lawmaker and the transport spokesman for the cdu ( cdu ) , called for airlines to have mandatory access to pilots ' medical records , montgomery , president of the german medical association ( bãk ) , disagreed
co-pilot lubitz , who purposefully crashed germanwings flight 9525 , killing 150 people , had been treated for a psychiatric illness , it later emerged
the discovery sparked a debate over whether airlines should be given greater access to pilots ' medical records mr montgomery believes that current laws are appropriate , since aviation doctors are already relieved of their duties of confidentiality if they think a pilot could put other people 's lives at risk
if lubitz 's doctor did not alert germanwings , it must have been because lubitz did not seem like a threat
there are two arguments for why lubitz 's doctor did the right thing by not disclosing lubitz 's depression to his employer
all 150 people on board were killed on impact he argues that confidentiality should be ' far closer to an absolute obligation that it has generally taken to be ' and that doctors should honour confidentiality even in cases where the patient might harm a third party
strict german privacy laws which prevented doctors treating lubitz from telling his airline about his ' suicidal tendencies ' were introduced as a consequence of the nazis
the findings from the investigation have prompted heated debate in germany on a patient 's right to privacy , with chancellor angela merkel proposing an inquiry to re-examine the law
this extends far beyond confidential medical data , however , to stringent protection of someone 's identity , meaning many german publications only referred to lubitz as andreas l , even after his death
in the days before the crash , lubitz searched online both for medical treatments and for ways to commit suicide , which suggests he was undecided as to what to do
furthermore , given the lack of relationship between depression and the pilot 's crime , it was not obviously in the public 's interest to know about lubitz 's depression and morally questionable that his medical history of depression has been exposed so freely
publicly disclosing lubitz 's ailment harms the public trust in doctor - patient confidentiality after death â and it may stigmatise people who are suffering from depression but who would never hurt anyone ( but themselves )
the avoidable deaths of 150 people is a calamity and it makes sense to have a public debate about how to prevent future similar events from happening
along with the crucially important rule of having two people in the cockpit at all times ( which violates nobody 's privacy ) , one medical measure to avoid future catastrophes is to notify employers of stay - home orders from doctors for employees who have high - responsibility jobs without mentioning the cause of the incapacitation
