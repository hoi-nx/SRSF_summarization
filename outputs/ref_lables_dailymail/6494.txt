prince prince , dutiful fellow that he is , has announced that he will be taking six weeks of paternity leave
god willing , his wife the kate will give birth to their next child in a few days â time , at which point the prince , having been excused from training with east anglia air ambulance , will roll up the sleeves of his viyella shirt and tell his beloved as she lies , exhausted , on her maternity hospital bed : â o duchess of my dreams , i am at your beck and call , coiled like a watchspring to hold milk bottles and change nappies until the first week of june â
six weeks ! some of you may find this sweet
he may be a prince of the realm , surrounded by hot - and - cold - running flunkeys , cocooned by the coroneted appurtenances of royal life , but under it all he is a new man , bowing to convention like a willow branch in the flood
how unlike his father , the fogeyish prince charles â who at the time of his engagement to diana , when asked if he was in love , gave a sighing , unromantic answer which included the throwaway phrase â whatever â in love â means â
and so , for the next six weeks , and possibly beyond , the prince will be on domestic parade , quivering to attention at the nursery door somewhere deep inside their stately home , anmer hall , in norfolk , like a guardsman doing sentry duty outside st james âs palace
and yet , at the risk of committing lese - majeste , i must confess that when i heard of the prince âs undertaking i thought ( and continue to think ) : â for god âs sake , man , are you mad ? â i say this , furthermore , as a committed royalist and father of three
' for the next six weeks , and possibly beyond , the prince will be on domestic parade , ' says quentin letts
' quivering to attention at the nursery door somewhere deep inside their stately home , anmer hall , in norfolk ' for your royal highness , i have been there and have glimpsed your immediate future
i have tried paternity leave , albeit briefly
new labour had been in office but a few weeks and the country was in the grip of a mini social revolution that saw the old tory ways washed aside by political correctness
' they knew what no nurse ever seems prepared in public to admit : men in a maternity ward are a flat - footed menace , ' says quentin letts , who says he made it through just a week of his own paternity leave i can claim to have changed claud âs first nappy â i remember the moment vividly , as my wife looked on cluelessly â and i also made myself uncharacteristically useful when , the following morning , the three of us went home
for prince and kate , home is the rather better - appointed anmer , an elegant , georgian spread on the sandringham estate
will prince need to carry the new - born bundle and its baby clobber ( nappy bags , push chair , cot , toys , etc ) down the garden path , as i did ? one suspects there may be staff to do that
once the newborn has been brought home , what is there for the father to do ? feeding the bairn ? my wife opted for breast - feeding
at anmer hall , there will surely be cohorts of nurses and norland - trained nannies on hand to take over from kate when she tires of feeding the little one
we touch here , perhaps , on terrain that will be familiar to prince , whose own ma - in - law , the indomitable middleton , is said to be in the jimmy anderson league of fast bowlers
' once the newborn has been brought home , what is there for the father to do ? ' asks quentin letts mrs middleton , one is told , will be on hand at anmer , once the young royals return to the family pile
a man may love his wife âs mother , and that affection may even sometimes be reciprocated , but that is not to say it is a good idea for him to try to disagree with her when it comes to theories about how to hold a baby , lay it in its cot or bring up wind
burping procedures : is this what search - and - rescue helicopter pilot prince was put on earth to do ? mrs middleton may not be a member of the blood royal but i suspect that if it came to a shoot - out between her and prince over babysitting niceties , she would take the bout with ease
for this is what a man learns while on paternity leave : he is there on sufferance
the early weeks of motherhood lean heavily to the distaff side
a paternity - leave dad such as prince prince has two options : he can stand in the margins of such covens , and possibly disgrace himself by fainting , floored by the nausea of envisaging post-natal undercarriage surgery ; or he can step into the garden ( better still a beer garden ) for some fresh air
prince prince , sir , ignore your press officers and image advisers
