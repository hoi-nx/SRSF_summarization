getting a selfie with a celebrity appears to be the latest craze , but two scuba girls from californian prefer to take their photos with some more colourful creatures
divers margo sanchez and stephanie adamson have been snapping exotic underwater life for nearly a decade
the recent addition of a selfie stick has helped them get incredible shots next to some of the most dangerous sea creatures in the ocean , such as sharks and sting rays
' pipefish selfie ! before the selfie stick , the co-owners of californian - based diving school scuba girls , seldom took pictures of themselves underwater with the animals as the equipment was n't available with the ability to use a gopro camera from an extended vantage point , the diving instructors now take every opportunity they can to take selfies with underwater animals , including eels ( pictured ) now that 's a selfie ! a photograph with a stingray is added to their list in this extraordinary shot the snap happy girls from san diego have an impressive dive history , having travelled to papua new guinea , the maldives and virgin islands
' squid selfie ! ' because we had to stretch out our arm to take the selfie , it was still a challenge getting the surrounding sea life and the photographer in the shot ' stephanie adamson said : ' we have to be very careful and respectful with different sea life
there are some creatures that sting or bite , and some sea life is delicate and can be injured if not treated with caution ' the pair from san diego mount a gopro to the end of their stick to get close to the fish , but remain at a comfortable distance the camera is over here ! the divers aim to first and foremost be respectful to the marine life and not disturb any creatures shark tales ! the divers get a picture perfect shot with a passing shark , which is probably his first selfie !
