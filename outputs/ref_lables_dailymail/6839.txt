sixteen and seventeen year olds should not be allowed to vote in a referendum on britain âs membership of the eu because they have been brainwashed with pro-eu colouring - in books , ukip has said
the party said schoolchildren were being exposed to â propaganda â from brussels in a bid to â catch them young â
it came as ukip was accused of performing yet another u-turn on its immigration policy ukip campaign chief o'flynn accused brussels of feeding ' propaganda ' to young people who could not be trusted to vote in a referendum david cameron has promised to claw back powers from brussels before holding an in - out referendum by the end of 2017
ukip has called for the vote to be held earlier , and today warned under - 18s should not be allowed a say
ukip deputy chairman ukip said : â it 's everything there from colouring - in books on the common agricultural policy for primary school children right up to research projects at university level
â the amount of money that the eu is putting into this propaganda and throughout the entire education system is enormous
â it 's certainly designed to catch people young and feed them propaganda and a very partial view which you know just speaks up to the eu being an unalloyed good thing that we could n't possibly do without
â we âve had many reports from our members of schoolchildren of secondary school age being exposed to overwhelmingly pro-eu views when the matter of the eu is discussed and not really having the eurosceptic case put
â ukip deputy chairman ukip said the amount of money that the eu is ' putting into this propaganda and throughout the entire education system is enormous ' mr oâflynn said the party was â strongly against â lowering the voting age as under - 18s are â too young / to vote
he accused the liberal democrats of trying to â gerrymander â a future in - out referendum after speculation they would demand 16 and 17 - year - olds and eu migrants are given a vote as part of a possible post-election coalition deal
â critics of eu waste have previously condemned a colouring and activity book produced by brussels which promoted the work of bureaucrats and mep at an eu summit in 2013 david cameron held aloft the book promoting the wastefulness of meps ukip was today accused of performing yet another u-turn on its immigration policy after it ruled out setting a net migration target hours after farage said he would like to see the figure reduced to 30,000
â because in the case of 16 and 17 - year - olds they are far more likely to have been exposed recently to very strident pro-eu views and not to have heard the eurosceptic case at all
