city under 18s boss wilcox , whose side take on chelsea in the first leg of the fa youth cup on monday , is aiming to emulate manchester united 's famous class of ' 92
wilcox , himself let go by his current employers as a teenager , could field a starting xi of players all born in manchester for the clash against the favoured opponents from west london
city under 18s manager wilcox wants to deliver local players to the first team wilcox talks with city elite development squad coach patrick vieira ' it could happen again but they were freak years , ' wilcox said
if we can get a group of manchester - born lads into the first team then that 's the ideal scenario
' the first leg will take place under lights at the impressive , newly - opened 7,200 - capacity stadium within the grounds of the Â£ 200m etihad campus , a sprawling complex aimed at kickstarting a conveyor belt of homegrown talent and defying those who claim the club have no interest nurturing growth from within
wilcox believes those facilities , coupled with elite coaching , stand city in good stead when it comes to recruiting talent
wilcox hopes to emulate manchester united 's ' class of 92 ' but says it will be very difficult ' we do n't want local lads playing for tottenham , arsenal or chelsea , ' he said
' will the final , between two clubs often criticised for spending millions of foreign players , be a chance to stick two fingers up to football association chairman dyke , who a year ago described the lack of english talent at city as ' pretty depressing ' ? wilcox does not want to get into that
wilcox believes city 's new etihad campus will stand club in good stead when it comes to recruiting youngsters a look inside one of the gyms at city 's training complex ' we ca nât get embroiled in that because , for us , it âs a day - to - day question of how do we improve players ? ' proposals have already been put forward with regards to home - grown quotas
the bolton youngster , who joined blackburn at 14 , was the only youth product to regularly appear in their jack walker - fuelled premier league triumph in 1995
' wilcox 's arrival at ewood park came after rejection at none other than city
' wilcox was one of the only graduate players to feature regularly for blackburn during title - winning season city manager manuel pellegrini will be at the etihad campus , as will england under 21s chief gareth southgate
things have not gone according to plan for the chilean 's first team this season , but does wilcox believe their struggles have increased the pressure on his youngsters to deliver the club 's only silverware this season ? ' not really , ' he said
' at the start of the year , irrespective of what was happening at first - team level , the fa youth cup was a chance for our players to be put in a situation where they are being put under a bit of pressure and i think it âs great that they are being put under a bit of pressure
