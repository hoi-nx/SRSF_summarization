on friday he expressed a tongue - in - cheek hope that alex will pay but , more pertinently , the current united manager hopes to have some genuine and tangible progress to talk about
the united team he left to david moyes moved only backwards while this season âs version has only occasionally appeared genuinely purposeful under van gaal
united boss louis van gaal revealed he is set to discuss the club with sir alex soon van gaal is preparing his side for saturday 's clash against aston villa as they bid to finish in the top four how the premier league table looks ahead of april 4 now , though , towards the end of this peculiar premier league season , life at the business end of the table has become a little more interesting
successive united victories over tottenham and liverpool have left both those teams listing a little
in second , meanwhile , manchester city , one senses , have stopped looking ahead and started to glance over their shoulder
on saturday , for example , a win for united over aston villa would take van gaal âs team above manchester city , who do nât play until monday night âs engagement at crystal palace
all of a sudden , places two , three and four in the premier league have begun to look rather interchangeable and it âs united who look in decent shape to benefit
â the comments of united legends are always important because they have a lot of fans , â said van gaal on friday when asked about gary neville âs suggestion that the recent united performance at liverpool was one of the best he could remember

on friday , van gaal conceded that it was â mathematically possible â for united to win the league
meanwhile , danny welbeck ( left ) will hoping to continue arsenal 's impressive league form that is a fanciful notion and he knows it but he and everybody else associated with the club would certainly enjoy the sense of discomfort city will undoubtedly feel if they find themselves looking at the backs of united âs heads by the close of play on saturday
