but 11 - month - old babies have already mastered the fundamentals of physics
baby boys and girls were surprised when a ball seemed to disappear through a solid wall
when they were then given the ball to play with , they repeatedly banged it on a table in an apparent attempt to work out its secret
importantly , the babies shown the magic tricks were more interested in playing with the ball than a brand new toy that they had never seen before
babies might be smarter than we had previously thought and can understand complex social situations from the age of just 13 months old
a study by psychologists at the university of missouri has found that infants are able to comprehend what constitutes bullying , friendship and what it means to be a bystander
this , say the us researchers , suggests that babies learn from the unexpected , something that is important in a world in which we are constantly bombarded with information
professor lisa feigenson , of john hopkins university in baltimore , said : â for young learners , the world is an incredibly complex place filled with dynamic stimuli
â when babies are surprised , they learn much better , as though they are taking the occasion to try to figure something out about their world
â the professor studied 11 - month - olds because they were old enough to sit and watch the ball and to pick it up and play with it
a ball was rolled down a slope and apparently passed through a solid wall in one magic trick in the study babies repeatedly droped the car after being shown the magic trick as they attempted to learn what happened however , previous studies have shown that much younger babies and newborn animals have surprising amounts of knowledge about maths and physics , including whether an object should be able to pass through a solid wall
she added : â it âs easy to look at a baby and see a blank slate but actually babies have rich , sophisticated expectations about the world
â after seeing the ball trick babies would bang it on the table more as they attempted to uncover its secrets the graphic above shows the reactions of the babies after seeing magic tricks that defied their expectations the babies in the study were given choices about the toys they would play with after watching a magic trick children who can accurately depict the human form at the age of four are more likely to be brighter in their teenage years , according to a study published last summer
