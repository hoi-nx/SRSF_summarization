all political leaders feel the need to lay bare the details of their private lives
but nigel farage may have taken it too far , with a tv interview in which he discusses his love of skinny - dipping in the icy waters of the english channel as a boy
the 51 - year - old also discussed his battle with testicular cancer , keeping his children out of the public eye and how he plans to go on and on as ukip leader - until 2030
instead he was interview by the tonight programme 's julie etchingham on the seafront at deal , where he grew up
mr nigel farage revealed that as a schoolboy he ' always questioned authority ' he described his childhood of ' youthful excess ' but gave few details
' as a boy he enjoyed more ' freedom ' than children today
' this schoolboy trait has now become part of his political persona
' in the programme , to be broadcast tonight , mr nigel farage also discussed the impact of his father leaving home when he was just five
mr nigel farage resisted the temptation to let the itv cameras into this home , perhaps after ed miliband 's problems with his second kitchen he reflected on his own mortality when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer in his early twenties
well my memory is that i was 21 years old and i had testicular cancer and one of my thoughts through that period was that perhaps i wo nât be able to have children , then having children , first child was a very big moment
' as a hobby , mr nigel farage would go out and collect things , including ' pot lids and bottles and old clay pipes and all sorts of things ' he said that being ukip leader did not necessarily prepare him for the level of interest , and opposition in recent months
' well you see if i got into the conservative party , one of the big parties and became an mp and was on a career path , perhaps you could have anticipated longer term what some of the costs might have been , because this was you know a little rabble army that suddenly became quite a big political party , so it 's , some of it has come as a bit of a surprise yeah
' but he insisted he has no plans to quit , despite suggesting in earlier interviews that he would stand down if he does not win the target seat of thanet south on may 7
' i have decided i will stand down before the 2030 general election , ' he said with a laugh
