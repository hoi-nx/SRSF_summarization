moores found himself in the familiar position of defending his captain on saturday with cook badly needing runs and wins in the last two tests of the series to stop the mood for change in english cricket claiming him as its next victim
england âs failure to win the first test and cook âs failure in both innings leaves the captain in the spotlight
yet moores , under pressure himself after the sacking of paul downton as managing director , remains steadfast in his backing for cook and is adamant he will turn things round in grenada , starting on tuesday , and in barbados
moores has been forced to defend his captain with cook badly needing runs and wins england âs failure to win the first test and cook âs failure in both innings leaves the captain in the spotlight â i âve known lots of people in sport and , in terms of character , cook is one of the strongest , â said moores
cook stands alongside denesh ramdin at the end of match ceremonies during day five of the 1st test match â we can see he âs really hungry to do well again and is playing well but he âs been done by the swinging ball
â it was his first test for a long time and that was always going to be tough but this is a player who has played some brilliant innings for england and he âs got a good chance now to show that he âs still got that ability
cook , chris jordan and jos buttler show their frustration as a chance is missed and game heads to a draw england have also decided to keep adil with them at least for the next week even though yorkshire wanted him to return to them
â the pressure was increased on moores , cook and england by new ecb chairman colin graves â description of west indies as â mediocre â before this series and his promise of an inquiry if they are not defeated
