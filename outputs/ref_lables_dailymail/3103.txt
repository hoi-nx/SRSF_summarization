a widow who was left Â£ 15million by a high - rolling gambler has launched a multi-million pound lawsuit against his family â claiming she is owed up to Â£ 385million more
dellal says her husband jack was worth at least Â£ 400million when he died and the Â£ 15million left to her was an â absurd presentation â of his true wealth
the former beauty queen has launched a high court claim against his relatives , in which she claims the property tycoon must have given away vast chunks of his fortune in secret deals to his family
her late husband , known as â black jack â , was a regular at the gaming tables of casinos in mayfair and monaco and gambled Â£ 1.7million in a single night in 2006
his family dispute his widow âs allegations and the true extent of the tycoon âs wealth will now be scrutinised by the high court , which will assess mrs dellal âs claim that she has been short - changed
mr black jack , who was friends with celebrities including sir mick jagger , was notoriously secretive about his financial dealings but is said to have gambled millions every year , regularly winning or losing up to a Â£ 1million a night
he died in october 2012 , aged 89 , and left his entire estate to mrs dellal , his second wife , with nothing to his six adult children from previous relationships as he said he had already made provisions for them
mrs dellal , a former miss south africa , received Â£ 15.4million and he also put Â£ 20million in a trust fund for their two children , now aged 15 and 12
records of those meetings , revealed to the high court , were said to show mr black jack did not dispute he was worth Â£ 400million
the couple did not divorce , but mrs dellal claims her husband began funnelling huge amounts of money into trusts for his children without her knowledge , and had a Â£ 50million â secret stash â hidden in an account
in his written ruling , high court judge mr justice mostyn said mrs dellal had argued a â strong â case that her husband had access to â very considerable resources â , but said there was little evidence he had given it to his children in secret
they also argued mrs dellal âs wealth meant there was â no prospect â of the court awarding her any more money
grandson : art dealer alex dellal , pictured with his wife elisa and their son jack , is the son of guy she claims her fortune has been â somewhat diminished â recently , although mr black jack âs relatives argued that was down to her own mismanagement
mr justice mostyn said it would be unfair to dismiss mrs dellal âs case without further scrutiny of her late husband âs finances
