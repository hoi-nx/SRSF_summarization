watching osborne enjoy scampi and chips with a glass of cider and a chat with the locals in a somerset pub garden , it is hard to believe that only three years ago he was virtually scared to leave the safety of his treasury office

osborne âs hand ended up drenched in oil
from st austell it was back to somerset and yeovil , where osborne hopes the tory candidate will unseat lib dem laws who was , until two weeks ago , a coalition colleague
