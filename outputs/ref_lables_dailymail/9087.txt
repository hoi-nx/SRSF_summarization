a virulent strain of bird flu continues to hammer the midwestern and the virus recently took its biggest toll yet after it hit a farm in iowa that held nearly 10 percent of the state 's egg - laying chickens
poultry producers and scientists had been hoping warmer weather would knock down the deadly bird flu virus
but the u.s. department of agriculture said monday that the h5n2 bird flu virus had been found at a farm in northwest iowa 's osceola county - prompting a massive bird cull

discovery of the bird flu on an iowa turkey farm has raised serious concerns that the bird killer could find its way into chicken barns in the nation 's top egg - producing state and rapidly decimate the flocks that provide the u.s. with its breakfast staple the confirmation means up to 5.3 million hens there must be destroyed in a state that produces one in every five eggs consumed in the country
seven other midwestern states have also been hit by the virus , dooming nearly 7.8 million turkeys and chickens since march
the virulent strain in question is the h5n2 , a highly contagious virus that kills commercial poultry quickly once it gets into a barn
so far , only two egg operations have been hit â the one in iowa and one in wisconsin
except for a couple of backyard flocks , all the other cases in the midwestern have been at commercial turkey farms
minnesota has had 28 turkey farms hit , far more than any other state

the country 's poultry industry may have to live with a deadly bird flu strain for several years according to the u.s. department of agriculture precautions : most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out , and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in - but is does not always protect poultry from bird flu officials say that 's because minnesota is the top turkey - producing state , and its thousands of lakes and ponds are attractive to migrating ducks and other waterfowl
h5n2 and other highly pathogenic strains have also been found since late last year among wild birds , backyard flocks and commercial farms in some western states and british columbia
however , several precautions have been put in place at farms to control the outbreak and stop the spread of bird flu

while vaccines have been used around the world to protect flocks against various bird flu strains ahead of time , this strain is new to north america
