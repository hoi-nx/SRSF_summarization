james hook claims it will be ' a bonus ' if wales come calling for his services ahead of this year 's world cup
the gloucester fly - half has a golden opportunity to showcase his undisputed ability in friday night 's european challenge cup final against edinburgh
but although 29 - year - old james hook has won 77 test caps , he can reflect on just two starts for wales - against the barbarians and tonga - since the last world cup in 2011
james hook will hope to showcase his ability in the european challenge cup final against edinburgh on friday the gloucester fly - half has n't given up on earning a wales recall ahead of this summer 's world cup given james hook 's quality at fly - half , centre and full - back , it is baffling to the layman that wales head coach gatland can not find room for him in his matchday 23 or wider squads
gareth anscombe is being widely touted as wales ' likely world cup utility back , suggesting that even if james hook makes a 45 - man training squad to be announced in early june , gatland 's final 31 - man cut could prove beyond him
asked about his wales ambitions , james hook said : ' i always hope , but it is out of my hands
' it has probably helped me because i have focused on gloucester and not thought about wales
' james hook , who made his wales debut almost nine years ago and has featured in two world cup campaigns , is philosophical about the current state of play
james hook says first and foremost he is focusing on what he needs to do with club side gloucester ' wales play direct , and i would like to think i could fit into that if needed
' in the past , you think a lot about the world cup as it comes up , but not being in the squad has helped me take my focus off it and i am just enjoying my time with gloucester and not thinking about wales , in a way
it is almost a year to the day since perpignan were relegated from the top 14 - the first time in their 103 - year history they had suffered such an ignominy - and james hook was to sign for gloucester just a month later
' david humphreys ( gloucester rugby director ) has given me that opportunity at fly - half , even when it was not going so well at the beginning of the season
