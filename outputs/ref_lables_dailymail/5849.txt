left on the bench for wednesday night âs home clash with kilmarnock , perhaps uncertain over his place in the starting xi for sunday âs cup semi-final against inverness , the celtic striker scored a 19 - minute hat - trick to guide his team to a handsome 4 - 1 victory
the treble - chasing reigning champions came from a goal down , inspired by kris commons and the second - half introduction of leigh griffiths , to record a win that takes them eight points clear at the top of the scottish premiership â and lifts confidence ahead of their trip to hampden
hat - trick hero leigh griffiths with signed match ball and man of the match award darryl westlake âs wickedly deflected strike early in the second half had given the visitors a shock lead completely against the run of play â only for kris commons to equalise in spectacular , if contested , fashion eight minutes later
as good and important as commons was for celtic , though , even his performance was overshadowed by the arrival of leigh griffiths , who simply exploded on to the scene with three goals of supreme quality in less time than it takes for the average warm down
celtic 's leigh griffiths ( right ) completes his hat - trick against kilmarnock celtic had begun the night with a starting xi looking very much like the team deila might have been thinking about for hampden , all things being equal ; leaving stuart armstrong and gary mackay-steven , both suspended for the semi-final , on the bench suggested that he was giving his cup formation a gentle run out
with lee miller plodding along on his lonesome up front and only the pace of left winger obadeyi carrying even the hint of a threat to the home side , the visitors â doughty in defence but reliably clumsy on the ball â were obviously intent on playing a containing game

substitute leigh griffiths came off the bench to spark celtic into life after lacklustre first - half it did nât take overly long for the crowd , such as it was on a night when empty seats abounded , to grow frustrated by the home team âs inability to get themselves ahead
would set - pieces , of which there were an increasing number , provide a more productive avenue of attack for celtic ? well , big van dijk came fairly close with a flashing header from a kris commons corner
if they were irked by their heroes showing less than perfect concentration in the art of opening up their opposition , kilmarnock âs opener had the home support in uproar when they took a hugely unexpected lead four minutes into the second half

leigh griffiths was thrown into the fray before the game could be restarted , forrest making way as celtic tried to provide guidetti with more support up front
leigh griffiths had been on the park all of six minutes , in fact , when he put celtic ahead , rising to score with a downward header after kris commons had shown excellent skill and vision to drive towards the byeline , beat his man and dig out a cross to the back post
