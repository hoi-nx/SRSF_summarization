diane greenberg , a devout catholic , and her husband bob , who is jewish , decided to split their family down the middle when it came to religion
diane greenberg took charge of her daughter , katie , 24 ; while bob took the reins teaching steven , 21 , as they grew up in new hope , pennsylvania
unusual set - up : steven and katie greenberg , above , were raised in separate faiths - steven jewish and katie catholic katie had a confirmation , attended weekly catholic instruction and remains a committed christian to this day
meanwhile steven was circumcised when he was eight days old , and was given religious lessons in an orthodox hebrew school , nbc 's today show reported
while katie remains christian today , steven is now agnostic
because his mother was not jewish , his father was also unable to arrange a bar mitzvah for him , and admits he was less strict keeping up his religious education than diane greenberg was with katie
' nonetheless , the diane greenberg clan think their unorthodox arrangement has its advantages
' ... we âd go to the jewish side of my family [ on jewish holidays ] and i definitely find comfort in jewish traditions because i grew up with them , but there âs always been a â that âs not my religion " thing
