there is a rich and mildly amusing irony about arsenal fans calling chelsea boring for defending well , when these gooners still celebrate a side that ground out results just to preserve their unbeaten record in 2003 - 04
instead of giving a shallow critique fuelled by sour grapes on chelsea 's title winners , maybe those fans should focus on the shortcomings of their own players , and in particular ozil
ozil has been sublime in recent weeks but he did n't do enough against chelsea on sunday the german , celebrating the fa cup win over reading , needs to start performing to live up to his Â£ 42m tag i 've enjoyed some of ozil 's recent performances , he 's been sublime more than spectacular , but he 's definitely been a joy to watch
and so as i sat down to watch arsenal face chelsea , i felt confident that ozil could be the difference between the two teams
while cesc fabregas was sending a killer pass only for oscar to be wiped out by the goalkeeper ( how is that not a penalty ? ) , and willian carved arsenal up with the pass of the match to gift a great chance to ramires , ozil was tidy , nothing more
cesc fabregas outshone ozil on sunday as chelsea showed why they are ahead of arsenal this season fabregas , who left the emirates pitch with ozil 's shirt , would have been better than the german for arsenal ozil takes on cesar azpilicueta in a game where he was fine , but not good enough to change the result he did n't stand out
and then when he had the chance to be the match winner , ozil completely missed his kick with the goal gaping right in front of him
in the second half chelsea played into ozil 's hands
for all of arsenal 's pivotal , meaningful , must - win games in the last two seasons , ozil has looked average
even in the fa cup final last year it was santi cazorla and aaron ramsey who stood out , while ozil failed to shine , complaining afterwards he was tired after his first season in english football
ozil could go down the same route as juan sebastian veron ( left ) and andriy shevchenko when henry says arsenal need a new spine of their team , it 's time to start listening a player with a huge reputation signed for such a huge amount has to be more than just sublime
two seasons have gone and ozil has failed to do that at arsenal
there are other big signings with big reputations who have flopped in the premier league â andriy shevchenko , fernando torres , juan sebastian veron , and we 're still waiting for the biggest of them all â angel di maria - to show us what he can do
in one of the biggest games of arsenal 's season , ozil missed his kick when a late opportunity came his way arsenal fans are defensive of the germany midfielder but that is merely a sign of their low expectations henry said what all arsenal fans know , but most refuse to admit â fabregas would have had a bigger impact in that team this season than ozil has
there 's a lot of goodwill from arsenal fans towards ozil â they want him to be the hero , they want him to be their superstar
witness this tweet about ozil from arsenal fan @ girlgooner two weeks ago : ' i still ca n't believe he plays for my team arsenal , i think we are very lucky , he 's a very special player
