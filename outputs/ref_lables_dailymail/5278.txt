have you ever panicked about whether you locked the front door , been woken by a facebook notification or desperately needed a phone charger ? to deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies , one company has designed a range of prototype products
you can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product , funded through a kickstarter campaign
they asked groups to design products to deal with common problems
these include forgetting to lock the door , which one company hopes to solve with their forget me lock prototype , shown the products were designed as part of the direct line everyday fix design makeathon
they asked people to pick their top ten â everyday emergencies â - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives
groups from london - based design company makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist
running out of battery on your phone whilst out ( 31 per cent ) 8
forgetting your bank card when paying for an item ( 25 per cent ) * how many people thought this was a problem in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep
to deal with not remembering if you had locked your door , onn studio created the forget me lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door
direct line is running a competition on twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about snooze , forget me lock or nipper
when the key is turned in a lock it swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it âs locked
so a group called instruments designed a product called snooze , shown , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night âs sleep whichever tweet has the most retweets , with the # everydayfix hashtag , by 23 april will go into a kickstarter fundraising campaign and ultimately into development
â through the direct line everyday fix event , we âve been able to extend our role as " fixers " and work with some unique creative talent to produce a fantastic shortlist of exciting prototypes that start to solve the nation âs everyday emergencies , â added john shaw , head of r&d and innovation at direct line
and as another solution to your phone running out of battery , one team designed an app that lets you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies
