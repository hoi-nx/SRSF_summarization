dark tourism is on the rise , with perhaps the best example of such a phenomenon being the ever - increasing interest in chernobyl as a holiday destination
april 26 , 2016 marks the 30th anniversary of the explosion , which was one of the worst nuclear accidents that the world has ever seen
in recent years , visits to the nuclear explosion site have increased exponentially , with kiev - based tour company , soloeast , estimating that it takes approximately 10,000 tourists there each year
the exclusion zone , a nearly 50kilometre ( 31 - mile ) radius of contamination , runs around the power plant , although levels have now returned to those which are safe for brief visits to the area
however , such visitations are highly regulated and permitted only as part of an organised private tour
however , visits to the 50 - kilometre exclusion zone , a contamination radius guarded by security , are highly regulated several private tour companies offer packages to the exclusion zone , which in some cases even include overnight stays guests must provide documentation at several check points upon reaching the site via tour bus
once inside , visitors are banned from touching any objects or digesting any food that does not come from outside the zone however , day trips - and even overnight stays - are permitted , now that radiation levels have decreased in the years since the disaster , despite still being up to 10 times higher than normal levels
while the city of pripyat , which was located just 3 km away from the reactor , remains empty to this day , some people do live in the nearby town of chernobyl , which is about 15 km from the site
soloeast travel , a kiev - based tour operator , offers multi-day trips that include overnight stays at a cottage about 50 km from the site ' there are no new hotels inside the exclusion zone , ' soloeast travel director , ivanchuk , tells mailonline travel
' despite the ban on all non-essential workers from living in the zone , wildlife in the area - including foxes - has been thriving dark tourism , a term first coined in 1996 at glasgow caledonian university , is defined as any visit to sites that are traditionally association with death and tragedy
chernobyl is one of the world 's most famous ' dark tourism ' sites and is especially popular among photographers the once affluent town was also home to a funfair , which , following the evacuation , has since been overgrown with weeds the town of pripyat and its ruins are favoured by photographers because of the soviet aesthetic and surrounding area 's untouched nature the fukushima site , the scene of the worst nuclear disaster since chernobyl , has also recently become a tourist attraction
while there are a number of abandoned villages in and around the zone , most popular site to visit is the ghost town of pripyat , which offers a breathtaking snapshot of a soviet city circa the 1980s
a relatively affluent town prior to the explosion , pripyat was home to a newly - built amusement park , blocks of apartment complexes , and even a movie theatre
