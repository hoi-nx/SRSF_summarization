the idea that your tongue is separated into â zones â for different tastes has been widely debunked - although the exact process taking place is still poorly understood
but now , for the first time , scientists have created a live imaging map of the tongue 's taste buds to determine what happens each time we place food in our mouths
it reveals how taste buds have different cells that are used to differentiate between between the five basic groups of flavours
a harvard - led study has mapped taste buds on a tongue for the first time
scientists examined the different cells used to identify taste and watched these cells capture and process molecules live
penguins lost three of the five basic vertebrate tastes - sweet , bitter and the savoury , meaty taste known as umami - more than 20 million years ago and never regained them , researchers have found
â we 've watched live taste cells capture and process molecules with different tastes , â said biomedical engineer dr lee , from anu
there are more than 2,000 taste buds on the human tongue , which can distinguish at least five tastes : salty , sweet , sour , bitter and umami - a word used to describe smooth and typically savoury , meaty sensations
interestingly , the results showed that taste cells respond not only to molecules contacting the surface of the tongue , but also to molecules in the blood circulation
the tongue is shown here , with taste buds in blue , among yellow papillae , or small bumps in the tongue 's tissue using a method called intravital multiphoton microscopy , the scientists were able to pick out individual taste cells within each taste bud
â the team now hopes to develop an experiment to monitor the brain while imaging the tongue to track the full process of taste sensation
