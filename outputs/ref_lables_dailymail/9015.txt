defense attorneys released some of the training records saturday for a 73 - year - old volunteer sheriff 's deputy charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of an unarmed suspect in oklahoma
the records for bates include certificates showing what training he received , job evaluation reports and weapons training and qualification records dating to 2008
bates ' attorneys said the 64 pages of information include records bates , of tulsa , copied and kept for himself
although there are time gaps in the documents provided , some of the records seem to indicate bates was proficient in firearms and dozens of other training courses
the reserve deputy appeared on the today show on friday ' for the first time today , we feel like someone 's starting to look at the other side of this as far as his qualifications , ' wood , an attorney for bates , said after the documents were released
bates has said he mistakenly pulled out a handgun rather than a stun gun when he fatally shot eric harris on april 2 as he lay on the ground
he has been charged with second - degree manslaughter
' the interview comes just days after bates turned himself in to face charges of second - degree manslaughter
bates also stood up and demonstrated where he keeps his taser on his body - slightly below his chest - compared to where he keeps his gun - on his lower right - hand side near his pants pocket
' the interview follows reports that bates , a millionaire insurance broker , had been allowed to ' play cop ' after he donated pricey equipment to the department - a claim he called ' unbelievably unfair '
the tulsa volunteer deputy disputed earlier this week a tulsa world report that sheriff 's office supervisors were ordered to falsify his training records

eric harris ' family attorney â who had questioned bates ' qualifications as a reserve deputy â did not return a message seeking comment saturday
a call to the district attorney 's office rang unanswered , and the sheriff 's office referred questions to wood
charged : eric harris ( pictured left ) died from his injuries and bates ( right in his mug shot ) has been charged with second - degree manslaughter
he faces four years in prison if he is convicted confusion : an image shows a taser and a handgun similar to the weapons bates was carrying
he mistakenly thought he was holding a taser , not his handgun , when he fatally shot eric harris bates is classified by the sheriff 's office as an ' advanced reserve '
but the sources who spoke to tulsa world claimed that the reserve deputy was not properly trained to be an armed deputy , despite sheriff stanley glanz saying otherwise
indeed , sheriff glanz and bates ' own legal team have repeatedly produced records which they claim prove he was an ' advanced reserve ' and had undergone 480 hours training
however , when asked to produced proof that bates was certified to use three weapons , including the revolver he fired at eric harris , the sheriff 's office say they have been unable to find the paperwork
