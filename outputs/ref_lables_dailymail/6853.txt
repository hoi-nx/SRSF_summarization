in this day and age , everything is personalised - from alarm clocks that measure your perfect amount of sleep to fashion brands that use social media to connect with each individual customer
the newest generation of beauty products will be personalised to meet all your particular needs - from bespoke mascaras and eyeliners to foundations and powders unique to you
at eyeko 's bespoke in london 's harvey nichols , which launched earlier this month , customers can choose between dozens of brush shapes - from thick wands for a dramatic sixties look to skinnier ones for lengthened , separated lashes
beauty brands have long promised customised foundation , but finding that perfect shade and texture is easier said than done
cover fx custom cover drops ( Â£ 36 ) can be mixed with any of your favourite moisturizers , oils , serums or other foundations to create your preferred texture and finish it 's not just make - up that is increasingly becoming tailored to your personal needs
not only are beauty brands creating more and more customised products , but shops and department stores are also taking note of the bespoke trend by launching services to help customers create their own blends
customers who book a complimentary appointment meet with a beauty adviser , whose mission it is to seek out your ideal lipstick , fragrance or skincare , with no bias towards particular brands
according to daniela rinaldi , group beauty buying director at harvey nichols , bespoke products are most certainly the future of beauty - and customisation is only going to get bigger
' i think the one size fits all concept just simply does nât cater to customers â individual needs at all times anymore , ' she explained
