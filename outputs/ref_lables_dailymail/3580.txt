clothing that features slogans joking about stalking has been slammed by the suzy lamplugh trust , a london - based charity which aims to ' make society a safer place '
a number of online retailers stock the offending garments , which feature phrases such as ' i heart my stalker ' and ' some people call it stalking
i call it love ! ' according to the slt , the t - shirts mock a serious issue which affects one in six women , and play into people 's fear of being laughed at , which prevents victims from seeking help to deal with stalkers and puts them at a higher risk of being attacked
