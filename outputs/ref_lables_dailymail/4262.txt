president obama threw off the gloves and took a direct punch at one of his possible successors , likely republican presidential candidate walker , in an interview airing this morning
responding to walker 's claims that he 'd ' absolutely ' cancel or ' disown ' a deal with iran on ' day one ' if elected to higher office , obama told npr morning edition host steve inskeep that such an approach ' would be foolish
walker fired back at obama on twitter , saying , ' americans would be better served by a president who spent more time working with governors & congress rather than attacking them
the current administration has been more willing to weigh in , however , when a presumed republican candidate threatens to dismantle one of the president 's prized domestic or foreign policies , which , in the case of walker , was the nuclear arrangement with iran
' i am confident that any president who gets elected will be knowledgeable enough about foreign policy and knowledgeable enough about the traditions and precedents of presidential power that they wo n't start calling to question the capacity of the executive branch of the americans to enter into agreements with other countries , ' obama told inskeep during their monday afternoon chat following the npr morning edition host 's invocation of walker 's past comments
a cadre of probable republican presidential contenders have spoken out against the obama administration 's laboriously negotiated pact with iran to stunt the growth of the country 's program
walker is the only one to say he would not honor his predecessor 's deal with iran and the international community if elevated to presidency , however
obama was responding to walker 's claims that he 'd ' absolutely ' cancel or ' disown ' a deal with iran on ' day one ' if elected to higher office
walker is currently the governor of wisconsin swatting walker away : obama takes part in the white house easter egg roll on the south lawn , which included a spot of tennis ' we 're now in a position where iran has agreed to unprecedented inspections and verifications of its program , providing assurances that it is peaceful in nature , ' he told npr morning edition , touting the accord that representatives of his administration and five other countries reached with iran
' and if iran does n't change its behavior , obama said the americans will ' still have the options available to me - or available to a future president that i have available to me right now
already a fissure between the americans ' and iran on sanctions - the americans will only commit to gradual relief that can be ' snapped back ' into place while iran is taking the stance that restrictions should be removed immediately and permanently in exchange for nuclear concessions - has emerged since the countries announced the preliminary agreement last thursday
obama told npr morning edition his administration still is n't sure it ' can button down ' all the issues standing in the way of a long - term agreement and it will have to ' work very hard in order to complete a deal
' and while he characterized israel prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's demand that a final deal force iran to recognize his country 's right to exist as a ' fundamental misjudgment ' of the political waters , obama noted that one of the most ' profound ' differences between americans and iran ' is the vile , anti-semitic statements that have often come out of the highest levels of the iran regime
' shifting to the topic of cuba briefly , obama confirmed that he was considering removing the latin american country from the americans ' list of countries that sponsor terrorism
