bbc programmes are set to move online as part of a new ' internet first ' strategy designed to compete with web services such as netflix and amazon
corporation bosses fear they could be losing younger viewers who are used to watching video online rather than through their tvs , and are promoting digital services in a bid to tackle the problem
but the revelation could spark controversy over the future of the licence fee , because viewers are currently able to use the bbc 's online services without paying for them
going digital : popular tv shows such as poldark could one day be migrating to the web as part of bbc plans to become an ' internet first ' broadcaster postgate , the bbc 's chief technology officer , said in an interview that the corporation needs to remain ' relevant ' to a new generation of viewers
he added that traditional media groups such as the bbc would have to ' learn lessons ' if they want to ' compete with organisations that were born in the digital age ' , which are not tied to the methods used to produce broadcast tv
hit : strictly come dancing is another popular bbc show which could be affected by the ' internet first ' plan popular : but shows such as eastenders , pictured , have lost viewers thanks to the rise of the internet the rise of catch - up tv , as well as the proliferation of digital services , has caused audiences to shrink dramatically - for example , the remake of poldark starring aidan turner attracted 6.9million viewers for its first episode , less than half the number who tuned in to the original series 40 years ago
postgate was appointed the bbc 's chief technology officer on a salary of Â£ 225,000 - more than the prime minister - in july last year
he was previously head of bbc research and development , working on digital projects including high - definition internet broadcasts
the strategy was designed to streamline all the bbc 's online services and give its staff access to the corporation 's whole archive at once , but it collapsed in 2013
technology chief john linwood was sacked over the fiasco , but last year he successfully sued the bbc for unfair dismissal
the move could herald a new wave of services moving to the internet - but mr postgate insisted that other channels will remain on broadcast tv for the time being , saying : ' bbc three was a brand that you could move from one platform to another relatively easily
' mr postgate also predicted that more and more bbc services will be consumed via mobile phones and tablet computers rather than on traditional channels
future : the bbc has increasingly been promoting its services on digital platforms such as iplayer figures released in november showed that children spend half as much time as adults watching ordinary broadcast tv , but much more time watching online video
if the trend continues , the television licence fee could be under threat as viewers opt out of the Â£ 145.50 payment and watch online instead
mps recently called for the licence fee to be amended so that viewers who only use catch - up services will have to pay it
my role is to make sure that the bbc âs technologies that underpin everything we do - from our newsroom infrastructure and new in - the - field production and editing tools , to how we keep the bbc on air and online - are set up in the best possible way , and take advantage of new internet - based technologies
