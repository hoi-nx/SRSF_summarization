a britain nuclear submarine suffered Â£ 500,000 damage in a collision while tracking russian vessels , the mail on sunday can reveal a britain nuclear submarine suffered Â£ 500,000 damage in a collision while tracking russian vessels , the mail on sunday can reveal
the 5,300 - ton hms talent limped back to port with a huge dent and will be out of action for several months
last night , defence officials refused to disclose exact details of the crash â including where or when it happened â but they were adamant that hms talent struck â floating ice â rather than a russian sub
royal navy sources say the damage to the nuclear - powered submarine , which will cost as estimated Â£ 500,000 to repair , is consistent with striking an object while trying to surface
after the crash , engineers from hms talent âs 130 - strong crew found that the impact had devastated the submarine âs outer layer of acoustic tiles
these square - shaped 2in - thick tiles minimise the vessel âs transmission of sound waves and other signals that could reveal her position
the royal navy âs explanation that hms talent struck ice was also used to explain damage to britain submarines during the cold war which was later found to have been caused by enemy vessels
hms talent , which was launched in 1988 , is a â hunter - killer â submarine used to attack ships and other submarines , and also to perform a surveillance role
on this occasion some damage was sustained by hms talent
hms talent âs captain , helmsman and her officers will have been making multiple calculations simultaneously and working in very testing conditions
a royal navy spokesman said : â hms talent suffered minor superficial damage after striking some floating ice last year
