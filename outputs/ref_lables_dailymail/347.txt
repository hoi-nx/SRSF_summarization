the obama administration stepped up its lobbying campaign on capitol hill today to try to persuade lawmakers not to pass any legislation that could hamper prospects for negotiating a final deal with iran to curb its nuclear program
administration officials as high up the rung as the president himself last week made calls to more than 130 federal lawmakers , urging them to support the deal secretary of state kerry negotiated with iran , and , at the very least , not to meddle in foreign affairs
' with the newly returned lawmakers scheduled to tomorrow take the first in a series of votes setting the perimeters for a deal , the white house said administration officials would hold classified briefings with members of congress aimed at ' helping ' them understand ' commitments iran has made so far , and how those commitments we hope will be finalized hopefully in the next two months
the trio , along with secretary of state kerry and senior members of the intelligence community are this week lobbying members of congress and jewish community leaders to support the nuclear pact with iran opposition : senate foreign affairs chairman corker , pictured here last friday at the national rifle association 's annual conference , is whipping support for a bill that would give congress a say on a potential deal aimed at keeping tehran from developing a nuclear weapon
the white house ' strongly ' opposes it a senate panel is set to vote tomorrow on an intensely debated bill authored by senate foreign affairs chairman corker that would give congress a say on a potential deal aimed at keeping tehran from developing a nuclear weapon
on the white house side , majority leader kevin mccarthy said today that he will bring the bill to the floor if the senate acts on legislation giving congress the power to review any deal
' it 's my intention to bring it to the floor of the white house and move it , ' kevin mccarthy said at a news conference as congress was returning from its spring break
' under the bill , obama could unilaterally lift or ease any sanctions that were imposed on iran through presidential executive means
during that 60 - day period , congress could hold hearings and approve , disapprove or take no action on any final nuclear agreement with iran
this week administration officials , including ernest moniz , are holding classified briefings with members of congress aimed at ' helping ' them understand ' commitments iran has made so far , and how those commitments we hope will be finalized hopefully in the next two months ' on the other hand , if congress passed a joint resolution disapproving it , obama would be blocked from providing iran with any relief from congressional sanctions
the white house has said the president will ' absolutely ' veto the corker legislation if it comes to his desk not just because it would allow congress to thrust itself into the deal - making process but also because it would require iran to renounce its terrorist activities
after a reporter asked him about kevin mccarthy 's claim that he is close to achieving a veto - proof majority of support for the bill in the white house , earnest said , ' it 's his responsibility to count votes , ' then snarked , ' i do n't think anybody 's battin ' 1000 when it comes to countin votes up there
energy secretary ernest moniz , treasury secretary jack lew and senior officials in the intelligence community were also holding classified briefings monday and tuesday with members of the white house and senate
' on the white house side , majority leader kevin mccarthy said today that he will bring the corker bill to the floor if the senate acts on legislation giving congress the power to review any deal at the white house , obama today met with jewish leaders in a separate attempt to woo their support for the shaky deal that appeared last week to be coming apart at the seams as iran leaders indicated that they would n't sign an accord unless it included the immediate lifting of nuclear - related sanctions - something the global community has said it can not and will not agree to
obama and national security adviser susan rice are meeting with leaders of jewish organizations such as the american jewish committee and the anti-defamation league , as well as other ' influencers , ' the white house
the bill giving congress the power of review has led to a political tug of war on capitol hill , with republicans trying to raise the bar so high that a final deal might be impossible , and democrats aiming to give the white house more room to negotiate with tehran
