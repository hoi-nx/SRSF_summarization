' although mrs mary was petite , rockwell wanted ' rosie the riveter ' to show strength , so he used artistic licence to make her arms , hands and shoulders bigger
mrs mary said people in arlington did n't make too much of a fuss about her being in the rosie the riveter painting , aside from teasing her a little about rosie the riveter 's big arms
rockwell 's painting is not to be confused with the equally iconic ' we can do it ! ' , wartime poster , often also referred to as rosie the riveter
