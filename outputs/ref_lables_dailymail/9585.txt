a measure proposed to the oregon legislature would require all new or replacement dryers to operate at a noise level no louder than 84 decibels , about as loud as a school cafeteria
( file photo ) it also would n't allow hand dryers blowing air downwards to blow air faster than 115 mph , in case the hand - dryer manufacturer does n't label the decibel level
bill sponsor democratic sen. chris edwards told the senate committee on business and transportation that the new generation of hand dryers used to elicit episodes in his autistic son , who would cry and cover his ears when he heard them
it 's not the hand - dryer motor that 's too loud , chris edwards said , it 's the ' air knife ' against the hand that can cause a sharp , shrill sound
