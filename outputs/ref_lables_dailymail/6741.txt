wayne rooney believes united team - mate fellaini has gone from old trafford scapegoat to one of the most dangerous forwards in europe
fellaini was one of the stars of united 's manchester derby demolition of neighbours city on sunday and was recently described as almost undroppable by manager louis van gaal
now wayne rooney has revealed his admiration for the former everton forward , saying : ' he is getting used in the right way
fellaini has enjoyed an upturn in fortunes in recent week at united ' we like to play out from the back and if teams are pressing us then we have him as an option
' he is probably the best in world football at bringing the ball down and getting us out of that pressure and further up the pitch
he is being used in the right way by the manager and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances
' fellaini was signed from everton by van gaal 's predecessor david moyes in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player
wayne rooney hailed his belgian team - mate as one of the best in world football at the moment fellaini has proved a handful for defences and was instrumental in wins over city and liverpool now the belgian has emerged as a potent attacking weapon under van gaal , used as a second striker behind wayne rooney
on sunday , city could n't cope with him just as liverpool had suffered at his hands at anfield three weeks earlier
' last year was awful for him but in fairness he kept his head down worked hard and come through that tough period , ' reflected wayne rooney
' he is showing now what he did at everton and why united bought him
' it was tough for him but he had the whole team 's support
' fellaini wheels away after heading in at the far post to beat joe hart and give united the lead in the derby united are now in third place in the barclays premier league after six league wins in a row
' we said earlier on in the season that we were working on things and it was going to take time , ' added wayne rooney
' we are in a good run of form and have beaten some good teams
louis van gaal suggested that fellaini is almost undroppable at the moment and hailed his rebirth ' they are top of the league and it is always tough at stamford bridge
