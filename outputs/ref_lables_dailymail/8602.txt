her neighbour âs leylandii hedge stands 40ft tall and , says audrey alexander , has left parts of her garden in deep shade
despite a 35 - year fight to get the trees cut down to size , the council has ruled they can stay
it is the final defeat in a battle that involved two generations of mrs audrey alexander âs family
it kicked off 35 years ago when mrs audrey alexander âs aunt found her vegetable patch at the property would not grow anything worth eating because of the leylandii
a row between neighbours over a 40ft high leylandii hedge ( pictured ) has finally come to and end after 35 years the battle between the neighbouring properties started in 1980 when the owner planted a vegetable patch which withered and died in the shade of her neighbour 's massive hedge then , 23 years ago , single mother mrs audrey alexander bought the house and asked her neighbour robinson to trim the hedge
â the dispute rumbled on , with mrs audrey alexander , 54 , claiming that the trees knocked Â£ 20,000 off the value of her property
stirling council has finally ruled that the hedge can stay , despite claims it has knocked Â£ 20,000 off the value of neighbour audrey alexander 's house ( pictured ) the situation came to a head in 2008 , when a 65ft section of hedge is said to have fallen and demolished a neighbour 's garden shed audrey alexander ( pictured ) also claims other neighbours have had to move their children from their bedrooms at night for fear of the falling branches but her council has ruled that mrs robinson can keep the hedge , although it has to be cut to 20ft
the high hedge act 2013 allows neighbours to complain to the council when a hedgerow blocks sunlight from reaching their garden
the local authority can either issue a high hedge notice , which orders owners to cut the hedge back , or decide not to act
ms audrey alexander called in council to try to solve the quarrel , but no solution could be found and the feud continued the council ruled that the hedge should be cut to about 20ft , a height which ms audrey alexander claims will still block most of her sunlight
