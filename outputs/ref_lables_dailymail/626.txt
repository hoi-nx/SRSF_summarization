a coroner has questioned the lack of swimming in the national curriculum after rony john , 15 , drowned on the first day of his summer holidays a coroner has raised concerns over the lack of swimming lessons included in the national curriculum after a 15 - year - old drowned in a river on the first day of his summer holidays
rony john , 15 , died after jumping into the river great ouse in hartford , cambridgeshire , despite being unable to swim
at an inquest into his death , the coroner said she would now write to government chiefs to ask why swimming is not included in secondary school education
the hearing heard that swimming is compulsory during primary school but is not enforced for those aged 11 or over
assistant cambridgeshire coroner belinda cheney said : ' swimming is not a difficult skill to learn yet it is a critical life skill
' the hearing heard how rony john was with friends on the bank of the river in july last year when he dived into the water
but an inquest heard how rony john was swept away by the current and would have died within four minutes of jumping into the water
the hearing , which took place in huntingdon , cambridgeshire , heard how rony john came to britain from india in 2012 and did not know how to swim
just weeks after rony john 's death , the school also cancelled swimming lessons for all older pupils
after the hearing , mr christopher bennet said : ' rony john came to school at the beginning of year eight
the teenager was swimming with friends in the great river ouse at hatford , cambridgeshire in july last year firefighters were on the scene within ten minutes and his friends also tried to bring rony john to safety , but the young man could not be saved ' pupils of his age were entitled to six half - an - hour lessons a year and we know that for all of the lessons that took place he was in school
' we had to cancel lessons for secondary school pupils because of the cost and it would be beneficial to have extra provisions for those students
