president obama has ordered the release of 22 drug dealers - including eight who were serving life sentences
nearly all of the offenders who obama granted clemency to were convicted of dealing addictive , hard drugs like crack cocaine , methamphetamine and heroin
eight of those whose sentences were commuted - an act the white house said continues obama 's push to make the justice system fairer - were serving terms of life in prison
the effort is aimed at reducing harsh sentences for those who faced outdated guidelines at their time of sentencing and would be serving shorter punishments had they been convicted today
obama has granted clemency to 22 drug offenders who were sentenced under outdated guidelines in december , mr obama issued his first round of commutations under new guidelines that were put in place to cut costs by reducing the growing prison population and grant leniency to nonviolent drug offenders sentenced to years long terms of confinement away from society
eggleston , the white house counsel , said many of the 22 people whose federal sentences will be cut short by mr obama 's action would already have served their time and paid the debt they owed society had they been sentenced under current laws and policies
' because many were convicted under an outdated sentencing regime , they served years - in some cases more than a decade - longer than individuals convicted today of the same crime , ' mr eggleston said in a post on the white house blog
mr eggleston said tuesday 's commutations underscore obama 's ' commitment to using all the tools at his disposal to bring greater fairness and equity to our justice system
' mr obama has now approved a total of 43 commutations during more than six years in office
mr eggleston noted that obama 's predecessor , george w. bush , had commuted 11 sentences during his two terms
