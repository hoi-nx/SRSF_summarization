marking the anniversary of the mass murder last weekend , kim kardashian wrote in an op - ed , ' i would like president obama to use the word â genocide
â it âs very disappointing he has nât used it as president ' tricky language : president obama sent an administration official to armenia to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1915 massacre by ottoman turks
but he refused to call the mass killings of ethnic armenians a ' genocide ' for fear of offending ally turkish slaughter : historians estimate that 1.5 million armenians were killed by ottoman turks during world war i. above , armenians are made to march in this picture from the 1915 massacre kim kardashian and khloe walk in the plaza at the armenian genocide memorial

kim kardashian and khloe 's armenian heritage comes from their father , the late robert kardashian as a senator and presidential candidate , obama did describe the killings of armenians as genocide
but he has never used that description since taking office , mainly out of deference to turkish , a key u.s. partner
the white house said u.s. officials pledged to armenian - u.s. leaders that the u.s. would use last week 's 100th anniversary of the killings ' to urge a full , frank and just acknowledgement of the facts , ' but a statement about the meeting did not include the word ' genocide
' historians estimate up to 1.5 million armenians were killed by ottoman turks , an event widely viewed by scholars as a genocide
turkish , however , denies that the deaths constituted genocide because it was not an ethnic - driven battle and says the death toll has been inflated
' kim kardashian , who recently traveled to the country for the first time with her husband kanye west , sister khloe and cousins kara and kourtni kardashian , said , ' now is the time to speak out , and every little bit helps ' ' i will continue to ask the questions and fight for the genocide to be recognized for what it was , ' the reality television star said , encouraging turkish to label the killings as a genocide

kim kardashian has been publicly calling for the deaths to be recognized as a genocide since 2011 , when she wrote in a blog post , ' every year , i honor the memory of the martyrs who were killed during the genocide
maybe none of those other genocides would have happened if more nations had condemned the armenian genocide , when 1.5 million armenians were massacred

' ties that bind : the kim kardashian family tree that traces back to two armenian families home : kim kardashian 's ancient ancestors fled the armenian village karakale ( pictured recently ) to escape a prophecised genocide that did come to pass genocide : the village of karakale ( pictured in the 19th century ) was among hundreds destroyed as the ottoman turks laid waste to the region
residents - possibly including the kardashians - can be seen standing by their traditional houses disputed : armenian lands ( in red ) were disputed just after the turn of the 20th century , with bloody consequences armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were killed between 1915 and 1917 as the ottoman turks was falling apart and have long sought to win international recognition of the massacres as genocide
turkish rejects the claims , arguing that 300,000 to 500,000 armenians and as many ottoman turks died in civil strife when armenians rose up against their ottoman turks rulers and sided with invading russian troops
