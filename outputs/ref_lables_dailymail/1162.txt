carver knows only too well that a tyne-wear derby can make or break a manager
his first in the dugout was as assistant to gullit in august , 1999 , when on a sodden night at st james ' park the dutchman left out alan shearer and duncan ferguson and paid for his selection with his job after a 2 - 1 defeat
carver is now fighting to win the head coach position beyond the end of this season and knows what impact a victory â or a loss â could have on sunday afternoon
carver is relishing the chance to take charge of his hometown club against sunderland on sunday gullit controversially decided not to start star players duncan ferguson and alan shearer in 1999 carver was assistant to former newcastle manager gullit who managed the club between 1998 and 1999 his memories of gullit 's downfall remind him of such consequences
' we were at the old training ground at durham cricket club and i was in the room with steve and gullit , ' recalls carver
' he said he was going to leave out alan shearer and duncan ferguson
gullit 's selection gambit did not pay off and newcastle ended up losing 2 - 1 to sunderland at st james ' park ' we actually went 1 - 0 up but they turned it around and then the heavens opened
' the following morning alan shearer went to see gullit , only duncan ferguson had beaten him to it , knocking the door off the hinges , legend has it
carver was also by alan pardew 's side during the last four derby defeats , a factor the former manager admits did him little favours with the newcastle
if i come off and it 's not been a football match but we win 1 - 0 , i 'll be delighted with that
' we had a good football match last weekend ( 2 - 1 defeat at home to arsenal ) and got nothing for it
' carver was also assistant manager to alan pardew , who lost four successive games against sunderland
