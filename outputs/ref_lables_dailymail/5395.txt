the ukip leader was booed by voters at westminster 's central hall as he faced claims he blamed all of british 's problems on migrants
nigel farage today insisted he did not ' lose my rag ' after rounding on the audience of a live tv debate for being too left wing mr nigel farage , pictured today , risked alienating those watching at westminster 's central hall in london as he protested they were ' a remarkable audience even by the left - wing standards of the bbc ' the bbc stressed that the audience was carefully selected by an process , but mr nigel farage said something had gone ' wrong ' with the process
' he said his protest had been sparked by the hostile audience reaction to his argument that high levels of immigration were increasing pressure on the housing market , something he said would be accepted by ' most rational people '
the night of the by - election that douglas carswell won in clacton with a landslide , there was a ukip representative - patrick o'flynn - on question time in clacton and the audience were deeply hostile to him
' asked if he blamed the bbc , mr nigel farage said : ' sometimes these things go wrong , sometimes you get groups who apply to be on programmes who perhaps are n't as truthful on their applications as they could be
' in this case , the bbc gave the job to a polling company called icm who are famous for getting everything about ukip wrong and that i think was the mistake
' mr nigel farage 's outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching independent pollsters icm were hired by the bbc to select the audience of around 250 people
after facing stiff criticism from ukip , the firm today released a statement on how it chose the audience members
icm added : ' the recruitment approach replicated those used by icm at all the 2010 leader debates , both the nick clegg vs nigel farage debates last year , and the recent itv debate
' mr nigel farage was widely considered to have won the debates against nick clegg last year , after which the ukip leader made no complaint about the audience composition
mr nigel farage was taken aback , and attacked a ' total lack of comprehension ' from those watching and protested they were ' a remarkable audience even by the left - wing standards of the bbc '
his outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching
mr miliband said told mr nigel farage : ' you abuse immigrants and those with hiv and then you complain that ukip is being abused
' but mr nigel farage claimed the audience was biased against him : ' there just seems to be a total lack of comprehension on this panel , and indeed amongst this audience , which is a remarkable audience even by the left - wing standards of the bbc
' mr nigel farage was heckled by members of the audience before david dimbleby , who was presenting the broadcast on bbc1 , intervened to say : ' nigel farage , let me just say one thing
' this is an audience that has been carefully chosen not by the bbc , but by an independent polling organisation to represent the balance between all parties
' labour leader miliband gave the ukip leader the advice : ' it 's never a great idea to attack the audience , nigel farage , in my opinion
' explanation : mr nigel farage was heckled before david dimbleby ( pictured ) , who was presenting the broadcast on bbc1 , intervened to say how the audience had been chosen the bbc insists the audience was carefully selected by an independent pollster , but mr nigel farage said something had gone ' wrong ' with the process unimpressed : ukip voter cripps , 44 a ukip voter has insisted he is having second thoughts about backing the party after nigel farage attacked the studio audience
security worker cripps , 44 , of bromley , south - east london , believed the ukip leader had ' done a couple of stupid things '
asked if mr nigel farage 's remarks had put him off supporting ukip , mr cripps said : ' it did a bit , yeah
' the bbc insisted the audience had been chosen by an independent polling organisation to reflect the supporters of all parties - not just those represented by their leaders last night
asked after the debate about mr nigel farage 's criticism of the audience , ukip deputy leader nuttall said : ' i am not sure whether we will complain
' asked if adopting an attack on the audience was an easy get out clause for dismissing opposition to ukip 's views , he added : ' oh no. people at home agree with us and that 's what really matters - the millions of people at home watching this
nigel farage having a go at the bbc audience may well appeal to the viewers whose vote he is targeting
' as the end credits rolled following the bbc debate last night , four of the five party leaders shook hands with each other - but mr nigel farage just drank from a glass of water from behind his stand
as miss bennett and miss wood walked away , miss sturgeon then went to shake mr nigel farage 's hand - and mr miliband offered the ukip leader a pat on the back
left alone : as the end credits rolled following the bbc debate last night , four of the five party leaders shook hands with each other - but mr nigel farage ( right ) just drank from a glass of water from behind his stand all of the leaders went to the audience to shake their hands - with the exception , again , of mr nigel farage
