charlotte watts argues that stress drain nutrients from the body , meaning it shows up in some surprising ways
these seven symptoms are an indicator you are stressed , warns nutritionist charlotte watts
below , she recommends the best foods to get rid of each one writing for the healthista website , she said : ' periods of stress use up nutrients more quickly
' as a result , some symptoms associated with vitamin or mineral deficiencies can also be a warning sign of the deeper , long - term effects of chronic stress
here , in an extract from her new book - the de-stress effect : rebalance your body âs systems for vibrant health and happiness - she reveals seven surprising signs of stress and what to eat to replenish lost nutrients ... cracks at the side of the mouth what âs causing it ? need for vitamin b6 those unpleasant little sore fissures we can get at the corners of the lips are a sure sign that b vitamin status is low and particularly b6
b vitamins are important for the health of the nervous system and are needed to get energy from the carbohydrates , fats and proteins that we eat , so we use them up during the energy - rich stress response
cracks at the side of the mouth are a sign the body is low on b6 important for the nervous system , b6 is involved in the production of the neurotransmitters ( brain chemicals ) serotonin and dopamine that regulate mood and motivation and also melatonin , that governs sleep , so we also see these suffer when stress is prolonged
food sources : carrots , chicken , eggs , fish , meat , peas , spinach , sunflower seeds , walnuts , avocados , bananas , beans , broccoli , brown rice , whole grains , cabbage , corn and potatoes jaw grinding what âs causing it ? need for vitamin b5 another b vitamin , b5 is often referred to as the anti-stress vitamin , as it helps with the production of adrenal hormones , cholesterol and immune antibodies , all of which have a higher turnover during the stress response
note here that this cholesterol production is not all â bad â , we need it to produce new cells and the steroid hormones like cortisol and dhea that are part of the stress response
long - term stress often shows up as jaw clamping and teeth grinding , partly as tensing muscles around the face increases brain alertness , which the body senses it needs to deal with danger , but it is also associated with lowered levels of b5
this vitamin is also needed for production of the memory neurotransmitter acetylcholine , which also calms us down after stress has past

citrus fruits are a rich source of vitamin c. if the body is deficient in this nutrient some people suffer bleeding gums and bruise easily a very mild form of this can be seen in easy bruising and bleeding gums when brushing teeth , signs we are probably using up vitamin c very quickly in the stress response
food sources : berries , citrus fruits , green vegetables , asparagus , avocados , broccoli , brussels sprouts , cantaloupe , kale , mangos , onions , papayas , green peas , pineapple , radishes , spinach , strawberries , tomatoes and watercresss hard pimples at the top of arms and thighs hard spots at the top of the thighs and arms reveal a vitamin e deficiency what âs causing it ? need for vitamin e follicular keratosis is also associated with lowered vitamin a levels , as it is also a fat - soluble antioxidant and works with vitamin vitamin e another nutrient that can contribute to easy bruising , vitamin e is a fat - soluble antioxidant that protects fatty body areas and is needed for fertility â the meaning of the greek word tocopherol , its chemical name
increasing vitamin a - found in fish liver oils can help replenish the body when you have trouble shifting colds and they commonly move to the chest and throat , increasing levels through plenty of greens and ( if you eat ) high - quality organic meat can help , in a stew helps deliver the nutrients efficiently and hydrate tissues at the same time
