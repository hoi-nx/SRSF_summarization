you might know that h20 is the chemical formula for water , but what about the chemistry of you ? dr joe hanson , a science writer and biologist based in austin , texas , pondered this very question and now has calculated what the human body is in terms of chemical elements
he revealed that a ' human molecule ' might contain 375 million atoms of hydrogen , 132 million atoms of oxygen and 85 million atoms of carbon
by comparison , this human molecule contains just one atom of cobalt and three molecules of the metal molybdenum
the full list of elements that dr joe hanson says would be found in a human molecule if such a thing existed - each set of letters represent a chemical element and the numbers are the proporation of atoms in each ' molecule ' dr joe hanson claims his formula , however , only represents the chemical make up of the human body at birth
dr joe hanson said : ' out of 98 naturally occurring elements , just over 30 are known to be essential to some form of life on earth
' dr joe hanson , who created the video for the it 's okay to be smart pbs channel on youtube , also calculated that the average human body has the equivalent of 16kg ( 35lbs ) of carbon in it and enough oxygen to fill a volume equivalent to 6 elephants
he said the human body also contained enough hydrogen to fill the volume of a blue whale and the same amount of nitrogen as is found in 400 litres of urine
but the human body may also be a source of revenue for those who think it is worth the effort
if the average person was to cut off all their tails and toenails , they could extract a nugget of gold worth around a tenth of a us cent ( one sixteenth of a penny ) , according to dr joe hanson
if you isolated all of the elements in your body into their pure form , the ingredients for one life would fetch around one to two thousands dollars on the open market
' biologist dr joe hanson has worked out what the human body would look like as a chemical formula ( above ) the average adult human body contains around 16kg ( 35lbs ) of carbon
