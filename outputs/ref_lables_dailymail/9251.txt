he fell down a 160ft cliff after trying to find his parents police are still trying to piece together the tragic sequence of events , but they believe the little boy was killed instantly in the fall on friday after leaving the marked ski slope to look for his family
investigators are unsure how he came to be at the top of the steep 320ft - high cliff , which overshadows the flaine
one theory is that he wandered away from a blue run to try to find his family , while there has also been speculation that he may have fallen off one of the ski resort 's lifts
