imagine if raheem sterling had actually done something wrong
imagine if he had not turned up for training
imagine if he had refused to play
imagine if he had gone on strike
imagine , even , if he had asked for a transfer away from liverpool
imagine the opprobrium that would have been heaped upon him then
he has been called avaricious , capricious , disloyal and impressionable
raheem sterling âs ability has been questioned and his contribution to liverpool has been mocked
raheem sterling winces during liverpool 's 4 - 1 defeat at arsenal to complete a tough week for the 20 - year - old rodgers takes a deep breath as he watches his side succumb to their worst defeat of the season raheem sterling is fouled by hector bellerin as liverpool earn a penalty which was converted by jordan henderson ok , so he has not signed the lucrative new contract that the club have put in front of him
he gave an interview to the bbc that he had not cleared with the club
it amounted to a softly - spoken plea for time and space
raheem sterling is not the kind of person to shout the odds
that âs not what liverpool fans want to hear but it happens
for what it âs worth , i hope raheem sterling stays at anfield
i hope that sooner or later , he signs that new contract , or perhaps an improved version of it
at this stage of his career , leaving liverpool is fraught with unnecessary risks
liverpool are a great club and they are on the rise again
they are staffed by good , intelligent , forward - thinking football people
and i ca nât think of any better manager than rodgers under whom sterling should continue the process of maturing into one of europe âs best players
the 20 - year - old gave an interview to the bbc on wednesday , giving his opinion on a variety of matters rodgers called the interview ' a mistake ' and shakes hands with his protege the day after its airing raheem sterling 's agent aidy ward is pictured sat next to saido berahino ( centre ) at old trafford but none of that means i have nât found the virulence of the reaction to raheem sterling âs refusal to sign immediately on the dotted line somewhat startling
we talk about loyalty in football as if it is a one - way street
we only apply it to footballers , not to clubs
clubs generally have very little loyalty to players
they treat them as commodities
they pay the players well when they are worth something to them
for the club owners , for the men who pay the wages , the relationship with a player is a business transaction
rodgers remains confident that raheem sterling will stay and the situation will be resolved in the summer it âs about money
and it âs that way at liverpool , too
we expect hard - headed business sense from the clubs but we demand that any nod to rationality is cast away when it comes to the time when players make decisions about their future
â raheem sterling is fully entitled to make his own mind up , â gary lineker wrote on twitter
i hope raheem sterling stays at liverpool but if he asks for time to think before he commits himself , it is absurdly unjust that he should be pilloried for it
english football might have plenty of problems but the loyalty of its supporters is not one of them .
