an american company claims to have invented a ' teabag ' that can turn an ordinary pint of lager into a craft beer the same way hot water is turned into brew the hop theory ' beer - bag ' contains a blend of hops , fruit peels and natural spices , and promises to turn light beer into craft after just two minutes of steeping
however , despite nearly reaching its crowd - funding target , the project has been criticised by professional breweries as being misleading about what constitutes as ' craft beer '
light beer is cost effective and low in calories but lacks flavour , and with hop theory , an average beer becomes craft
' williamson of independent brewery cheddar ales in somerset , england , is sceptical to the idea of ' tea bag ' beer
' firstly , adding hops , flavouring herbs , peels during the brewing process is about stabilizing those ingredients to make them safe for consumption
' new drink : after a short infusion of two minutes , the blend of hops , dried fruit and spices will have changed the taste of a lighter lager into that on par with a craft beer new ideas : the relativity blend contains dried and ground orange peel , cascade hops and ground coriander seeds , and is set to hit the market this summer ms williamson adds that the claim that the hop theory sachets can make a lager taste like a craft beer could also ' mislead people '
' their words are echoed by durham atkinson , owner of london craft beer pub and brewery hops & glory
' in all honesty , i am not convinced that the attention to the brewing process in craft beer can be outdone in a sachet
' reusable : each sachet can be used in up to four beers , so keeps both costs and calories down guide : a graphic from mr gattuso 's kickstarter campaign describes how to use the hop theory sachets hop theory 's first blend relativity contains dried and ground orange peel , cascade hops and ground coriander seeds , with another four blends planned for this year - raspberry , pumpkin , double ipa and peach
each 5g hop theory sachet can transfuse up to four beers , so one bag could keep the drinker going for a session at the pub. the first infusion will take between two and four minutes , but once the bag is wet , any further uses will only take about 30 seconds to transfuse , mr gattuso says
' hop theory is here to add customisation to the beer industry
