broadcaster smith has once again taken a controversial stance on domestic violence on espn 's first take
nine months after smith received a one - week suspension for claiming women can play a role in provoking men into violence , smith tried to to claim that boxer floyd mayweather 's career should be looked at separate from his domestic violence history
when co-host cari champion said she had an issue with floyd mayweather 's domestic violence history , smith said that was because she 's a woman and ' should feel that way floyd mayweather has been convicted twice for domestic violence , according to the new york post
' what makes me uncomfortable is that they 're also lumping all of this other stuff that floyd mayweather allegedly has done to say , " well , you know what ? look at how much of a bad guy he is " , ' smith told cari champion and skip bayless on april 8
' champion jumped in , saying : ' i definitely have an issue with his domestic - violence record , but i also have an issue with how he treats women period outside the ring
' smith stuck with his words , claiming that cari champion only holds the position she has because she is a woman
when i 'm talking about mayweather-pacquiao , i 'm thinking about two dudes strictly in the boxing ring
