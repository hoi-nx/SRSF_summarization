the number plate that got clarkson and his former top gear colleagues harangued out of argentinian was a direct reference to the falklands war , a judge has ruled
a village of falklands war veterans targeted the team as they drove through patagonia , with clarkson claiming in one account that they stormed their hotel
they were accused of deliberately inciting conflict with the plate , an alleged reference to the 1982 falklands war
investigating whether this was illegal , mrs barrionuevo said : ' it should be understood that it is not up to me to investigate or evaluate the decision - arrogant and disrepectful to say the least - by the top gear production team to enter the country with one or more malvinas - referenced number plates
clarkson ( pictured this week ) said an angry mob targeted the top gear team in their hotel
his producer , wilman ( right ) , who announced his resignation on wednesday , denied deliberately using the plate ' my responsibility is to analyse whether a crime has been committed under argentinian law in relation to the removal from the porsche of the original number plate fkl and its replacement by another
they abandoned the cars in argentinian to flee the country clarkson , 55 , and co-hosts hammond and james may fled argentinian with a police escort after being told to leave the country as angry falklands war veterans threatened to kill him
the number plate that sparked calls for a full criminal probe - hi vae - was found on the battered porsche which was attacked by a furious mob after it was left at the side of the road
a local councillor in ushuaia later claimed the digits 269 on the number plate of the ford mustang hammond had driven were close to the 255 british killed during the war - and the numbers 646 on james may âs lotus could be taken as a reference to the 649 argentinian casualties
the furore sparked a diplomatic incident with argentinian âs ambassador alicia castro calling the fkl plate ' malicious mockery ' of those who fought in the 1982 falklands war
they were spotted in london on thursday with hammond and james may , entering clarkson âs home before leaving together for a drink at a local pub. hammond , 45 , has joined may in confirming he will not return to top gear following clarkson 's sacking , insisting yesterday / on friday he had no plan to ' quit my mates
