two property developers branded ' arrogant and greedy ' by a judge have been jailed after a three - storey building collapsed trapping three people in the rubble
a doctor 's wife and a student plunged from the living rooms of their flats into the basement below and a workman was buried after a digger struck a load - bearing column
the accident left three victims hospitalised with minor injuries , while 20 students were left homeless and one of sheffield 's main arterial roads was closed for a day
jailing brothers naveed and rizwan for 12 months each today , judge murphy told them : ' it was only by the grace of god or good fortune that people were not seriously injured or killed
' if a member of the public had been passing by they would have said " how on earth was no - one killed in that ? " there was potential for a complete disaster
' before : students and a doctor and his wife lived above the retail premises in sheffield until the 2013 incident
three people were injured and the building 's collapse caused the main road to be closed off after : but the building was left looking like it had been hit by a bomb after botched work by landlords naveed and rizwan , who were jailed for health and safety offences today officers from the hse spent two years and Â£ 150,000 investigating the collapse and bringing the defendants to justice for what was called a ' flagrant disregard ' of hse regulations
rizwan , who managed the shop in the building , and naveed , the landlord of the flats above , were hoping to extend and reopen a former indian restaurant on the site
lawrence , prosecuting , said the flats above the retail premises were occupied by sheffield university students as well as a doctor and his wife
a builder and a structural engineer were consulted over plans to lower the floor level and make the restaurant open - plan but the brothers then dispensed with their services
although a planning application was submitted , permission had not been grantedwhen construction work on the restaurant started about four weeks before the collapse in march 2013
the student tenants complained about cracks in their walls and noise from drilling and machinery but rizwan told them the restaurant would be open within four months and he would offer them jobs there
naveed brought in an excavator and began removing rubble with the help of an odd - job man while rizwan instructed other workmen
doctor 's wife khushboo shah was sat on the sofa in her lounge
she fell on the rubble and was covered in dust as well as being struck by falling pieces of wood
' david webster for naveed , a father - of - four who was convicted last year of unlawfully evicting a tenant , said the work was not ' wholly cavalier ' from the outset but a measure of cost - cutting overtook prudence
now builders are trying to completely re-build the premises after huge disruption caused by the accident the court heard the father - of - seven had taken out a Â£ 488,000 bridging loan on the restaurant project guaranteed by properties belonging to his brother and was currently working as a chef
judge murphy told the brothers that their breaches of the regulations were ' blatant and financially motivated '
