the splatters of blood on the checklist for the very first american spacewalk were from an astronaut as he frantically battled to close the hatch door of the spacecraft after a historic venture
but the gemini 4 mission of june 1965 ultimately proved successfully , and paved the way to astronauts walking on the moon for the first time four years later
a complete 13 - page checklist , including a bloodstained document seen at the front ) , from the gemini 4 mission in june 1965 is tipped to sell for a huge Â£ 80,000 ( $ 120,000 )
the list shows the various steps the astronauts had to go through when opening and closing the hatch to space gemini 4 launched from cape canaveral in florida on 3 june 1965 with two astronauts on board
the two astronauts on the gemini 4 mission were jim mcdivitt and white
nasa 's two - man gemini spacecraft spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule 's orbit , remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft
they orbited earth 66 times over four days and , on the first day , white donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule
it 's thought one of them cut their hand or finger on the hatch locking mechanism and their blood ended up on the checklist after they removed their gloves while safely inside
had the pair not been able to lock the hatch after themselves , they would n't have been able to re-enter earth 's atmosphere and would have been lost in space

the spacewalk checklist for the gemini 4 mission of 1965 belonged to jim mcdivitt who gave it to a friend after signing it many years ago
cassandra hatton , of auctioneers bonhams which is selling the item , said : ' the gemini 4 mission was the first time [ an american ] walked in space and it was a huge step in the development of the space programme
