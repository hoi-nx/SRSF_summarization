mercedes motorsport boss wolff has revealed the team may have to make ' an unpopular call ' for their drivers in light of ferrari 's revival this season
wolff 's remark also comes in the wake of nico rosberg 's moaning over the team radio during sunday 's chinese grand prix about how slow team - mate lewis hamilton was driving
wolff ( left ) says nico rosberg ( right ) and lewis hamilton will have to deal with some ' unpopular calls ' nico rosberg then turned on lewis hamilton during the post-race press conference , accusing the world champion of being selfish
lewis hamilton insisted he was merely looking after his tyres to ensure they lasted during the crucial middle stint of the race , with the 30 - year - old exonerated of any wrongdoing by wolff and mercedes non-executive chairman niki lauda
but wolff has confirmed that with pressure from ferrari , rather than his drivers simply allowed to fight it out between themselves as was the case last season , there may be decisions taken on the pit wall during a race that could anger one or the other
the british driver won the chinese grand prix but has come under fire from his mercedes team - mate ' it may be if we are risking a win against ferrari we would make an unpopular call , not to freeze everything , but manage them more , ' wolff said
ferrari and sebastian vettel have proved surprise tough competition in the race for the championship ' i can understand why teams in the past have done it because they were under threat of losing a championship
