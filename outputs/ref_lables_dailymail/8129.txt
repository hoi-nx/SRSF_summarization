' a family tragedy ' : bavishi in khartoum the joint director of the safe deposit company robbed in the Â£ 60million hatton garden gem heist said yesterday that he believes it was an inside job
bavishi , who lives in sudan , said detectives have asked to put some â sensitive â questions to his uk - based son who runs the business , including whether he suspects someone connected to the company or other firms in the same premises had links with criminal gangs
and he said the robbers almost certainly had some inside information because they appeared to know that several cctv cameras in the building where his firm is based were not working when they broke in
speaking for the first time about the crime mr bavishi , 69 , also told of his fury at police for ignoring an alert from a state of the art alarm in the vault while the gang were forcing their way into 72 safe deposit boxes during the easter holiday
mr bavishi is a joint director of hatton garden safe deposit with eldest son manish , who lives in kenton , north - west london , and usually runs the business full - time
but when the robbery happened manish , 38 , was on a month - long holiday with his wife and child in sudan
mr bavisihi said robbers almost certainly had some inside information it is estimated that anything from Â£ 60million to Â£ 200million of jewellery and cash was removed from the company âs vaults in london âs diamond district
mr bavishi was in china on unrelated business when news broke about the robbery , but rushed back to sudan to be with his eldest son who was himself frantically trying to arrange a return from khartoum to the uk with his family , which took several days
he said : â the police called manish on his phone in sudan to tell him what happened and said we want you to come back to london because there are sensitive issues we want to talk to you about
the police want to know from manish if he suspects someone inside who could have contact with a gang
mr bavishi said : â there must be suspicion on everyone who worked in that building
â it is estimated that anything from Â£ 60million to Â£ 200million of jewellery and cash was removed from the company âs vaults in london âs diamond district over the easter weekend the robbers set off an intruder alarm just after midnight on good friday and the southern monitoring alarm company contacted the metropolitan police âs central communications command
â it is incredible that the police did not act on this , â said mr bavishi
