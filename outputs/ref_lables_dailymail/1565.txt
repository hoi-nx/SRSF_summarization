the liverpool street hotel in london used to be bedlam , but not through cavalier management , rebellious staff or disruptive guests
the victorian building that houses it is built on the site of english âs first hospital for the mentally ill - the bethlehem hospital , which opened in 1247 and was often pronounced as â bedlam â
fast forward a few centuries and in its place is a swanky , celebrity - baiting boutique hotel with 267 rooms - four of which have been decorated by trendy artists
and instead of mental health patients , it 's the likes of beyonce , lil kim and lady gaga that stay here these days
silence is golden : step into the andaz liverpool street lobby and you 're in a world of hushed swankery star guests : the likes of lady gaga ( right ) and beyonce ( left ) are fans of the andaz liverpool street historic : andaz liverpool street is built on the site of english 's first hospital for the mentally ill the striking thing about walking into the lobby is just how serene it is
despite its proximity to one of the country âs busiest railway stations and the frenetic bishopsgate road , the foyer is a place of almost temple - like peacefulness , as if hermetically sealed from the outside
the check - in system is very apple store
the vibe in this large king room is minimalist chic , with two distinctive red eames chairs and a sleek wooden desk with jacob jacobsen lamp
but we âve chosen it for a certain bespoke flourish , for this is one of four rooms in the andaz which has been decorated by trendy artists
art of the matter : mailonline stays in the andaz 's quirky one day walk room , which features a huge mural by patrick vale and davis big draw : patrick vale ( right ) and davis ( left ) put the finishing touches on their amazing one day walk picture creative : the pearly room - also king - sized - features a flamboyant piece of art by chris price easel does it : internationally renowned british artist patrick morgan reveals his andaz street art room - the day the flower rose multi-disciplinary english artists ilovedust âs east my dust street art room will also appeal to those who fancy a quirky twist to their stay one day walk is a celebration of the hotel âs east side locale , documenting a nine - hour walk the artists took that began with breakfast at st john bread and wine and wound its way past st paul âs cathedral , hawksmoor church , brick lane and columbia road , of flower - market fame
delightful design : the andaz liverpool street features a knowing nod to new york 's guggenheim museum suite deal : the andaz also contains bigger rooms with a living - room set - up there is also an ipod dock , which would have been spiffing â¦ if we had ipods
the andaz should really invest in some bluetooth - capable sound systems as mobile phones tend to be the portable music system of choice these days
the andaz has made the business of sauntering around inside all the more pleasant by dispersing a zesty fragrance through diffusers and , i 'm told , courtesy of housekeeping staff armed with sprays
it 's called ' darjeeling ' and was created specifically for the hotel by a company called t london , which claims it ' relaxes and renews '
a highlight is the soaring six - storey - high atrium and a winning nod to the guggenheim museum built into the ' spine ' of the hotel that joins the old part with a newer section
guests looking up as they walk to the lifts in the foyer will notice the walkways above have been sculpted to imitate the new york museum âs world - famous spiral design
masons began using it again for meetings when it was uncovered and while it 's not open to guests , this ornate room can be hired by the public , with wine tastings and wedding receptions popular bookings
today it is available for hire flaming brilliant : once a month the andaz hosts a candle - lit dinner in its 1901 restaurant tasty : the standard of cooking at the andaz is stunning and the setting truly relaxing food , glorious food : the presentation of the dishes at 1901 is stunning
pictured is a crab starter casual : breakfast and brunch is served at the andaz 's eastway cafe , where the atmosphere is more informal brute of a breakfast : the full english option at eastway will satisfy the hungriest of customers dinner at the andaz , in its 1901 restaurant , is truly an experience to savour
the setting is enhanced because it 's 1901 âs candlelight dinner night which takes place on the last wednesday of every month
brunch the next day in the hotel 's eastway diner is far more casual , but memorable all the same
it 's delicious but i feel anchored to my seat , so it 's time to abandon the tranquillity of the andaz and follow in the footsteps of vale and davis through the streets of the east end to walk it off
