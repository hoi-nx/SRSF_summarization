defence minister andrews has failed to name the leader of terrorist organisation the islamic state on the same day the federal government announced they would be sending more than 300 australian troops to iraq
australian soldiers are embarking on a two - year mission in iraq , but will be spending it ' behind the wire ' not engaging in combat , mr andrews said
' abu bakr al-baghdadi is leader of notorious terrorist organisation islamic state , which is wrestling to take power in syria and iraq sales continued , saying given the u.s. government had a $ 10 million bounty on his head , she was ' surprised ' he could n't name the terrorist leader
earlier that day , the prime minister announced australian troops would return to iraq with the aim to provide iraq security forces with the skills and training to defend their country , to degrade and ultimately defeat the forces of islamic state or daesh
mr andrews said australian troops would not accompany the iraq forces they train into battle
mr andrews was appearing on 7.30 following the federal government 's announcement 330 troops would be leaving for iraq this is a stark contrast with deployments over the past decade when troops conducted sweeping patrols across southern iraq , occasionally contacting insurgent forces
prime minister abbott announced on tuesday his cabinet had given the go - ahead for deployment of task force taji , 330 australian and 100 new zealand troops to train iraq soldiers for the next two years
mr andrews said 5,000 iraq troops had already been trained by four international training missions .
