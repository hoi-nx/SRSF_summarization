the wild oats project by rinaldi at the age of 42 , san francisco - based journalist rinaldi believed she had accidentally succeeded in conceiving a longed - for child
the pregnancy test turned out to be wrong , but her husband scott was nât taking any more chances : he got a vasectomy
rinaldi âs response was to demand an open marriage and bed 12 strangers in as many months
she âs now written a graphic , tell - all memoir about that year and its very messy fallout
rinaldi ( pictured ) demanded an open marriage from her husband , scott after he had a vasectomy when they met , 17 years earlier , rinaldi was nât sure she wanted kids
as her biological clock began ticking louder , though , a child came to embody the solution to all sorts of problems
it would strengthen their marriage of opposites , help her finally overcome a troubled childhood as the daughter of an alcoholic bookie and give her life a sense of purpose
her husband , meanwhile , was adamantly against it from the start
after his vasectomy , rinaldi âs discontent settles onto her failure to sleep around when she was single
instead of ending her marriage , she strikes a bargain that seems to give her the best of both worlds
during the week , rinaldi lives in a rented studio , free to have as much casual sex as she likes
she picks up men on business trips , places â good girl seeks experience â ads online and , eventually , gravitates to an urban sex commune , where very hands - on orgasmic meditation is practised twice daily
reading about her wild oats project , it âs hard to know what âs more astonishing â that scott ever agreed to this 5:2 open marriage or that rinaldi thought it could possibly solve anything
full disclosure : some years ago , i published a memoir about my own year - long experiment â with chastity
afterwards , several people told me i should write a follow - up in which i did the exact opposite
i assumed they were joking , but that âs more or less precisely what rinaldi has done
â hmmm , â she says , after being given technique tips by a 23 - year - old she âs just slept with
later , when rinaldi âs year is up and she finds herself back living full - time with scott , trying to patch up their â you guessed it â deeply fractured intimacy , it âs an email from alden that finally derails everything
in fact , rinaldi seems able to define herself solely in relation to her fertility and her allure to men
