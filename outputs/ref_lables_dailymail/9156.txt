whether it is through sir bradley wiggins , geraint thomas or ian stannard , ireland 's classics king sean kelly believes the time has come for team sky to break their duck in one of cycling 's monuments
with the two major cobbled classics - the tour of flanders and roubaix - looming large over the next two weekends , it is time to see the early results of sir dave brailsford 's move to put more emphasis on the monument in his second five - year plan for team sky
british bradley wiggins competes during the the wevelgem one day cycling race on march 29 the shift in emphasis has already paid dividends in the early part of the season , with ian stannard defending his title at omloop het nieuwsblad , team sky 's third victory in the belgian race , while geraint thomas last week won e3 harelbeke - a key warm - up for this weekend 's tour of flanders
sean kelly , whose record of nine monument wins puts him in a tie for third all - time , likes what he sees from team sky as the big races approach
but the development of ian stannard and geraint thomas gives team sky two in - house contenders , while wiggins raised eyebrows with his ninth - placed finish in roubaix last year and he vowed to return
ian stannard ( 3rd from front ) rides in the wevelgem one - day cycling race on march 29 injuries to classics specialists cancellara ( trek factory ) and boonen ( etixx-quickstep ) - although the latter may return in time for roubaix - add to the impression that team sky 's best chance may be now
' without cancellara , without boonen , it 's going to be a more open race , ' said sean kelly , who will commentate on both the tour of flanders and roubaix for eurosport
geraint thomas is certainly in there , ian stannard is maybe a little bit under his best after his crash ( in the first monument , milan-san remo on march 22 ) but can come back , and then of course there is wiggins
' of the three , wiggins is yet to show the sort of form this season which suggests he can win roubaix , but sean kelly is not counting the 2012 tour de france winner out , saying a monument win to add to his tour of flanders and world time trial success would elevate wiggins to ' another level '
