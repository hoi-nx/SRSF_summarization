murray reckons a supposedly easier run - in can swing second place hibs ' way ahead of rangers in the last month of the scottish championship season
dumbarton boss murray believes that rangers will struggle to maintain their pace through the run - in rangers - currently level on points but having played a game less - still have two matches to play against title winners hearts , including sunday 's match at ibrox , while the leith side take on their city rivals just once more
hibs : april 4 queen of the south ( h ) ; april 8 dumbarton ( a ) ; april 12 hearts ( h ) ; april 22 livingston ( a ) ; april 25 alloa ( h ) ; may 2 falkirk ( a ) rangers : april 5 hearts ( h ) ; april 9 queen of the south ( a ) ; april 12 raith ( h ) ; april 15 livingston ( a ) ; april 18 dumbarton ( a ) ; april 25 falkirk ( h ) ; may 2 hearts ( a ) ' rangers got a good result against cowdenbeath last saturday to keep themselves in contention and i think it 's going to be close but i still believe hibs have the easier run - in , ' said murray
' they do have tough games as well including one against hearts and if they 're serious about finishing second , they need to beat the likes of ourselves and queen of the south at easter road this saturday
' but the fact rangers play hearts twice and one of those games is on the final day of the season does n't help them
' hibs were favourites to finish second for a while after they beat rangers 4 - 0 at easter road then 2 - 0 at ibrox and because of the lack of form rangers were showing
murray 's dumbarton team are virtually assured of a place in next year 's second tier thanks to a 14 - point lead over second - bottom cowdenbeath and could become mathematically safe this weekend after they play jimmy nicholl 's strugglers on saturday
' we still have to go to queen of the south and we 've got rangers and hibs at home so we 've got games that are meaningful for others
