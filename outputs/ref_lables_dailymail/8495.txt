she might be a new mother to twins but that did n't prevent a fresh - faced charlene from cutting a glamorous figure as she presented a sports prize this morning
among the big names celebrating with novak djokovic , albeit from a distance , were actors benedict cumberbatch and henry cavill and model karolina kurkova
while benedict cumberbatch , who was hosting the main event , and 31 - year - old henry cavill have no clear links to sport , charlene 's own sporting pedigree is impeccable
glamorous gathering : the 37 - year - old royal cut an elegant figure during the presentation ceremony sporting pedigree : charlene has an impressive sporting pedigree of her own and was an olympic swimmer chuffed : mr novak djokovic looked suitably thrilled with his sportsman of the year award she went on to compete in the 2000 olympics but narrowly missed out on the 2008 event after spending 18 months out with shoulder injury
