it is exactly a year since sportsmail revealed that moyes was getting the sack at manchester united , the club deciding to take action as soon as a defeat at everton meant champions league qualification was no longer possible
into his shoes stepped an entirely different character , the supremely confident louis van gaal
one year on , joe bernstein looks at which man has coped best in the crucial areas of the job , with the pressure of trying to continue sir alex ferguson 's success at old trafford weighing heavily
moyes waved goodbye to manchester united exactly a year ago after a dismal run of results louis van gaal has propelled manchester united back into the top four , despite an up - and - down season results for moyes to take a team that had won the premier league title by 11 points into seventh place was an unmitigated disaster , even if he coped well with his first champions league campaign and reached the quarter - finals
manchester united lost seven of their 19 league games at old trafford â unacceptable
under louis van gaal , manchester united have already won more league points than they did last season and there are still five matches left
under moyes , manchester united lost 3 - 0 at home to their biggest rivals liverpool and manchester city
moyes 4/10 ; van gaal 7/10 manchester united reflect on another low point last season after champions league defeat against bayern munich there is a different vibe around old trafford now , as seen in the 4 - 1 win over manchester city this month performances neither manager plays the same way as alex ferguson , whose response when lesser teams came to old trafford was to try and overwhelm them with attacking play , based on the use of wingers
moyes is a more cautious manager , prioritising his defence and it left manchester united fans chanting : ' come on moyes , play like alex ferguson 's boys '
under moyes , manchester united looked great in some away games , particularly hitting newcastle for four at st james ' park
manchester united got lucky at arsenal and southampton earlier in the season , but the showing in the manchester derby a fortnight ago was a lot more vibrant
moyes 5/10 ; van gaal 6/10 mata scored twice as manchester united enjoyed a 4 - 0 win at newcastle , a rare good show under moyes robin van persie 's double helped manchester united scrape a lucky win at southampton in december decisions moyes got himself into a pickle before he 'd even started by appearing ambiguous over whether he was a robin van persie man or a wayne rooney man
ironically , it was van gaal 's decision to push a moyes signing , marouane fellaini , forward which proved the key to turning manchester united 's season around
moyes 5/10 ; van gaal 6/10 ryan giggs ( left ) was one of the senior pros whom moyes failed to get the best out of falcao has been a big disappointment under van gaal , but the manchester united boss has n't been afraid to drop him signings it 's a confusing area because we do n't really know who has been responsible for all the signings at manchester united since alex ferguson left
moyes definitely scores a higher mark now for his transfer business than he would have scored when he left the club , which is why his supporters are aggrieved he was n't given a second season
moyes 6/10 ; van gaal 5/10 marouane fellaini was originally branded a poor signing but moyes 's decision has since been vindicated angel di maria was bought for a british record Â£ 60m , but has flopped in his first season at manchester united relationship with players having worked with wayne rooney as a teenager at everton , moyes was able to get the striker back onside despite his disappointment at the time of not earning a move to chelsea
club captain nemanja vidic made his decision to leave during moyes ' tenure
moyes 5/10 ; van gaal 7/10 moyes endured a fractious relationship with several stars at manchester united , including van persie wayne rooney and van gaal have formed a strong bond , and the dutchman has the respect of his squad public relations in a sense , moyes was handed a thankless task , replacing alex ferguson as the ' chosen one '
in retrospect , he was too deferential , when he cited the club 's tradition for bringing in young players and attacking until the end , it did n't sound right because his strengths lie elsewhere
moyes 5/10 ; van gaal 7/10 a banner critical of manager moyes was flown above old trafford during a match against aston villa van gaal 's glittering cv ensured he had the gravitas needed to take on one of the game 's biggest jobs escaping the shadow of fergie having personally anointed moyes , alex ferguson maybe felt subconsciously he should have some influence
he went to nearly all the matches despite having said on retirement he 'd travel the world and was put out that moyes let his backroom team of mike phelan and rene meulensteen leave
certainly , when moyes was heading out , alex ferguson knew about it and did n't fight to keep him
whether he intended to or not , alex ferguson 's shadow loomed large over moyes
moyes 4/10 ; van gaal 6/10 total : moyes 34/70 ; van gaal 44/70 sir alex ferguson was a regular presence in the stands at old trafford during moyes 's rule alex ferguson , pictured speaking with van gaal in 1998 , knows he does not hold influence over the dutchman
