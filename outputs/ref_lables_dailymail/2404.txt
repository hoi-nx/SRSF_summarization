this is the spectacular moment a goose narrowly avoids a snapping fox âs jaw after the sly animal had given an almighty leap in a bid to take down the large bird
however despite the fox âs best efforts to capture the canada goose - it only came away with a single feather
the action - packed photographs were captured by roger byng , 67 , on the wetlands surrounding the severn estuary in slimbridge , gloucester
lunch ! the hungry fox races across the grass towards the large canada goose ... launch ! he is poised to take off as his startled prey takes flight ... mr roger byng , from bristol , was in a hide â with the intention of photographing small british birds , such as bullfinches , long - tailed tits and wrens as part of a relaxing day âs photography
â however mr roger byng âs relaxing day âs photography came to an explosive end after he noticed a charging fox out of the corner of his eye
â gotcha ! the fox leaps but his jaws snap shut a fraction too late to bring down the bird escape : the goose manages to take flight leaving the hungry fox in its wake the retired security installer described how the fox came so close to what surely would be a grand catch for an animal that is roughly the same size as its prey
