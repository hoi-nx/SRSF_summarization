wayne rooney may have to revert to a midfield role at stamford bridge on saturday night after michael carrick and daley blind were two of four manchester united players ruled out of the clash with chelsea
centre - backs phil jones and marcos rojo will also miss the trip to the premier league leaders , and with evans completing his six - match ban , louis van gaal described it as â the worst scenario â
phil jones and daley blind , who was injured by vincent kompany âs controversial challenge in the manchester derby last weekend , both have ankle injuries while michael carrick limped out of that game with a tight calf and marcos rojo later reported a stomach muscle problem
michael carrick limped off against man city while marcos rojo picked up an injury soon after louis van gaal also revealed in his pre-match press conference that daley blind and phil jones are out wayne rooney has impressed up front in recent weeks but may have to drop further back louis van gaal puts his arm round manchester united captain wayne rooney during training this week van gaal has revealed that wayne rooney may play in holding midfield role against chelsea 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 : de gea ; valencia , chris smalling , blackett , luke shaw ; wayne rooney ; juan mata , herrera , maroaune fellaini , young ; radamel falcao manchester united âs injury setback means that luke shaw and radamel falcao could both be recalled against jose âs side
â i have to tell that we have four injuries who played the last match so that âs not so good for us , â said van gaal
â we had very good hope that we should recover two of the four but it âs not like that
michael carrick is out and marcos rojo is out , but also blind and phil jones
â that âs the worst scenario because marcos rojo and phil jones are good players at the left central defender position
blind and michael carrick could play the midfield holding position and i do nât have any other option , or i have to play wayne rooney in that position again
â you have seen that i took phil jones off pitch ( against man city ) because of injury , you have seen that michael carrick was off the pitch , you have seen the tackle of kompany against blind
only marcos rojo is a little bit surprising because he felt it the day after the match
blind and phil jones were very close to playing but it was not enough

luke shaw is fit enough i think
â with chelsea holding an eight - point lead and a game in hand over third - placed manchester united , van gaal believes it is asking too much for his team to win the title
the fact is that we are behind chelsea
â but , alright , we have to play against them and so do arsenal so we can lay pressure on chelsea âs shoulders
â they play at home but i think that chelsea will be satisfied with a draw
of course they will want to beat manchester united and we want to beat them , the question is how long players can play in the discipline
