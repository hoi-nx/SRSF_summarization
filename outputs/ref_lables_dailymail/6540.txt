q : i have been suffering from mouth ulcers for the past five months and feel i 'm living on bonjela and mouthwash
i get them all around my mouth and on my tongue
i 've been referred to hospital but the appointment is n't for three months
although i 'm otherwise in good health , i 'm quite worried
a : mouth ulcers may seem like a minor ailment but can actually be incredibly distressing
the pain can severely impact on quality of life , as eating and drinking are significantly affected
as many as 20 per cent of people suffer with the occasional single mouth ulcer and these are of no consequence
they are usually shallow and occur on the tongue or inside the lip or cheek
it is equally important to consider multiple chronic mouth ulcers as a symptom of bowel disease , as both coeliac disease and crohn 's disease can first present as mouth ulcers
coeliac can be identified on specific blood tests and crohn 's on a thorough history , examination and specialist opinion
while waiting to see a specialist , always make another gp appointment if something has changed or you feel that perhaps an important symptom has been missed
a urologist 's opinion would be warranted to assess whether a complication such as scar tissue could be preventing the bladder from emptying properly

there is a story doing the rounds on science blogs at the moment warning those who buy breast milk via the internet that it 's highly likely to be contaminated with either harmful bugs or cow 's milk
it 's good news on meningitis , despite a scare for my son one evening last week my eight - year - old son started complaining that he had a headache
once the dust had settled ( he 's absolutely fine now ) i could n't help thinking it was quite a coincidence : i wrote on these very pages just a few weeks ago about the worrying rise of a rarer form of the disease , meningitis w. and all of this happened in the week that health secretary jeremy hunt finally announced he will make the meningitis b vaccine part of the routine uk vaccination schedule
but it 's been good news all round , in the end
