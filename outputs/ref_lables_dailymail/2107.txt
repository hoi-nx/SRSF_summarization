mystery solved ? experts believe they have finally discovered how the rapa nui people placed distinctive hats made of red stone on top of some of the easter island figures â heads , more than 700 years ago despite the size of the statues , hixon an undergraduate student in archaeology and geology at the oregon university , believes the rolling of the bulky stones would have been relatively easy
a tall order : physicists believe that the pukao , or ' hats , ' were rolled up ramps to reach the top of the figures ( examples are pictured left and right ) , some of which measure up to 40 ft ( 12 metres ) tall remote : some 1,000 carved moai line the perimeter of the 12 mile ( 25km ) volcanic island , which is the most isolated inhabited landmass on earth with just 6,000 residents the moai are monolithic human figures carved by the rapa nui people on easter island , between 1,250 and 1,500 ad
the 887 statues gaze inland across the island with an average height of 13ft ( four metres )
all but 53 of the moai were carved from tuff - compressed volcanic ash - and around 100 wear red pukao of scoria
since europeans came to easter island , or rapa nui , in the 1700s , people have wondered how the vast carved stones were erected , complete with their ' hats '
some experts believe the stones were walked into place , while others have suggested that locals chopped down trees to roll the statues into position , unwittingly destroying the forests and causing their own demise through lack of natural resources
an estimated 100 pukao have been discovered so far , either in place on the statues , or scattered nearby
despite this , many agree that the red colour of the stone indicates that the pukao had ritual significance
mr hixon âs team used basic physics to model the force and torque required to place a pukao on a moai âs head , using different techniques
standing guard : an estimated 100 pukao have been discovered so far , either in place on the statues or scattered nearby
this map shows the location of the 887 statues , which gaze inland across the island , with an average height of 13ft ( four metres ) it may have been possible for less than 10 men to roll a â hat â into place , because the oblong shape stopped it easily rolling down the ramp again , but was still a good shape for being hauled upwards
some of the statues have indentations which may have stopped them tipping over during placement of the pukao
however , while the team thinks ramps were the most likely method for the placing of the hats , their models revealed that any of the proposed methods for raising the pukao would have been possible - with enough manpower
mr lipo said the findings may help dismantle the traditional story line of easter island , or rapa nui , that a ' crazed maniacal group destroyed their environment , ' by cutting down trees to transport gigantic statues
