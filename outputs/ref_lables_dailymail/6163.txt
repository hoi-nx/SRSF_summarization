the mirai features the toyota , which combines fuel cell technology with hybrid technology
tesla 's home battery could work in a similar way , or be a standalone battery
rival car manufacturer toyota already uses a hydrogen fuel cell in its mirai car that can be removed and used to power a home
according to the japanese car maker , the battery can supply electric power to an average home for a week
last year , tesla unveiled plans for a ' gigafactory ' designed to help the firm ramp up production of batteries for its electric cars , and now homes
elsewhere , mr elon musk is already the chairman of solarcity - a company that offers solar power systems for homes - and tesla 's home battery could be an extension of this
