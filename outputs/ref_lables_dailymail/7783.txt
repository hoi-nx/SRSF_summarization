premier league clubs are now so wealthy through their tv deals that they can afford to turn down a title sponsorship worth Â£ 45million a year
guinness offered the top flight a huge deal of Â£ 135m over three years , a Â£ 5m - a - year increase on the payments from barclays , whose 15 - year partnership with the premier league will finish at the end of next season
but the clubs awash with over Â£ 5billion from domestic tv rights alone rejected the bid from guinness âs parent company diageo , in part because some teams have conflicting beer deals
the premier league has turned down a bid from guinness to replace barclays as the title sponsor instead the premier league want as much as Â£ 60m a year from a mega title backer but will also examine a multi-partnership sponsorship model
such are the tv riches that the smaller clubs in the premier league are the ones more anxious about the sponsorship money â the Â£ 3m - a - year split does nât make much difference to the top of the table
the fa , meanwhile , have failed to find an â in association â fa cup partner this season prepared to pay Â£ 9m a year , although it âs understood wembley finally have someone at the table after well over a year âs search
the league 's mega-rich clubs have demanded a deal in the region of Â£ 60m - a - season from 2016 sky sports â petty refusal to let pundit thierry henry present tony mccoy with the champion jump jockey trophy at his sandown farewell on saturday â because it âs on channel 4 â does nât mean that an arsenal legend will not doing the honours
thierry henry 's ( centre ) contract with sky sports have presented him presenting a trophy to tony mccoy surrey boss richard thompson âs elevation to chairman of the england cricket commercial committee will aid the sport âs chronic need for more terrestrial tv coverage
richard thompson will push for a free - to - air highlights deal for the domestic t20 this summer which would be vital to grow a tournament that is in the shadow of the ipl and the australian big bash
