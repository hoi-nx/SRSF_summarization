george osborne dodged questions over plans to offer more help to the country 's top earners labour and tory politicians have come to blows over the 45p top tax rate following the chancellor 's admission that establishing the threshold was not one of the government 's priorities
george osborne has avoided calls to rule out further help for the country 's top earners , offering vague answers when asked whether those raking in more than Â£ 50,000 could see the rate lowered
instead he says the conservatives are committed to raising the tax - free personal allowance bracket from Â£ 10,000 to Â£ 12,500
raising 40 per cent tax so that it only applies to those earning at least Â£ 50,000 was also a priority , he said
at present anyone earning between Â£ 31,866 to Â£ 150,000 is taxed at the higher rate
those earning above Â£ 150,000 are taxed at the higher rate of 45 per cent
but labour politicians are calling for the amount to be raised to 50 per cent for those in the highest bracket
accusing the current government of prioritising ' helping the very richest ' , shadow chief secretary chris leslie condemned the chancellor 's refusal to rule out offering reduced tax rates on high income salaries
when pressed in an interview with sky news the chancellor refused to rule out making further cuts for uk 's top earners , instead saying the issue was ' not a priority '
judge us by what we want to do and what we want to do is increase the tax - free personal allowance to Â£ 12,500 so people full - time on the minimum wage do n't have to pay income tax and millions are better off , ' he said
