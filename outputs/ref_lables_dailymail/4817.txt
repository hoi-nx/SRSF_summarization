one wall street trader closed out his week a few million dollars richer last friday - and it was all thanks to social media
the unnamed trader used perfect timing to capitalize on one of the biggest deals of the year when journal mergers and acquisitions reporter mattioli took to twitter to announce that intel was in talks to buy one of its competitors , chipmaker altera
3:33pm : trader purchases 315,800 shares of altera at $ 36 a share for a total cost of $ 11,368,000 plus $ 110,530 for a $ 0.35 call option
this call option allowed the trader the right to purchase more shares in the company , in this case 315,800 shares , at the cost of $ 36 , even though the value of shares quickly began to rise
just 28 minutes later , when the market closed for the day , altera was valued at $ 44.39 per share
so instead of making a 28 % profit , the trader made a 2,220 % profit of roughly $ 2.5million when they sold their shares
' as for intel 's reported purchase of altera , that still has yet to happen
