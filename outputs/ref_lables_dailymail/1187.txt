david cameron and johnson warned of a looming ' constitutional crisis ' last night after scotland 's former first minister salmond was caught boasting : ' i 'm writing labour 's budget
' the two most high - profile conservatives joined forces to question the legitimacy of the snp 's plan to try to put miliband in downing street , even if labour wins fewer seats at the general election
johnson and david cameron joined forces yesterday to slam the snp plans to prop up labour ' lots of people â¦ people who might even have voted labour - people will think that this is a constitutional crisis , ' mr johnson said
last night , secret footage of mr salmond yesterday raised new fears about scotland nationalists holding the balance of power at westminster after may 7
at a fundraising event , mr salmond , who is bidding to become an mp , is heard mocking labour after it slapped down scotland leader jim murphy 's claim that he would write a labour budget north of the border
mr salmond also joked that he would ' check his top pocket ' â a reference to a conservative election poster showing a miniature mr miliband in his breast pocket
salmond boasted that he would write labour 's first budget because the snp would hold the balance of power the prime minister , in his first joint interview with the london mayor , his chief leadership rival , said : ' in the last 48 hours the snp have said " no money spent on defence projects unless you get rid of trident
' you have now got salmond saying he wants to write miliband 's budget
but frankly the stakes have got much higher because of what 's happening in scotland with the snp potentially wiping out labour
' mr johnson , seeking to return to the commons in the west london seat of uxbridge and south ruislip , said a labour government dependent on the snp 's support would be ' totally shambolic '
the two high - profile tories yesterday visited a school in south west london , where they made some hand paintings with the students the pair left the school together , where mr johnson claimed snp 's plans to prop up a labour government would mean ' truckfuls of taxpayers ' dosh growling up the m1 to scotland ' ' you would have labour at the beck and call of the snp
mr miliband dismissed mr salmond 's claim as ' fantasy and nonsense ' â but again refused to rule out relying on snp votes in a hung parliament
miliband , pictured on the campaign trail in ipswich yesterday , dismissed mr salmond 's claims he would write the labour budget as ' fantasy and nonsense ' the labour leader also insisted yesterday that he had no plans to negotiate with snp ' we are going to be writing the first labour budget , ' he told bbc radio five
' mr miliband also accused mr david cameron of ' trying to stir up english hatred against the scotland ' by highlighting the threat posed by the snp 's left - wing agenda
nicola sturgeon , mr salmond 's successor , yesterday set out another policy demand for the entire united kingdom â saying snp mps would vote for a Â£ 24 billion increase in nhs spending
former first minister of scotland salmond said mr david cameron had a ' sense of humour bypass ' after the prime minister reacted angrily to the leaked video responding to the leaked footage of him , mr salmond said mr david cameron should ' try holding a few public meetings and meeting real people â and develop a sense of humour '
' but scotland conservative deputy leader jackson carlaw said : ' here we have the snp - labour offer in a nutshell : a chaotic pact with united kingdom 's future security treated like a dinner - party joke
' after nicola sturgeon 's slick con - trick earlier this week , this video shows the snp 's arrogance laid bare
