cameron this morning launched a furious attack on labour mps ' bleating ' about poverty after it emerged more than a million people turned to food banks last year
the prime minister said labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which ' punished the poor '
he accused ed miliband and ed balls of having ' some brass neck ' by attacking the tories for failing the poor , adding : ' do n't you dare lecture us on poverty
mr cameron said families stuck on benefits were not â playing the system â but were â victims of it â
â so when i hear labour politicians bleating on about the same old tories , not on the side of working people , i just think : some brass neck
â mr cameron accused ed miliband and ed balls of having ' some brass neck ' by attacking the tories for failing the poor , adding : ' do n't you dare lecture us on poverty
' mr cameron promised extra free childcare for 600,000 children a year to counter spiralling costs and said the expense of nurseries and childminders has become a major barrier to employment
the conservatives have pledged to reduce tax relief on pension contributions for people earning more than Â£ 150,000 to fund additional free childcare places
â that means over 600,000 extra free childcare places available for families every year â nine million extra hours of childcare a week and parents able to work an extra 78 days a year without any childcare costs â all by 2017
â mr cameron also argued â that true compassion is nât giving people a benefits cheque â it âs giving them a chance â
