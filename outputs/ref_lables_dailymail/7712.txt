the militant unite union was facing embarrassment last night over claims it â sacked â an activist for complaining about being hired on a zero - hours contract
former lecturer martyn reuby won the first round in his legal battle against unite , after a tribunal ruled that he had been employed to teach its courses

mr martyn reuby , a unite member for 42 years , claims he was sacked by the union after complaining that he and more than 100 colleagues were employed on a zero - hours basis , with no entitlement to sick pay or paid leave
it is hypocrisy ( on their part ) because effectively what they were using was zero - hours contracts through the back door
â unite has openly campaigned about the use of zero - hours contracts , which provide far fewer benefits such as holiday pay and pension , yet there is evidence in this case that tutors employed by unite and other colleges worked under zero - hours contracts
unite , which is appealing the judgment , claimed it did not employ mr martyn reuby , who had a series of short - term contracts from colleges , which did not guarantee any minimum hours
a spokesman for the union said : â unite does not use zero - hours contracts and it is misleading to say so
â labour was facing further embarrassment over the issue last night after parliament âs expenses watchdog confirmed some of the party âs mps were employing staff on a zero - hours basis
