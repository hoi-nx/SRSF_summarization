mr bowes has won Â£ 30,000 in an out - of - court settlement after a two - year battle with dr crees kate chadwick , associate solicitor at the dental law partnership , said : ' bowes has been the victim of mistreatment by his dentist for years
' this decade of neglect was a real catalogue of errors with dr crees failing to diagnose and treat decay and carrying out extractions without informed consent
' fortunately he visited another dentist for a second opinion who immediately spotted the problem , otherwise , left untreated mr bowes may well have lost more of his teeth
' dr crees , who , despite the out of court settlement has not admitted liability , said that due to patient confidentiality it would be inappropriate for him to comment on the case at this time .
