lynn , from chippenham , had to stop taking medication that enables her to move without pain as she suffers from a painful and crippling condition callled hip displasia
lynn and husband liam tried for a baby for three years so when she fell pregnant , she did n't want to take any risks so stopped taking pain relief for her scoliosis and hip dysplasia symptoms the condition means the ball and socket joint of her hip has not formed properly , which causes pain when she moves
due to her disabilities , lynn has to walk with a crutch around the home and uses a wheelchair when out and about
but after becoming pregnant with a baby girl after three years of trying to conceive with husband , liam , lynn chose to stop taking the drugs for the time she carried their baby
lynn explains when pregnant that she 's prepared to forgo pain relief for the sake of her baby libby was then delivered via caesarean section but lynn had hoped for a natural birth ' she 's so special and it took such a long time to get her , i do n't want to do anything to risk the pregnancy
' lynn , who has only 30 per cent mobility with her hips , said her problems began when she was a small child
she works as an occupational therapist for the nhs , plays wheelchair tennis and wanted to be able to deliver her baby naturally despite her hip problems
despite her hip problems , lynn , pictured in hospital with liam and libby after her birth , had wanted a natural delivery but had to have a c - section as libby was breeched adjusting to life as a mother with limited mobility means lynn has had a chairlift installed in her home the new mother is determined not to let her disabilities get in her way however , this was not possible in the end as her baby was in the breech position so she had to have her daughter , libby , via a caesarean section
lynn has to allow changes she 's always resisted - such as having a chairlift installed in their home - to take place so she can better care for libby with her physical limitations
lynn admits she 's always tried to do things for herself but she admits as a new mother , she has to accept more help for the sake of her daughter
following the safe arrival of libby , the couple had an anxious six week wait to find out if she also has hip dysplasia as there is thought to be genetic link
those with hip dysplasia are five to ten times times more likely to have baby with condition and it 's more common in female and first - born babies
lynn and liam return to hospital six weeks after libby 's birth to hear the good news that she does n't also have hip dysplasia as there is a genetic link the couple were delighted when a scan revealed libby does not have the condition
this was something lynn was keen to pursue as her own late diagnosis contributed to the mobility problems she has now
