' that âs what i did with the whole england - finland situation
finland were great to me when i was younger and i really enjoyed playing for them
the aston villa midfielder ( centre right ) has been an instant hit since breaking into the first team ' it was a great experience at the time because i was playing against some of the best teams in the world
' but then it came to a crunch time where i had to pick and i had to ask myself : " what do i feel â english or finland ? " the answer was english
' i do nât know grealish but my advice to him would be to follow what feels right
' the clock is ticking for grealish to make up his mind with ireland boss martin o'neill understood to be keen to include him in his plans for the friendly against roy hodgson 's england in dublin this summer

roy hodgson and his staff are believed to be fans of the young winger and want him to commit to england ' we âve shown in the friendlies we âve played recently , like against germany and czech republic , and we âve beaten them
