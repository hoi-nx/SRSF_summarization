the 72 - year - old 's long - term employer , the bbc , is still reeling from a string of allegations levelled against former staff - most of them blackburn 's vintage
several media personalities were investigated and arrested following the launch of operation yewtree , including broadcasters dave lee travis and rolf harris
the probe also exposed abuse by paedophile dj , who sexually assaulted staff and patients aged between 5 and 75 over several decades
the bbc radio 2 presenter professed his deep shock at the headlines , explaining that most of his colleagues in the industry were ' just working hard ' and ' having a good time '
' it 's upsetting , horrible , ' he said
' i never liked savile , and i knew there was something about him that was odd but i did n't know what it was
it 's tarnished that era , and it was n't really like that
' his good friend and fellow dj , paul gambaccini , was also caught up in the scandal after spending a a year under a cloud of suspicion when he was arrested over historical sex offences
in his case the 65 - year - old was accused of having sex with two underage boys , however , the cps ( cps ) dropped the charges last year
tony blackburn said he is outraged at how paul gambaccini was treated and has called for lessons to be learnt
' in paul gambaccini 's case , he did n't know the people - and your name is just dragged through the mud
' blackburn has remained unequivocally untouched by scandal , and explained : ' that 's because i have n't done anything wrong , it 's as simple as that , ' he says emphatically
tony blackburn said he never liked paedophile dj jimmy savile ( pictured ) , who sexually assaulted staff and patients aged between 5 and 75 over several decades rolf harris and dave lee travis were among blackburn 's former bbc colleagues caught up in the historic sex abuse scandal at the corporation he made the boasts in his 2007 autobiography poptastic ! my life in radio in which he said he had slept with 250 women â a number which he then doubled five years later in a magazine interview
' it only happened , he maintains , as his autobiography 's ghost - writer said they needed a bit more sex , given the lack of drugs and ' rock n roll '
blackburn says lessons need to be learned after his friend and colleague paul gambaccini ( pictured ) had charges against him dropped ' i was quite open about it - i do n't see anything wrong , and i never have , if two consenting adults make love that 's their business , providing it is all above board
