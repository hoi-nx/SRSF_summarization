over the years i âve been lucky enough to play with a lot of accomplished women golfers , including two former world no 1 's in lorena ochoa and laura davies
but none of these encounters prepared me for playing 18 holes with charley hull , the best teenage golfer in british
the sun was shining , ailsa craig was shimmering in the distance and hull put on a shot - making clinic
charley hull can make it to the very top of the women 's game if she carries on her progression teenager hull possesses the same â wow â factor as world no 1 rory mcilroy ( below ) one of the nice things for me about playing golf with the women pros is we usually hit the ball about the same length
hull hit drives that pitched past mine
she positively exudes the â wow â factor rory mcilroy had at the same age
like rory mcilroy , she âs also easy company
the 19 - year - old was keen to know about the revamp planned by the trump family , who recently purchased turnberry , under the guidance of course architect martin ebert
the 19 - year - old has the same mentality and ' wow factor ' as world no 1 rory mcilroy it puts her in the vanguard of the next revolution set to sweep the women âs game
hull is part of a group that includes thailand rookie ariya jutanugarn and american lexi thompson
hull has added 25 yards to her drive since hooking up with swing coach matt belsham earlier this year
american lexi thompson is another highly - touted golfer in women 's golf and will challenge hull what âs next for the girl from kettering who plays at woburn and who finished no 1 in europe last year , the youngest to do so ? she has now earned her privileges to play in american and clearly that is the next proving ground
her plan is to be the best player in the world at 21 â the year rory mcilroy reached the summit â which might be a tall order given the present incumbent happens to be 13 months younger and won yet again in american on sunday
they played together in new zealand recently , where the home favourite shot a course - record 61 to hull âs 64
