arsene wenger says that arsenal will have to be perfect until the end of the season if they want to challenge for the title â but maintains that they will be ready if chelsea slip
arsenal thrashed liverpool 4 - 1 at home with goals from bellerin , mesut ozil , alexis sanchez and olivier giroud and are seven points behind chelsea , with the premier league leaders having to visit the emirates in two weeks â time â although jose mourinho âs team still have a game in hand
and arsene wenger says his team have to focus on winning every game in order to be ready for any setbacks that chelsea may suffer
arsene wenger is not letting his team get ahead of themselves despite an excellent win on saturday bellerin celebrates after putting arsenal 1 - 0 ahead against liverpool in the first half on saturday â if the opportunity presents itself , we will have to be perfect and chelsea have to be not perfect , â said arsene wenger
â liverpool manager brendan rodgers praised raheem sterling , despite liverpool 's heavy defeat liverpool won their penalty after raheem sterling ( top ) was fouled by bellerin ( bottom ) in the second half but arsene wenger insisted that the performance against liverpool demonstrated that had they not be hampered by injuries and the late return of world cup winners mesut ozil and per mertesacker , then they would have been closer to chelsea in the table
â mesut ozil scored a glorious second for arsenal with a sumptuous free - kick on 40 minutes meanwhile , it has emerged that liverpool must give raheem sterling âs first club , qpr , up to Â£ 15 million of the profits if they sell the 20 - year - old
liverpool agreed a 25 percent sell - on clause with qpr when they signed raheem sterling in 2010 as a 15 - year - old for Â£ 500,000
it means qpr would be entitled to Â£ 12.375m if raheem sterling is sold for Â£ 50m and is seen as an important reason why liverpool boss brendan rodgers is keen to keep the talented winger
