the yoga being taught in a san diego school system is not a gateway to hinduism and does n't violate the religious rights of students or their parents , a california appeals court ruled friday
the 4th district court of appeal in san diego upheld a lower court ruling that tossed out a family 's lawsuit trying to block the encinitas union school district from teaching yoga as an alternative to traditional gym classes
the lawsuit brought by stephen and jennifer sedlock and their two children claimed the school district 's yoga classes promoted hinduism and inhibited christianity
the district said the practice is taught in a secular way to promote strength , flexibility and balance
a three - year grant from the k.p. jois foundation , a nonprofit group that promotes ashtanga yoga , provides twice - weekly , 30 - minute classes to the district 's 5,600 students
