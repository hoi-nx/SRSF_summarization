sometimes life imitates art , but apparently not when it comes to the cia
current and former female agents spoke out to the new york times on sunday to renounce depictions of cia women on tv shows and in movies
the group of women say they are nothing like the honey - pots on these shows who use their sexuality to ensnare terrorists and drown ptsd with booze and pills
retired cia officer sandra grimes , 69 , who helped expose her colleague aldrich ames as a russian double agent , says she sees nothing of herself in the characters at the center of shows like state of affairs and homeland
and we do nât act that way , ' sandra grimes told the new york times
in the scenes before her death in a terrorist attack on a u.s. military base in afghanistan , actress jennifer ehle plays matthews as a ' giddy ' agent , excitedly baking a jordanian source a cake for their meeting on his birthday
' the problem is that they portray most women in such a one - dimensional way ; whatever the character flaw is , that âs all they are , ' bennett said
' it can leave a very distinct understanding of women at the agency - how we function , how we relate to men , how we engage in national security - that is pretty off
' one of the fictional cia agents currently on screen is charlie tucker on nbc 's state of affairs
played by katherine heigl , charlie tucker is a character who in the first episode gets drunk at a bar , sleeps with a stranger and lashes out at her psychiatrist
another example is homeland 's carrie mathison ( played by claire danes ) - a bi-polar spy who gives up nearly all responsibility for her child ( the product of a secret relationship with a double agent ) and spends most of her time controlling sources with sex
offensive : veteran cia analyst gina bennett says she was upset with the ' giddy ' portrayal of her friend jennifer matthews ( left ) in the movie zero dark thirty ( played by jennifer ehle , right )
while the trials and tribulations of female agents on screen are wildly exaggerated , the women interviewed said they do similarly struggle to maintain the balance between their work and private lives
it 's not about sex : the real women of the cia say they are not all honey - pots who use their sexuality to control sources ( like carrie mathison on homeland , played by claire danes above ) sending the wrong message : the women also take issue with nbc show state of affairs , which features katherine heigl ( above ) as a troubled cia analyst ' i briefed condoleezza rice while in labor
many of the women though said they enjoyed working for the agency , which is becoming more and more female friendly with a day care center in langley and flexible time off
