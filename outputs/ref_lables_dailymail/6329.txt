millions of point of sales systems are vulnerable to security breaches as they are protected by the same default password - used by a global maker of payment devices for more than two decades , researches say
the password , 166816 , is still being used by about 90 per cent of customers , researchers byrne and henderson disclosed on wednesday during the annual rsa security conference in california
researchers henderson ( right ) and byrne ( left ) said a global maker of cash registers has been using the same default password on the payment devices for more than two decades
' hackers would need physical access to the payment devices , opening a panel of the device using a paperclip , to exploit it , according to the register
for example , during the conference it was revealed that two individuals reportedly entered a major u.s. retail store , unscrewed a server rack and walked out with the server leaving the store unable to process credit card payments , according to rt. while henderson and byrne did not name the vendor using the 166816 password , a google search pointed to verifone which connects around 27 million payment devices around the world , according to rt. on thursday , verifone said in a statement that all of its devices in the field came with the same default password , z66831 , according to cso
however , verifone claimed sensitive payment information or personally identifiable information can not be captured , even though the password has become known over the years
while henderson and byrne did not name the vendor , a google search pointed to verifone ( file photo of one of the company 's payment devices ) the company said : ' what the password allows someone to do is to configure some settings on the terminal ; all executables have to be file signed , and it is not possible to enter malware just by knowing passwords
