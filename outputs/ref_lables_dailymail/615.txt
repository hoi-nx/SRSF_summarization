this is the moment a driver deliberately blocked a sneaky motorist who tried to beat a traffic jam with an undertaking manoeuvre
but one driver in a silver mercedes obviously was n't prepared to wait in the queuing traffic on the outside lane , where vehicles were merging
traffic began to build up on the m58 around switch island in merseyside when a silver mercedes attempted to undertake the trafffic but a renault driver was n't happy and pulled into the inside lane to block the mercedes from moving forwards he attempted to sail up the inside lane in a sneaky bid to avoid having to wait
not content with having to wait , the mercedes driver the tries to both overtake and undertake the renault in an attempt to get past the vehicle
