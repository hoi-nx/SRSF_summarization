oâshea has revealed his concern at the increasing force of rugby âs collisions after quins and england full back brown was consigned to even more time on the sidelines to recover from the latest high - profile head injury
brown has not played since the final round of the rbs 6 nations on march 21 , is still suffering headaches after a week - long holiday in dubai and no closer to being declared symptom - free
the episode raises questions about whether the 29 - year - old was brought back too early for england âs title - decider against france , having been knocked out in the test against italy five weeks earlier following a crunching collision with andrea masi
brown is knocked out in a collision with italy âs andrea masi in the rbs 6 nations last month brown was out cold for approximately eight minutes and has n't played since the italy game on march 21st â it âs a concern because i do nât like someone coming in with something you ca nât diagnose , â said oâshea , quins â director of rugby
there âs no doubt that a decade or even a year ago browny would be back out on the pitch
â brown will have played just six of his club âs last 19 games after sitting out of the coming weekend , and his england team - mates joe marler and chris robshaw have featured in only eight of the last 18
â is it tough on us having the england full back for six out of 19 games and still indeterminate ? yes , but there are more important things than rugby
