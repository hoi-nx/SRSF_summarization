it 's the ultimate in slow - motion footage
the bbc is to air a two - hour , real - time documentary following a canalboat as it pootles its way along a british waterway at a leisurely 4mph
for many , the languid film will be as interesting as watching paint dry , but the corporation hopes many viewers will find it a refreshing change from the usual frenetic pace of modern tv
00.00 : and they 're off ! 0 - 4mph in ten minutes 34.07 : bridge over ( not at all ) troubled water 41.50 : crazy boy racers scream past at 5mph aside from two aerial cutaway shots , when the boat negotiates a lock and crosses the dundas aqueduct , the full two hours is shot continuously from a single camera on the front of the boat
the film was shot on a sunny day last month and will air on may 5 as part of the bbc four goes slow series of deliberately unrushed programmes
if people are going to sit and watch a two - hour single shot , it needs to be the most beautiful two - hour shot it can be
