a new hard - hitting campaign is aiming to highlight the misery of homeless women who are unable to access proper sanitary care
the homeless period project hopes to shred the taboo around females living on the streets and their monthly cycle , and is encouraging people to donate tampons and towels to their local homeless shelter
a campaign video tells the story of a woman called patricia , who slept rough on the streets of brixton for six months and was forced to use makeshift sanitary products while menstruating
among the cardboard placards held up are the words : ' why does a woman have to rip up a cloth put between her to protect herself from bleeding ? ' another is written with the words : ' i used to feel very depressed
' the project was started by oliver frost , josie shedden and sara bakhaty , who met while working as interns at an advertising agency
the trio told femail that they began the campaign as a way of drawing attention to the amount of women who live on the streets after realising that society considered homelessness to be a ' male ' issue
the campaign has prompted supporters to start their own collection boxes for tampons and sanitary towels : this ( pictured above ) was one of seven boxes collected in the workplace of twitter user sarah wyatt while homeless shelters receive funding for condoms , there is currently no government funding to supply charities with aid for sanitary products they said that they were surprised to find that approximately 26 per cent of people who access homelessness services are women
oliver frost adds that periods seem to be a forgotten issue when it comes to living on the streets
nearly 81,000 people have signed a petition to lobby the government for better funding to buy sanitary care
she says she was forced to used ripped up cloth as a makeshift sanitary towel oliver frost said donations are key to the campaign 's success : ' for us , the hope is that # thehomelessperiod will become a platform for people wanting to help with donations
