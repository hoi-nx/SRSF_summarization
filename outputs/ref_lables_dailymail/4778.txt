stewart has expressed his interest in becoming the new director of england following the sacking on wednesday of managing director downton
stewart , who played in a record 133 tests for england and is currently director of cricket at surrey , has not yet been approached by the ecb
but he said : â when england come calling , you should nât say no. â the early bookies â favourite for the post is michael vaughan , the former england captain who is close to the incoming ecb chairman colin graves , and has also made clear his desire to help english cricket out of its current state of chaos

asked whether he âd be interested in the post â created by the ecb âs new chief executive tom harrison , who confirmed downton âs demise wednesday evening â stewart said : â i ca nât just say yes until i know what the role and the responsibility are
if they asked me to take on a role , and it âs the right role , of course i âd listen and have a big conversation â once the ecb have asked surrey permission to speak to me , of course , because i âm under contract here
â i just want england to be the best side in the world

â stewart , who led england in 15 tests and scored nearly 8,500 runs , was effusive in his praise of kevin pietersen , whose chances of a surprise england recall increased from highly unlikely to merely improbable following the sacking of downton â who in turn had sacked kevin pietersen over a year ago
kevin pietersen will feature for stewart 's surrey outfit in this year 's county championships and the former wicket - keeper batsman believes the 34 - year - old could still make a comeback at international level â we âve never had a problem with him , â said stewart
if he âs racking the runs up , and england are struggling , if the players are nât getting runs or there âs an injury to a batsman , and he âs in top form â why would nât you want to bring him back ? â
