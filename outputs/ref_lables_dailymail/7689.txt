coastlines : the story of our shore by barkham we are an island race , â which means , in practice , we are a coastal people
no one in britain lives as much as 70 miles from the sea
our coastline of 10,800 miles is longer than india âs ( unbelievable ? try measuring the ins and outs of scotland âs )
many people in the u.s. , russia or china never see the sea in their lives
but most of us are saturated with it in childhood â in holiday homes and beach huts with deckchairs and sandy sandwiches , shivering and occasionally baking in the capricious arms of the sea
people are drawn back to the sea in their retirement , staring once more and feeling as they did as children
our attachment to the coast is strong
barkham âs book is written to celebrate 50 years of enterprise neptune , the trust âs campaign to save our coastal beauties from being spoiled â by purchasing them
beginning in 1965 , the trust has by now acquired 742 miles of coast
our attachment to the coast is strong
popular television series explore it , gliding over the cliffs by helicopter as if in a dream and coastal paths are never short of walkers naturally , the trust mainly bought up the wilder shores to preserve their wildness , which is why you wo nât find any popular resorts among them
when she died , in 1961 , the trust was given the island by the treasury in lieu of death duties
he is the right man to salute the preservation of our coast : the trust âs miles are the only part we actually have the right to stand on as common land
