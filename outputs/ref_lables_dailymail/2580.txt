covering aircraft in blue lights , and only turning them on when beginning to take off , could help stop birds colliding with aircraft
that âs according to a study , which found that birds responded to lights in different ways than a human might
the study was conducted by scientists at purdue university in indiana
they were investigating how to reduce bird to aircraft collisions by keeping birds away from planes ( stock image shown )
research showed that birds responded most to blue lights on planes the study , by scientists at purdue university in indiana and the national wildlife research centre in ohio , was published in the condor : ornithological applications
the authors suggest that runways could be synced with aircraft to alert birds to incoming planes and avoid collisions
the lights could be off during taxiing but on during take - off , to help the birds move out of the way of the fast - moving planes
and they say their method could even help birds avoid collisions with buildings and wind turbines by also covering them in blue lights

the lights could be off during taxiing but on during take - off , to help the birds move out of the way of the fast - moving planes in the experiments , the researchers studied how flocks of cowbirds ( stock image shown ) responded to model aircraft
they were seeking to find a solution to the problem of birds colliding with aircraft , which causes Â£ 480 million ( $ 700 million ) worth of damage in the us alone â in previous studies , we have demonstrated that avian response to vehicle approach can be enhanced by increasing the conspicuousness of the approaching vehicle with white lights , â explained dr. fernã¡ndez-juricic , one of the authors of the study
