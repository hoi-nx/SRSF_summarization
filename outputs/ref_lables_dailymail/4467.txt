sheffield 's kell brook retained his world strap with a four - round destruction of jo jo dan a week ago and immediately called out regular verbal sparring partner khan
the two have spent the week trading barbs - with kell brook offering a june 13 date at wembley for an all - british bout - but khan made it clear he was going his own way when announcing his next opponent on thursday
the bolton man said he will face algieri in new york on may 30 and kell brook can not understand the move
after kell brook 's victory over jo jo dan on march 1 , he called out khan in a post-match interview khan has previously refused a fight with kell brook , but now promises it will take place within 12 months ' if someone said to me you can get five million quid , a world title , fight at wembley with a fight that every fan wants to see , it 's a no - brainer for me , ' 28 - year - old kell brook told bbc 5 live
' he 's fighting algieri who did n't win a round against ( manny pacquiao ) manny pacquiao , a feather puncher , not a big puncher
