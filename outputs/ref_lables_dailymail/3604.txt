the lib dems have admitted they are on course to lose at least 20 mps , but claim this could still be enough to put them back in power
clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains , stopping off in hampshire where the lib dems held eastleigh after chris huhne was jailed

clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains , stopping off in eastleigh in hampshire mr clegg today admitted that his party was fighting ' tooth and nail ' in fewer than a tenth of westminster seats
instead of battling to win seats across the country , the party has highly targeted strategy , effectively fighting 60 by - elections in constituencies where his candidates stand a chance
a party source said if the party had a group of mps numbering ' in the 30s ' it could potentially hold the balance of power after may 7 and be able to once again form part of a coalition government
the senior lib dems , closely involved in the party 's election strategy , said the campaign 's focus was increasingly on between 10 and 15 marginal seats - some held by the party and a few targets - with other constituencies either assessed as safe or effectively written off
' there are lots of marginal seats
there 's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40 - odd
' mr clegg today admitted that his party was fighting ' tooth and nail ' in fewer than a tenth of westminster seats opinion polls by yougov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the lib dems support , to barely 8 per cent the lib dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the conservatives
mr clegg travelled to eastleigh , the scene of a 2013 by - election triumph , to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats
mr clegg and the party 's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings , which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark , are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling
' so we are fighting a campaign like we have never fought a campaign before
' mr clegg was all smiles at the ageas bowl cricket ground near eastleigh , behind the scenes , senior party sources admit their current total of 57 mps will be slashed to ' in the thirties ' after a catastrophic collapse in support
we will campaign like no other party knows how to campaign again
' asked whether he was now even running a national campaign following his call for ' 60 eastleighs ' , mr clegg said : ' i am saying that exactly the same zeal of that by - election is what we are applying in the 60 - odd seats where we are fighting tooth and nail to get lib dems elected in this election
