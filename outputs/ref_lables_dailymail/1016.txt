massachusetts senator elizabeth warren says she 's relieved tsarnaev has been found guilty of carrying out the boston bombing - the greatest tragedy in her state 's recent history - but does n't believe he should be executed
in an interview with cbs this morning on thursday , warren reacted to wednesday 's jury verdict which found the 21 - year - old guilty on all 30 charges related to the boston marathon explosions which killed three and injured hundreds at the finish line
when asked what she would like to see happen in the penalty stage of the trial , liberal - minded warren stuck by her anti-death penalty stance
tsarnaev pictured right in boston federal court on wednesday as his guilty verdict was read warren went on to speak about current democratic party issues , as well as comment and likely presidential candidate hillary clinton
however , the woman once thought to be a front - runner for her party refused to compare her politics to the former secretary of state
now that tsarnaev has been found guilty of committing the boston marathon bombings , the case will move on to the penalty stage of the trail which could begin as early as monday
it is in this stage of the trial that the jury will decide whether or not to sentence tsarnaev to life in prison or the death penalty - a matter in which they will have to vote unanimously

secret weapon : tsarnaev 's lead defense attorney , judy clarke , specializes in death penalty cases and has spared several of her notorious killer clients from execution by humanizing them to the jury
however , tsarnaev has yet another advantage of being put on trial in massachusetts since the state outlawed capital punishment in 1984
however , experts say that since the jury was pulled from a pool of massachusetts residents , they could decided against the death penalty as a reflection of the state 's general politics on the issue
