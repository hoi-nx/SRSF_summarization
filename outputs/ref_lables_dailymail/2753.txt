politicians ' living quarters are under close inspection in order to establish just how human and how like us they really are
it is the current prime minister 's kitchen that has got everyone talking more than any of the other political leaders ' â perhaps because he is a known ' toff ' , and britain , despite protests from the left and now the right , really still are obsessed with class
score one point for each - the more points you get , the more upmarket your house must be
the kitchen a cafetiere those pesky middle - middle classes have fallen hook , line and capsule for these sleekly designed , all style and no substance coffee machines , but those of true upmarket stock know that you ca n't beat freshly ground coffee in a cafetiere
you will probably own a few of these , in different sizes , to cater for varying numbers of drinkers
a cookery book shelf of little - known authors if your kitchen shelves are teaming with works by messers oliver , ramsay and martin then you 're in trouble
those of better stock will stick to tired , faded old works â think constance spry , mrs beeton and julia child ( the latter only if you have american blood the family )
william says that there are several items that you are required to own for your home to be ' posh ' mary berry 's books are all right so long as they are the pre-bake off ones and you are able to talk at length about her terribly helpful cooking instructions for agas alongside each recipe
an aga a little hackneyed now but still a good sign that you 're in a house of good standing
a cling film dispenser too many kitchen gadgets and you 're on thin ice but one of these terribly clever dispensers for cling - film is a ' godsend ! ' ( shout this ) and saves so much time as you 're covering the leftovers of the pickled pears
proper tea and coffee cups no politician has been seen with anything but a mug when snapped in their own home since 1997 , but tea or coffee from the proper vessel ( i.e. one that requires a saucer ) is a must for better houses
cloth napkins for kitchen suppers most people will know to get out the nice napkins ( never ' serviettes ' ) for guests but those of better breeding will ensure cloth napkins are set for even the most simple of suppers for one
knock off a mark if you have ever given a guest a piece of kitchen roll in lieu of a proper napkin
old fashioned it may be but william says that an aga is still a good status symbol william says that a posh household should opt for a cup and saucer ( right ) over a mug ( left ) for a hot drink bathroom a reed diffuser there 's no better smell than fresh air , but for city - dwelling upmarket folk this may not be to hand ( or a bathroom may have no windows )
when it comes to seating william says that fabric sofas are the only way to go william says that a leather sofa is seen as ' a tad suspect ' among the middle classes plain loo paper the upper classes would sooner use sandpaper than quilted lavatory roll
there are even rules when it comes to toilet roll , according to william it should always be white and under no circumstances whatsoever should it be quilted sitting room ( never ' the living room ' ) books to dvd ratio you may award yourself a point if the number of books you own and that are on display outweighs the number of dvds
naff tv cabinets to hide the thing are definitely lower - middle and now no - one makes them to fit modern flat screens anyway
deduct a mark , if not four , if you have a cinema room
