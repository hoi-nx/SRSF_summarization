downton was brave enough to make huge decisions in his first 14 months as ecb âs managing director but the jury is still out on all of them at a time as the clamour for change has grown louder
it was downton who made the big call to sack kevin pietersen and reappoint peter moores as ecb coach
downton has left his role as managing director of ecb the move came a day ahead of an ecb board meeting that was meant to discuss the future of downton october 2013 downton , a former ecb wicketkeeper , is appointed managing sirector of ecb , with his position taking effect from february 1 , 2014
april 2014 downton appoints peter moores , who had spent the previous four seasons as head coach at lancashire , for a second spell as ecb head coach
may 2014 downton and the ecb issue an apology to kevin pietersen for claiming he appeared â disinterested â and â distracted â during the fifth test in sydney
december 2014 alastair cook is sacked as one - day captain and replaced by eoin morgan , marking the end of a sorry year for ecb in which they won just 18 of their 48 matches across all formats
february - march 2015 ecb endure a dreadful world cup campaign , failing to advance from the group stage and finishing behind bangladesh , who sealed their exit with a 15 - run victory
april 2015 downton departs as ecb managing director
he also had to back the decision to replace alastair cook as one - day captain on the brink of the world cup even though it was the selectors who drove it
but , most of all , it is ecb âs humiliating world cup that led the 14 members of the ecb management board to unanimously back the sacking of downton when new chief executive harrison rang them on wednesday morning
so acute was the embarrassment at ecb going out in the first round of the world cup that any hopes downton had for an extended stay in office proved impossible
â morris ( his predecessor ) stayed in the background but downton became far too high - profile , â one board member told sportsmail on wednesday night
â downton is the most high - profile casualty so far of that new broom sweeping through english cricket , led by harrison and chairman - elect graves but he will not be the last , unless ecb are successful in their busiest of all years
james whitaker , the national selector , is the most vulnerable , not least because a change of job description for downton âs successor to director of ecb cricket looks likely to make the new man an all - round supremo
much may depend on who replaces downton because there is still no real appetite within the ecb , and certainly not among senior members of the ecb team , for kevin pietersen to return
downton 's job description has been abolished as a result following ecb 's dismal world cup showing downton leaves his role as ecb managing director following ecb 's shameful performance at world cup former ecb captain michael vaughan said on wednesday he would like to talk to the ecb about the role kevin pietersen ( left ) could return for ecb while andrew strauss ( right ) is another that could take the role kevin pietersen was uncharacteristically coy when asked on twitter for his thoughts on downton âs departure alec stewart is another candidate who , presumably , would have a more open mind about recalling kevin pietersen as he has just re-signed him for surrey
downton has become a derided character but he does not deserve to be the figure of ridicule he has become as frustration has grown at the national team
the decision to ditch kevin pietersen was , as far as i am concerned , absolutely right while peter moores may yet prove to be the coach downton and others believe him to be
but a fall - guy was needed for the world cup and downton was the obvious candidate

alastair cook downton was a supporter of alastair cook as test captain but was persuaded to sack him as one - day captain three weeks before the disastrous world cup campaign
the new â director of ecb cricket â might think alastair cook needs to go back to scoring runs at the top of the order after failing to convince as a tactician verdict : vulnerable alastair cook was suppoerted by downton before being sacked as one - day captain before the world cup james whitaker the chairman of selectors and former leicestershire captain has been involved in one of the grimmest periods in english cricket
selections have been difficult to fathom at times and a series of well - publicised clangers have alienated the selector from players , spectators and media verdict : sure to follow downton out the door ecb selector james whitaker ( left ) and former managing director downton during a nets session peter moores an atrocious world cup heaped even more pressure on the coach , whose reappointment last year by downton has been mitigated only by last summer âs test series win against india
described as â the outstanding coach of his generation â by downton , peter moores â position is now as weak as it has been
verdict : vulnerable peter moores â position is now as weak as it has been following downton 's dismissal at the ecb kevin pietersen it is almost inconceivable that barely six months after publishing one of the most vitriolic books in the history of sport , this high - maintenance player could be on the brink of a return
but downton âs removal , and giles clarke âs departure , means the path is now clear for kevin pietersen if he scores runs for surrey
