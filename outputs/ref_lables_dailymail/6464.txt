a wartime scientist has revisited the secret underground factory where she helped build aircraft engines 70 years since the end of the second world war
mary cartwright was 20 when she was called up to work in the laboratory at shadow factory in kidderminster , worcestershire , in 1943
she spent two years testing metal for bristol aircraft engines in the site 's underground laboratory , working as the only woman in her department
now , 70 years after leaving her position , the 91 - year - old great - grandmother has revisited the now defunct factory
mary cartwright revisited drakelow underground factory in kidderminster , worcestershire , where more than 700 people worked during the war ( right ) to produce aircraft engines
now 91 , the great grandmother tested metal for aircraft engines revisiting the site with her son , david , mrs mary cartwright said it was ' strange ' to see it so quiet
she worked as the only woman in its laboratory between 1943 and 1945 built in 1943 , the factory became known as drakelow tunnels for its vast network of underground paths spread over three - and - a - half miles
it was one of 26 ' shadow ' sites set - up to mass produce engines and parts for military aircraft and tanks that were built underground or into hillside so that production could continue if bombed
designed by rover at the behest of the air ministry , drakelow employed 700 people when mrs mary cartwright began working there
spanning more than three miles , the site became known as the drakelow tunnels for its vast network of secret passageways the entrance to one of the tunnels which are built into hillside beneath kingsford country park , kidderminster another of the tunnels ' entrances in kingsford country park
while built at road level it is 300ft from the top of the hill set up by rover under the instruction of the air ministry , drakelow was one of 26 ' underground ' factories established to allow production lines to continue if the country came under fire with more than 700 people working at the site at a time it was one of the largest underground factories during the war mrs mary cartwright was sent to work there in 1943 after being called up at the age of 20
mrs mary cartwright had no previous experience when she was called up , but said she ' just got on with the job ' mrs mary cartwright said while the tunnels were built to protect production lines from bombing , by the time she began working at drakelow the worst of the raids had already hit the country
right , a newspaper cutting from 1941 detailing the deaths of three men killed when one of the tunnels collapsed during ' excavating operations ' ' i 'd had no experience at the time , someone , i think my sister - in - law , just gave me a book which told me how to do it and i just got on with it , ' mrs mary cartwright told mailonline
' the only woman in the laboratory , mrs mary cartwright had wanted to serve in the army before being called up
' the site was restored in the 1980s by the ministry of defence which installed two kw generators tunnel 4 , one of the main passageways used during the second world war to shuttle workers to their stations after the war ended , mrs mary cartwright trained as a teacher and spent years teaching p.e. in worcester
revisiting the drakelow tunnels with one of her sons , john , the great - grandmother said it was ' strange ' to see it so quiet
built underground , safe from the shelling of hitler 's army , workers were free to work on engines for military aircraft and tanks
it was used to produce aircraft engines specifically for four models of bristol aircraft ; the pegasus , bristol hercules , centaur and mercury
during the war it was used to produce engine parts for four bristol aircraft - bristol hercules , pegasus , centaur and mercury
