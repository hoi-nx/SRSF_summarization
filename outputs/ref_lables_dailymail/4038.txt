now fascinating images reveal how fish make a collective effort to stay out of the way of sharks
the striking photographs show a shoal of fish making way for the blacktip shark swimming in the shallow waters of heron island in queensland , australia
incredible images show a shoal of fish making way for a blacktip shark ( pictured ) , perhaps proving that they are instinctively frightened of it it is thought that the reef shark was not interested in catching a meal , but the fish naturally keep their distance , creating circles of clear water around the predator
' fish are thought to gain many benefits from shoaling behaviour , such as keeping safe from predators as well as boosting their chances of feeding and finding a mate
it âs known that shoals of fish can change shapes and directions in seconds - as if they are thinking as one - and in these images , the fish manage to keep a pocket of clear water between themselves and the shark , even the pocket does change shape

the photos show a shark swimming in the shallow waters , where they are guaranteed a clear path because â terrified â fish move out of their way software engineer scott carr was looking for a picturesque spot to have photos taken before his wedding when he came across fish trying to avoid the shark off heron island in queensland , australia ( marked ) it âs thought that shoals may be an effective means for the majority of fish within them to escape predators â jaws , because they confuse larger creatures
the â predator confusion effect â is based on the idea that it becomes difficult for predators to pick out individual prey from groups because similar - looking fish create a sensory overload for predators
the fact that there are many fish in a shoal means they have many eyes to scan an area for predators and keep out of the way
â there were four blacktip reef sharks circling the area and there was one other type of shark - a lemon shark , â he said
â we noticed a number of reef sharks patrolling the area near the jetty and as we watched the reef sharks slowly moved into the school of fish , with the fish retreating away from the immediate area around the shark
some studies claim that fish feel pain , but shoaling behaviour 's thought to be purely instinctive software engineer scott carr was looking for a picturesque spot to have photos taken before his wedding when he came across the shoal of fish trying to avoid the sharks ( pictured left and right ) near a jetty whether fish have emotions , is a slippery question for scientists , whose studies have shown that they can feel pain in an abstract way , as well as other emotions
whether fish feel fear , or simply act instinctively , they swim in large shoals that offer individuals more protection from predators than going it alone
