what cook did here , particularly in the first hour of his innings , was spot - on
this was really encouraging for the england captain but ultimately hugely frustrating because he could nât push on to that all - important hundred
cook 's innings into day three in grenada was spot on , particularly the first hour of it cook worked his way to an encouraging 50 but frustratingly was out playing gabriel on for 76 yet it is nonsense to say a batsman who has hit 25 test hundreds can not drive the ball
perhaps it has been playing too much one - day cricket , perhaps it has just been the pressure to score big runs again , but cook has been searching for the ball far too early
the england captain hits behind square on the onside as jermaine blackwood ducks for cover cook left the ball outside off stump and made the bowlers come to him , but drove when the option arose he is stronger mentally than anyone he will face , so he just has to carry on showing the same discipline
the england captain was aided by the fact the ball did not swing much for west indies , because it is the moving delivery that has caused him so many problems
cook 's off stump is rattled after a wide delivery from gabriel found the inside edge the skipper shows his frustration as his impressive innings to this point is cut short gabriel celebrates after cook 's eyes lit but the ball just lacked pace and he was through the shot too early west indies celebrate the breakthrough but cook can not admonish himself for playing at the delivery cook just has to put that one key statistic to bed and finally reach three figures , then move on with such a big summer ahead
meanwhile , trott still looked a little frenetic at the start of his innings , certainly for those first 10 to 15 runs when he was searching for the ball and driving when he did not need to
trott drives during his first innings of 59 , which started day three somewhat frenetically cook congratulates a smiling trott after his fellow opener reached his 50 milestone in the morning session yet as his innings progressed , he looked calmer and it was significant when he started walking off towards square leg between deliveries
trott has obviously been through a heck of a lot , has looked anxious and wants to prove the point that he belongs back with england and that he can open the batting in tests
trott looked calmer as his innings went on but devendra bishoo found his edge before he could go on with it trott leaves the field at st george 's - on st george 's day - after an opening partnership of 125 runs
