connolly had n't seen his teenage cousin in 10 years when she added him on facebook out of the blue in december
the 23 - year - old sunshine coast university student was enjoying semester break and training hard in the hope of one day representing australia as a champion sprinter
he messaged his 17 - year - old cousin angela * ( name has been changed for legal reasons ) to see how she was doing and soon found out she was homeless , illiterate and 32 weeks pregnant
mr connolly picked her up from where she was sleeping rough on the gold coast , let her move into his flat , took care of her through the final stage of her pregnancy and is now helping to raise her four - week - old baby boy
connolly , a 23 - year - old sunshine coast university student , took in his homeless , pregnant 17 - year - old cousin and his helping her raise her four - week - old baby boy the 23 - year - old sunshine coast university student says he did n't think twice about helping her ' i went and picked her up and she basically started telling me about her situation , which was hard for me to hear because she was my favourite little cousin when i was growing up , ' he told daily mail australia
' mr connolly said angela â whose last year of schooling was year six â had stopped taking hard drugs by the time she was 15 but at 16 she fell pregnant , and her baby 's father was sent to prison soon afterward
by the time mr connolly met up with her she was 32 weeks pregnant , and he said he did n't think twice about taking her in
angela ( not her real name ) added mr connolly on facebook after they had n't seen each other in 10 years ' obviously i 'm not going to let her stay on the streets
mr connolly ( pictured in the u.s. while studying there in 2013 ) still studies and works three days per week to support the three of them when angela gave birth to her baby joshua * ( name has been changed ) on march 17 , he was finishing off university assignments due the next day in the hospital waiting room
now that joshua is four weeks old , mr connolly continues to go to class and is working three days per week to support the three of them
and while many other 23 - year - olds would rather be spending their spare time partying with friends or travelling , he says he does n't mind the impact that looking after angela and joshua is having on his social life
' his brother liam has started a gofundme fundraising page in an effort to make mr connolly , angela and joshua 's financial situation more stable
