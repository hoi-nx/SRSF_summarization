the health reforms , which include fining agencies employing models with a bmi under 18 and criminalising pro-anorexia web content , have now passed through the upper house of parliament
an analysis of the reforms by jackson , a research psychologist at university college london , suggested that censoring images of ultra-thin models may ease their adverse effects on young women , such as concerns about body image and behaviours such as unhealthy eating
but while some have been hailing the legislation as a ' crackdown on anorexia ' , the laws may be unlikely to have any such effect
the view that anorexia is caused by comparing oneself to catwalk models remains popular
but rachel cole-fletcher , of durham university says it is not a lifestyle choice and personality traits are to blame ( file photo ) not a lifestyle choice in western europe , around 0.5 per cent of adults are thought to be affected by anorexia nervosa
despite accounts of the disorder pre-dating the fashion industry , the view that anorexia is caused by comparing oneself to a catwalk model remains popular
likewise , while pro-ana websites insist that anorexia is a commitment , not an illness , they are highly exclusive online communities , created by and for those already showing signs of the illness
research mentioned by ms jackson did find that women evaluated their bodies more negatively after viewing images of thin models
however , this effect was small and mostly determined by women 's pre-existing opinions of their figures â women who were already dissatisfied with their body were most affected
as this effect was only measured at one point in time , the effects of prolonged exposure are not known , but when more images were used there was a tendency for the effect to be smaller
the results were fairly inconsistent , with some factors â such as body dissatisfaction â only corresponding to some types of media , and others â such as self - worth â showing no relationship
more importantly , the research showed correlation , not causation â it is just as plausible that women already unhappy with their bodies seek out thinness - promoting media more often
in western europe , around 0.5 per cent of adults are thought to be affected by anorexia nervosa , but these figures tend to be underestimated , experts said ( file photo ) model ban but no support most researchers currently view the cultural value placed on thinness as a ' background risk factor '
so the legislation is likely to have little effect on the prevalence of anorexia in the general population , but it also offers no support to the models themselves
while there is some debate over whether models are at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , this career certainly encourages unhealthy behaviour
france has already lost a high - profile model to anorexia â yet the new laws almost encourage agencies to wash their hands of models who fall ill. legislation banning models with a bmi under 18 is likely to have little effect on the prevalence of anorexia in the general population , but it also offers no support to the models themselves , experts have argued in the same way , while pro-ana content is undoubtedly harmful , the new laws punish those who are in need of help
