international stars like mccullum will visit to play t20 cricket this summer , but talk among homegrown players is of how it might save england from further embarrassment in global competitions
hales and woakes , two foot soldiers in the recent world cup fiasco , both called for some rethinking of the domestic structure to avoid a repeat of what happened in australia and new zealand
at the launch of next month 's opening of the natwest t20 blast nottinghamshire 's hales admitted : ' as a team we 're not hiding behind the fact that we 're embarrassed about what happened
' hales believes england 's players are n't competing in enough t20 competitions hales was at edgbaston on thursday at the launch of this season 's t20 domestic competition both he and woakes feel that a way of improving england 's one day cricket would be to adopt more the model of countries like australia and india with their franchise systems
' the big bash is fantastic , i 've played in it for three years and really enjoyed it , ' said hales
in the last couple of years in england i have n't had much of a chance to develop
' i think that 's maybe where we got found out a bit in the world cup , not many guys get exposed to t20
there 's such a heavy schedule of test matches guys do n't get a chance to play domestic t20
other players are constantly playing in front of big crowds and improving their skills and that 's not something we had in the world cup
england were thoroughly embarrassed at the 50 - over world cup earlier this year , dumped out of their group mccullum is adept at playing t20 all over the world and hales wants more of that for english stars ' it 's tougher here with the indifferent weather and i do n't really know what goes on behind the scenes , but in terms of standard and quality i think the franchise system would work in england
' at thursday 's edgbaston launch there were players from all 18 counties , but that number would be cut down if the ecb and its new management ever get round to introducing a more city - based league
