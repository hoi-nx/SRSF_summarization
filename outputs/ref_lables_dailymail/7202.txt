for celtic , a slow - burning season has seen deila âs side raise their game after a stuttering start and eventually rout their nearest rivals
yet although the parkhead side have in recent times looked like an increasingly irresistible force in the race for the treble , it has been left to third - placed inverness to enhance their credentials as the team most likely to represent a potential stumbling block on deila âs march towards history

in august , celtic lost 1 - 0 at tulloch caledonian stadium , before gaining revenge with a 1 - 0 win at parkhead in november
on saturday , deila âs side were held to a draw by inverness
yet while celtic were surprisingly poor , the evidence from the weekend also suggests that inverness possess a potent blend of passion and physicality which , more so than any other side in the country , seems to knock deila âs men out of their stride
for goalkeeper gordon , saturday âs 1 - 1 draw - which included a quick - fire goal from leigh griffiths and one in immediate response edward ofere - served as a warning shot against complacency in the quest for a rare domestic clean sweep

but gordon reckons the recently re-laid turf at hampden will benefit inverness just as much as the treble - chasers
â the pitch at hampden will help us but it will be good for inverness as well because they like to pass the ball about
â we all know next weekend is a big one but we âve also got a midweek league match ( against kilmarnock ) at home on wednesday night sandwiched right in the middle of these two inverness games
if we can win against kilmarnock we can go into the semi-final high on confidence and looking to beat inverness
â if celtic felt ill at ease on a poor pitch and blowing wind , it did not show as the elements played a part in the opening goal after just 135 seconds

belgian defender denayer cleared the ball off the line but only as far as nigeria forward edward ofere , who was there to ram home his second goal for inverness since joining the club in january
there was precious little else to talk about in the remainder of the match , apart from some decent saves by brill âs replacement ryan esson from efe ambrose and denayer - while celtic captain brown was booked for â simulation â after colliding with raven in the box
