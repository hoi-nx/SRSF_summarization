uk exports to the rest of the world are surging ahead of those to the eu , official figures showed yesterday
it is the first time since records began that such sales of uk goods have outstripped those to the eu for six months in a row
they are also a major rebuff to tony blair , who claimed in a speech this week that quitting the eu would cause ' significant damage to our economy '
the news that uk sales to the rest of the world are surging ahead of those to europe is a major blow to former prime minister tony blair 's claim that leaving the eu would damage the economy the figures appear to vindicate david cameron 's ' mercantile ' foreign policy , which has seen him lead trade missions all over the world but total sales of uk goods overseas have fallen to the lowest level for nearly five years amid warnings that the strong pound and weak eurozone are acting like a ' straitjacket ' on exporters
uk has exported more goods to europe than the rest of the world since the uk joined the common market in the 1970s
but the gap has been closing in recent years as the crisis in the eurozone has hit demand for uk - made goods and uk firms looked further afield for business
at the same time , sales of goods stamped ' made in uk ' to the rest of the world were up 4.2 per cent to Â£ 37.9billion
' with firms on the continent so reliant on trade with the uk we are in a strong position to renegotiate our relationship inside the eu or secure a trade deal outside altogether
' uk goods overseas have fallen to the lowest level for nearly five years amid warnings that the strong pound and weak eurozone are acting like a ' straitjacket ' on exporters in a ringing endorsement of uk 's eu membership this week , mr tony blair said : ' i believe passionately that leaving europe would leave uk diminished in the world , do significant damage to our economy and , less obviously but just as important to our future , would go against the very qualities that mark us out still as a great global nation
the government should be pushing the eu as hard as possible to secure trade deals with countries where tariffs on goods still matter for uk manufacturing exporters
' but despite the shift to far - flung markets in asia and latin america , total exports have fallen to the lowest level since early in this parliament
sales of uk - made goods overseas fell by Â£ 900million or 3.7 per cent in february alone to Â£ 23.2billion â the lowest monthly figure since september 2010
' paul hollingsworth , uk economist at capital economics , said the bleak figures ' will re-ignite fears that the strong pound and weakness in demand in the euro - zone is acting as a straightjacket on exporters '
exports to china jumped 21 per cent between 2012 and 2014 sales of uk goods to south korea were up nearly 14 per cent
