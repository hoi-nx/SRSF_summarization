koeman called for saints 's players to show maturity , nous and respect after victor wanyama 's future came under question
this weekend brings with it arguably saints ' biggest match of the season , with the visit of tottenham likely to be key in the fight for european qualification
koeman says his saints players must remain focused on european qualification koeman spoke to victor wanyama and his other players to refocus them on the last five league games victor wanyama 's claims that arsenal were interested in his services were the catalyst and , while defending the 23 - year - old by saying the story was ' bull * * * * ' , koeman called for his players to show more common sense
' you know always in the last part of the season there are rumours talking about interest in players , ' the saints boss said
' such speculation about the likes of victor wanyama , nathaniel clyne and morgan schneidelin brings back memories of last summer 's talent drain from st mary 's
victor wanyama 's future came under question after an interview where he seemed to hint at a move to arsenal koeman has repeatedly insisted a similar situation will not arise this time around , although he is wise enough to know the south - coast club 's place in the food chain
' on one side it 's normal because , okay , we are saints , ' koeman said
' we are not man united , because they are always talking about new players , and normally in teams like saints , a little bit more down , they are talking about interest in players of saints
there has also been speculation about the futures of morgan schneiderlin ( left ) and nathaniel clyne saints come up against former boss mauricio pochettino on saturday in the race for the europa league ' you 're not a young kid
' koeman says he will not be enforcing a media ban to keep his players out of trouble - something he accepts is more difficult now given the power held by agents
' everybody likes to play champions league football - that 's normal
