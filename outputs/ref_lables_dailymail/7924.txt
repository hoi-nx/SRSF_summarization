no chorus of boos or whistles would stop the sweet strike rising above the 1950s tower blocks in the colombes suburbs , with the ice cool 31 - year - old mobbed by players and coaches as racing 92 were unceremoniously dumped out of the competition

charlie hodgson kicked two first - half penalties â either side of a 27th minute try for maxime machenaud after saracens lost an attacking scrum - jim hamilton was shown a yellow card , the tourists were fortunate to go into the break with a one - point advantage
â we were n't great in the first half , even though we had a very strong wind , â said saracens director of rugby mark mccall
playing into that very strong wind and with sexton playing no 10 for the opposition , being 6 - 5 up at half time felt like a mountain to climb
marcelo bosch is an argentinean utility back who moved to europe in 2006 to play for biarritz
he joined saracens in the 2013 - 14 season and has featured predominantly at centre
he is not saracens â first - choice kicker - owen farrell , charlie hodgson and alex goode are all above him - but he has a hugely powerful strike
marcelo bosch 's football skills aid his powerful kicking racing 92 winger teddy thomas shows his speed to avoid chris wyles and escape the in - goal area saracens ' stand - in captain charlie hodgson places his grubber kick underneath wenceslas lauret racing 92 and ireland fly - half sexton ( left ) locks horns with saracens winger strettle strettle is upended going for a high ball against racing 92 's brice dulin , who escapes a yellow card â but that 's where it turned around and i 'd say our second half performance was as courageous , brave and hard working as i 've seen
racing did most of the running but saracens edged further ahead , with alex goode also adding his weight to the kicking with a 47th minute penalty
marcelo bosch then tackled his countryman juan imhoff just short of the line â although the pitch - length move was subsequently pulled back for a forward pass â and billy vunipola intervened with a crucial turnover to snuff out a racing 92 attack
but saracens were unable to build upon their lead and , just past the hour mark , racing 92 narrowed the gap thanks to three points from maxime machenaud
