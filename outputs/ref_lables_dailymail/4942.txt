celtic 's treble dream died on sunday with striker leigh griffiths pointing the finger of blame squarely at the officials after his side 's shock scottish cup semi-final defeat by inverness
a blatant josh meekings handball in the box was missed by referee steven mclean and his team , particularly assistant alan muir , at the end of the first half with the parkhead club left to rue the decision not to award a penalty and dispense a red card
a goal down at the time , inverness fought back and eventually emerged victorious following a pulsating period of extra-time and the celtic players could do little to hide their fury after the match

' celtic were a virgil van dijk goal to the good at the time of the josh meekings incident but the game was then turned on its head in the second half as celtic goalkeeper craig gordon was sent off for a foul on marley watkins
with the teams level at full - time , edward ofere and john guidetti swapped goals in extra-time before david raven grabbed a 117th - minute winner â leaving the highlanders jubilant and their opponents distraught
' i have asked the centre - half in the second half if it has hit his hand or his face - and he said it hit his hand 100 per cent , so in my book that 's a penalty and a red card , ' continued leigh griffiths
' we have probably the best penalty taker in the league in kris commons , who i am sure would go and tuck it away to put us 2 - 0 up

it is a game - changing decision
if he thinks that 's him in on the face ... ? ' i do n't really want to say too much about the officials because i 'll end up in trouble
but it 's a massive , massive decision and it 's cost us the game
everyone was saying the scottish cup was practically a given
but we knew we had to come here and do a job - and it 's just unlucky that we never managed to get it done
' leigh griffiths attempts an acrobatic shot at goal during the scottish cup semi-final on sunday against inverness as much as leigh griffiths was nursing a personal grievance over being denied yet another hampden semi-final goal , the former hibs star felt for manager deila , a man who has been so open about his desire to win a treble â and his belief in this team 's ability to do so
celtic had made no bones about their determination to succeed where so many had failed , backing themselves to have the skill and strength to get the job done , whatever obstacles they might have to overcome
' i think the gaffer is the most disappointed person out of everyone , ' said the leigh griffiths
' he 'd only have been the third celtic manager to have won a treble
inverness stood in our way and did a job
