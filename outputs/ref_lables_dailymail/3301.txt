shirley , his wife mayo and seven - year - old son phoenix , were travelling back to washington after a birthday trip to disney world , orlando , when they discovered the vomit and complained to cabin crew
' she then rubbed the carpet area on the floor of our seats and discovered the whole area was wet
when she raised her had towards her face to smell the liquid , that 's when she made the horrible discovery that the liquid was vomit
my wife got up and ran towards the bathroom area of the plane with me following behind
' the shirley 's luggage remains in the plastic rubbish sacks while they decide how to clean items mr shirley says the family were told by cabin staff that a passenger on an earlier flight had been sick in the seating area , and that staff had cleaned the area
' mr shirley described how his wife was so upset she began crying and shaking , and they were given two options by united airlines staff ; fly out next day or remain in their seats
because mrs shirley had to go to work next day at the fda ( fda ) , the family say they had no choice but to remain in the seats
the family were flying back on a united airlines flight from orlando to washington ( file photo ) however , staff allegedly refused to clean and scrub down the affected area , and the passengers were given blankets , which they say did nothing to remove the pungent smell
mr shirley said : ' the pilot came out and asked if a resolution had been made
' it was completely humiliating walking through the airport with our belongings in trash bags as if we were some sort of homeless family , ' added mr shirley
' with their luggage still bagged up , mr shirley says united airlines have offered them a $ 150 flight voucher each and some ' mileage points ' a spokesperson for united airlines told mailonline travel : the situation mr shirley described is certainly one that we wish no customer experiences , as our cleaners did not fully clean the seat area prior to departure
our agents did the best they could in the short time they had to accommodate mr shirley and keep the flight on time
upon returning home , united airlines has offered the each member of the family a $ 150 voucher as well as additional mileage points for mrs shirley
however , mr shirley said : ' i personally feel it is a slap in the face considering all we had to endure on this two hour flight from hell
