samantha says she thinks she 's ' fabulous ' i sprung out of bed this morning and examined myself in the full - length bedroom mirror , and i can honestly say that there âs never a day when i would rather be someone else
but as long as i do nât mind , who cares ? which is why i âm utterly peeved about dove 's latest campaign results
how humiliating to film women in a public place â choosing â to walk through a door marked either â beautiful â or â average â
it 's hardly a big surprise the survey discovered 96 per cent of women chose the ' average ' option
from my experience , most women would rather strut out in public as naked as the day they were born than freely admit that not only are they good - looking , but they âre also ( whisper it ) beautiful
why is this ? numerous university studies have been carried out ( i know this because their authors send them to me ) and they have all come up with the same conclusion â it âs self - protection
if women do nât fit in with their ( usually older , fatter , less attractive ) female peers , then those who are good - looking wo nât get hired for jobs by the fairer sex ; their careers will stall if their boss is female and they âll routinely receive their p45 for nothing more heinous than boasting a lovely smile
even though i âm an un-botoxed , un-surgically enhanced 44 - year - old , i would have marched through the entrance marked beautiful without giving it a second thought
haters : samantha has received death threats for standing up and saying ' i 'm beautiful ' this confidence annoys the heck out of other women
the earth turned on its axis as one woman - me - was up for admitting : â i like how i look and other women have a problem with it
little wonder only four per cent of women were brave enough to walk through a door marked ' beautiful ' in the dove campaign
critical : samantha claims dove 's campaign works because it exploits our need to act modestly my personal take on this experiment is devastatingly simple : we âd rather fit in and humiliate ourselves by claiming to be average than give our fellow ' fairer ' sex any more ammunition than we 've got already against each other
whether they âre teenagers at school in the us , middle - aged mums in australia or women in the workplace in the uk : if they rate themselves , display confidence , or dare to say they look good they get bullied or socially ostracised
a recent plea from a young women in how to deal with her critics was this : â i have just looked up your article , it âs my life in black and white
reaching out : samantha receives letters from teens who get bullied for being beautiful ' i am confident and friendly , men open doors for me , they are polite
in the dove campaign , women were asked to choose between a door marked ' beautiful ' or ' average ' yet to admit to the world â yeah , i look good â means we risk incurring the wrath of other women
we have to be display modesty at all times - which is why dove 's campaign works brilliantly
in 2015 , we desperately need a seismic shift in female societal thinking so that women can say loud and proud that they âre beautiful - and not fear reprisals
