two years on , the curious and friendly joey they have dubbed ' dusty ' is now so comfortable living with the couple and their dogs lilly and rosie on their farm , near esperance in western australia , that the stewart 's are convinced he actually thinks he is a dog too
dusty rides around the property in the back of mr stewart 's truck along with the dogs , sleeps with them on a dog bed , eats with them , asks for scratches , and even tries to sneak dog treats when he can
' i loaded the dogs in and he was hanging around and looking up at the truck and so i just picked him up and put him in the back with them , ' mr stewart told daily mail australia
he 's a very placid creature , and every time you walk out the door if he 's not laying in his bed he comes up and wants a pat and a scratch , ' mr stewart said
and just like most dogs , while dusty gets along well with lilly and rosie , he does n't care much for the couple 's cat
dusty the kangaroo sleeps and eats with the dogs , and often tries to sneak their food as well as his own mr stewart said that dusty will hold his arms up and wrap them around like he is trying to give a cuddle ' he just likes to hang out with the dogs , probably because he thinks he 's a dog
he eats and sleeps with them , and will wander down to the shed with them and lay around if i 'm working there , ' mr stewart said
' when he was little we used to let him out during the day and he 'd go off grazing and would n't come back at night , so we 'd have to go looking for him , ' mr stewart said
' although when we feed the dogs he often wants what they 're having , ' said mr stewart
