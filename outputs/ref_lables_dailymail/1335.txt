a busy town centre was brought to a standstill this afternoon after a mysterious 15 - foot sinkhole opened up in the road without warning - almost swallowing a number of cars in the process
motorists had to swerve out of the way of the giant hole after it appeared on the residential earl street in northampton at around 2pm , just hours after part of a london pavement collapsed , swallowing a pedestrian
shocking pictures show the gaping chasm - which was around eight foot ( 2.4 metres ) wide - with a section of surrounding road also looking on the verge of collapse
a barmaid from the charles bradlaugh pub , opposite the hole , who did not wish to be named , said : ' we saw it from inside the pub. ' it was weird
' police were here pretty quick but cars had to swerve out of the way until we went out and stopped them ' it is incredible
it is like something you would see in a disaster movie
' gradual : one eyewitness said the road ' gave way really slowly ' as people watched on unbelievable : another person watching it collapse was ' like something you would see in a disaster movie ' van driver chris williams , 30 , who was stuck in the traffic which backed as a result of the hole , added : ' i could n't believe it
' coincidence : the five foot wide by two and a half foot long hole which suddenly appeared in london today meanwhile , investigations are continuing into how the pavement outside a cafe in fulham , south - west london , came to collapse at about 8.50am
a woman , said to be in her 40s , had to be hospitalised after she fell through the hole into the basement of a cafe
passers - by reported hearing a loud scream before the woman fell into the gap and early reports suggested she had been pushing a pram - although it 's now thought it was a shopping trolley
