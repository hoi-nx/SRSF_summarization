when van gaal talked about michael carrick and wayne rooney as coaches on the pitch last week , it actually revealed far more than you might at first imagine
the backdrop is a season at old trafford where champions league football looks likely , but at the same time it is fair to say manchester united have only been truly convincing in a few isolated games
van gaal has identified michael carrick ( left ) and wayne rooney as two of his most bright players van gaal demands a level of ' football intelligence ' from his players at manchester united manchester united now have a eight - point cushion over liverpool and are in good shape to make the champions league van gaal revealed why manchester united have almost stumbled into the top four this season when he praised michael carrick and wayne rooney
he basically said too many players at manchester united are nât very bright
of course there are exceptions : juan mata is a cultured , classy individual on and off the pitch
michael carrick and wayne rooney have football intelligence in abundance : hence michael carrick slipping seamlessly in and out of the centre - half position mid-game at times this season , and wayne rooney slotting into whichever position van gaal asks him to occupy
the dutchman can trust these players
let me give you a couple of examples : last summer his first encounter with luke shaw was to set up a separate training regime for the teenager because he was so unfit
spanish midfielder juan mata is another cultured , classy player in manchester united 's team wayne rooney showed plenty of intelligence to turn and volley home manchester united 's second goal on saturday luke shaw had to take part in extra pre-season training sessions to reach the necessary fitness levels imagine signing for manchester united and being so unfit you ca nât take part in pre-season training sessions
ander herrera played well on saturday but at one point in the first - half with manchester united pressing he launched a ridiculous pass from the right - wing position , back into his own half
ander herrera score twice against aston villa but also played a notably poor pass to marcos rojo phil jones makes himself prone to injuries by crashing into tackles fellaini had his football intelligence hammered out of him by the disastrous moyes regime a continental colleague told me that van gaal is frustrated by the lack of football intelligence he has found in the squad at old trafford
and this issue of a lack of football intelligence in the squad and at the club needs a long - term solution
