skyfaring by vanhoenacker , has acquired a morbid flavour since germanwings flight 9525 was deliberately crashed into the french alps by its troubled co-pilot lubitz
the tragedy ignited an ongoing debate about stress and depression among pilots , and airline vetting procedures , in which just about all of us have a vested interest
this makes vanhoenacker âs book , unwittingly , very timely indeed
vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with british airways , who wants us simply to understand his passion for his job , and to share with us many of its more beguiling secrets
vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with british airways and he wants the reader to simply understand his passion for his job vanhoenacker , an american , worked as a management consultant before rekindling that childhood obsession
but vanhoenacker moved on to boeing 747s , and they are his great love
vanhoenacker recalls a wildlife writer once describing virginia âs great blue heron as â the 747 of the swamp â and notes how this would delight the aircraft âs chief designer , sutter , who was greatly influenced by the anatomy of birds
pilots like flying 747s for all kinds of reasons , vanhoenacker tells us , but not the least of them is one of the most prosaic : unlike the airbus , in which pilots usually wear heavy socks , they have foot heaters
vanhoenacker will get to the airport 90 minutes before he pilots his 747 to los angeles or tokyo , and there will meet the rest of the crew , 20 or so strong
â before boarding , he will brief the cabin crew on what kind of flight time and weather to expect , while they will tell him if there âs anything noteworthy about the passenger roster , and whether any of the british airways staff on board have friends or family on the flight , people known , splendidly , as â klingons â
these often relate directly to the place below , so above boston in vanhoenacker âs home state , there is the waypoint lbsta , referring to the region âs prized shellfish , and another , leonard nimoy , after one of the city âs more notable sons , the late actor leonard nimoy , who played mr spock in star trek
vanhoenacker âs best guess is that an air - traffic controller there was a fan of eurythmics â singer annie lennox
maybe one day , vanhoenacker hopes , wide - eyed children will again be allowed in the cockpit during a flight
