nestled in eastern long island is a sleepy little town called yaphank where the streets have cozy names like oak and park , names that hide a dark past : they once bore signs like hitler and goebbels streets
yaphank , in the 1930s , appeared as a haven for u.s. -- most of them of german heritage -- who sympathized with the causes of the nazi
in fact , it was largely founded as a nazi camp , one of several scattered across the u.s. , where the children in the german american bund ( aka american nazis ) could fish , swim , hunt and learn about things like eugenics
the group set up pro-nazi camps where they could put on military demonstrations , teach their children about fascism and enjoy the outdoors today , yaphank is still a town on long island
the german american bund in yaphank , as it did in similar communities in pennsylvania , wisconsin and new jersey , organized military demonstrations where they waved both the u.s. and nazi flags
in an article published in the long island history journal , stony brook university historian ryan shaffer describes a typical day at camp siegfried thusly : ' locals from yaphank , jamesport , aquebogue , and riverhead visited the camp to drink beer , join in the festive atmosphere walking or driving down hitler street to salute u.s. and nazi flags
' hitler street : yaphank once had streets named hitler , goebbels and goering as well as berliner and hamberger
most of the names have since been changed , but the county still retains the original maps swastika hedge : gone now , too , are the swastikas that once adorned the lawns and buildings of the camp and town ' locals from yaphank , jamesport , aquebogue , and riverhead visited the camp to drink beer , join in the festive atmosphere walking or driving down hitler street to salute u.s. and nazi flags , ' notes stony brook university historian ryan shaffer in the years leading to u.s. joining the allies , the fbi and new york police started to keep an eye on the german american bund in yaphank
adolf hitler street is now park street , goering is now oak and goebbels is northside avenue
