a controversial pro-israel advocacy group known for publicly criticizing islam can display its political advertisement containing the phrase ' killing jews is worship ' on new yorkers 's buses , a judge ruled this week
judge koeltl said in a decision made public tuesday that the incendiary ad is speech protected under the first amendment
he said he was sensitive to the mta 's claim that the poster could incite violence and appreciates the efforts necessary to prevent violent attacks targeting jews people
afdi 1 , mta 0 : a federal judge has ordered the mta to run on its buses anti-islam ads featuring the phrase ' killing jews is worship ' created by the pro-israel lobby american freedom defense initiative but he noted that substantially the same advertisement ran in san francisco and chicago in 2013 without incident
koeltl also noted that the mta and chairman thomas prendergast ' underestimate the tolerant quality of new yorkers and overestimate the potential impact of these fleeting advertisements
it came in a lawsuit filed last year by the american freedom defense initiative , an organization headed by firebrand blogger pamela geller that 's behind the advertisement
' an ad from the pro-israel american freedom defense initiative is seen on an articulated septa ( septa ) bus featuring a 1941 photograph of hitler and supporter hajj amin al-husseini , a palestinian arab nationalist , wednesday , april 1 , 2015 , in philadelphia the lawsuit was filed after the mta notified the group in august that it would display three of four proposed posters but not an ad with the quote ' killing jews is worship that draws us close to allah ' because it could incite violence
the mta , whose buses and subways have been forums for policy debates , has accepted other ads from the american freedom defense initiative
in a september statement , the mta said it recognized that the ' killing jews ' ad was a parody of ' myjihad ' ads sponsored by the council on american-islamic relations , which said it was promoting the concept that jihad is an individual and personal struggle rather than a violent conflict or terrorism
defeat jihad ' in new yorkers on september 24 , 2012 but he said he believes the agency underestimates ' the power of counter-advertisements to explain that the mta does not endorse the ad and that the ad is not to be taken seriously
