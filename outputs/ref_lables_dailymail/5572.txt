with just over a week to go until the kate hits her due date , preparations for the new arrival at her norfolk home , dubbed ' fortress anmer ' , have been heating up
fittings for both are thought have come from luxury children 's furniture emporium , dragons of knightsbridge , where moses baskets start at Â£ 75
but in a curious twist , it is understood that kate had several pots of pink paint delivered to anmer hall from the annie sloane store a couple of weeks ago
home : the new baby will spend its first few weeks at his or her parents ' norfolk home , anmer hall london pad : the new arrival will also have the run of a second nursery at kensington palace each pot comes with a price tag fit for a royal , with just one litre of the paint costing Â£ 18.95
kensington palace refused to comment on the story saying that they could neither ' confirm ' nor ' deny ' that the couple had plans to paint the nursery
echoing the palace 's line , a spokesman for annie sloan said the company could not â confirm or deny â that it had supplied paints to anmer hall
' boy or girl ? kate 's pink coat and pink paints have fuelled speculation over the new baby 's sex compelling : annie sloan has supplied three feminine paint samples to anmer hall whatever the nursery 's eventual colour , more work still has gone in to turning anmer hall into a secluded property where prince george - and his new sibling - can enjoy a relatively normal childhood
prince george has been cutting his teeth on old - fashioned wooden toys , while his reading material includes the george books - the first of which was published in the 1950s
prepared : the duke and kate also have plenty of pieces left over from prince george traditional : the duke and kate have traditional tastes and prefer old - fashioned toys one for george : the couple were presented with a dorothy and theodore box when george was born tally ho ! both royal children are likely to start riding as soon as they are big enough , much like the queen kate , who has made no secret of her liking for traditional fittings such as moses baskets , is also likely to follow suit when it comes to toy boxes
