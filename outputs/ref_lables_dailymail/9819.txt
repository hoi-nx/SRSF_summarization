fighter pilots flying the deadly f-35 lightning ii jet have very special secret weapon - a $ 400,000 helmet that allows them to see through the plane
six infrared cameras mounted around the aircraft allow its pilots to ' look through ' the air - frame , giving them a perfect 360 degree view of their surroundings and enemies
and all of the information they need to complete their mission - airspeed , altitude and even warnings systems - are projected straight onto the helmet 's visor rather than the traditional ' heads - up display '
each custom - made piece of high - tech headgear costs nearly half a million dollars , which is reportedly millions over its original budget due to development problems
earlier versions of the helmet did not deal well with turbulence and there was a delay in the state - of - the - art video system which caused motion sickness , the washington post reports
the f-35 lightning ii has what is considered to be ' one of the most complicated weapons systems ever '
whereas a fighter jet like the f-22 is programmed with around 1.7 million lines of software code , the f-35 lightning ii has up to a staggering 8 million
trouble : earlier versions of the helmet did not deal well with turbulence and there was a delay in the state - of - the - art video system which caused motion sickness state - of - the - art : the information which would usually be on the ' heads - up display ' - airspeed , altitude and even warnings systems - is projected straight onto the helmet 's visor joint attack : the helmet is so advanced that it allows pilots to share information with other f - 35 jets nearby military force : the u.s. government estimated the f-35 lightning ii would cost around $ 1.5trillion to develop over the next 50 years the helmet incredibly allows pilots to share information with other f-35 lightning ii 's near it but that function has also had teething problems , the program 's executive officer
air force lt. gen. chris bogdan said : ' if one or two jets are flying together , they have been able to share information seamlessly
the state - of - the - art helmet - which costs $ 400,000 - give the pilot real - time access to battle space information with 360 - degree coverage of their surroundings
