here , the 30 - year - old from bexleyheath discusses his family 's visits to portland , coming up against orlando city 's brazilian star kaka and the upcoming clash against fierce rivals seattle sounders on monday morning at 2:30am uk time
that was how long a group of our fans camped outside providence park before the game against fc dallas
they already had tickets , but just wanted to be first into the stadium
sounds crazy right ? i was walking around the city with nat borchers and we stopped to have a chat
it âs wicked to see supporters ' passion , and they carry that throughout the matches
on game day i love the national anthem at the start
it âs not mine but it really gees me up
the fans swing their scarves and sing
it âs an honour to play in front of them
ridgewell in action for the portland with the new mls season well under way in the united states of america ridgewell ( right ) attempts to gee up his side during a match against new york city fc last week we beat dallas 3 - 1 for our first victory of the season , which was especially pleasing as my children luca and eva were over visiting with my parents bob and linda
nice to get up and running
it âs been raining quite a bit but one day we got the paddle boards out , and the kids had a splash on the lake behind my house
luca , who âs nine , came into training with me every day
he went training with the timbers under - 9s one day and met gavin , the general manager , and the owner merritt
ridgewell ( back , second right ) lines up for a portland team photo ahead of an mls match portland and orlando city walk onto the field ahead of an mls match in oregon earlier this month portland mascot timber joey uses a chainsaw to cut a timber slab after a goal is scored nat borchers is my central defensive partner and beard brother
his is huge and makes me look like a nine year old boy
nat borchers holds up a timber slab after portland beat fc dallas 3 - 1 earlier this month the whole family of 12 is flying out and i had dad doing some jobs around the house to prepare
there are a lot of vineyards we can visit and we want to trek up mount hood , the highest point in oregon
it is technically an active volcano , though i read the chances of an eruption in the next 30 years are about three per cent , so i think we âll be alright
to organise the current range we went to a hotel in london ( during the mls winter break ) and sifted through thousands of prints laid out in front of us , more or less going off our instincts
after dallas we lost at home to orlando city , who were inspired by kaka
he kept it simple with one - twos and his presence on the pitch was clear
kaka ( front centre ) poses for a photo alongside his orlando city team - mates ahead of the portland match kaka ( left ) on the ball with montreal impact 's nigel reo-coker giving chase during a match last month it was frustrating not to do better but i watched him play in the world cup so to walk out with him and be captain on the same day was a real privilege
we redeemed ourselves in the next game at new york , winning 1 - 0
when i first signed my professional contract with villa i took the family to united states of america and new york
new york city fc 's david villa ( right ) looks to leave new england revolution 's scott caldwell in his wake up next on sunday night united states of america time are seattle sounders , our fiercest rivals
there will be 65,000 there and the atmosphere promises to be intense , louder than a villa - blues derby
i knew i had made the right call to come to the mls
