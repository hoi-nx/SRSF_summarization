there is an insufficient supply of whooping cough vaccine in australia , according to queensland health
however , medical professionals insist the resource shortage will not affect the immunisation programs for babies , children and pregnant women
it comes less than a month after the death of 32 - day - old riley who died after contracting whooping cough
his parents catherine and greg are now leading a campaign , urging adults to vaccinate themselves and their children to prevent more infant deaths from the terrible disease
the adult whooping cough vaccine will not be available in australia until july , according to abc news
however , although whooping cough is less severe in adults , infected adults do pose a serious risk for infants and children who are not vaccinated
' we have sufficient stocks to vaccinate children as part of the school - based vaccination program
' on march 15 , two days before baby riley died , his mother catherine posted a devastating photo of her son wrapped up in a blanket in his hospital bed urging people to get themselves and their children immunised against whooping cough
' if you 're anti-immunisation / anti-logic / anti-duty of care to your society as a whole , then feel free to take a look at this picture of my son in hospital right now at 4 weeks old with whooping cough - and then come and tell me how you think immunisation is a bad thing , ' riley 's father greg added
infectious diseases expert at anu medical school canberra , senanayake , told daily mail australia : ' from my point of view immunisation is wonderful particularly for whooping cough
' whooping cough is lethal in babies and in adults people can be absent from work for the persistent cough , it 's a nasty infection
the government health website says the disease is ' highly infectious and most serious in babies under the age of 12 months '
it 's very rare for children who have been immunised against whooping cough to get the disease â and if they do , it 's usually not as serious
information supplied by healthdirect.gov.au in 2013 , the department of health report said that despite a long - standing immunisation program , ' pertussis remains highly prevalent in australia and the least well controlled of all vaccine - preventable diseases '
