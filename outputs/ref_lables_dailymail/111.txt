ben affleck today finally admitted the name of the slave ancestor he had censored from his past
the oscar - winning actor posted on social media that a ' benjamin cole ' of georgia , an ancestor on his mother 's side , was the relative dropped from the pbs show about his family history
the admission came the day after he apologized for lobbying for the removal of the truth about his family past from finding your roots
his name was benjamin cole - lived in georgia on my mom 's side about six generations back
after appearing on finding your roots and learning one of his ancestors was a slave owner , ben affleck pushed the network to leave that information out of the program it was first revealed by dailymail online , a request the producers ultimately agreed to
however , the admission suggests ben affleck may have more than one slave - owning ancestor
it has also plunged pbs into crisis , and according to a prominent commentator , ' diminished ' prof gates , the host of the show , who is a harvard university academic
last night the actor apologized for asking producers to leave out the name in a post on facebook , while also explaining his reasons for his decision
' after an exhaustive search of my ancestry for finding your roots , it was discovered that one of my distant relatives was an owner of slaves , ' wrote ben affleck
' i did n't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves
finding your roots is a show where you voluntarily provide a great deal of information about your family , making you quite vulnerable , ' he explained
' spotlight : the future of prof gates as the host of the show is in the balance after pbs launched an investigation into whether its editorial code was breached
us genealogist fleming is said to have helped trace ben affleck 's family tree back to mcguire , a relative of his father timothy
pbs meanwhile is conducting an internal investigation to determine if this omission violated the network 's editorial standards
however , the affair has also called into question the future of the show 's host , prof gates after an exhaustive search of my ancestry for ' finding your roots , ' it was discovered that one of my distant relatives was an owner of slaves
i did n't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves
finding your roots is a show where you voluntarily provide a great deal of information about your family , making you quite vulnerable
while i do n't like that the guy is an ancestor , i am happy that aspect of our country 's history is being talked about
pbs declined today to offer any guarantees that he would remain host of the show
the publicly - funded broadcaster was severely criticized by its ombudsman for its handling of ben affleck and daily mail online 's revelations
' on the broader points , it seems to me that any serious program about genealogy , especially dealing with celebrities , can not leave out a slave - owning ancestor , ' he said
' ... gates , aside from the decision he made â and it looks to me like a bad one â also , in my opinion , violated the well - known " no surprises doctrine " for public affairs programming and many other things by not informing pbs about these demands by ben affleck '
