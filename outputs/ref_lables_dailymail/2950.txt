durst , who was heir to a vast real estate empire before becoming estranged from his family , was arrested last month for the suspected 2000 murder of his friend , writer susan berman , in la
he said he ' hated la traffic , which makes houston look like a small town ' before going on to say that his interests are ' opera and pro football '
your politicos and business leaders have chosen to fight rather than agree to disagree and there was no football
i am sure you know what your abilities are to visit me when i get to louisiana , which is , if any of this gets published , please copy me bob ( grammar and spelling errors throughout ) durst ( right ) was long thought to be involved in the murder of his friend and confidante susan berman ( left ) before his arrest
he is currently state and federal gun charges before being extradited to california he blamed the lack of football in la on ' politicos and business leaders ' who ' have chosen to fight rather than agree to disagree '
handwriting , including that on a 2000 letter to beverly hills police informing them about the dead body of susan berman , is expected to play a part in the case against durst for the murder of his friend evidence that came to light during the filming of hbo 's the jinx shows similar handwriting to the ' cadaver ' letter on an envelope sent to susan berman before her death ( left )
the hbo documentary series the jinx delved into a letter durst wrote to susan berman obtained by the victim 's stepson kaufman durst , seen with the jinx director andrew jarecki , willingly participated in the series , though he was later caught telling himself that he killed all the people he is accused of murdering durst admitted to chopping up the body of the texas man , morris black , and dumping into galveston bay , but said the killing was in self - defense
the arrest in the susan berman case , in which durst was long thought to have played a part , came after new evidence from the victim 's stepson was shown as part of the hbo series
durst ( right ) is also thought to have been involved in the disappearance of his first wife kathleen mccormack ( right ) and admitted to killing morris black ( left ) but said it was in self - defense durst 's lawyer deguerin ( pictured in march ) said that he does not mind his client sending letters from prison as long as they do n't give away legal strategy an episode also focused on a letter to susan berman from durst obtained by susan berman 's stepson kaufman , where the handwriting matched a message to police alerting them of the writer 's death
initial los angeles police investigations into the ' cadaver ' letter believed that susan berman 's manager nyle brenner wrote the message , according to the new york daily news
however the handwriting matches the letter from kaufman , who is mentioned in durst 's recent letter to hennessey-fiske as his broker for an apartment deal , and contained the same spelling mistake of beverly hills as ' beverly hills '
durst 's lawyer mr deguerin told the los angeles times that the handwriting appeared authentic , but ' it certainly does nât look like the cadaver letter '
durst ends his letter to hennessey-fiske by saying that she is probably aware of her ability to visit him once he returns to la .
