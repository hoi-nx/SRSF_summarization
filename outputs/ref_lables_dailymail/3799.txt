primatologists working in ntokou-pikounda national park have captured the first ever picture of the bouvier 's red colobus monkey
' mr lieven spent three months , after setting off in february , searching the jungles of congo in an attempt to find the bouvier red colobus monkeys , or piliocolobus bouvieri
however , they found that the creatures appear to be extremely vulnerable to hunters involved in the commercial bushmeat trade in the area
red colobus monkeys are among the largest primates in the forests of congo and are prized by hunters
rather than fleeing , red colobus monkeys tend to look down at humans from the trees
the last unconfirmed sighting of a bouvier 's red colobus monkey was in the 1970s and they are mentioned in a book from 1949 as living in swamp forests aong the likouala and sangha rivers
a video is shown above the bouvier 's red colobus monkey lives in stretches of jungle alongside rivers in the congo ( pictured above ) the only previous examples of them had been collected more than 100 years ago
dr fiona maisels , from the wcs , said : ' we âre very pleased indeed that lieven and gaã«l were able to achieve their objective of not only confirming that bouvier âs red colobus still exists , but also managing to get a very clear close - up picture of a mother and infant
' thankfully , many of these colobus monkeys live in the recently gazetted national park and are protected from threats such as logging , agriculture , and roads , all of which can lead to increased hunting
' james deutsch , vice president for conservation strategy at the wcs , added : ' confirmation that bouvier âs red colobus still thrives in the this area reminds us that there remain substantially intact wild places on earth , and should re-energize all of us to save them before it is too late
