the book sex by numbers : what statistics can tell us about sexual behaviour was released this week and it 's a must - read for anyone fascinated by who really does what , where , when and how in bed
the author , david spielgalhalter , a cambridge university professor , sets out to investigate various sexual statistical claims and separate myth from reality
since no other part of the human body is more shrouded in myth and folklore than men 's most precious part , it seemed the penis was the most deserving subject to study
here 's what the latest research has to say : so , it is really six inches ? a new paper in the british journal of urology international is based on the results of scientists who reviewed 20 different studies of penis size , including 15,521 measurements of penises from around the world
most importantly , it was based only on studies where the penis had been measured by a trained health professional ( surprise , surprise : men are n't terribly honest or accurate when they measure it themselves )
if he wants to diy , the correct way to measure a penis is to use a cloth measuring tape , not a straight - edged ruler
tracey investigate various sexual statistical claims and separates myth from reality the average time between penetration and him ejaculating ( for heterosexual couples ) is nine minutes
what does make sense ( though , again not proven ) is that men who have difficulties turn to porn as a way of experiencing sex without embarrassment
great sex does not depend on a big penis
a study including opinions of 25 highly respected sex therapists identified eight elements that make up the best sex you can possibly expect
guess what ? the penis did n't even get a look in
the myth that big hands / big feet / big nose means a big penis has no scientific proof or evidence supporting it whatsoever
but height did make a difference : the taller the man , the longer his penis is likely to be
bald guys have a stronger sex drive
the average number of erections per day for most men is seven
