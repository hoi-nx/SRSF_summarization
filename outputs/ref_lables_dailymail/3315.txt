a post reporter detained in iran has been charged with espionage and collaborating with ' hostile governments ' , nine months after his arrest
the charges against jason rezaian had been shrouded in secrecy until now in what has become a politically sensitive case that has parallelled with high - level nuclear talks between iran and global powers , including the us
monday , jason rezaian 's lawyer leila ahsan detailed the four serious offences her client faces , in a decision branded absurd monday by the white house and the newspaper
as well as allegedly spying under the first two charges , the 39 - year - old journalist , the post 's tehran correspondent , stands accused of gathering classified information and of disseminating propaganda against the islamic republic
but she said requests for bail had been turned down and criticised iran media for publishing allegations about jason rezaian that are ' wrong and contrary to reality '
however ahsan said : ' jason rezaian is a journalist and the nature of his work is to have access to information and to publish it
' jason rezaian was detained in tehran on july 22 last year , along with his iran wife yeganeh salehi , also a journalist , who was released on bail after spending two - and - a - half months in custody
white house spokesman josh earnest said it had no official confirmation of the allegations , but if reports of jason rezaian being accused of spying were true it would be ' absurd ' and that the charges should be ' immediately dropped '
' iran 's foreign minister mohammad javad zarif ( pictured ) last week said the reporter faced ' very serious ' allegations but it was a matter for iran 's judiciary in a rare official comment regarding jason rezaian , gholamhossein esmaili , tehran 's judiciary chief , said monday : ' the file is thick and contains different aspects
' in a statement , the post 's executive editor martin baron said : ' the grave charges against jason rezaian that iran has now disclosed could not be more ludicrous
' it is absurd and despicable to assert , as iran 's judiciary is now claiming , that jason rezaian 's work first as a freelance reporter and then as the post 's tehran correspondent amounted to espionage
