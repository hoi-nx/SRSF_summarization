cameron took on church bishops yesterday after they questioned the morality of his austerity and welfare policies
in an easter message to christians , the prime minister insisted the coalition had spent five years â trying to lift people up â by making work pay and encouraging responsibility
â just because some people have disagreed with our policies , does not mean those policies are missing in moral content , â he insisted
six weeks ago , the church provoked a row with ministers by publishing an unprecedented guide to how the country âs 30million christians should â approach the general election â
bishops insisted it was not targeted at any particular party , and criticised successive governments while calling for a â fresh moral vision â
but much of the 50 - page document was widely interpreted as indirect criticism of the coalition âs welfare policies , which include a Â£ 26,000 - a - year cap on household benefits , a new universal credit designed to ensure people are always better off in work and tough sanctions to prevent people languishing on jobless benefits
the archbishop of canterbury the most rev justin welby - pictured ahead of a service for the re-burial of richard iii at leicester cathedral last week - has seen the church come under fire from the pm despite evidence that the best - off are paying more in tax than ever before , the bishops also complained that â the greatest burdens of austerity have not been borne by those with the broadest shoulders â
archbishop of york john sentamu blamed welfare cuts and ' poverty wages ' for rising inequality speaking to premier christianity magazine , mr cameron said the â values of the christian faith are the values on which our nation was built â
and for me , the key point is this : the values of easter and the christian religion â compassion , forgiveness , kindness , hard work and responsibility â are values that we can all celebrate and share , â he added
mr cameron conceded he was not a model christians and was â a bit hazy on the finer points of our faith â
the prime minister said he had attempted to â banish the notion that being in government means you can somehow wave a magic wand and solve all the world âs problems â , and instead it was about â the right judgement â¦ based on clear values and beliefs â
â to call yourself a christian in contemporary britain is to invite pity , condescension or cool dismissal
