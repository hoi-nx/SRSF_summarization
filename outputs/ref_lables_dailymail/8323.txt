so why are we running out of them ? why does the last surviving male of the northern sub-species of the white rhino now live under a 24 - hour guard ? why has he been stripped of his horn ? why is it that we seem to be on the brink of losing an entire race of rhinos ? threatened : sudan is the target of poachers looking to sell rhino horn which can make up to Â£ 47,000 a kilo this is the lonely rhino , known as sudan , guarded day and night by rangers who risk their own lives as they try to keep him from poachers
even without his horn , his keepers in the kenyan reserve of ol pejeta fear for his safety
a rhino âs horn is made from keratin , the same stuff as fingernails
you could try selling your keratin at Â£ 47,000 a kilo
you probably would nât find many takers , but it âs no more absurd than selling rhino horn for the same purposes and price
people will pay an absurd amount for an absurd product because of an absurd belief : that rhino horn is the most wonderful kind of medicine
today , the wildlife business â including the sale of rhino horn â represents the third - largest illegal trade in the world , after arms and drugs
and there is huge â and growing â demand
the horns were removed and they were sold on the asia medicine market
dangerous : the rangers are aware they are risking their lives to protect the enormous animal failure : but attempts at breeding have been unsuccessful - and sudan is now getting old last year in africa 1,215 rhinos were poached and killed
it âs driven by money , and the more horn costs the more desirable the stuff becomes
prestige , status , vanity and belief in magic drive the trade in rhino horn
the fact that it âs useless for anyone but a rhino has no bearing on demand
rhino horn has for centuries been part of traditional china medicine , and it âs used to treat disorders of the blood
increasing prosperity in china has led to higher demand
the country âs new wealth has kick - started a craze for rhino horn
they take a much more free and easy attitude to its powers there : it âs regarded as a cure for cancer , and it âs also used a pick - me - up after a big night
can the trade possibly be stopped ? there are two ways of doing so : policing the poaching , smuggling and sale with more commitment , and reducing the demand in the places where people buy the stuff
in 2012 , the africa and vietnamese governments signed a memorandum of understanding , agreeing to work with closer co-operation to stop the trade
in vietnamese a non-governmental organisation called education for nature in vietnamese ( env ) is trying to make rhino horn uncool
it has a public service announcement with vietnamese âs great singing diva , hong nhung , standing by a poached and dehorned corpse telling the vietnamese not to use rhino horn
and in another sequence , a comedian plays a rich man trying to impress the girls with his hideously expensive chunk of horn
â env runs a hotline for information about rhino horn use and a database
the organisation has plenty of young volunteers and a good deal of their work is making rhino horn unthinkable for the next generation
it gets some of its funding from the excellent london - based organisation rhino â of which i âm a patron
extreme measures : rangers have even cut off the rhino 's horn - but they fear it wo n't be enough hungry : feeding time in sudan 's enclosure - he spent most of his life in a czech zoo there are also many good projects for rhino conservation in africa and across the world
