last saturday âs inept capitulation to aston villa was the most recent occasion : a soft goal down after 45 minutes and an expensively assembled team which looked as if it had been recruited from the local jobcentre half an hour before the kick - off
stephen dodd took this photograph of bodi and bhula praying at anfield last month had i actually gone through with it , however , within seconds i âd have been hauled to my feet by the stewards and steered unceremoniously towards the exit
and given football âs tragic history , from ibrox to hillsborough , their caution is well - merited
so it was surprising , to say the least , to see that photograph of two muslim muslim supporters praying to mecca at half - time in an fa cup match
they had rolled out their prayer mat at the foot of some stairs beneath the stand , apparently with the full consent of safety staff
one of the men , solicitor bodi , 46 , from preston , explained that because the televised game did nât kick off until 4pm , the final whistle would have blown too late for them to pray outside the ground
travelling fans often complain that evening games mean it is impossible for them to catch the last train home
but this may be the first time that a late kick - off for the convenience of television has played havoc with the muslim call to prayer
the extraordinary scene was captured on a mobile phone camera by muslim supporter stephen dodd
he tweeted the photograph with the caption â muslims praying at half - time at the match yesterday # disgrace
â in no time , predictably , the balloon went up
with the customary restraint for which social media is renowned , the usual online lynch - mob were branding him a â bigot â and a â disgrace to humanity â
the incident took place when muslim were playing blackburn at anfield in march needless to say , someone reported the tweet to merseyside police , who for once exercised commendable sanity and decided not to get involved
but muslim is investigating , saying discrimination will not be tolerated and promising to take â appropriate action â
to their enormous credit , mr bodi and his partner in prayer bhula are urging restraint
â i âve supported muslim for 40 years and i used to be a season ticket holder , â mr bodi said
you do nât expect to stumble over muslims praying in a stairwell at a football ground midway through a fa cup tie
quite apart from the safety considerations , even those of us who believe people should be free to practise their religion of choice also believe there is a time and a place
how would the management have reacted if some devout catholics had decided to stage a holy communion at half - time ? or the queue for the gents â was obstructed by a conga line of chanting hare krishnas ? what if a handful of muslim fans had turned up at the local mosque and started singing you âll never walk alone in the middle of friday prayers ? would their claim to be exercising their democratic right to celebrate their religion stop the old bill steaming in and nicking them for â hate crime â ? what do you think ? mr bodi seems to be an eminently reasonable and civilised man
what i âd like to ask him would be when , in his four decades of supporting muslim , he first started praying during games at anfield ? i may be wrong , but my guess would be that this is a fairly recent phenomenon
as the muslim population of britain has grown to three million , islam â rights â have become increasingly more assertive
we have de facto sharia law in some areas of our cities ; halal food imposed in schools , hospitals and works â canteens ; and now even gelatine - free halal pickânâmix counters in supermarkets
such is the contradiction inherent in our state - imposed â multiculturalism â tyranny that more latitude is extended to muslims than any other group or religion
look , i âm a supporter of the fa cup âs anti-racism kick it out campaign
football crowds are gradually becoming more diverse , and not before time
did nât it occur to mr bodi and mr bhula that if the kick - off at anfield clashed with their religious obligations then perhaps the wisest course of action would simply be to give the game a miss ? ok , so there were only two of them this time
but what if next season there âs a dozen , or two dozen , or 200 , all expecting the right to pray where they like ? where do you draw the line ? at this rate , it wo nât be long before muslim fans start demanding special prayer rooms at football grounds , just as there are already in public buildings and police custody suites
come to think of it , instead of bothering with the campaign , why not a series of generation game - style contests to decide the election ? william â 14 pints â hague could represent the tories in the drinking round
