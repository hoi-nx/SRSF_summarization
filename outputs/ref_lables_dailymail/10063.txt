the performance of jimmy anderson on the last morning of the second test was one of the greatest i have seen from an england cricketer
england captain cook celebrates as he scores the runs to defeat west indies in the second test cook ( left ) dives to his left to take a catch at first slip and claim the wicket of chanderpaul england must remember that , having won a crucial toss , they had the best conditions against the eighth - ranked side in the world
jimmy anderson may have won it with his extraordinary display but the key to me in england going one - up was the captaincy and batting of cook
there were times during the ashes when it was very clear who was leading australia on the field but not so obvious who was in charge of england
arms were being waved everywhere and , if you did not know cook was the england captain , you would never have guessed it from watching them
he seems to be on top of the big two senior bowlers in jimmy anderson and broad , as was made clear in the first test when he had a little argument over fielding positions with jimmy anderson and very much got his own way
jimmy anderson ( left ) celebrates the dismissal of west indies batsman marlon samuels cook ( left ) celebrates with team - mate ballance ( right ) during the second test last week and it makes such a massive difference to the captain if he is scoring runs
ok , cook has nât scored that elusive century yet and the big test will come when he faces the moving ball again but for now his game looks in very good order again and he is making very good half - centuries
cook ( right ) kicks the wicket in frustration after being dismissed for 13 runs against the west indies the test , of course , will come when brad haddin is flailing it to all parts at some point this summer and the wheels are coming off jimmy anderson and broad
for now there is a lot for cook and england to be pleased about , not least the batting of joe root and ballance who are breaking all sorts of records at such a young age
there is , of course , still work to be done and there is clearly a concern over jonathan trott going into friday âs third test
if he can bring his old calmness to the start of his innings as an opener , england will have a very good player back in the side
