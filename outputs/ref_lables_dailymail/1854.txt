win and arsenal go second to put huge pressure on city
lose and liverpool will be nine points behind arsene wenger âs side
the frenchman is in excellent form this season but the only question mark against him was does he score enough in the big games ? so far in this campaign , he has scored against manchester united , city and liverpool
skrtel ( centre ) misses the trip to arsenal after getting a three - game ban for stamping on david de gea kolo toure ( centre ) and mamadou sakho ( right ) are in contention to replace skrtel for saturday 's clash whichever defender plays , they are in for a tough afternoon against in - form arsenal striker olivier giroud mertesacker v daniel sturridge i âve lost count of the number of times i have covered arsenal games and wondered how mertesacker does it
germany world cup - winner mertesacker ( right ) is expected line - up in defence for arsenal however , mertesacker 's lack of pace could be exposed if daniel sturridge ( right ) is fit to start for liverpool aaron ramsey vs jordan henderson this time last year if you asked people who they would rather have in their team , it would be aaron ramsey all day long
aaron ramsey can grab a goal , and liverpool will have to watch his runs into the box , but jordan henderson will press hard and make sure aaron ramsey and the likes of mesut ozil and santi cazorla have no room to breathe
arsenal 's aaron ramsey ( left ) midfield battle with liverpool 's jordan henderson should prove a close affair
