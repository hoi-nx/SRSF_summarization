kicking , punching and moving around during sleep might be an early sign of parkinson 's disease , a new review suggests
moving around in sleep , and seeming to ' act out ' dreams is a characteristic of a condition called rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder ( rbd )
researchers have discovered about half of people with rbd will develop parkinson 's disease or another neurological disorder within a decade of being diagnosed , livescience reports
people with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder ( rbd ) move around in their sleep and ' act out ' their dreams
up to 90 per cent of people with the condition will develop a neurological condition , a study found ultimately , 81 to 90 per cent of patients with rbg with develop a neurodegenerative disorder , they found
' if you get this disorder and live long enough , you will almost certainly get parkinson 's disease or a condition similar to it â it 's an early warning sign , ' said professor howell , of the university of minnesota , and co-author of the study
people with rbd move around during the rapid eye movement period of sleep , when most dreaming occurs but the body 's muscles are usually paralysed by the brain stem
those with the condition are believed to have a malfunction in their brain - stem which allows them to move around during rem sleep , and therefore act out their dreams

as part of the study , professor howell and his colleagues reviewed 500 studies published between 1986 and 2014 that explored the link between rbd and parkinson 's
parkinson 's disease , a condition in which part of the brain becomes progressively damaged , is characterised by a tremor , slow movement and stiff and inflexible muscles
however , not everyone who develops parkinson 's will have rbd first
nevertheless , the findings could help doctors find a way to catch parkinson 's early and treat parkinson 's disease while it is in its early stages , professor howell added
parkinson 's disease is caused by the breakdown of proteins in brain cells , meaning that part of the brain can not work ( pictured in red )
