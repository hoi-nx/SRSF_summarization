china is poised for its biggest corruption case since mao 's widow went on trial for treason with the rest of the ' gang of four '
trial : former national security chief zhou yongkang is embroiled in the biggest corruption case since mao 's widow ( pictured right ) went on trial with the rest of the ' gang of four ' so the move to announce charges against zhou yongkang is being touted by official media as proof that the leadership is determined to take action â although some commentators argue that it is simply a sign of internal divisions and score - settling between factions in the party
officially , however , zhou yongkang , 72 , is the highest - level official charged as part of president xi jinping 's anti-corruption campaign that began in late 2012
if the trial proceeds as expected he will be the most senior politician to face court since the sensational 1981 trial of chairman mao 's widow , his fourth and last wife jiang qing , and the rest of the ' gang of four ' over claims they persecuted political opponents during the 1966 - 76 cultural revolution
a useful side effect of the case will be that it will destroy for ever any hopes zhou yongkang may have had of rivalling the party 's leadership
