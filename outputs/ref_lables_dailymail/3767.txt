mourinho had placed the premier league âs joint - top goalscorer on standby for this match , insisting he would only turn to diego costa if absolutely necessary
the Â£ 32million striker was required to stop chelsea squandering the opportunity to open a seven - point advantage over their title rivals
yet all they got was 11 minutes before diego costa was forced off with a recurrence of the hamstring injury that ruled him out of the international break with spain
chelsea striker diego costa limped off with a hamstring injury shortly after coming on at the interval will he be out for a week , a month , two months , maybe more ? â it âs too early , â said mourinho , who went on to defend throwing diego costa on
â in the meantime a chunk of the chelsea contingent will be wondering how they fill the void left by diego costa
they need look no further than this win against stoke as the answer presents itself in the form of loic remy and , of course , eden hazard
blues striker diego costa looks despondent as he sits on the turf following another injury to his hamstring eden hazard scored and assisted in the same premier league match for the seventh time , and looked like a man ready to rubbish the idea he was too tired to play a full 90 minutes for belgium in midweek
he tormented the stoke defence here at stamford bridge , and has scored more premier league goals for chelsea over the past three seasons than any other player
it took an outstanding one - handed save from stoke goalkeeper begovic at full stretch to deny loic remy âs deflected shot from giving chelsea the lead after just three minutes
diego costa looks in pain after pulling up at stamford bridge during chelsea 's 2 - 1 win over stoke chelsea gave away possession in the final third â not for the first time â and a frowning mourinho turned to his substitutes â bench , gestured at diego costa with a nod , and the striker began warming up down the touchline
yet this was all about chelsea 's go - to guy , eden hazard , and diego costa âs worthy replacement , remy . â we have three strikers , â mourinho declared afterwards
â but by this evidence , chelsea supporters need not lose sleep over their first - choice striker 's injury
as stoke found out , loic remy can fill the gap left by diego costa , and eden hazard is simply every bit a premier league title winner in the making
eden hazard steps up to stroke home the opener for chelsea from the penalty spot in the first half loic remy finishes to put chelsea back in front after a mistake from stoke keeper begovic
