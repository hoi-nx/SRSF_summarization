the north sea stretches before me
i dip a toe in
and , within seconds , making frantic strokes , i âm swept up and i âm swimming
i âve swum through them all , wherever i can find the water
so best of all has to be swimming outdoors , and here on the east coast in suffolk it is now warm enough â just about â for the sea
and despite the greyness , the appalling cold , and the downright bleakness of the north sea here , i âm in heaven
the poet lord byron â who was every bit as proud of his phenomenal swimming prowess as his verses â called the experience a â buoyancy of spirits i never feel on any other occasion â
yet i âm not one of those athletic people who glide through the water with a sleek , racing crawl
a 30 - minute dip leaves me exhausted
you need look no further than aidan turner in poldark to see how a dip in the ocean can set pulses racing i âm that woman with the white - hatted head bobbing up and down offshore in a rather staid breast stroke
but in the water i do nât care
and , for me , that âs the magic of swimming
of course , it would be easier to get in if it were nât so damned cold â nudging a steely 8c ( 47f )
yet however enticing it is to bask in languid , tropical waters along with colourful fish , and laze about in mediterranean and caribbean seas , give me the atlantic any day
what i love is the emptiness , the menthol cool of the water
on the isle of islay i have found deserted bays and swum completely alone or just with those i love , the sea crystal - clear and only the sound of the curlews and the water lapping over the rock pools
why does it affect me so ? freud , not surprisingly , had a view on a love of swimming
he believed it disguised a desire to return to the amniotic waters of the womb
i prefer the thoughts of novelist jane austen , so much more restrained , who simply declared swimming â delightful â
she found the combination of sea air and sea water â nearly infallible â and â a match for every disorder â
to the romans , swimming was a most manly , heroic occupation , so much so that they defined an ignorant man as one who â neither knows how to read or swim â
i came across a similar attitude when i lived in london and finally plucked up the courage to swim in the famous , natural , spring - fed ponds on hampstead heath
the water was so black and deep , my thoughts would turn black and ominous too , imagining drowning and wondering how many rats were lurking in the murky shadows
because although there is something to be said for the way you emerge from cold water stinging and tingling as if heated by a feverish drug , i âm not hardy enough for swimming through liquid ice
but , unfortunately , i was not allowed to wear my new wetsuit â â not in the spirit of the ponds â , i was told by the strict hampstead heath matriarchs who police it
but then , at the end of the 18th century , george iii gave swimming the royal stamp of approval by taking dips in the sea off weymouth , accompanied apparently by a band who struck up god save the king every time he popped his head out of the water
george iii brought swimming to fashion in english after years of scepticism from prudish members of the church whatever methods people learned to swim they were effective and , as more people took to the waters , something had to be done , in the name of modesty , about the habit of swimming naked
forced to put on underwear ( red and white striped ) to conceal himself , he complained that : â if ladies do nât like to see men naked , why do nât they keep away from the sight ? â indeed given the hysteria generated by poldark actor aidan turner âs quick cornish dip , watching men swimming seems to be a pleasure that has never dimmed
they are following in the footsteps of the composer benjamin britten , the town âs most famous resident , who extolled the virtues of cold water â just to wake you up â
so i will continue to confront the north sea , take delight when the temperature climbs a few degrees as we head into summer in the weeks ahead and then grit my teeth again as it plummets back into winter
