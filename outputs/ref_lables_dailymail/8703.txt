we know him as ' success kid ' - the toddler with a clenched fist and look of satisfaction who 's become the internet 's most positive meme
but now sam griner is eight years old and is using his online fame to help out his sick dad
his mother , griner from jacksonville , florida , set up a gofundme page to raise the $ 75,000 her husband , justin , needs for the kidney transplant and years of subsequent medications
his mother snapped the photo - which actually shows him just moments before trying to put sand in his mouth - when he was 11 months ' his mother died from this disease , please help us write a different story for justin and his son , sam
although sam griner initially decided against using the notoriety of ' success kid ' to help raise funds , she eventually spoke to the daily dot about the campaign because of her fears for her husband
' sign of success : his face has since been used to create the internet 's most positive meme , pictured grimace : an image shows sammy , who is now eight years old , posing beside a t - shirt bearing his face the funds will supplement the money medicare puts towards the procedure
it is also not yet clear where the kidney will come from and so the family is also using the gofundme page to ask strangers to see if they could be a match
