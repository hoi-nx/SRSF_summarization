with house prices soaring , it 's not easy finding somewhere to live
meet seattle 's rolling neighborhood of rvs , where each unassuming vehicle is a capsule home
the unusual format has been captured in a series of photographs by visual journalist anna erickson
meet dodson , 57 , and welcome to his home : an rv in seattle 's sodo where he watches over the parking lot in exchange for a spot no place like home : john , 52 , has turned his $ 200 vehicle into his home after his apartment burned down years ago there are around 30 drivers that float in and out of this parking lot in the sodo ( south of downtown ) area of the city in washington state
he told anna erickson his car cost $ 200 , and does n't drive very well
but for a home , it 's just about enough
people come and go for work in the factories nearby , but on the weekend it is just the rv - dwellers that area left daily life : here bud can be seen preparing himself a barbecue on the gravel outside his capsule home , one of about 30 in the community eclectic : while bud 's rv is organized and functional , john 's is full of trinkets and belongings dating back years alongside him - most of the time - is dodson , 57
while some are forced to move about regularly , dodson , a maintenance man , looks after the parking lot in exchange for a semi-permanent spot
' he had really made the rvs his home and taken good care of it , ' anna erickson described
move in , move out : some have agreements to stay , but others have to keep driving around to find a spot john works as a panhandler at safeco fields stadium , where he used to work as a cook he is content with his life in between the usual confines of society personal : to many this may just seem like a parking lot but for these men it is a very personal space ' bud is very grateful , he said the parking lot owner is just such a nice guy to let him live like this
