a 10 - year - old autistic boy has hand - delivered a heartbreaking poster to the immigration minister pleading to be allowed to stay in the country he has called home for the past eight years
the touching words were written by sevilla and delivered to dutton 's office in brisbane on monday , along with a petition containing 122,000 signatures
the poster simply said : ' dear mr sutton , can i stay in australia please
' maria sevilla and her young son 's desperate last - ditch attempt to remain in the country comes as they face the very real possibility of being deported back to the philippines after their visa expires today
this comes after the immigration department rejected the single mother 's visa application 28 days ago because tyrone 's autism would be a ' burden on the australia health system '
' tyrone goes to a school in townsville in queensland which caters for his special needs and ms sevilla works as a nurse at townsville hospital
' tyrone has excelled since starting at a specialised school in townsville four years ago due to tyrone 's autism , he does not adapt to change very well earlier this month , the queensland government labelled the federal government 's decision to deport ms sevilla and her son as ' cold and heartless '
' it 's like , i 'm pleading for our life , for tyrone 's future , ' she said
' ms sevilla , a single mum and nurse in the queensland town of townsville , has lived in australia with her son since 2007
she says it is the only place he knows , and he only knows english maria sevilla has lived in australia since 2007 , when she arrived in the queensland town of townsville - a single mother wanting to become a nurse , in the hope of finding a better life for herself and for her baby
her son was diagnosed with autism at the age of two , six months after they arrived in australia
ms maria sevilla told daily mail australia the new life in australia ' changed everything ' for her and her son , and she was able to fulfill her ' dream ' of working as a nurse
it was not possible for ms sevilla to work as a nurse in the philippines , where she said university is only possible for ' well - off families '
' all of it could be taken away because the government thinks that children with autism are going to be more of a cost to australia society than a benefit â but that 's just not true , ' she said
ms sevilla has made a petition and is appealing the decision to send herself and her son back to the philippines - a place where she has no family and no network of support ' everything is here for us
my work , our family , our home is here , tyrone 's school
' ms sevilla 's application for a skilled-region visa subclass 489 was rejected by the department of immigration and border protection due to tyrone 's autism
a spokeswoman for then - immigration minister scott morrison said in a statement accompanying the initial rejection : ' the visa was refused because the child did not meet the health requirement
' i have received so many messages from mums of children with autism ; it 's very prevalent in australia , ' ms sevilla said ' as a mother of a child with autism , i know it is n't a disease you have to cure , but one you have to manage
' due to tyrone 's autism , even minor changes to their routines troubles him , meaning having their deportation would cause enormous issues for the little boy
they are a crucial support for her and adored by tyrone ms sevilla says there is no support for them in the philippines , compared to australia , where her beloved mother , brother , sister - in - law , aunty , uncle and cousins live
my mother , stepfather and tyrone 's uncle and aunty are so important for tyrone and i. ' they are a big help , as any single mum would understand
