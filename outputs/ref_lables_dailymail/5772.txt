a carpenter from california has created what may well be the world âs biggest see - saw
kyle , who runs his own custom woodworking business , built the seesaw from trees behind his workshop in temecula
it measures a whopping 45ft in length , and according to its maker , sends its occupiers into the air at a height of around 25ft
kyle said the tree was about 65ft long so he cut it to make it even on both sides and the seesaw was born as seen in the video , the seesaw is made from entirely raw materials â a large trunk sits securely in between the natural split of a tree
kyle told mailonline : â i was cutting down some dead and damaged trees one day and was trying to drop this tree in between two others
kyle climbed the tree with a sledge hammer and pounded the trunk into the split branches to stop it from sliding there is no seat attached to the trunk but handrails have been added for support and ropes help people get on â the whole thing kind of just happened
kyle said : â we had to attach a rope on one side so that when one person gets on they can pull the other person up and let someone else on
the seesaw measures 45ft in length , and according to kyle , sends its occupiers into the air at a height of around 25ft â i got on with one of my friends and it worked perfectly
â according to kyle , four people can ride on the seesaw at one time and there is an amazing view from the top
kyle said that the seesaw is a lot of fun and that it takes the childhood memory of playing on one and magnifies it by a thousand kyle 's woodwork has been featured in the providence art show , boston âs world trade center furniture show and the del mar woodworking competition in california a number of people have commented positively on the video with one youtube user writing : â that and a beer looks like a good time
