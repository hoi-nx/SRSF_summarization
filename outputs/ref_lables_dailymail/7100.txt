an offensive attempt by a men 's magazine to commemorate fallen anzac soldiers has backfired as social media users and the department of veteran affairs condemn the crude ' commemorative issue '
after coming under scrutiny , zoo weekly removed all ' offending ' images of a half - naked model holding a long stemmed red poppy from facebook
the department of veteran affairs ( department of veteran affairs ) said the word ' anzac ' is protected by federal legislation since 1920 and is not authorised to be used for commercial purposes - like zoo weekly 's ' special anzac centenary issue ' - without express permission from the minister for veterans ' affairs
social media users were quick to condemn the controversial issue , labelling it ' gross and offensive
' twitter users were quick to condemn zoo weekly for the controversial issue some thought the issue was ' gross and offensive ' some questioned how on earth an editor thought this was a good campaign ? while others questioned how this relates to the aussies anzac story this is n't the first time zoo weekly used flesh to make their anzac specials more appealing
