an elderly woman died after she was unable to call for help because the phone company had disconnected the mobile she kept for emergencies
sheila secker , 78 , had been given the pay - as - you - go phone by her son , but as she had not used the phone for some time it had been cut off
cancelled : as sheila secker had not used her pay - as - you - go phone for any chargeable services , vodafone retired her number without warning mrs sheila secker 's son steve told the newspaper how his mother had owned the mobile phone for 14 years , and recently topped up the credit , but had not made any calls
when mr secker contacted vodafone he was told his mother 's number had been retired , and that a ' glitch ' in the system had allowed the elderly woman to continue to ' top up ' her credit
take heed : most major mobile phone operators regularly ' recycle ' numbers when they have been out of use for a three to six months ' what i can not fathom is , if vodafone has retired a number , how can it permit money to be taken as a top - up , ' mr secker , 46 , told the sunday times
a vodafone pay - as - you - go mobile is put into ' semi-quarantine ' if no chargeable calls or texts are made for 90 days
