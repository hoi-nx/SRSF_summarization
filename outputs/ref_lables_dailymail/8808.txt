hillary and top aide abedin did n't leave a tip during their now infamous stop at an chipotle on monday - despite there being a jar on the counter
' her bill was $ 20 and some change , and they paid with $ 21 and left , ' wright , manager of the maumee , ohio , restaurant , told bloomberg
to be fair , multimillionaire ' clinton did n't pay ' for the meal , according to wright
' the other lady paid the bill , ' he said , referring to abedin , the vice chairwoman of clinton 's campaign
the manager says they did n't leave a tip do you tip at chipotle if there is a jar ? do you tip at chipotle if there is a jar ? now share your opinion not every chipotle restaurant has a jar for change
' if we 're doing our job right , people tip. ' clinton and abedin dropped by the maumee restaurant incognito for lunch just after 1 pm on monday during their road trip from new york to iowa for the first round of campaign events
it was n't until after clinton was back on the road that her campaign alerted the press to the lunch outing
a former first lady , secretary of state , new york senator , clinton 's net worth fell somewhere between $ 5 million and $ 25 million in 2012 , the last time she was required by the government to disclose her earnings
a key feature of clinton 's second attempt for the presidency was supposed to be her interactions with ' everyday ' americans , meant to show how down to earth and approachable the wealthy new york is
but clinton made no attempts at the chipotle to introduce herself , the manager indicated , or mingle with other burrito - goers
' the daily mail online yesterday learned that an impromptu round table that clinton held at a coffee shop with three young people was completely staged by her campaign
to her left is iowa senate majority leader michael gronstal this is the branch of chipotle in maumee , ohio , where hillary and her right - hand woman abedin were spotted at 1:13 p.m. local time on monday the question of whether clinton left a tip at chipotle was first raised by conservative radio show host limbaugh during his tuesday broadcast
explaining to his listeners the concept of chipotle , limbaugh noted , ' there 's a tip jar in there
he also suggested , correctly , that clinton probably did n't pay for her meal , her assistant did
clinton made no attempts at the chipotle to introduce herself , the manager indicated , or mingle with other burrito - goers continuing limbaugh said , he really would ' like to know if she left anything in the tip jar , because that would be an indication that she understands the average , ordinary , everyman that she seeks to represent
' i mean , that 's where the people that work at chipotle , that 's where they make a little extra , in the tip jar , and i have n't heard a word about whether or not she visited the tip jar , whether she put anything in it or not
' republican national committee chairman reince priebus picked up the ball and began running with it on wednesday , telling fox news that clinton 's strategy is to ' make sure the field knows that she 's running , and then not answer any questions from the media , and not actually talk to anybody
