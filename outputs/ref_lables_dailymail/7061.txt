an army major and his wife engaged in ' a regimen of abuse and neglect ' with their three young foster children over a period of years that left the toddlers with broken bones and numerous other health problems , a federal prosecutor told a jury at the couple 's child abuse trial monday
john and carolyn also forced some of the children to drink hot sauce or eat hot pepper flakes and were n't exposed until one of their biological children reported the abuse to someone outside the family , assistant u.s. attorney shumofsky said in his opening statement
the trial marks the second go - round for the jacksons , whose previous trial last fall ended in a mistrial when a prosecutor inadvertently referred to the fact that one of the children had died
cruel : army major john jackson ( left ) and his wife carolyn ( right ) are currently on trial for abusing their three foster children
pictured above in may 2013 the judge had previously ruled that the boy 's death could not be introduced during the trial since the defendants were not charged directly with his death
second trial : the jacksons first child abuse trial was ruled a mistrial when a prosecutor mentioned the death of one of their sons - a detail that was not supposed to be mentioned in the proceedings
they have only been charged for abusing the foster children the jacksons , who live in mount holly , were stationed at picatinny arsenal , a military installation about 40 miles west of new york city , when the abuse occurred between 2005 and 2010 , according to a 15 - count superseding indictment
sinins and david holman , representing john jackson , both mentioned in their opening statements that while the government 's experts concluded abuse had taken place though they had n't treated the children , the children 's treating doctors did not reach that conclusion .
