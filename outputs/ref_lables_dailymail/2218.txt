a dangerous ' death ring ' has been spotted around the bay area
scientists say the lethal ring is leaving tens of thousands of creatures with severe , and often fatal injuries
now researchers have released an interactive roadkill map to show the trail of destruction being caused by california 's state highways
to view the interactive map , click here pictured are the south san franscisco bay area regional highway roadkill hotspots
the ring of death refers to an area made up of made up of i-80 ( labelled as 9 ) and route 101 ( labelled as 13 and 8 ) the map uses data from the california roadkill observation system , a volunteer - submitted database of instances where wildlife and vehicles collided over the past five years
it assigns different coloured markers for various sizes of species
clicking on the dots reveals the species - striped skunk , mountain lion , black bear , gopher snake , desert iguana - and where and when they were hit
major hotspots include the sacramento area where i-80 and i - 5 run across bypasses along the pacific flyway
where i-80 and i - 5 run across bypasses along the pacific flyway , marshy areas attract birds during migration and result in high rates of roadkill sacramento area : where i-80 and i - 5 run across bypasses along the pacific flyway , marshy areas attract birds during migration and result in high rates of roadkill
bay area : ' it 's sort of a ring of death around the bay area , ' shilling said
i-80 and route 101 run alongside the bay , where high rates of wading birds and water birds are killed
california : many areas along state route 94 in san diego county have high rates of collisions where the highway runs through wildlife habitat
' it 's sort of a ring of death around the bay area , ' said shilling at the uc davis , who led the study
i-80 and route 101 run alongside the bay , where high rates of wading birds and water birds are killed
meanwhile , many areas along state route 94 in san diego county have high rates of collisions where the highway runs through wildlife habitat
the 419 roadkill observations of 36 species within the hotspot were collected between april 2011 and october , 2014 many areas along route 94 in san diego county have high rates of collisions where the highway runs through wildlife habitat the drought may be increasing the number of roadkill , as animals seem to be putting themselves at greater risk to find food and water sources , crossing roads they may not have in the past
' the drought may be increasing the number of roadkill , as animals seem to be putting themselves at greater risk to find food and water sources , crossing roads they may not have in the past the long continuous hotspot represents 681 roadkill observations of 57 animal species
