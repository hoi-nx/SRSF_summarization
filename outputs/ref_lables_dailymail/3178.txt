with 20 goals to his name this season , watford captain deeney is regarded by many as the best striker outside the premier league
in fact , deeney has been lighting up the championship for the last three seasons , scoring 64 goals in 123 league games at an average of over a goal every other game
the next logical step for the birmingham - born striker is the top flight and , with watford just a point off the top of the table with five games to go , he could well be skippering the hornets in the premier league next season
watford striker deeney won the championship 's player of the month award for march hornets skipper deeney is hoping to cap off a fine season by leading watford to the premier league deeney believes he can follow in the path of charlie austin and danny ings by becoming a premier league hit watford are currently just one point behind championship leaders bournemouth with five games left to play and deeney , who was this week named the sky bet championship player of the month for march , makes no secret of his desire to test himself at the highest level
' these are all people that have been in the championship , done well , then held their own in the premier league
' it seems fair for deeney to say ' when ' and not ' if ' he plays at the top level because on this season 's evidence he and striker partner odion ighalo certainly are ready for it
between them the championship 's most lethal strikeforce have scored 39 league goals this season and deeney waxed lyrical about his nigerian strike partner
' before saturday ( when odion ighalo scored from 20 yards in the win over middlesbrough ) we had been joking that all of his goals were inside the 18 - yard box
' deeney is adamant that together he and odion ighalo could terrorise premier league defences
watford striker odion ighalo has also been in fine goalscoring form during the course of the campaign deeney has been impressed with jokanovic since the watford manager took charge in october ' i think you have to be very ruthless in the premier league and we 've shown that we can score goals
' watford - currently third in the table and kept out of the top two only on goal difference - joined the promotion - chasing pack late after a turbulent start to the season saw three managers depart before current boss jokanovic took charge in october
but referring to that period deeney , who has played under seven managers since joining watford from walsall in 2010 , insists : ' it was n't that bad
' watford have won 15 of jokanovic 's 27 matches in charge and deeney has been impressed by the serbian 's tactical flexibility
' former watford boss beppe sannino handed deeney the captain 's armband during his brief spell in charge but deeney 's role in the revival of watford 's season , not just as goalscorer but as captain , can not be underestimated
' deeney served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and says it is no coincidence he has enjoyed by far the best three seasons of his career since his release
deeney has warned his watford team - mates they have ' three weeks of hard work ' ahead of them ' the two are definitely linked , ' he admits
' captaining watford in the premier league next season , deeney admits , would be the crowning glory after three years ' hard work following his release
' you get the feeling deeney will be playing in the premier league regardless of what happens in the next few weeks
