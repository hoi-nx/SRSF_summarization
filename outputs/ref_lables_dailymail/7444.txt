an international panel of scientists will today launch a major inquiry to discover whether official world temperature records have exaggerated the extent of global warming
the panel , convened by the global warming policy foundation ( global warming policy foundation ) , the â climate sceptic â think - tank led by the former tory chancellor lord lawson , will focus on thousands of â adjustments â that have been made to temperature records kept at individual weather stations around the world
sceptics have argued that the effect of such adjustments â made when instruments are replaced or recalibrated , or heat - producing buildings are erected close to weather station sites â has skewed the records
sceptics : the panel will look at whether ' adjustments ' made to temperature records around the world have made climate change appear worse - or whether they actually manage to cancel each other out the panel will also examine â extrapolations â â when the records include virtual figures from places where there is no actual measuring station , instead basing them on the figures of other stations in the same region
the panel has been drawn from leading universities around the world , and includes scientists with widely differing views on climate change
panel member professor william van wijngaarden , a physicist and climate expert from york university in toronto , said he had been concerned about the records â quality for many years , after noticing that when you examined an individual station â you âll see a sudden jump â
â dr benny peiser , the global warming policy foundation director , said the panel would try to look at all the thousands of stations whose data goes into the three main world temperature records â those kept by the met office , nasa , and the us government agency that deals with weather

â we hope that people who are concerned with the integrity of climate science , from all sides of the debate , will help us to get to the bottom of these questions by telling us what they know about the temperature records and the adjustments made to them
