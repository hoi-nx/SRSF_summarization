scientists claim to have established which diets are most likely to work - and keep the weight off in the long term from high protein to low fat , calorie counters to slimming shakes , we are bombarded by diet plans promising the holy grail of weight loss
a landmark report claims to have established which diets are most likely to work - and keep the weight off in the long term
the us researchers say very few of these - often very expensive - weight loss plans have solid evidence to back up their claims
but a handful - including weight watchers , the atkins diet , jenny craig and nutrisystem - do appear to be effective , according to long - term studies
to draw their conclusions , they first reviewed 4,200 studies involving these diets for solid evidence of effectiveness
three ' high - intensity ' programmes were included : weight watchers , jenny craig and nutrisystem
the high protein , low cab atkins diet scored well : this was because there was ' gold - standard data ' showing that people following the diet lost more weight after one year than those people either dieting on their own or getting health and diet information elsewhere the researchers say only two programmes are supported by gold - standard data showing that enrolled dieters - on average - lost more weight after one year than those either dieting on their own or getting health and diet information elsewhere
evidence of long-term success : weight watchers , jenny craig evidence of short-term success : nutrisystem produced more weight loss at three months than counselling or education alone , but researchers were unable to find any long - term trials
programmes based on the atkins - high in fat , low in carbohydrates - also helped people lose more weight at six months and 12 months than counseling alone and the approach ' appears promising '
not enough evidence to judge : slimfast and the internet - based programmes : biggest loser club , ediets and lose it ! results were generally ' modest ' , with participants losing on average between three and five per cent more weight than the studies â control groups who did not take part
based on the analysis of the studies , jenny craig and weight watchers were backed by clinical trials that lasted 12 months or longer and showed those enrolled had a greater weight loss than those not following the plan
nutrisystem also produced more weight loss at three months than counselling or education alone , but researchers were unable to find any long - term trials of that plan
people on very - low - calorie meal replacement plans lost more weight than many other dieters in the first four to six months
programmes based on the atkins - high in fat , low in carbohydrates - also helped people lose more weight at six months and 12 months than counseling alone and the approach ' appears promising '
jeanne clark , professor of medicine , said : ' we want people to experience the health benefits of weight loss - lower blood pressure , cholesterol and blood sugar , and lower risk of developing diseases like diabetes people on very - low - calorie meal replacement plans lost more weight than many other dieters in the first four to six months
' those benefits are long - term goals - so losing weight for three months , then regaining it , has limited health benefits
' that âs why it âs important to have studies that look at weight loss at 12 months and beyond
' other popular programmes , such as nutrisystem , show promising weight - loss results , but additional studies evaluating long - term outcomes are needed
' the researchers looked at the evidence for 11 different weight loss plans weight watchers : a calorie controlled diet , which assigns every food a points value , based on its protein , carbohydrate , fat and fibre
