university of waterloo astrophysicists have created a 3d master map of the universe spanning nearly two billion light years
it will help astrophysicists understand how matter is distributed in the universe and provide key insights into dark matter â one of physics ' greatest mysteries
the map spans nearly two billion light years from side to side
published online in the peer - review journal , monthly notices of the royal astronomical society â one of the world 's leading primary research journals for astronomy and astrophysics , knowing the location and motion of matter in the universe will help astrophysicists predict the universe 's expansion and identify where , and how much dark matter exists
dark matter accounts for a large majority of the mass content in the universe
the existence and properties of dark matter can only be inferred indirectly through its gravitational effects on visible matter and light
' a better understanding of dark matter is central to understanding the formation of galaxies and the structures they live in such as galaxy clusters , superclusters and voids , ' said hudson
scientists have observed that galaxies move more than can be accounted for by the universe 's expansion
these deviations in the motion of galaxies are a valuable tool to determine the distribution of matter and dark matter on the largest scales
the map spans nearly two billion light year from side to side
