facebook has two days to release all emails to a defense lawyer whose client has fled from criminal charges that he falsely claimed a majority ownership in the social media giant
the order ignores zuckerberg 's request to wait until ceglia is caught before handing over the documents
zuckerberg must release documents and electronic correspondence to a defense lawyer whose client has fled from criminal charges that he falsely claimed a majority ownership in the social media giant with a may 4 trial approaching , ceglia cut off his electronic ankle bracelet last month and fled
ceglia 's father told broderick at a hearing last week that he believed his son might have fled because he believed facebook and zuckerberg were working together with prosecutors against him , jeopardizing his chance for a fair trial
federal prosecutors had urged broderick not to force facebook and zuckerberg to turn over the documents , saying doing so would ' reward ceglia 's flouting of the judicial process while unreasonably drawing on the resources of the government and the authority of the court
prosecutors said a forensic analysis of his computers and harvard 's email archive determined ceglia had altered an unrelated software development contract he signed with zuckerberg in 2003 and falsified emails to make it appear zuckerberg had promised him a half - share of facebook
