miliband was accused of plunging the general election campaign to a â new low â last night by â weaponising dead migrants â
the labour leader and his party âs spin machine prompted the most bitter row of the campaign so far by suggesting that cameron bore personal responsibility for drownings of refugees in the mediterranean
senior conservatives claimed mr miliband was effectively â accusing the prime minister of murder â in a â desperate and negative â attempt to score political points by exploiting a human tragedy
miliband , pictured , was accused of trying to make political capital from the mediterranean tragedy miliband claimed the mediterranean crisis was ' in part a direct result ' of the pm 's libyans policy the controversy began after labour spin doctors issued a briefing note which said mr miliband would use a speech on foreign policy to say the â tragic scenes â in the mediterranean were â in part a direct result â of mr cameron âs libyans policy
the labour leader later insisted he was not saying mr cameron had â blood on his hands â , but was making a â very important point about post-conflict planning in libyans â after the overthrow of colonel gaddafi
but a senior tory source said : â a few bad polls for labour after a poor week of campaigning and miliband accuses the pm of murder
â clegg leader clegg also condemned labour âs intervention , pointing out that mr miliband had backed western military involvement in libyans
former foreign secretary william hague said mr miliband âs remarks represented â a new low in shallow opportunism â , given that the labour leader had said â nothing â about foreign policy for five years
and former defence secretary liam fox said : â having tried to weaponise the nhs , miliband is trying to weaponise drowning migrants
â mr miliband , speaking at the chatham house think - tank in london , was forced to deny that he had â politicised â a tragedy
former defence secretary liam fox said miliband was trying to ' weaponise drowning migrants ' asked if that was true , mr miliband replied : â nonsense
labour accused the tories of â personal attacks â earlier in the campaign , when defence secretary michael fallon said mr miliband â stabbed his brother in the back â in the party âs 2010 leadership contest .
