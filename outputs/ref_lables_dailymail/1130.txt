mr rowley issued the warning of new tactics among islamist fanatics at the counter-terror expo at olympia , west london , yesterday
london - born isis execution jihadi john is being used to recruit a network of ' misfits ' around the world , made up of the ' very young , violent and mentally ill ' , a senior police officer has warned on changing methods of attack , mr rowley said : ' we still have groups who are interested in the awful , spectacular attacks that we have seen with al qaeda in the past
' his words echo the case of london teenager brustholm ziamani , who was jailed in february for plotting a ' lee rigby - style ' attack on a uk soldier or policeman
in 2008 , 22 - year - old nicky reilly - who had a mental age of 10 - attempted to carry out a suicide bombing in exeter after he was contacted by extremists online
assistant commissioner rowley said yesterday that the tactics of terror groups are changing mr rowley said there had been a ' step - change ' in the scope and scale of terror threats
citing the rise of isis in syria and northern iraq , compared to existing terror strongholds in afghanistan , somalia and yemen , he said : ' it 's a much easier area to get to
' more than 600 uk jihadists have travelled to join isis , with half returning to pose a threat on uk streets
instead , many had been radicalised via propaganda on social media , by extremists , hate preachers and fighters such as jihadi john - real name mohammed emwazi
branding isis a cult , mr rowley added : ' it is actually looking to inspire people to support their cause
mentally ill nicky reilly ( right ) was also goaded into carrying out a nail bomb attack in 2008 mr rowley added : ' we have terrorist groups now able , from relatively safe environments in ungoverned space of broken areas of the country , to reach into communities in the uk and influence people to act in their name to commit terrorist act
