identical twins share 100 per cent of their genes , meaning that until now it has been impossible to tell which sibling a sample comes from

but researchers at the university of huddersfield have created a technique which they claim can distinguish between the genetic fingerprints of identical twins ( illustrated ) researchers at the university of huddersfield have created a technique which they claim can distinguish between the genetic fingerprints of identical twins
identical twins start life with the same genes because they come from the same fertilised egg which divides into two embryos
but as they age different life experiences , such as smoking or diet , create variations in the number of hydrogen bonds in the dna
hrma subjects the dna to increasingly high temperatures until the hydrogen bonds break , known as the melting temperature
the more hydrogen bonds that are present in the dna , the higher the temperature required to melt them
identical twins start life with the same genes because they come from the same fertilised egg which divides into two embryos
but as they age their different life experiences create a variation in the number of hydrogen bonds within dna ( illustrated )
this could be caused by smoking , exposure to chemicals , or different diets dr williams ( pictured ) , who leads the forensic genetics research group at huddersfield , found that by heating dna until its bonds break these subtle differences become apparent
the more hydrogen bonds present in dna , the higher the temperature needed to melt them they have created a method of heating dna until its bonds break - identifying minute differences between two twins

but as they grow older their different life experiences create a variation in the number of hydrogen bonds within the dna
he said : â what hrma does is to subject the dna to increasingly high temperatures until the hydrogen bonds break , known as the melting temperature
â the more hydrogen bonds that are present in the dna , the higher the temperature required to melt them
crucially , methylation changes the number of hydrogen bonds
