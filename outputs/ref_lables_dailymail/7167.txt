the harry potter books have sold more than 450 million copies since the first was published in 1997
by scanning the brains of participants as they read passages from the collection , researchers discovered that the common use of ' arousing words ' affected parts of the brain concerned with emotion
the harry potter books ( pictured ) have sold more than 450 million copies and its success may lie in the use of words used - rather than the texts as a whole
by scanning the brains of people reading passages from the collection , researchers discovered ' arousing words ' affected parts associated with emotion the emotional potential of words is rated in terms of valence and arousal ratings
emma watson ( left ) as hermione granger and daniel radcliffe are shown in prisoner of azkaban from this , they selected 120 passages , each of which was four lines long and did not require a high level of familiarity with the books
the team then used a magnetic resonance imaging scanner to map activity in the brains of people reading these 120 passages
following the experiment in the scanner , each participant rated the passages on valence , on a scale of -3 for very negative to +3 for very positive , and arousal , on a scale of 1 for very calming to 5 for very arousing
the researchers said this was due to the contrast between the low arousal of ' silence ' and the high arousal of ' chill ' , which led to the overall lexical arousal of the whole sentence to be moderate
harry potter 's mind wandered a long way from the marquee , back to afternoons spent alone with ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds , ' from the deathly hallows was rated positive
following the experiment , each participant rated the passages on valence - from -3 for very negative to +3 for very positive - and arousal - scaled from 1 for very calming to 5 very arousing
a passage involving ginny ( played by bonnie right pictured left ) , and harry potter ( daniel radcliffe right ) had a neutral valence the mri scans revealed that reading passages like the one from the half-blood prince correlated with brain activity in regions associated with emotion , with building a mental model of a situation and also with the understanding of a character 's state of mind
in particular , these emotional passages stimulated the left amygdala of the brain , which processes emotional reactions , and the insula
this stimulated the left amygdala of the brain ( left ) and the insula ( right ) which are associated with emotional reactions researchers screened all seven harry potter novels and selected 120 passages , each of which was four lines long and did n't require a high level of familiarity with the books
the team then used a magnetic resonance imaging scanner to map activity in the brains of people reading these 120 passages before they were asked to rate each for valence and arousal
the researchers said this was due to the contrast between the low arousal of ' silence ' and the high arousal of ' chill ' , which led to the overall arousal of the whole sentence to be moderate
' the study : ' the emotion potential of words and passages in reading harry potter â an fmri study ' is published in brain and language .
