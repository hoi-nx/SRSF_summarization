the wikipedia official who accused shapps of doctoring his own online biography was exposed yesterday as a former liberal democrat member
but yesterday it emerged that the senior wikipedia administrator who investigated the allegations - following a tip - off from the left - wing guardian - was a former lib - liberal democrat member
richard symonds , 29 , who goes by the online name ' chase me ladies , i 'm the cavalry ' , is one of the uk 's top administrators for the website
mr shapps angrily denied the claims , insisting the story was ' untrue from start to finish '
mr richard symonds ' decision was also criticised by other wikipedia activists , who warned that the site should not be used to ' play politics ' and referred the case to an internal arbitration committee
' mr richard symonds , from bow , east london , described himself on twitter as ' liberal democrat ( to the last ) ' before deleting his profile yesterday
furious denials : shapps yesterday continued to deny he was behind the wikipedia changes among his facebook friends is wikipedia co-founder jimmy wales , who married tony blair 's former diary secretary kate garvey in 2012
he was once featured in a bbc profile that called him ' one of the uk 's top wikipedians ' and reported that he spent up to eight hours a day working on the site
responding to the criticism yesterday , mr richard symonds insisted he was not a lib - liberal democrat activist and said he would never let his political views interfere with his wikipedia work
' mr richard symonds toned down his conclusions about mr shapps ' possible connections to ' contribsx ' , revisions to one of his wikipedia pages show
at first he claimed the tory chairman ran the account either directly or indirectly , but later he changed this to suggest simply that the account was run by a user called ' hackneymarsh ' who was linked to mr shapps ' office by guardian in 2012
mr richard symonds admitted that wikipedia 's top officials had ' chastised ' him for his handling of the case , although he refused to back down yesterday
' but given the nature of edits , i suspect that it was mr shapps or someone close to him
lib - liberal democrat leader nick clegg said he believed the denials but then joked that the person behind the account could have been ' michael green ' , the pseudonym used by mr shapps to promote get - rich - quick schemes before he became an mp
a lib - liberal democrat spokesman said mr richard symonds had ' no connection to lib dem hq '
minister justine greening , left , and tory election supremo lynton crosby , right , were among those mentioned in the wikipedia edits mr shapps yesterday continued to furiously deny he was behind the wikipedia changes , and tory cabinet ministers rallied behind him
wikimedia uk spokesman stevie benton said to the best of his knowledge mr richard symonds did not brief the liberal democrat about his actions
' the guardian rejected criticism that its story did not made it plain that it had prompted the wikipedia inquiry into alleged links between ' contribsx ' and mr shapps
