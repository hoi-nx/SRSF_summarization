jurors hearing the boston marathon bombing trial are barred from attending this year 's race , a federal judge told the panel on tuesday as part of instructions ahead of the trial 's sentencing phase
tsarnaev , 21 , was convicted last week of planting two homemade bombs at the crowded finish line of the world famous marathon in 2013 , killing three people and injuring 264 others
the same jury that convicted tsarnaev will hear testimony on whether he should be sentenced to death or life in prison for his crimes , starting next tuesday , the day after the 2015 marathon takes place
george o'toole said the sentencing phase of the trial - in which witnesses will again be called to the stand - is expected to take four weeks , followed by jury deliberations
' in the next phase of this case you will learn a lot more , ' defense lawyer judy clarke told jurors during closing statements in tsarnaev 's trial
the prosecution is expected to portray the ethnic chechen as an islamic extremist adherent of al qaeda who planted one of the two homemade pressure cooker bombs at the race 's finish line on april 15 , 2013 , because he ' wanted to punish united states for what it was doing to his people , ' in the words of assistant u.s. attorney aloke chakravarty

but the sentencing phase , which the justice department announced on friday would begin on april 21 , will provide the defense with an opportunity to focus on that element of the case and possibly to call tsarnaev to testify
