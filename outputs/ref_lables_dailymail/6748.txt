i spoke to carl froch for an hour this week and we have talked long and hard about what he is going to do next
needless to say , we were disappointed to see julio cesar chavez jnr lose at the weekend against andrzej fonfara
it was nât a result we were expecting and it also blows away the chance of carl froch and chavez fighting in las vegas â a fight carl wanted
carl froch ( left ) has not fought since beating george groves at wembley last may carl froch has kept in shape and weighs 12st 7lbs - despite being away from the ring for nearly a year now carl froch had hoped to meet julio cesar chavez jr , but he lost to andrzej fonfara last week there is the possibility of paul smith - ward in the pipeline , anthony dirrell versus badou jack for the wbc world title and dirrell âs ibf world title fight against james degale , which is the biggest bout of this trio
anthony dirrell âs people have already been in touch with me about a carl froch fight in the event that he wins , but i wonder if it is big enough
a fight against james degale still feels to me like the most probable , if he comes through against dirrell on may 23
that is a huge fight , a proper 50 - 50 , but i fully believe he can do it
james degale ( right ) has now emerged as the most likely next opponent for carl froch on his return another option for carl froch could be a rematch with ward , should the south american beat paul smith after a disappointing couple of weeks it seems that my hopes to stage carl frampton - scott quigg this summer are dead in the water
we received no offers from their side and made three of our own â we offered a 50 - 50 split , a 60 - 40 in favour of the winner and also a Â£ 1.5m guarantee to carl frampton
you ask yourself who is making these decisions ? it is life - changing money for carl frampton that has been offered
scott quigg will move on and fight on july 18
i can guarantee that in his next fight he will fight a tougher opponent than carl frampton will
scott quigg ( right , in action against hidenori othake ) will fight on july 18 against an unnamed opponent carl frampton 's team failed to make an offer to fight scott quigg , according to his promoter hearn hearn went live on sky sports to offer carl frampton and his team Â£ 1.5m to fight scott quigg anthony joshua has been added to my may 9 show in birmingham , where he will fight rafael zumbano love , the south american champion
he is 6ft 4ins and this will be a good test for anthony dirrell against a big man before he then has his 02 fight against johnson on may 30
