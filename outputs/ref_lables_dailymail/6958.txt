the shocking moment cyclists dodged the safety barriers at a level crossing to race through the path of a speeding train has been caught on camera
during the paris-roubaix race - sir wiggins ' last for team sky - competitors approached a crossing over a train track
around 85km into the race , the cyclists desperately try to cross the traintracks before the barriers descend sir wiggins took part in the race - renowned for its demanding route - for the last time for team sky cyclists who did cross the rail - tracks could yet be disqualified from the race , as they are expressly banned from crossing a level crossing when the barriers are down
it was the last time british tour de france winner sir wiggins would compete for team sky , and told their official site before the race it was a great way to finish
it was a fitting end for wiggins , who was among the first riders to join team sky for its inaugural season in 2010 mathias hamar shared the competition rules on twitter - stating that it is ' strictly forbidden ' for cyclists to cross level crossing
offending riders should be disqualified from the competition , the rules add ' riders plug on to get to the finish ' , sir wiggins said before the race - where cyclists risked life and limb to cross a closed level crossing and beat the pack
this was his final race with team sky fans created a special sign for sir wiggins , who in 2012 was the first british cyclist to win the tour de france showing appreciation : fans hold a sign thanking wiggins at the roubaix velodrome at the end of the race
