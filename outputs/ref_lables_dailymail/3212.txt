the humble honeybee may only be small , but scientists are hoping to use its brain to power a series of futuristic - style drones
their final aim is to build a robot that thinks , senses and acts just like the tiny insects
scientists are working towards building a robot that thinks , senses and acts just like a honeybee professor james marshall said if they were able to recreate a fraction of the honeybees ability they would have made ' tremendous advances ' the artificial brain is being created by the green brain project , which is a collaboration between researchers from the universities of sheffield and sussex
' building an artificial brain is a complex process and so far , scientist have only managed to clone the part of the bee 's brain which allows it to see
on the green brain project website it states : ' since the start of the project , the gb team has setup the lab , built and tested our robots , and begun to demonstrate some sophisticated visual - based navigation and cognitive functions through embodiment
