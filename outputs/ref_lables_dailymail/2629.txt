as england âs supporters settled in for a few pints at the huntsman pub in the centre of turin on tuesday afternoon , a sizeable number spilled on to the street outside to sing the latest anti-ira song
â * * * * the ira , â it goes â and it really does go on , and on and on

england fans sang anti-ira songs during tuesday 's friendly draw with italy at the juventus stadium - there is no suggestion that the fans pictured in this image where involved in the chants michael carrick ( centre ) and the rest of the england squad applaud the travelling support in turin on tuesday frankly , it is embarrassing to listen to - a stain on our usually good - natured and good - humoured travelling supporters as we look ahead to june âs friendly with the republic of ireland in dublin
