just ask liverpool if mesut ozil cared about the game on saturday
people have been quick to criticise mesut ozil , but the german star is worth paying to watch when at his best hazard so cool when it counts a few weeks ago i was talking to john and we got round to discussing eden hazard
john told me that eden hazard was the most relaxed player he had ever played with
he is so chilled out on and off the pitch but that âs exactly what chelsea needed against stoke
in a match where some of his team - mates looked overcome with fear , eden hazard was playing a different game
he âs only 24 but the belgian is already the man chelsea seek out when they need something special

manuel pellegrini will be feeling the pressure as his manchester city side sit in fourth place sergio aguero and co will know they must beat crystal palace on monday night to stay in the title race with wilfried bony gone , bafetimbi gomis is the star at the start of the season , i picked out bafetimbi gomis as one to watch
when wilfried bony left , i feared for swansea , but bafetimbi gomis has come into his own
even when they lose players like wilfried bony or joe allen , they have already lined up quality replacements and the same goes for the managers
it âs good to see bafetimbi gomis finally becoming the player i expected him to be
