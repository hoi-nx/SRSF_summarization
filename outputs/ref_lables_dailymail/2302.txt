imagine a future where humans are skiing on the surface of a distant moon and living in floating cities on venus - while earth lies in ruin
and he hopes the posters encourage us to expand our presence into the solar system - especially as our planet is vulnerable to cosmic disasters
they show how we could colonise various worlds in the solar system
included are humans skiing on a moon of uranus and living in cities on mars
others show life on europa and near saturn - and a destroyed earth ( shown ) the posters were created by artist and entrepreneur frank mckeever , 28 , from st augustine in florida and his colleague miranda
mr frank mckeever runs an art business called science hype with his wife nicole , where each of these posters can be bought
mr frank mckeever told mailonline his inspiration for the posters came from his love of travel , retro - style designs and a love of space
perhaps the most striking image is the one of earth seemingly destroyed and uninhabitable
it âs a future that has left many experts to recently call for more effort to be made to protect earth from threats such as asteroids - and expand our presence into the solar system
â the destroyed earth was big for me , â said mr frank mckeever
â another poster shows humans living on the surface of mars in cities , which frank mckeever says he thinks is â very possible â
colonisation of mars in the form of a city , meanwhile , is something that may also be a possibility ( right ) venus is known to have an earth - like band in its atmosphere about 30 miles ( 50km ) above the surface , where some have said it could be possible to place floating space colonies ( shown ) neptune has 14 known moons , the largest of which is triton , which mr frank mckeever thinks we might colonise ( left )
maybe one day we will also return to the moon ( right ) , with a destroyed earth in the background - while one of the apollo flags has been bleached white from radiation owing to the orbits of earth and mars , there are specific windows of opportunity when a mission can take place
many have wondered whether it might be possible to colonise certain corners of the solar system before
europa , meanwhile , has often been said to be a potential place to find life in the solar system - and mr frank mckeever has imagined we might live there one day , too
the gas giant planet is seen in the distance here above the horizon of the moon mr frank mckeever also imagines a future where we can tour the historic rings of saturn ( left ) , while europa - known for its ice surface with geysers of water erupting - may one day be ' your new home ' ( right ) â space exploration and essentially spreading our seed is so important , ' mr frank mckeever continued
