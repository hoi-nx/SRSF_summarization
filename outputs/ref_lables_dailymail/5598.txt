farage 's controversial claim that foreign nationals with hiv should not be treated on the nhs was part of what insiders called a â shock and awful â strategy

but when it was discovered that the antiretroviral drugs to treat people with hiv were more expensive , a decision was taken to use that example instead

mr farage has claimed he would stand down if he does not win the seat he is contesting in thanet south , and last night all of his answers focused on the need to curb immigration
