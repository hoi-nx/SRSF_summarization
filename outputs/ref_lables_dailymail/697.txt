a former high court judge who led the inquiry into the bradford stadium fire which killed 56 football fans has dismissed claims the blaze was not an accident saying they are ' nonsense '
a new book by author martin fletcher has revealed a series of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with heginbotham , the club 's chairman at the time of the tragedy in 1985
the official inquiry into the blaze , led by mr justice oliver , concluded that the fire was an accident , probably caused by a spectator dropping a cigarette into rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand at the valley parade ground

today , the former judge has dismissed claims the blaze was not an accident the stand at the valley parade ground burns after a fire in 1985
56 football fans were killed in the tragedy today sir oliver was asked about the new allegations in an interview on bbc radio leeds , where he rubbished mr martin fletcher 's claims
the retired judge said the main flaw in the argument that the fire was arson was that the stand involved had no insurance value as it was due for demolition
' sir oliver also rejected claims his inquiry was held too quickly , three weeks after the fire
he added : ' i can quite understand after having previous fires some suspicion being raised but , as far as i âm concerned , we conducted our inquiry perfectly properly and i have no reason believe it was other than an accident
' the new claims about the fire at valley parade are contained in the book fifty-six by mr martin fletcher , who was 12 at the time and escaped the blaze

mr martin fletcher lost three generations of his family in the tragedy , including his 11 - year - old brother andrew , the fire 's youngest victim , as well as his father john , 34 , uncle peter , 32 , and grandfather eddie , 63
the book , published today and being serialised in the guardian , does not make any direct allegations but mr martin fletcher says mr heginbotham âs history with fires , which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around Â£ 27 million in today âs terms , warranted further investigation
he asks : ' could any man really be as unlucky as heginbotham had been ? ' the disaster also occurred at a time , according to mr martin fletcher âs evidence , when the businessman was in desperate financial trouble - and two days after he discovered it would cost Â£ 2million to bring the ground up to safety standards required by bradford city âs promotion from the old third division
the fire at the ground broke out close to half - time during bradford 's home game against lincoln city on may , 11 , 1985 an official inquiry found that the fire was started by accidentally when a fan discarded a cigarette on to rubbish below the timber stand mr martin fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry , which took place three weeks after the fire mr martin fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry , describing it as inadequate and saying it took place far too close to the event
west yorkshire police said the force would consider any new evidence about the blaze , which also injured 265 people former prime minister margaret thatcher visited valley parade to survey the damage to the stand and pay her respects with her husband dennis mr sutcliffe , mp for bradford south and deputy leader of bradford city council at the time of the tragedy , said he knew mr heginbotham ' flew by the seat of his pants ' in terms of the finances of the club , but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry
