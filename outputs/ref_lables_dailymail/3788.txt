nasa could afford to send us astronauts to red planet orbit by 2033 and onto the red planet 's surface by 2039 , a new report has claimed
the planetary society analysed the feasibility and cost of a crewed mission to orbit the martian moon phobos in 2033 , leading up to a crewed landing on the red planet in 2039
it concluded that such a plan could indeed fit within nasa 's human space exploration budget - but that politics is holding the decision back
' we believe we now have an example of a long - term , cost - constrained , executable humans - to - red planet program , ' hubbard , a professor in the stanford university department of aeronautics and astronautics and a member of the planetary society 's board of directors , said
' this workshop was an important step in community - building among the many groups interested in red planet science and exploration
' the planetary society 's ceo ( and former tv ' science guy ' ) bill , said : ' getting humans to red planet is far more complex than getting to earth 's moon , ' said bill
' but space exploration brings out the best in us
' by reaching consensus on the right set of missions , we can send humans to red planet without breaking the bank
' the workshop 's 70 attendees discussed the technical feasibility , affordability and benefits of a proposed schedule to get humans into orbit around red planet and eventually onto the planet 's surface , using a detailed plan was not created by planetary society , but was proposed in a separate report co-created by nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory
the workshop ' reached a consensus ' on a series of key points , including that an orbital mission would be required prior to a crewed mission to the surface of red planet , and an independent cost estimate showed that the program would fit into the nasa budget , assuming the agency ' ends its lead role in the international space station
' the 2033 orbital mission was identified as the crucial first step of the plan , comparing it to nasa 's apollo 8 mission , which took astronauts into orbit around the moon before humans landed on the satellite 's surface
' the ' humans orbiting red planet ' workshop took place in washington , d.c. various forms of propulsion have been touted for a mission to red planet , including chemical , ion ( electric ) and nuclear
' hubbard said that , in the past , red planet missions may have been limited by technological or scientific challenges , but that no longer appears to be the case
