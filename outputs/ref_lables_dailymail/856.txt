two warring sisters were yesterday stripped of the right to control their aged mother âs fortune because of the intensity of the hatred between them
the hostility between the women â one a 61 - year - old retired gp and the other a 58 - year - old radiographer â meant they would never be able to make rational decisions about how to deal with the 97 - year - old widow âs property , a judge said
senior judge denzil lush said the elder sister could be jailed for attempting to alter a legal document , so she could gain greater control over her mother âs money
she owns a Â£ 600,000 house , has savings and shares worth Â£ 100,000 , and has an income of Â£ 1,200 a month
the court of protection case was brought by the opg ( pictured ) - the regulator of agreements for people without capacity the judge said both sisters were unsuitable to control her affairs â because of the intense acrimony between them â
senior judge denzil lush said the â daughters do nât see eye to eye
the sisters agreed with their mother in 2007 that they should draw up an agreement to control her money and property if she became unable to do so herself
the mother , a widow since 1984 , owns a house in marlow worth between Â£ 550,000 and Â£ 600,000 , savings and shares worth about Â£ 100,000 , and has an income of around Â£ 1,200 a month
the document drawn up by the sisters in 2007 to control their mother âs affairs - an enduring power of attorney - was put into effect in 2013
since suffering from dementia the mother has lived in a care home in stoke mandeville ( pictured ) costing Â£ 940 a week but senior judge denzil lush said that at some stage the elder sister had attempted to alter the document
the judge added that when she registered the new document the gp â knew that this statement was false
judge denzil lush said there were criminal penalties for dishonestly tampering with an enduring power of attorney knight of the opg told the court that â it is more difficult to believe that a professional person with the responsibilities of the gp would misunderstand the difference in appointment types â
