it was set as a maths problem , aimed at testing the logical reasoning skills of 14 - year - olds in singapore
but the question went viral after people across the world were left completely baffled
the problem , which tests logical reasoning , has been shared thousands of times online as people have tried to pose their best explanations of what at first appears to be an impossible question
a maths question set for 14 - year - olds has left people across the world baffled as they try to solve the puzzle the test was set for 14 - year - olds in the singapore and olympiad
the olympiad often features logical reasoning questions and are set to test top achievers
â the test asked : albert and bernard just became friends with cheryl , and they want to know when her birthday is
may 15 , may 16 , may 19 june 17 , june 18 july 14 , july 16 august 14 , august 15 , august 17 cheryl then tells albert and bernard separately the month and the day of her birthday respectively
so when is cheryl âs birthday ? organisers of sasmo said the question was set to filter out the most intelligent of participants at first the question appears impossible to answer without a bit of extra information , but we know cheryl has already told albert the month of her birthday , and bernard the day
this allows reasoning to be used to begin to whittle down the number of options
so , firstly , for albert to be ' certain ' that bernard can not know the answer - as suggested in the first statement he makes - we can deduct that the birthday is not in may or june
so there are now just five remaining dates - july 14 , july 16 , aug 14 , aug 15 , aug 17 - and bernard says he knows which is the birthday
the problem was posted on facebook by â singapore â television presenter kenneth kong , and went viral as people posted their various solutions to the problem
it was set for 14 - year - olds in the singapore and asian schools math olympiads ( sasmo ) , which were held on april 8
this year around 28,000 students from countries across the world including singapore , thailand , vietnam , china and the uk took the test
henry ong , executive director of sasmo , told mothership.sg : ' being q24 out of 25 questions , this is a difficult question meant to sift out the better students
sasmo contests target the top 40 % of the student population and the standards of most questions are just high enough to stretch the students
