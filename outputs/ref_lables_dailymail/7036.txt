all but one of 10 former atlanta public school educators convicted in a widespread conspiracy to inflate student scores on standardized tests were sentenced to jail time on tuesday , as the judge called the cheating scandal ' the sickest thing that 's ever happened in this town
' fulton county superior court judge jerry baxter had delayed sentencing by a day and encouraged all to negotiate deals with prosecutors
but only two agreed to deals
in both those cases , jerry baxter followed the state 's recommendations : he gave a former teacher a 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew at home for one year and a former testing coordinator six months of weekends spent in jail
they 'll also serve five years on probation
he called the cheating scandal ' the sickest thing that 's ever happened in this town ' defense attorney angela johnson holds her hand on her client , former atlanta public school teacher pamela cleveland
she was the only one of the accused to avoid jail after she took a plea deal and was sentenced to 5 years , with 1 year of home confinement and curfew despite their lawyers ' pleas for probation and community service , the remaining eight received harsher sentences , ranging from one to seven years in jail
a state investigation found that as far back as 2005 , educators from the 50,000 - student atlanta school system fed answers to students or erased and changed answers on tests after they were turned in
evidence of cheating was found in 44 schools with nearly 180 educators involved , and teachers who tried to report it were threatened with retaliation
in 2013 , 35 educators were indicted on charges including racketeering , making false statements and theft
the jury acquitted one of the 12 former educators who went to trial and convicted the other 11 of racketeering
' this was very , very remarkable , to have the judge sort of give the defendants a second chance , ' said university of georgia law professor emeritus carlson
' the thing that maybe was a little surprising was the reticence of the defendants to step forward and do that
' former testing coordinator donald bullock was one of only two accused to took a plea deal
he was sentenced to 5 years probation , 6 months of weekends in jail , a $ 5000 fine and 1500 hours of community service former atlanta public school teacher angela williamson was sentenced to two years in prison , three years probation , 1,500 hours of community service and a $ 5,000 fine bob rubin , who represented former elementary school principal dana evans , said the decision to turn down the deal was n't hard for his client
' she could n't say something that was n't true , ' he said , referring to the insistence by the prosecution and the judge that the negotiated deals include an acceptance of responsibility
those who took the deals â former teacher pamela cleveland and former testing coordinator donald bullock â waived their right to appeal
jerry baxter eventually agreed to let all the defendants qualify for first - offender status , after initially denying it for some
former atlanta public school williams , left , and tamara cotman , right , were both sentenced to seven years in prison , 13 years probation , 2,000 hours of community service and a $ 25,000 fine atlanta public school educator tabeeka jordan , left , was sentenced to two years in prison , three years probation , 1,500 hours of community service and a $ 5,000 fine misconduct by educators rarely ends up in criminal court , and the fact that so many of them received jail time sends a strong message , carlson said
when sentencing those who did n't take a deal , jerry baxter reserved the harshest punishment for three regional directors who oversaw multiple schools and were ' at the very top of this scandal
' for them , jerry baxter went above prosecutors ' recommendations of three years imprisonment
during sentencing , jerry baxter called the cheating ' pervasive
' ' it 's like the sickest thing that 's ever happened in this town , ' he said
former atlanta public school srt director michael pitts was sentenced to seven years on tuesday , while diane buckner received a one year jail term former superintendent beverly hall was among those indicted , but she did not stand trial because her lawyers argued successfully that she was too sick
district attorney howard told reporters after sentencing that his goal all along was to get the community to pay attention to what happened in atlanta schools and to make sure the affected children get some relief
he said his office is in talks to create the atlanta redemption academy , which he said will seek to identify and assess the students who were hurt by the cheating scandal and to provide solutions for them , including help getting a job or ged training or assistance getting into college
sentence : chose to take a plea deal before his sentencing , including six months of weekends in jail , a $ 5,000 fine , five years of probation , 1,500 hours of community service and an apology
sentenced to five years of probation with one year of home confinement , 1,000 hours of community service and a $ 1,000 fine .
