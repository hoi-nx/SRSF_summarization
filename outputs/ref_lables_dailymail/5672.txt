for the first time , the government 's drug regulator - the mhra - has approved a remedy containing a traditional chinese herb
the product , phynova joint and muscle relief , contains sigesbeckia , a herb traditionally used to treat aches and pains caused by arthritis
' until now many gps have been wary of recommending chinese herbs , but now there is one product that we know is produced safely and at the optimum dose , ' explains professor lewith , a complementary medicine researcher from southampton university
sigesbeckia is a herb traditionally used to treat aches and pains caused by arthritis ' sigesbeckia gives us another alternative to anti-inflammatory drugs which come with potential side - effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding
' professor lewith does n't use the product himself , but says that before having hip replacements for arthritis he used another herb , devil 's claw , as a remedy for joint pain
he is n't the only orthodox doctor who recommends complementary therapies to his patients ... herbal medicine for colds and depression dr mike dixon , a gp in cullompton , devon , and chairman of the college of medicine , says he is a ' fan ' of herbal medicines because they are ' safe , help to encourage self - care by patients and , in cases such as mint and aloe vera , can be grown by the patients themselves , making them virtually free '
' my go - to remedy in the cold season is a herb called pelargonium , which i take as soon as i feel a cold coming as it prevents the virus replicating , ' he says
' i also use mint tea for indigestion and make a remedy from the lemon balm that grows in my garden to help me sleep
the remedy i most commonly suggest to patients , though , is st john 's wort
' it can interfere with the contraceptive pill and some other medications - but it 's definitely something that i suggest patients should consider

' turmeric for aches and pains dr uzma ali , an nhs who also works at the integrated medical centre in london , explains that as a child she was always given a glass of warm milk with half a teaspoon of the spice turmeric if she fell over
dr uzma ali was always given a glass of warm milk with half a teaspoon of the spice turmeric if she fell over ' only now do i know why that was - turmeric contains an ingredient called curcumin which has been found to have a powerful anti-inflammatory action
' now , if i see patients with problems like sports injuries , back pain , whiplash , fibromyalgia or sciatica , i suggest that they add a supplement of curcumin to their treatment - or , if they ca n't take painkillers , that they use it as their primary remedy
' my favourite remedy is called dehlvi 's haldi capsules , which contain turmeric , but you can buy turmeric / curcumin capsules in health stores - or just add more to your cooking
' acupuncture for migraines dr tanvir jamil , a gp at burnham health centre , near slough in berkshire , has been treating his patients with acupuncture for years
' i mostly offer this to patients for pain relief - particularly migraine
the number of gps in britain who practise homeopathy ' i combine chinese acupuncture - which works along energy lines called meridians in the body , that chinese practitioners believe become imbalanced during illness - and western acupuncture , which concentrates the needles where it specifically hurts
