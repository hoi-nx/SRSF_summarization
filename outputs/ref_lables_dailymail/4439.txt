on saturday , rosetta swooped to within just 8.6 miles of comet comet 67p 's surface

as part of the recent moves around comet 67p , rosetta swooped to within about 8.6 miles ( 14 km ) of the comet âs surface on saturday
its camera was able to capture a four image montage scale at this distance is 1.7 m / pixel showing the large lobe of the icy comet to the left and the small lobe to the right the view also gives a detailed look at the numerous , curved markings visible on the smooth surface
in the same frame , details in the cliffs of hathor can be seen , leading up to the â head â of the comet âs small lobe
the esa also recently released a trove ofimages captured by the rosetta probe during its long journey to comet 67p / churyumov-gerasimenko
this stunning scene was created from two rosetta frames acquired at 12 miles ( 19.9 km ) from the comet centre on 28 march
the scale is about 1.7 m / pixel and the image measures 3.1 x 1.7 km the top right frame offers a stunning view onto hapi , the comet âs â neck â region littered with boulders
as rosetta makes an adventurous passes through the geysers of comet in the coming months , scientists hope to discover more information about the comet âs interior from the jets
the rosetta probe , which was carrying philae , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of earth and mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67p
after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , the probe then successfully released the philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 november 2014 , travelling at 3.3ft ( one metre ) per second relative to the comet
this resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) above the comet before again landing on the surface
â the comet is getting super exciting , â said esa âs rosetta project scientist dr matt taylor in the times
â the probe will be brought within nine miles ( 15km ) of the comet , with its path taking it right through comet 67p âs geysers
but studying the jets could reveal vital data on how gas and dust flows out from the surface , and it could also reveal the connection between the comet âs atmosphere - its coma - and the surface

seen here is rosetta 's view of earth on march 5th , 2005 the latest images include ones of earth and mars which were taken when the probe was attempting â gravity assist manoeuvres â in which it used other planets to slingshot its way towards the comet
pictured is mars as seen by rosetta in 2007 now , as the comet approaches the sun , it is hoped that solar rays will recharge philae âs batteries and bring it back to life
