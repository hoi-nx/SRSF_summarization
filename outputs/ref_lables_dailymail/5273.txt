â bees up , fulham down â rang out of the not - so neutral end at craven cottage on a day for brentford âs 6,000 travelling fans to savour
as stuart dallas thundered in his second of the afternoon , boos descended down on symons , who slunk back into his dugout
but this was nât about fulham and their mounting deficiencies
there were hairy moments for warburton âs side - particularly after ross mccormack âs 67th minute penalty halved the deficit - but they continue to chip away at those above them with a fearless way of playing the game , excitement in abundance

here was a first league double over fulham in 23 years and still the potential for a play - off campaign , although the manager might be looking for more
the celebrations after alan judge âs stunning late free - kick were almost muted , such was the shock at what they âd just seen , and delirium as jota smashed in a fourth
the guard has been changed around these parts and , when symons looks back on the video today , he âll have serious misgivings as to how the little upstarts five miles down the road were allowed to humble fulham in their own back yard
woodrow saw two presentable opportunities go begging before seko fofana - all alone at the back post - could only skew an effort wide with goal gaping
ross mccormack , the multi-million pound signing from leeds last summer , became increasingly on the periphery ; starting as one of two strikers , the scot felt the need to constantly drop off into midfield , such was fulham âs lack of creativity
ross mccormack scored from the penalty spot with 23 minutes remaining to drag fulham back into the game in short , fulham need a plan for next season - and quickly

they âll need a bit more of that if this adventure is to finish at wembley , although the quality of alan judge âs late free - kick might just be even more important
brentford 's moses odubajo challenges fulham midfielder danny guthrie for the ball â we âve had momentum from day one , not in an arrogant way but we have
â they were nât finished there , jota hammering home in stoppage - time to cap off a stunning move
