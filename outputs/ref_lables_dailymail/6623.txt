in 2013 , an 11 - year - old girl was taken to hospital after being trampled by a crowd in new boston , ohio
bargain hunters were accused of behaving like animals as they grappled over coffee machines , hair - dryers and computers
â clearing mr andrew anderson of wrongdoing , district judge anthony carr said : â mrs julie mcgoldrick tried to get one or two tvs disappearing before her eyes , and did get her hand on a box - and unfortunately got her hand through the wires , because she thought that was the best way to hold on to it
