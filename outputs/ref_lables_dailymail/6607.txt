dr giorgi-guarnieri testified on friday during court hearings in dc , that will ultimately determine whether and under which conditions hinckley will be allowed to live full time outside a mental hospital
giorgi-guarnieri said hinckley should be allowed to start the band but not perform publicly
hinckley , in 2014 , the would - be assassin of president reagan , pictured for the first time since a court ruled he can spend 17 days a month away from a mental home where he has been for the last three decades at his mother 's virginia home u.s. secret service agents and bystanders attend to those injured in the assassination attempt on reagan by hinckley on march 30 , 1981
hinckley 's lawyers said mental illness drove the then 25 - year - old hinckley to shoot the president in an effort to impress actress foster hinckley 's lawyer and treatment team say he 's ready to live full time at his 89 - year - old mother 's home in virginia under certain conditions
if the man who shot president reagan is allowed to leave a mental hospital for good , he should have to live under strict conditions , wearing an ankle monitoring device and driving a car with a gps tracking device , government lawyers said on thursday
hinckley 's attorney , levine , said on wednesday on the first day of hearings that hinckley is ' clinically ready ' to live permanently outside the hospital , a position supported by his treatment team
levine said that the mental illness that drove the then 25 - year - old hinckley to shoot the president in 1981 in an effort to impress actress foster has been in ' full and stable remission ' for more than two decades
but levine and government lawyers disagree about the conditions hinckley should have to comply with if he is allowed to live full - time outside of st. elizabeth 's mental hospital in dc , his home since a jury found him not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting
prosecutors have proposed about three dozen conditions if hinckley lives permanently at his mother 's home in williamsburg
hinckley 's lawyers and the hospital oppose many of the restrictions
the judge overseeing hinckley 's case , u.s. district judge friedman , previously rejected prosecutors ' request to have hinckley wear an ankle monitor during the 17 - day visits to his mother 's home
it will ultimately be up to friedman whether to let hinckley live full time in williamsburg and , if so , under what conditions
