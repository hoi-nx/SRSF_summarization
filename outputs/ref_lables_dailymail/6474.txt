' you 're getting the hang of this commentary lark , ' cooed martin tyler during sky sports coverage of the manchester derby
martin tyler was , of course , one half of the commentary team that was once seen as being the best of the bunch
and it was his zinger after united 's fourth goal â ' smalling has scored
it 's a mauling for city ' â that got the veteran lip mic man reaching for the platitudes
neville in the sky sports studio after co-commentating with martin tyler for the manchester derby smalling is pictured scoring for united as city goalkeeper joe hart sees it go in united defender smalling was an unlikely goalscorer against city and neville had a zinger to match it co-commentator neville analysed the goal by saying : ' smalling has scored
it 's a mauling for city ' nevertheless , on his return to his old stamping ground with that new title attached , it was good to see him to turn it on even just a bit
neville was all over this thrilling derby right from the get go
he was also quick to point out what he saw as the ' graveyard ' of city 's right - hand side as united punished them time and time again along the hosts ' attacking left
and when co-commentator martin tyler did observe that he could see yaya finally picking up his man , neville snorted his retort
time and time again neville found himself analysing yaya 's poor performance for city yaya could do little for city as they suffered a 4 - 2 defeat by their great rivals united at old trafford neville ( right ) and sportsmail 's jamie carragher form a dynamic monday night football duo here yaya carried on getting it from neville - who referred to the ' dereliction of duty ' in his performance before adding that yaya 's recent form was : ' not a conundrum anymore
' what 's more , he was equally gobsmacked by yaya 's team - mates ' lack of urgency when sergio aguero scored a late second
however , let 's not assume this criticism is all because neville is simply red
on discussing city 's immediate financial fair play - affected future , he made it quite clear where he stands
' neville was damning in his analysis of city and freely admits he is a united fan after his years of service neville was gobsmacked by the city players ' lack of urgency when sergio aguero ( above ) scored a second this turned out to be not only the right moment , but also the right kind of game to make that point
