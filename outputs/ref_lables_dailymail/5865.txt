a restaurant manager feared huge debts after forking out Â£ 2,000 on a bizarre addiction which meant he had to wear new underpants every day
almond , 26 , from bristol , spent at least Â£ 40 a week buying new calvin klein boxers so that he could slip into a new ' crisp pair ' every day of the week
but after wiping out most of his savings , mr almond realised that it was ' bankruptcy or boxers ' - and that he needed to wean himself off his addiction
he said : ' when i first started wearing new boxers every day , i loved it
it always felt great to slip into a crisp pair
' during his year - long addiction , mr almond bought 365 pairs of new boxers - which were then thrown into the bin after just one wear
' crisp pair ' : during his year - long addiction , mr almond bought some 365 pairs of new boxers - and threw most pairs into the bin after just one wear whenever they stayed over , they would wear the same underwear for several days running , which he thought was ' disgusting '
so , in a bid to get over his former partner , mr almond started wearing a fresh pair every day
' luckily she never looked through my bin - it was full of boxers that i had only worn for one day at a time and then just thrown away
' mr almond eventually began feeling the squeeze when his mother increased his rent by Â£ 100
but mr almond was again forced to rethink his lifestyle when he received a hefty insurance bill through the post
' for the first time in a year , i mustered up the courage to put a pair of boxers in the wash
' it was only once mr almond overcame his boxer addiction that he felt comfortable chatting about it with his friends
