richardson is both one of the most famous and most controversial photographers in the fashion industry
known as much for his racy - often pornographic - photo shoots as he is for the sexual assault allegations that have been made against him
and this week he faced accusations from the model kate upton that he had released footage of her dancing in a bikini without her permission
in the one - minute - long film , which played a huge part in kate 's rise to fame , and which was uploaded to youtube two years ago , kate is seen dancing seductively in a tiny red string bikini - the model says the film was not meant to be for public consumption
alexa chung writes in vogue : ' richardson found himself on the receiving end of her wrath in may 2012 , when he uploaded his now infamous video of upton in a teeny - weeny bikini doing the cat daddy , a dance craze that appears to involve a lot of grinding , " paws " aloft
' the video received millions of hits on youtube - not to mention a number of slow - motion versions for the more discerning customer - but , at the time , upton was horrified because the behind - the - scenes video had been filmed for fun , not something she expected would make the final cut
' richardson has worked with miley cyrus ( left ) and kim kardashian ( right ) shooting them in his new york studio richardson sat front row at the alexander wang fashion show in september 2013 alongside kanye west when asked about the situation kate said : ' i was like , " that was disrespectful , you could have told me ! ''
' but upton also adds that there 's no bad blood over the youtube video anymore
' however this is not the first time that the 49 - year - old photographer who has shot everyone from miley cyrus to kim kardashian in his new york studio has faced controversy
known to many as ' richardson , ' one of his more controversial shots includes a woman giving a man - thought to be terry-fellatio whilst he is dressed as a horse
further sexual shots show richardson completely nude dressed as the devil and with models who are sexually stimulating him with their hands or mouths
in 2004 an intern named ' alex ' was photographed performing oral sex on the photographer while wearing a tiara labelled ' slut ' , something which the richardson described at the time as , ' it 's sesame street ! ' then in 2009 , a model called sena claimed that richardson 's assistant had asked her to give him a handjob , apparently telling her : ' sena , can you grab his c * * * and twist it real hard ? he likes it when you squeeze it real hard and twist it
' in 2010 a model named rie rasmussen confronted richardson at a party in paris after he placed pictures of her next to underage models in his book - in us , models under the age of 18 are considered underage
' richardson poses with pharrell williams ( left ) and james franco ( right ) doing his signature thumbs up pose richardson is good friends with gaga who has previously starred in his risque shoots - the pair were spotted hanging out together in new york in 2010 furthermore in 2010 one of the most disturbing allegations was made against richardson
jamie revealed that she also sexually stimulated the photographer with her hand and was encouraged to do so not only by richardson but by his team after he took all of his clothes off
' despite the allegations which have been levied against him richardson remains popular within the fashion industry pictured here with ralph lauren and emmanuelle alt last year model sara ziff spoke to huffington post live about working with richardson and said : ' you are going to a casting to possibly shoot with him for harper 's bazaar , whose one of his clients
richardson rarely responds to the allegations levied against him , but in march 2014 - after a model posted a piece on reddit including a string of sexual assault accusations he wrote an open letter for page six
charlotte waters claimed that during her shoot richardson became aggressive and it ' became sexual act after sexual act
' the model daisy lowe has previously defended richardson saying : ' he just exudes this sexual energy , so he does n't need to ask girls to take off their clothes
the model coco rocha said in 2010 : ' i 've shot with [ richardson ] , but i did n't feel comfortable and i wo n't do it again
designer marc jacobs once defended richardson as being , ' not ill - spirited
' richardson 's career as a photographer came after he failed to make it as a punk rock musician
