the most likely cause of death was an accidental overdose , an inquest was told however a pathologist could not determine the exact cause of death because the dogs , who were trapped in the house , ate parts of her vital organs
pets : a staffordshire bull terrier ( left ) and jack russell ( right ) like the ones owned by baynham detective constable wesley arnold from hampshire police told the coroner that scratch marks on her chest indicated that her dogs may have tried to wake her after she collapsed
the ' combined effect ' of a variety of drugs found in her system was likely to have been the cause of an accidental overdose , she added
recording an open verdict , senior central hampshire coroner grahame short ruled that there was no evidence of suicide or an accidental fall , but said ms baynham may have had a stroke
' the horrific element in this case is what happened after death rather than before , and it 's entirely plausible that when there are dogs in the house with no one to care for them , that they will then start to eat her remains
' the dogs were subsequently put down on the advice of police officers .
