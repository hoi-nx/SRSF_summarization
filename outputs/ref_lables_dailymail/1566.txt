does any player fluctuate between world - beater and under - achiever more than townsend ? currently on a high after his stunning equaliser for england against italy in turin on tuesday night , the 23 - year - old tottenham winger has already had more ups and downs than most players experience in their careers
later in 2013 , he turned in two of the great international displays of recent years when he destroyed montenegro and poland at wembley to book england 's place at the world cup
townsend unleashes an unstoppable right - footed strike from 20 yards to score england 's equaliser the tottenham and england winger celebrates his goal against italy , which was his third for his country his strike in turin , measured at 77.2mph , was further evidence he belongs on the top table
and yet ... how can a player with townsend 's obvious ability be sent out to nine different clubs on loan by tottenham
why has he still not played a full 90 minutes for his club in the premier league this season ? how come in the autumn it was townsend rather than lennon who was seen as surplus to requirements at white hart lane ? he has scored as many goals for england as he has done in the premier league for tottenham
hodgson admitted agonising about giving him a debut ahead of james milner and jack wilshere against montenegro 18 months ago , but he was man of the match and scored the important third goal in a 4 - 1 england victory
townsend celebrates scoring england 's third goal against montenegro in a world cup qualifier townsend as a pundit for itv during the world cup articulate and bright â his father troy is a leading figure in football 's anti-racism body kick it out â he was comfortable in the television studio as a pundit at last summer 's world cup when an ankle injury ruled him out of hodgson 's squad
townsend thrived with harry redknapp at qpr but it did n't look as if he fitted in under mauricio pochettino at tottenham
when hodgson 's squad was announced for the recent double - header against lithuania and italy , merson claimed townsend should n't have been included
the player had scored for england against san marino this season but missed the slovenia and scotland games with another ankle injury , another reason for his inconsistency
townsend looks dejected after his first - half substitution during tottenham 's 2 - 0 defeat by manchester united the truth is townsend 's style may be best suited to international football which after all is cup knockout when you get to the big tournaments
he has scored three goals in seven games for england compared with three in 21 premier league starts for tottenham
in that sense , you can understand why hodgson will continue to pick him regardless of club form
tottenham will be hoping that townsend can replicate his international form for his club
