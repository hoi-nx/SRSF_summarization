lucas and liverpool captain steven gerrard during sunday 's all - star charity game at anfield liverpool midfielder lucas is looking to recapture what he considers his best form in two years after recovering from injury
the brazil international enjoyed a run of 16 starts in 19 matches from late november - which coincided with a marked improvement in the team 's results - until a groin problem in february 's merseyside derby saw him miss 10 games
he was an unused substitute in the defeat by manchester united immediately before the international break , their first in the league since mid-december , but played 90 minutes in sunday 's all - star charity game at anfield
lucas 's return to fitness could not have come at a more opportune moment , with captain steven gerrard suspended for three matches for his sending off against manchester united , and the brazilian is hoping to slot back in seamlessly after injury halted what was turning into a good season personally
' the beginning of the season was n't good for me because i could n't play much , but as soon as i got back in the team i think i helped a lot
' i do n't know if stevie 's suspension will change things because the team were playing well , but i need to be ready and there are a lot of games to play and the fa cup as well , so everyone will be needed
' lucas attempts to spoil luis 's suarez 's return to anfield with a tackle in the charity match fifth - placed liverpool head to arsenal on saturday knowing they can not realistically afford to lose if they are to keep pace with the top four , but in addition to steven gerrard 's absence they will also be missing centre - back martin , a virtual ever - present this season , after he was retrospectively banned for standing on manchester united goalkeeper david de gea
he has been a very consistent player for us and losing him and stevie is hard to take , but if you want to be successful you ca n't rely on one or two players , ' lucas told liverpoolfc.com
' lucas 's spoiling in midfield helped liverpool go on an impressive run before christmas the brazilian is aiming to take advantage of steven gerrard 's absence in he next three games lucas rejected the chance to have some time off during the international break in order to make sure he was fully fit for the resumption of the premier league
