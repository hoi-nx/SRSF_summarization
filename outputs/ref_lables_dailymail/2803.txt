but for one new york - based writer , the urge to stand in front of a mirror and poke at and squeeze her pores for hours on end became so bad that it actually started ' sabotaging ' her life
in an inspiring essay for marie claire , jenna marotta , 27 , tells of her experience with dermatillomania - a compulsive skin - picking disorder that left her face bleeding - and how she managed to overcome it
' i 'd descend " into the mirror " for up to four hours a day , ' jenna marotta writes in the essay , explaining how her actions horrified her parents
as a child she developed bad eating habits - she would skip breakfast and lunch , then stuff her face with whatever she wanted for hours when she got home
her binge - eating cycle continued through college and after graduation , when she moved back home to her parents ' house in illinois
' getting better : after accidentally going ten days without touching her pores when she forgot to pack her tweezers for a trip , jenna marotta managed to move away from her bad skin habit
she still sees a psychiatrist jenna marotta was aware that her skin - picking was growing out of control and visited a ' battalion ' of dermatologists , who told her that her problem was psychosomatic
but once the three - week program ended , she insisted she had her problem under enough control to move on her own to new york
though the dreaded magnifying mirror was back at her parents ' house in illinois , jenna marotta would still lean in close to her own bathroom mirror to pick at her pores
jenna marotta admitted that she 's also ' attacked ' her face with an extruder , an earring post , an unspooled paperclip , a pushpin , a toothbrush handle , the rough side of a nail file , lotion caps , and nail clippers
one of jenna marotta 's most agonizing memories was when the writer had to interview steve carrell after picking at a cyst on her chin until it bled
' luckily , while travelling to the sundance film festival in utah this january , jenna marotta forgot her tweezers at home , resulting in ten whole days during which she did n't pick at her face
now , the 27 - year - old says she has overcome her condition - and is working on being ' nice ' to herself
' i continue to work with a psychiatrist to stay on track since i first put the tweezers down , ' she says
