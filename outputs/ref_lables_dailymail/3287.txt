the good news for celtic is that they have an immediate opportunity to both vent their frustration and exorcise any sense of helplessness created by sunday âs controversial scottish cup semi-final loss
the bad news ? ronny deila âs men looked like a tired team by time - up at hampden
celtic left back emilo izaguirre has called on his team - mates to focus their attention on winning the league title emilo izaguirre and celtic team - mates john guidetti , nir bitton and scott brown look dejected during semi-final loss celtic are currently five points ahead of aberdeen as they travel to dens park to take on an always - dangerous dundee , ronny deila , john collins and the rest of his backroom team must find a way to lift â emotionally as much as physically â players who have seen a rare and historic treble wrested from their grasp
â we âll try our best to win the league now - and next season we âll try to win the treble
now it âs finished , everything is finished - and we must try our best to win the league
â to not have a scottish cup final to look forward to is so hard
it âs all about winning the league now
â in the aftermath of such a sickening loss , celtic have no option but to move on and concentrate on beating dundee , re-establishing their commanding eight - point lead over nominal challengers aberdeen
what neither ronny deila nor his players can afford to do , though , is completely ignore some of the lessons learned in defeat by inverness
ignoring the obvious pointer about hoping a team umpteen officials can spot a deliberate handball on the line
the way in which celtic were exposed by inverness in the game âs * other * crucial moment , marley watkins out - pacing and out - muscling adam matthews before beating craig gordon to the ball , must be of concern
celtic striker leigh griffiths has a goal - bound shot blocked by the outstretched arm of josh meekings virgil van dijk , scorer of a wonderful opener on sunday , admitted : â we will look at our own performance , because we lost
â it ( the josh meekings handball ) should be the key moment but the penalty was nât given so it âs nothing to talk about right now
â celtic 's virgil van dijk has also urged his team - mates to move on from their recent defeat by inverness
