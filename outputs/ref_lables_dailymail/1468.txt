clarkson and his fellow top gear presenters were just about to renew their lucrative contacts for three more years but they were scrapped when the star punched the show 's producer
james may , 52 , revealed he had prematurely celebrated the three - year deal by ordering a rare Â£ 200,000 ferrari before clarkson 's sacking after an infamous ' fracas ' with producer tymon
may says he had ordered the last ever ferrari 458 speciale - in bright orange - while the ' draft version ' of the lucrative contract was sitting on his desk ' with only a few details to resolve '
but after clarkson punched tymon in a rage over a hot meal , the offer was taken off the table
writing in a column for the sunday times , may said : ' there we were , all three of us , on the brink of a new three - year contract to make top gear , after which we would definitely chuck it in with dignity and hand the reins to a new generation , assuming we were still alive ' there were a few details to resolve about time frames and other mundane stuff , but the groaning draft version of this document was actually sitting on my desk
' this was a great privilege and a once - in - a - lifetime event ; an invitation to continue presenting the world 's biggest tv show for â let 's not be shy â a handsome salary
' the three men had planned to stay on for another three years before quitting ' with dignity ' until clarkson was sensationally sacked after punching show producer tymon ( pictured ) on the future , he remained vague , suggested the three may be reunited on screen or go in separate directions
now , may admits ordering a brand new ferrari is a ' strange ' thing for an unemployed person to do , but insists he has no regrets , describing the purchase as a once - in - lifetime opportunity
