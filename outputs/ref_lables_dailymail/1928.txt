john carver says his newcastle players have a point to prove to themselves at liverpool on monday night
the magpies are in danger of being sucked into what had previously seemed an unlikely relegation battle given their alarming run of form
amid accusations of the team ' playing with their flip - flops on ' , united have lost four on the spin - scoring just once - and john carver admits he does not know where their next point is coming from
it is unlikely to arrive at anfield , a venue at which they last won in 1994
they were beaten 1 - 0 by north-east rivals sunderland seven days ago â a performance john carver labelled ' embarrassing ' â and there was a showdown meeting at the club 's training ground this week in which the head coach let his feelings be known
john carver says his newcastle players have a point to prove when they face liverpool on monday john carver , though , is hoping that personal pride will kick in when they travel to merseyside
' john carver said this week that owner mike ashley has promised to invest in the squad this summer and a major overhaul is expected â out - of - contract players such as jonas gutierrez , ryan taylor and sammy ameobi will be released , while the likes of yoan gouffran , cheick tiote , moussa sissoko and papiss cisse are also expected to move on

john carver , in fairness , is caught in the middle of what is a toxic relationship between supporters and the club 's hierarchy
newcastle were beaten in last weekend 's tyne / wear derby by jermain defoe 's stunning volley john carver has now seen his newcastle team lose four in a row and fall into relegation danger ' it would be easy to say , ' i 've had enough , thanks '
