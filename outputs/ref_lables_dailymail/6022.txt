just two cups of coffee a day could halve the risk of breast cancer returning in women recovering from the disease , a study has found
researchers found coffee can stop the growth of tumours in women who have already been treated with the drug tamoxifen
tamoxifen is the main hormonal therapy drug given to women who have not been through the menopause , and is usually taken for five years or longer after treatment for breast cancer
just two cups of coffee a day can halve the risk of breast cancer returning and boosts the effect of the drug tamoxifen , researchers found most breast cancer tumours rely on the hormone oestrogen to grow , and tamoxifen blocks oestrogen from reaching the cancer cells
they found that more than 500 women who had been treated with tamoxifen , and those that had drunk at least two cups of coffee a day , had only half the risk of their cancer returning than those who drank less coffee , or none at all
rosendahl , a researcher from lund university who carried out the study , said : ' the study also shows that those who drank at least two cups of coffee a day had smaller tumours and a lower proportion of hormone - dependent tumours
they found the breast cancer cells reacted to these substances , especially caffeine
caffeine caused the cells to divide less frequency , and die more often , especially when it was drunk in combination with tamoxifen
the study found caffeine caused breast cancer cells to divide less frequently and die more often ms rosendahl said : ' this shows that these substances have an effect on the breast cancer cells and turn off signalling pathways that the cancer cells require to grow
