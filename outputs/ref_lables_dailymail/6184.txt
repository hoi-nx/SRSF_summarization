all of this because humphrey teasingly suggested to harry redknapp he was in â hostile territory â as bt sport brought us the lunchtime game from the emirates between arsenal and liverpool
not since his aching knees took him away from the touchline have we seen harry redknapp pitch side at a premier league ground
well , that break seemed to have done him the power of good as the former tottenham gaffer chuckled at humphrey âs notion
harry redknapp joined bt sport presenter humphrey for live broadcast of arsenal vs liverpool and it was indeed good to see harry redknapp back in the role of pundit at a live game
and harry redknapp had a view on both aspects
first he addressed sterling âs contribution on the pitch , saying liverpool had â got away with it to a point â in playing him in recent games at wing back
harry redknapp was in fine form as pundit for saturday 's premier league encounter at the emirates while on the young player âs future at the the club , for harry redknapp there was only one position
â wright and steve mcmanaman were in totally agreement , stating in tandem â he does â when asked if they thought he wanted to play his football at liverpool ? when it came to a discussion on the title race , harry redknapp was once again unswerving in his opinion
â we âll have a tenner â , he suggested to the laughing former arsenal hero
the fact that just a few seconds later the same ball was now nestled in the back of liverpool âs net allowed darke a well earned denouement
ian wrighty and steve mcmanaman were quick to defend former tottenham boss harry redknapp the presentation team were now in the studio at the break
harry redknapp giving them knees a rest in the comfy chairs
so harry redknapp was relaxed , but he was nât resting on his laurels
when it became clear daniel was going to be coming on for the second half , harry redknapp was quick to question rodgers decision - making regarding the player
at this moment , had there been anything hanging in the studio air regarding harry redknapp âs future in football management , he managed to snuff that thought out most effectively
arsenal beat liverpool 4 - 1 in the premier league clash at the emirates on saturday picking up on rodgers â pain straight away , harry redknapp told us , shifting uncomfortably in that comfy chair , â that âs the most difficult thing , to stand there and smile
it was the perfect moment to put to rest any suggestion that harry redknapp had departed from the game he clearly still loves
