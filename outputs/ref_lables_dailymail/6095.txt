adam federici lay inert on the turf for a moment
he let his head rest on the grass and closed his eyes as if he was trying to wish it all away , as if he was trying to blot out the din and the agony and the wild celebrations of the arsenal fans
reading , still struggling to avoid relegation to league one , had performed heroically to push arsenal into extra-time in this fa cup semi-final and adam federici had pulled off a series of stunning saves to keep the sides level at 1 - 1 but the australian goalkeeper guessed there would be no way back now
there had been less than a minute to go before the extra-time interval when sanchez had cut in from the left and fired in a stinging shot straight at federici
he knelt to gather it but somehow it squirmed through his legs and trickled over the line as he scrambled in vain to retrieve it
sanchez 's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of reading goalkeeper adam federici in extra time it was a routine shot from sanchez but the reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe the ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game adam federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp reading had fought valiantly but were unable to score another equaliser to take the tie to penalties federici lies slumped on the ground as the impact of his error hits him in the fa cup semi-final against arsenal the reading goalkeeper , who had been magnificent until then , left the field in tears as manager clarke tries to console him adam federici 's opposite number , szczesny ( left ) of arsenal comforts his fellow goalkeeper after the game is resolved reading : adam federici , gunter , michael hector , pearce , obita , gareth mccleary , williams , chalobah ( cox , 106 ) , robson-kanu ( karacan , 90 ) , mackie , pavel pogrebnyak ( yakubu , 111 )

the reading manager , clarke , tried to console him but he was inconsolable
sure , the bigger picture was that arsenal now have a chance to become the most successful club in the history of this competition by winning it for the second year in succession
â i am happy we are through , â said arsenal goalkeeper szczesny

they had nearly taken an early lead when mertesacker rose to meet a corner at the near post and adam federici had to dive smartly to his left to push it off the line
reading held firm but arsenal started to exert more and more pressure
seven minutes before the interval , arsenal broke the stalemate
