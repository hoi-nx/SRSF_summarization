called the micro mote , to tiny technology is a complete computer system
the micro mote is the smallest computer in the world , measuring less than 2mm across
the micro mote contains solar cells that power the battery with ambient light , including indoor rooms with no natural sunlight , allowing the computers to run perpetually
this line of ' smart dust ' devices includes computers equipped with imagers ( with motion detection ) , temperature sensors , and pressure sensors
by strobing light at a high frequency , the operator is able to send information to the computer
once the micro mote processes the data , it is able to send the information to a central computer via conventional radio frequencies
the michigan micro mote is the first complete , operational computer system measuring as small as two millimeters across
' to be ' complete , ' a computer system must have an input of data , the ability to process that data - meaning process and store it , make decisions about what to do next â and ultimately , the ability to output the data
the other key to being a complete computer is the ability to supply its own power

the solar system allows the computer to work under indoor lights without ever having to be charged
' with a 1mm2 solar cell producing 20nw , the device can harvest enough energy under ambient light to run perpetually , ' the team say
