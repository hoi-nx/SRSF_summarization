short , 49 , said women were not suited to playing chess because it required logical thinking
the chess commentator and writer said women should accept they were â hard - wired very differently â and were nât as adept at playing chess as men
mr short , who was the first english player to play a world chess championship match , made the comments when explaining why there were so few women in competitive chess
short has controversially claimed women were not suited to playing chess because it required logical thinking but critics immediately pointed out that he lost a high - profile game against a woman grandmaster
â his comments mirror those of his rival garry kasparov , who infamously said : â women , by their nature , are not exceptional chess players : they are not great fighters
â female chess players reacted angrily to mr short âs statements last night
hungarian judit polgar , above , the former women âs world champion , beat short eight classical games to three in total amanda ross , the leader of the casual chess club in london , told the daily telegraph the comments were â incredibly damaging when someone so respected basically endorses sexism â
she added : â judit polgar , the former women âs world champion , beat short eight classical games to three in total , with five draws
â mr short responded to miss ross âs comments on twitter , writing : you seem to suffer from incomprehension
