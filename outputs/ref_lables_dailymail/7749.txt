a gene that affects the melting point of cocoa butter could lead to the creation of new types of chocolate - as well as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals
us researchers discovered that a single gene called tcsad1 is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter
plant geneticists say their finding could also lead to new varieties of climate change - resistant cocoa plants , which could boost plants â yields and the income of farmers
a gene involved in determining the melting point of cocoa butter could lead to the creation of new types of chocolate as well as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals , scientists claim
each cocoa pod has 40 seeds , which are composed of cocoa butter and used in the making of chocolate â and some drugs
lead researcher guiltinan , professor of plant molecular biology at pennsylvania state university 's college of agricultural sciences said that cocoa butter with altered melting points may find new uses in specialty chocolates , cosmetics and pharmaceuticals
us researchers discovered that a single gene called tcsad1 is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter
plant geneticists say their finding could also lead to new varieties of climate change - resistant cocoa plants
for example , a chocolate with a higher or lower melting point would be useful for production of chocolate with specific textures and specialty applications
' the " snap " and " melt " of chocolate are two very important textural features that determine the appeal of chocolate to consumers , and having new varieties of the cocoa plant that produce butter with different melting points would be a valuable resource to control those characteristics , â professor guiltinan explained
now professor guiltinan and his team have discovered that a single gene - tcsad1 â in the sad family , is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter
â we used state - of - the - art plant science techniques to gain evidence for the role of the sad1 gene in cocoa butter biosynthesis , â he explained
the natural melting point of cocoa butter is close to human body temperature
this trait gives chocolate its melt - in - your - mouth texture and provides a creamy texture to lotions applied to the skin professor guiltinan and his team have discovered that a single gene - tcsad1 â in the sad family , is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter
â an important part of this process is the activity of an enzyme produced by the sad1 gene that creates a special double bond critical in determining the melting point of chocolate that is very close to the human body temperature and makes cocoa butter quite unique
