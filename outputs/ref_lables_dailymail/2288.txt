the nine - gram robots - built by mechanical engineers at stanford university in california - can haul more than a kilogram up a vertical wall
they are so successful they could be used in emergencies , in factories or on construction sites in the future
' scientists have used a gecko as inspiration to create super-strong robots , one pictured , that can carry over 100 times their own weight geckos have small hairs on their feet to enable them to scurry across ceilings and walls without falling off
the robots ' ' feet ' are covered in tiny rubber spikes , mimicking these hairs
