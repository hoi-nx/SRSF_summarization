children of the 1970s and 1980s will likely remember the chunky , plastic fisher-price magnets that adorned fridges in family homes
but for some people , they had another unintended consequence ; the magnets forever changed the colours that people would associate with letters
his colour - letter pairings matched 25 of the 26 letters in the fisher-price magnet set , which is in the foreground at least that 's the conclusion of a study on synaesthesia - a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together
it is believe that around one in 10,000 of people have synaesthesia , and scientists are still unsure exactly what causes some people to perceive two senses at the same time
the colours along the bottom represent the most frequently chosen colour label for each letter the latest study adds to that body of work by suggesting the toy caused a generation to foreever link a with red , f with purple and p with green
they then compared these colour - letter matches to fridge magnets sold by fisher-price between 1971 and 1990
the results revealed that at least six per cent ( 400 out of the 6588 participants ) learnt ' many of their matches ' from the fisher-price set
among those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured , the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter - colour pairings was closer to 15 per cent
the colours in the toy ( upper row ) , the average colour choice for each letter from the 6188 synesthetes ( middle row ) , and the most commonly assigned colour for each letter for the 400 synesthetes are shown here
for participants born between 1970 and 1985 , the prevalence of synesthesia apparently learned from the fisher-price set can exceed 15 per cent synaesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together
but among those born five years or more before it was manufactured , none of the colour - letter matches were aligned with the colours used in the set
' analysis of the letter - colour matching data suggests the only difference between synesthetes with matches to the toy and those without is exposure to the stimulus , ' explained the paper
