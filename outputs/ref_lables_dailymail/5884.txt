memories of drunken escapades may make us blush , but now a computer can use similar facial flushes to recognise people who have had one drink too many
greece researchers created the algorithm , which determines a person âs state of intoxication by looking at the temperature of their face - especially the forehead and nose
and they say the technology could one day be installed in cars to spot drink drivers and stop them starting the ignition
researchers from the university of patras took thermal infrared photographs of 41 volunteers â faces , before and after drinking four glasses of wine
the scientists then used artificial neural networks to compare the sober ( left ) and drunken images ( right ) pixel - by - pixel ( a single pixel is shown above the left eyebrow ) researchers from the university of patras took thermal infrared photographs of 41 volunteers â faces , before and after drinking four glasses of wine
alcohol also affects the hypothalamus , which regulates the body 's temperature
in the study , the researchers found that the temperature of the forehead and to a lesser extent , the nose , is the best indication of a person âs drunken state and built an algorithm to recognise intoxication with 90 % accuracy
they found that the temperature of the forehead , and to a lesser extent the nose , is the best indication of a person âs drunken state and built an algorithm to recognise intoxication with 90 per cent accuracy

the algorithm worked even on faces that it had nât been trained on , and without comparing them to images of people when they were sober when alcohol is absorbed into the blood stream it increases heart rate and blood pressure and blood vessels open wide to allow for more rapid flow , which causes some people to flush

the researchers hope their technology could be used by the police to spot intoxicated people who might start trouble at football matches , for example and say it could be installed in cars and lorries to spot potential drink drivers
called the alcohol language corpus , the database was made by researchers from ludwig maximilian university of munich and the institute of legal medicine between 2007 and 2009 by giving people too much alcohol to drink , before recording conversations conducted in a stopped car , where the drunk person was sitting in the passenger seat
a stock image illustrating drink driving is shown the researchers hope their technology could be used by the police to spot intoxicated people who might start trouble at football matches , for example and say it could be installed in cars and lorries to spot potential drink drivers
currently , breathalyzers ( pictured ) are used to measure alcohol content from this , an algorithm capable of detecting whether someone is drunk by listening in on slurring speech patterns , was created by computer scientists at queens college and columbia university
â the cars themselves could listen to the driver , detect that the potential driver is intoxicated , and prevent the car from starting , â the researchers explained .
