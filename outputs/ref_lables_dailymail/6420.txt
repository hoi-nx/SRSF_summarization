eli was born premature on march 4 without any nasal passages or sinus cavities , a condition so rare it only has a one in 197 million chance of happening
a facebook spokesperson said : ' the photo in question is not in violation of our advertising policies or our community standards
' a post about the removal of the photo by eli 's mother brandi mcglathery was shared 30,000 times in six hours , wkrg reported
brandi mcglathery said : ' i posted the status with a link about it saying no one 's going to keep me from posting photos of my child
' if i can see completely distasteful things on facebook all day long , then i can post a picture of my son
doctors hope to be able to drill nasal passages in eli 's skull which will allow him to breathe when he is older
