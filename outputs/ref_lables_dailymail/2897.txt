' prosopagnosia is a neurological disorder characterised by the inability to recognise people 's faces
also known as ' face - blindness ' , the severity of the condition depends on the degree of impairment a person suffers
some people with prosopagnosia may only struggle to recognise a familiar face , while others will be unable to discriminate between unknown faces , and in more severe cases sufferers can not distinguish a face as being different from an object
some sufferers are unable to recognise their own faces
source : national institute of neurological disorders and stroke mrs natalie whitear , mother to daughters mia , eight , and eva , three , first became aware of her condition when her boss noticed she was unable to remember people she 'd met before
she said : ' about two or three years ago my boss took me to one side and told me i needed to be more careful with remembering people 's names
' looking back , mrs natalie whitear realises that the condition has affected her throughout her life
' people would say that they 'd stood next to me at a queue in the supermarket but i 'd ignored them , or i 'd walked past friends in the street
' mrs natalie whitear uses various coping mechanisms to ensure that her face blindness does not affect her daily life
she said : ' i recognise people by what they 're wearing , how they style their hair , or the way they walk
mrs natalie whitear can describe the weight , height , and hair colour of her husband and children , but not their facial features once mrs natalie whitear 's eldest daughter mia ( left ) wore her hair pigtails so she did n't recognise her
' in an attempt to remember faces , mrs natalie whitear uses facebook , and takes lots of pictures of family and friends
she said : ' i use my friends list as a personal database of all of the people i know , in the hope that i can recognise them when i see them in person
' very rarely some people acquire the condition following neurological trauma , but we 've recently become aware that many more people have a developmental form of prosopagnosia
' sometimes the condition appears to run in families , and often people report other first - degree relatives who also appear to be poor with faces
' recent estimates suggest as many as two per cent of the population ( that 's one in 50 people ) have a degree of face blindness , yet public awareness of the condition remains low
