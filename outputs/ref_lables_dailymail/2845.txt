the cyclone strength winds currently battering the new south wales coast are being caused by an intense low - pressure system known as an east coast low
the stormy weather system , formed in the tasman sea , has n't hit new south wales this strong since 2007 and is expected to be one of the longest lasting ever
east coast lows are particularly common in june and tend to be more frequent in autumn and winter
they can also dump hundreds of millimetres of rain , causing flash flooding and riverine flooding
but this particular one is quite strong and close to the coast winds are up to 135kmh and rain up to 200mm
powerful winds on monday night and tuesday morning also brought down scaffolding ( right ) in edgecliff , in sydney 's eastern suburbs â they normally move away after 12 hours but this one is going to stick around for 24 - 36 hours , which is unusually long for an east coast low
â east coast lows draw strong , moisture - laden winds across the coast , which cause heavy rain to fall when they are uplifted by the hills and ranges that run parallel to the coast
