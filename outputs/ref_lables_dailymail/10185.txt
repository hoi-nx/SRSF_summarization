gibraltar could be the new home of uk 's nuclear submarines if the snp succeeds in ridding scotland of trident
moving the nation 's nuclear deterrent to the uk territory could cost Â£ 3billion and take 10 years to complete , it was reported
the snp want to eject trident from scotland , but both the conservatives and labour have committed to retaining the base on the clyde
the snp 's deputy leader stewart hosie has threatened to hold westminster to ransom over trident if the party holds the balance of power after the general election on may 7
other options for a new home for the nuclear deterrent include falmouth , but the potential political fall - out of moving the submarines to the cornish coast make gibraltar a more attractive proposal

however , a spokesman for the mod said : ' this is absolutely untrue and we can be very clear that the mod is not planning to move the nuclear deterrent from hm naval base clyde to gibraltar , or anywhere else
' the mod is fully committed to retaining the deterrent on the clyde and indeed we are basing all our submarines there from 2020
