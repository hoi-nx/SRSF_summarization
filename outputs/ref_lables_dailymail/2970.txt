local campaigners vigorously opposed to the bridge are calling for a parliamentary inquiry into the scheme ahead of a judicial review the promises were made against a tide of criticism likening the scheme more to a privately managed tourist landmark than a bridge
those opposed to the bridge garden have accused the mayor and the chancellor of disregarding guidelines while using money meant for public transport which would not normally benefit such a small group of people
the director of the waterloo community development group , michael ball , has said the Â£ 175 million could fund 30 million new london parks or the equivalent of 30 times the area of open space the bridge would give
he highlighted the mayor âs previous statements that public money would not be used for the bridge only to reveal last month that public funds would be needed in perpetuity to underwrite the bridge âs yearly Â£ 3.5 million maintenance bill
