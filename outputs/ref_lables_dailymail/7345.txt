miliband today set out plans to scrap stamp duty for most first - time buyers , curbing rent rises and giving local people priority for new homes
miliband used a speech in stockton-on-tees today to promise there is ' nothing more british than the dream of home - ownership ' as he sets out plans to prioritise new homes for local people the move to clampdown on landbanking - where firms hold on to undeveloped sites while its value increases - has proven unpopular
mr miliband , pictured checking his phone as he travels to stockton-on-tees by train , wants to ban developers hoarding land which could be built on in a speech today , mr miliband said there is ' nothing more british than the dream of home - ownership ' as he sets out plans to prioritise new homes for local people
he warned that too often new homes are ' snapped up before local people get a look - in ' and promised to cut the cost of getting on to the property ladder
nine in 10 people buying their first home will benefit from the stamp duty break , saving them up to Â£ 5,000 , according to labour
in a speech in stockton-on-tees , mr miliband said : ' there 's nothing more british than the dream of home - ownership , starting out in a place of your own
' but for so many young people today that dream is fading with more people than ever renting when they want to buy , new properties being snapped up before local people get a look - in , young families wondering if this country will ever work for them
under labour 's proposal , the planning laws would be changed to introduce a ' first call ' policy that would give first time buyers who have lived in an area for more than three years priority on up to half of local new homes
mr miliband was greeted at the arc arts centre in stockton-on-tees by louise baldock , the labour candidate for the stockton south seat house prices are rising faster for first - time buyers than people already on the property ladder , according to nationwide mr miliband said : ' it is simply too expensive for so many young people to buy a home today , saving up for the deposit , paying the fees and having enough left over for the stamp duty
' for the first three years of the next labour government , we will abolish stamp duty for all first time buyers of homes under Â£ 300,000
' chancellor george osborne allowed a two - year holiday on stamp duty , which raised the threshold for first - time buyers to Â£ 250,000 , to expire in march 2012 , introducing a new buy guarantee in its place
mr miliband warns that too often new homes are ' snapped up before local people get a look - in ' and promised to cut the cost of getting on to the property ladder buyers currently pay nothing on the first Â£ 125,000 of a home 's value and are then charged on a sliding scale , starting with 2 per cent on the next Â£ 125,000 and 5 per cent on the following Â£ 675,000
labour says it would fund the stamp duty plans by tackling tax avoidance by landlords , pointing to hmrc figures that estimate it costs Â£ 550 million a year
holding companies that buy properties for investors would be hit by increases to the annual tax on enveloped dwellings while buyers from outside the european union would be hit by a hike in their stamp duty bills of at least 3 per cent
coming from the people who crashed the housing market and repeatedly raised stamp duty , this wo n't distract from miliband 's inability to say what deals he will make with the snp to prop him up in downing street
' in contrast to miliband 's gimmicks , because of our balanced economic plan , we 've been able to deliver lasting reforms - cutting stamp duty for 98 per cent of people who would have paid it
' higher borrowing and higher debt under an snp - controlled miliband government would mean higher mortgage rates and fewer first - time buyers
