hillary 's newborn presidential campaign is reeling from new financial links between her family foundation and companies that benefited from her stewardship of the state department
on a day when a new quinnipiac university poll found only 38 per cent of us believe she is honest and trustworthy , the leading democratic party candidate for president has a mess to clean up
the murky picture also includes tens of millions of dollars bill clinton collected in speaking fees from companies that saw their fortunes rise because of state department actions while his wife ran the agency
he also met putin ( right ) , at the time russian 's prime minister , during the visit in one case a foundation run by the chairman of uranium one , a nuclear energy company tied to russian , gave the clintons ' family philanthropy millions while hillary 's state department gave its stamp of approval to the company 's purchase of us uranium
the russian state atomic agency rosatom purchased a majority stake in the vancouver - based company in a years - long process that unfolded from 2009 to 2013 â the same years mrs. hillary was us 's secretary of state
the executive , telfer , gave the clinton foundation $ 2.35 million during the same time through his family 's fernwood foundation
bill clinton , the former us president , also received one of his highest speaking fees , $ 500,000 , in june 2010 in moscow for addressing an investment bank linked to russian president putin and the kremlin
that number comes from financial disclosure statements filed by hillary when she was a us senator and , later , secretary of state
canadian businessman telfer was only shown as having donated $ 250,000 to the clinton foundation , though tax records reveal that his foundation gave millions when his company was being sold to russian an investigation by the new york times uncovered the connections , based on interviews and public records in canadian , the us and russian
chelsea clinton defended her family philanthropy on thursday in new york , calling it ' among the most transparent of foundations ' reuters reported on thursday that the clinton foundation and its associated charities will re-file at least five annual tax returns to correct the mistakes
her chief female republican rival , former hewlett-packard ceo fiorina , said thursday that alleged links between the clinton foundation , former president bill clinton 's speaking fees and mrs. hillary 's leadership at state are disturbing
when rosatom purchased 51 per cent of uranium one , which controls a reported one - fifth of the uranium made in the us , the reported $ 610 million sale needed to be approved by a committee of government agencies , including the state department
the clinton foundation has become lucrative for one of us 's most powerful political families , with bill clinton receiving $ 26 million in speaking fees from donors to the charity

sixty companies that lobbied the state department when hillary was secretary donated $ 26 million to the foundation , at the time run by her husband , according to the wall street journal
the clinton foundation only reported that telfer gave it $ 250,000 , though tax records reviewed by the new york times show that telfer 's fernwood foundation gave $ 1 million in 2009 , $ 250,000 in 2010 , $ 600,000 in 2011 and $ 500,000 in 2012
the revelations about possible connections between the clinton foundation and hillary 's work in the state department come as more information has been gathered about how the charity lined the pockets of one of us 's most powerful political families
bill clinton has made a total of $ 26 million in speakers fees from donors to the clinton foundation , according to a report in the washington post
the former president has received more than $ 100 million in speaking fees since leaving office , though how much of that was from organizations that also donated to his foundation has not previously been known
some of the biggest donors to the foundation are financial institutions goldman sachs , barclays capital , deutsche bank and citigroup , which personally paid bill clinton $ 3 million in speaking fees
then - senator hillary listens to a briefing from the committee on foreign investment in the united states , the organization where she would later help approve russian 's purchase of us uranium assets bill clinton 's trip to kazakhstan and its president nursultan nazarbayev ( pictured ) helped paved the way for a major foundation donor giustra to start a booming uranium business there canadian businessman giustra ( right ) got a sweetheart uranium mining deal from nursultan nazarbayev in 2008 with bill clinton 's help , a year after launching a ' sustainable development initiative ' with the clinton foundation ; giustra pledged $ 100 million and half his earnings from mining to the foundation his june 2010 speech to leading russian officials at an event for renaissance capital netted him $ 500,000
bill clinton met with putin , at the time russian 's prime minister , during his visit
bill clinton 's appearance is seen as helping giustra secure a deal to start his urasia uranium company in kazakhstan , which would later merge with uranium one
russian would ultimately benefit from the deal and bill clinton 's involvement , and was able to secure more uranium production in its own backyard when took majority control of uranium one in 2010 and 100 per cent control in 2013
