city manager pellegrini has confessed his academy players are not ready to step into his first - team squad , hinting that city may look to cherry - pick the best youngsters from their top - flight rivals
in the week that liverpool âs sterling spoke about his unwillingness to agree a new contract at anfield , pellegrini âs comments suggest that city may look to invest heavily in other teams â homegrown talent this summer
premier league regulations require clubs to carry at least eight homegrown players , which can include youngsters who have spent three of their formative years at an english club
pellegrini says the academy players at city are not ready for the first team pellegrini 's assertions may mean city buy english players like sterling to reach homegrown quotas everton 's england international midfield player ross barkley has also been linked with city but the lack of suitable candidates emerging from patrick vieira âs academy means city âs only option will be to buy in the bulk of their quota , with the defending league champions also linked with arsenal âs jack wilshere and ross barkley of everton
city âs current group of home - grown players will be reduced in the summer when frank lampard departs and it could be further depleted if james milner , who wants guarantees of more regular first - team football , opts to leave
coincidentally , liverpool is james milner âs most likely destination should he leave but the prospect of sterling moving in the opposite direction has been increased to the point that bookmakers rate city his most likely destination next season
belgian defender boyata , who has started nine league games in nearly six years at city , is the only former academy player anywhere near first - team contention
james milner could leave city in the summer with liverpool a potential destination arsenal midfield player jack wilshere has also been linked with a transfer to city defender boyata ( right ) is city 's only academy player near first - team contention â but it âs important to have years of working the same way
pellegrini said : â i think it âs important for big clubs to bring in the best players , that âs the most important thing
â city âs homegrown quota is made up of boyata , frank lampard , james milner , joe hart , reserve keeper richard wright and gael clichy , who qualifies from his years spent with arsenal
frank lampard helps make up city 's homegrown quota but is leaving for new york at the end of the season patrick vieira is overseeing the city academy 's production of youth and homegrown players striker john guidetti is on loan at celtic but could return to meet quota regulations next season meanwhile , pellegrini is not in action until monday , when he takes his team to crystal palace , and with chelsea in an apparently commanding lead at the top , the city manager admits his side face eight cup finals
