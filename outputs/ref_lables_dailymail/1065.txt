now miliband has hired a leadership coaching firm that helps people overcome anxiety and find their â inner voice â
the consultants drafted in by the labour claim to work with politicians to build â leadership skills â using â neuroscience â and â business psychology â
â when miliband tried to make a conference speech off the cuff in september , he forgot to mention the deficit and was roundly ridiculed
â and in a sign that the firm could help mr miliband prepare to negotiate post-election deals , it notes : â our intelligent networks process encourages people to think about what they want to achieve [ and ] identify the people who might collaborate with them to achieve those goals
â mr miliband has consistently lagged behind david cameron in polls on their personal ratings during his five years as labour leader
after the seven - way televised leaders â debate on itv , it emerged that mr miliband had been reading from motivational notes â including one reminding him to be a â happy warrior â
mr miliband has hired extendedmind despite already employing axelrod , a former adviser to barack obama , on six figures
â mr axelrod , who is based in the us , has insisted he is in touch with mr miliband â all the time â by phone , text and email
asked yesterday whether his use of extendedmind had been â helpful â , mr miliband told a press conference : â i will let other people make a judgment on those questions
tory michael ellis said : â there âs nothing authentic about miliband ... even after all his extensive coaching , could you imagine him standing up to putin on the world stage ? he should ask for his money back
