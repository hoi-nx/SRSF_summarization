i âve been out injured for a whole year now , but i âm finally on the verge of a return to regular training
i âm actually in my last week of rehab at the moment , then i âll transfer to normal training and introduce more cycling into my routine
the year has been so mentally and physically tough , but now i can finally look forward
sportsmail 's road to rio cyclist becky james is desperate to get back on to the track after her recent injuries james , pictured during a fashion shoot in manchester , has been sidelined for a whole year british cyclist james supported boyfriend george north during wales ' six nations campaign the most frustrating thing was that one moment i âd be completely fine on the bike , then the next i would be in a lot of pain
this happened a lot during my training up in manchester , so in october we all sat down and decided the best thing was to send me to bisham abbey rehabilitation centre
obviously , there was the stress of being injured as well â but my puppy lola helped me with that ! i did , however , see plenty of the six nations , which i do nât usually get to do because it clashes with my season
though being at the millennium stadium for the opening loss to england was nât great â you can imagine how my boyfriend george north took it
