while you were stuck in a traffic jam this easter , the rich kids of instagram continued their lifelong adventure across the world 's most beautiful locations , exclusive beach - side restaurants and star - studded parties
your average package holiday wo n't do for these youngsters who travel by private jet , sleep in presidential suites , wake up to scrambled eggs topped with truffles - and spend the rest of the day lounging on a luxurious yacht
mailonline caught up with the world 's most extravagant 18 to 26 - year - olds who blew their cash in miami , new york , marbella and monaco to name but a few cities before indulging in their stratospheric nightlife during spring
while the glamorous lana sisters ' partied with a-list movie stars ' , self - made millionaire tomer sror continued to earn hundreds of thousands in minutes over online trades â even when he was sunbathing on the beach
and no one does it quite like 18 - year - old marcus who ' constantly needs to be on the move ' and hates being in ' one place for two weeks '
but not before heading down to louis vuitton to pick up a gold and brown document holder worth over Â£ 750 which has made several appearances on his opulent instagram account
the young investor says it 's not all fun , games and champagne - telling mailonline : ' i would n't exactly say that life is just one big holiday because while i travel i 'm not just sitting there and relaxing i 'm always networking or doing meetings
' 20 - year - old lana and her sister stephanie - who have been travelling back and forth between countries since they were young children - have become pretty used to the jet - setting lifestyle
' but tomer sror who describes himself as a self - made man believes vacations should be spent relaxing with a beautiful girl
' high - fliers : while most 20 - somethings would shack up in a local hostel , the jet - setting lana sisters spend their vacations in monaco in the cafe scenic : and instead of hiring a cheap rental car for a cross-country road trip , andreas does the trip in his porsche before enjoying a beautiful panoramic view of oslo fjord wish you were here : 20 - year - old businesswoman lana says she travels to promote her jewellery business as much as to have an adventure ca n't stop : marcus who ' constantly needs to be on the move ' used his mind - blowing trip to machu pichu in peru to satisfy his need not to be ' one place for two weeks ' playtime : after spending time in los angeles and london , lana was delighted to be back in her ' playground ' of monte carlo unlike most 23 - year - olds who would book into a local hostel , he spent his time between the presidential suites of the elysium in rhodes which set him back around Â£ 1,000 - a - night and the eilat in israeli which costs at least Â£ 500 - a - night
for lana who grew up between new york , london and monaco , travelling both a hobby and a necessity to promote her luxury jewellery company lana scolaro diamonds around the world
' and despite his own desire to unwind and relax , even tomer sror takes time away from the jet - ski and presidential suite to make a quick ' 209k profit '
' same is the case for globe - trotting marcus who told mailonline : ' i would n't exactly say that life is just one big holiday because while i travel i 'm not just sitting there and relaxing i 'm always networking or doing meetings ! ' quick round : 26 - year - old andreas spends his time in the united states at the glorious miami beach golf club with his friends soaking it in : lana ( pictured ) , prefers to spend her time working on her tan on a west - hollywood rooftop in los angeles getting dirty : go - karting is a no - go for native new - yorker marcus who enjoys a spot of dirt racing in sunny costa rica big money : self - made israeli businessman tomer sror ca n't bare to leave the office at home and manages to make a quick few hundred thousand while on vacation stunning : the lana sisters lana ( left ) and stephanie ( right ) still manage to fit in a bike ride on venice beach in between their many meetings despite the extreme levels of wealth he flaunts on his social media site , the 18 - year - old insists he is not out to make people jealous or infuriate the so - called ' haters ' - but to inspire people to reach higher
mile high : marcus even relaxes in style wearing his vintage ray bans and expensive time piece in the back of a Â£ 2million personal jet chilling : andreas ' choice of hang - out spot after a yacht ride and a round of golf in miami is n't too shabby either , as he stretches his legs in the marquis residence in miami where apartments cost up to Â£ 3.2million sunset cocktail : what better way to relax and watch the sunset after a busy day of business meetings in malibu than dinner at the exclusive nobu restaurant rooftop cheers : and tomer sror who says he is ' unlike the other kids ' because he ' had to work for the money ' says there is nothing better than using your vacation to kick back and relax
