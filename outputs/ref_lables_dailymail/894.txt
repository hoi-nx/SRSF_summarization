college basketball player hill lost her battle with cancer on friday morning , aged just 19
the indiana native , who was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer shortly after her 18th birthday , had defied doctors ' expectations after they told her that she would not live past december
instead , she played four games with her team at mount st. joseph in cincinnati and raised more than $ 1.5 million for research into the cancer , dipg
but as her condition worsened , she became an honorary coach and earlier this year , she moved to cincinnati children 's hospital , where she passed away on friday morning
but in september , doctors told her she would n't make it past december - and after years as a standout high school basketball player , hill 's hopes of playing college ball were put in jeopardy
but the ncaa granted permission to move the school 's opening game forward because of her worsening condition , and on november 2 , she realized her dream of playing for the school
' it 's a dream come true , ' she said
