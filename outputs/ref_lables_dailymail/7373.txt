the emails that resulted in the firings of two police officers and a court clerk in the city of ferguson , missouri were released on thursday
seven in particular are remarkably racist , including one that was previously released in which disgraced police officer richard henke says of president obama ; ' what black man holds a steady job for four years
' in the other emails president obama is labelled a monkey , welfare recipients are described as ' lazy ' and unable to speak english before being compared to dogs and black individuals are first lady michelle obama is called a tribeswoman
the caption underneath reads ; ' rare photo of ronald reagan babysitting obama in early 1962
' mary ann twitty wrote at the top of that email ; ' some of these emails just touch me more than others
another email sent by twitty , this one to unknown recipients , is a story about a man having his daughter deliver his final child support check to her mother called ' leroy 's last child support payment
' so i explained to her that my dogs are mixed in color , unemployed , lazy , ca n't speak english , and have no frigging clues who their daddies are
' there is then a photo of a black man who is missing almost all of his teeth screaming ' lawd a mercy ! ! ! ! ! ' what 's more , at the bottom it says ; ' a smile is contagious , pass it around
' twitty also sent an email that showed a group of tribespeople in costumes dancing with the subject line ' simply beautiful , ' and wrote ; ' michelle obama 's high school reunion
' twitty is also responsible for sending an email called ' insensitive one liners , ' saying ; ' this is pretty funny stuff
an email sent by mudd to twitty and then forwarded on by twitty to unknown recipients is about a black woman getting an abortion in new orleans
' two weeks later she received a check for $ 5,000 , ' reads the email
' it then closes by saying ; ' the hospital said , ' crimestoppers , " ' in another , mudd writes to twitter about getting his dogs on welfare as they ' are mixed in color , unemployed , lazy , ca n't speak english , and have no frigging clues who their daddies are
' mudd then says at this point the worker went to see if his dogs qualified for welfare
' damn , this is a great country ! ! ! ! ' the only email sent by captain richard henke meanwhile was the aforementioned one about president obama
president obama ( above ) has not commented yet on the emails released on thursday analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records in ferguson last month found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed african - americans make up 93 percent of arrests while accounting for only 67 percent of the population in ferguson , an unnamed department official said
a black woman in new orleans was admitted into the hospital [ for ] pregnancy termination
two weeks later she received a check for $ 5,000
' nationwide protests of police actions that resulted in deaths of african americans in ferguson , new york and cleveland laid bare racial tensions and what president obama called ' simmering distrust ' between police and communities
but they are unlikely to restore full trust in the ferguson police by citizens who were angered when a grand jury decided not to indict michael brown 's killer , officer darren wilson
