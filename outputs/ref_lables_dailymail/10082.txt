bamford enhanced boro âs automatic promotion bid by equalling the club âs record goal return of the modern era
bamford , the on - loan chelsea forward , struck his 15th of the campaign , to match the tally of colombian hamilton ricard during the 1998 - 99 premier league season
his deflected 20th - minute effort was enough to earn victory over relegation - threatened wigan , who now have just six matches to avert the prospect of playing league one football just two years after shocking manchester city in the fa cup final at wembley
boro striker bamford , on loan from chelsea , scores the opening goal via a deflection bamford celebrates his 17th goal of the season , the fourth that he has scored in his last four games boro : konstantopoulos , kalas , jonathan woodgate , gibson , friend , adam clayton , leadbitter , reach , bamford , adomah , vossen
wigan : al habsi , boyce , harry maguire , jason pearce , bong , pennant , james perch , kim , mcclean , leon clarke , josh murphy
however , no second - tier side have taken more points on their own turf than boro and bamford made it nine victories in 10 attempts at the riverside
a wigan free - kick invoked panic in the home penalty area as konstantopoulos dropped a high ball at the feet of leon clarke , whose instinctive prod goalwards then fortuitously struck the boro goalkeeper
but boro seized on the loose ball and within seconds they had scored
he curled his shot goalward from 20 yards and a slight deflection off wigan defender jason pearce took it beyond the grasp of his goalkeeper ali al-habsi
jonathan woodgate plays the ball out of defence as boro looked in control for long periods adomah gets dow the outside of josh murphy as boro continued their promotion push despite bamford stealing the limelight , however , boro head coach karanka praised the effort of his team
wigan were playing to stay up and i think in all games someone has something to play for , so every game will be difficult
â everyone was tired after bournemouth and there were a lot of games in february and march
â bamford is mobbed by his team - mates after the goal that sent boro back to the top of the league malky mackay 's side remain adrift in the relegation zone after a third defeat in their last five games wigan pressed hard for an equaliser after the break and it took a strong right hand from konstantopoulos to keep out substitute marc-antoine fortune âs effort just after the hour
