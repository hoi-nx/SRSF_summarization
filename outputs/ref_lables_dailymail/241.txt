a breakthrough has been made in the development of clean hydrogen power , scientists claim
at the moment , while hydrogen fuel is appealing , the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy
but the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water , meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels
hydrogen - fuel is appealing for use in cars like the vauxhall zafira minivan pictured , but producing hydrogen requires huge amounts of energy
with the new breakthrough , it could be possible to make it more easily researchers at the university of bath and yale university created the invention
it uses a newly designed molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel
the new patented catalyst is more efficient at performing the crucial oxidation half of the reaction than any other existing material , minimising energy losses in the electricity - to - hydrogen conversion process
the process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen but , while the first part can be done quite efficiently , the latter was more difficult and lots of energy is lost
their catalyst , placed on an electrode used in the production of hydrogen , is much more efficient - and although dr hintermair did nât have an exact figure , he said the energy loss using it is â almost non-existent â
the major benefit from this breakthrough is that hydrogen could now be used more easily as a way to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar
the large bubbles are oxygen , while the smaller bubbles on the left are hydrogen the team are in discussions with a number of energy companies about utilising this technology on a large scale and hope the breakthrough marks the start of contributing to providing the world with more sustainable fuels
one use of the newly developed catalyst could be to store the energy produced by solar power by using the electricity to produce hydrogen which can then be used on demand , regardless of the time of day
if we want to bring about a clean hydrogen economy we must first generate clean hydrogen
' this new molecular catalyst will hopefully play a large role in helping create hydrogen from renewable energy sources such as solar power
