having gone all the way to last year âs wimbledon final bouchard has shown she knows how to handle etiquette , including the anachronistic task of having to curtsey
her refusal to shake hands with romanian opponent alexandra dulgheru turned out to be the precursor of a dreadful few days for the world no 7
bouchard was mocked at home and abroad over the handshake controversy bouchard refused to shake the hand of alexandra dulgheru before fed cup match at the weekend bouchard ended up suffering not just the humiliation of losing to far lesser ranked opponents in front of her hometown crowd in montreal , but of being mocked by the opposing romanian team after they had inflicted defeat
even romanian âs world number three halep , a shy and retiring type , weighed in by casting aspersions about the kind of upbringing bouchard has had
bouchard explained away her graceless act as merely being true to herself , but the truth is that such brattish behaviour is neither principled nor smart
it is not the first time that bouchard has declined the traditional shake of hands that takes place at the draw prior to matches in the fed cup , the women âs incomprehensible equivalent of the davis cup
she did the same last year to slovakia âs kristina kucova in front of the cameras which have , again , spread the footage all over the internet
the 21 - year - old canadian broke into the world 's top 10 after a superb 2014 she lost both her singles matches to world no 69 alexandra dulgheru and andreea mitu , ranked 104th romanian 's alexandra dulgheru said the handshake snub had given her extra motivation for the match â it was nât personal , i just do nât believe in wishing my opponent good luck before a match , â said bouchard this time
after alexandra dulgheru beat her in straight sets she celebrated with her team - mates by theatrically pulling away her hand before it could be shaken
the watching halep told romanian reporters : â i would never have done it but this is how she ( bouchard ) is raised or it âs a habit
â a superb 2014 saw bouchard fly into the top ten at a rate few expected , the highlight being her run to the final of sw19
bouchard reached last year âs wimbledon final , where she lost to petra kvitova there is also a sneaking admiration for the way she refuses to get involved in the sometimes phoney mateyness that permeates the men âs locker room
not for bouchard the guff that she is â pleased â for her opponents when they do well
