blackburn manager bowyer has hit out at fa rules which prevent him from fielding one of his own players against liverpool in wednesday night 's sixth round replay at ewood park because he was on loan when the first tie was played on march 9
bowyer , who has a lengthy injury list at his championship club , wanted to include 21 - year - old midfielder john o'sullivan to face the reds having recalled him from a loan spell with league one barnsley last month
blackburn midfielder john o'sullivan ( right ) is ineligible to play in their fa fifth round replay vs liverpool bowyer says it ' does n't make sense ' that he ca n't use john o'sullivan , who 's been recalled from barnsley bowyer said : ' it will be a huge achievement to beat liverpool in these circumstances
because of the embargo ( for breaching fpp rules ) we are only allowed a squad of 24 players and have played 13 games in 43 days
' so to be told we ca n't even play one of our own players because he was sent on on loan before the first game does n't make sense to me
he 's back now , he 'd be eligible for the semi-final if we get there , but not the quarter - final replay
john o'sullivan ( left ) , who was on loan at barnsley , will be available to play if blackburn reach the semi-finals though ' the palace fans got them over the line against manchester city on monday night and we need our supporters to be the 12th man , 13th man or even 14th man
