there is a passage in torres âs book , ' the special one - the secret world of mourinho ' , which goes a long way to understanding the practices of chelsea âs manager
in the english version of torres âs biography , the exchanges between mourinho and cristiano ronaldo in the dressing room at real madrid start on page 138 and finish five pages later
here is an abridged version of the alleged events in the team meeting before the second leg of the 2011 champions league semi-final against barcelona , when cristiano ronaldo had made it clear he expected real madrid to be more adventurous in the bernabeu
mourinho makes a point to oscar and his brazilian team - mate willian during a game at stamford bridge mourinho has been called out by players for being too defensive before , by cristiano ronaldo at real madrid oscar holds his head in his hands after missing a good chance at stoke , where he was replaced at half time oscar has n't completed a full 90 minutes for chelsea since mid-january
here is is full recent record : jan 31 manchester city ( substituted , 89 ) feb 7 aston villa ( substituted , 73 ) feb 11 everton ( unused ) feb 17 paris saint-germain ( substitute , 83 ) feb 21 burnley ( substituted , 72 ) mar 1 tottenham ( substitute , 88 ) mar 4 west ham ( substituted , 74 ) mar 11 paris saint-germain ( substituted , 45 ) mar 15 southampton ( substituted , 82 ) mar 22 hull ( substitute , 61 ) apr 4 stoke ( substituted , 45 ) according to torres , the real madrid coach told his star player : â i âm going to say it to your face : you complain that we play defensively
you can not blame oscar , the current fall - guy , for encouraging chelsea to play with a sense of adventure at a team meeting that took place during their wobble at the end of january
when you can call upon oscar , eden hazard and willian , why would nât you ? oscar has been put back in his box in recent weeks , failing to start or finish a full 90 minutes in all competitions for chelsea since the 1 - 0 victory over liverpool in the capital one cup semi-final second leg on january 27
the brazilian midfielder has failed to complete 90 minutes in any of chelsea 's last 11 games mourinho demands that the likes of oscar work hard on their defensive roles to free eden hazard 's flair the brazilian forward has not completed a barclays premier league match since the 5 - 0 victory at swansea , where he scored twice for the league leaders , 10 days earlier
naturally oscar has some concerns , worried that his views at a routine team meeting have been misinterpreted by this most demanding of managers
oscar was disappointing during last weekend 's win , and mourinho hit out at his performance afterwards the chelsea star tries a fancy flick but little of what he tried came off during the win against stoke it is believed to have been innocuous , an observation from a player who has been a popular and respectful member of the chelsea dressing room since his move from internacional in 2012
it was oscar , after all , who is so highly - regarded by the coaching staff at chelsea that he was considered a potential , future rival to the annual duel between lionel messi and cristiano ronaldo for the ballon d'or
oscar was dejected after brazil 's world cup semi final defeat , but he returned to chelsea with a good attitude the chelsea midfielder suggested the side should be more positive with the likes of eden hazard and willian when oscar arrived at the club he was thought of as a future ballon d'or winner , but his place is now in doubt there is a touch of clough about mourinho âs attitude towards him , a nod in the direction of the famous response he gave when asked about the way he dealt with disaffected players
