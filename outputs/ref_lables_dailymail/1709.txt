alderweireld is ignoring the background noise about his future , such is the on - loan defender 's determination to complete saints 's ' special season ' by securing european qualification
eyebrows were raised last summer when the 26 - year - old moved to st mary 's on a season - long loan , just months after playing for atletico in the champions league final
alderweireld 's form on the south coast has attracted interest from the likes of manchester city and tottenham , but koeman 's side have the option to make the deal permanent for just Â£ 6.8million
alderweireld has been in superb form this season at saints since joining on loan from atletico the belgium international has expressed a desire to stay at saints , but the waters are muddied by atletico 's ability to nullify the buy - out clause by paying them Â£ 1.5million
jose luis perez caminero recently indicated the primera division club would invoke that clause , saying diego simeone 's men were counting on him for next term , but alderweireld is unclear whether he will be at st mary 's , the vicente calderon or elsewhere
' i saw something in the spain papers , ' said alderweireld
' i am just focused on saints and we are playing for a european spot , so it is going to be a special season
' alderweireld has been one of saints 's best players in a remarkable season
last season alderweireld was playing in the champions league final for his parent club , and he could return ' it is has been a very nice season , ' alderweireld said
' the win over hull was unconvincing but gave saints 's faint top - four hopes a boost
the belgian defender tackles stephen quinn , and says he is ignoring rumours about going back to spain ' we know we have tottenham at home so we can do good business , but first we have to go to stoke and that is going to be difficult
alderweireld is focused on european qualification , and saints took another step towards that goal against hull ' the yellow card incident where alex ( bruce ) is covered in claret , where ( graziano pelle ) has caught him flush straight in the face , that for me is a red card , but obviously with the penalty the ref got that right
