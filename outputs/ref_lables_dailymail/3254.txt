a two - year - old girl who died from a brain tumour has been frozen - in the hope she will one day be revived by advances in science
matheryn naovaratpong , from thailand , is thought to be the youngest person ever cryogenically preserved
the toddler was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer last april after she failed to wake up one morning , motherboard 's brian merchant reports after being admitted to a bangkok hospital , tests revealed she had a 11cm tumour in the left side of her brain
the outlook was bleak from the start - the disease has a five - year survival rate of 30 per cent
to make matters worse , matheryn naovaratpong - known to her family as einz - had fallen into a coma
she died on january 8th this year after her parents switched off her life support machine
by the time she passed away , she had lost 80 per cent of the left side of her brain - essentially paralysing the right side of her body
but determined for some good to come from her death , her family have had her body cryogenically preserved - by one of the biggest providers of this service in the world
matheryn naovaratpong is currently at the arizona - based alcor , her brain and body frozen separately at 196c
her family 's main - although many would argue , far fetched - hope is that one day , science will have progressed enough to restore life to her
alternatively , her parents want the cells from her brain and other parts of her body to be saved , so the disease that killed her can be studied in the future
' membership ' to alcor costs $ 770 a year - plus a rather more hefty $ 80,000 for a ' neuro ' ( the procedure matheryn naovaratpong had ) or Â£ 200,000 to have a full body frozen
alcor is also where the bodies of famous baseball player ted williams , as well as his son john henry williams , are stored
' it [ the freezing ] provides the opportunity for matheryn naovaratpong to breathe again when the technology is provided and appropriate for her disease , ' said her father , who found out about the cryopreservation firm on the internet
over a dozen different medications are administered before blood is drained from the body and replaced with medical - grade antifreeze ,
and as matheryn naovaratpong 's doctor pointed out : ' her life was made possible by modern science in the first place - she was carried by a surrogate because her mother had lost her uterus birthing a son
instead , a doctor from alcor flew to thailand and , as soon as she was pronounced dead - at 6.18pm on that january evening - preservation of her body began
matheryn naovaratpong is currently at the arizona - based alcor , her brain and body frozen separately.her family 's main - although many would argue , far fetched - hope is that one day , science will have progressed enough to restore life to her usually , the brain would be removed from the body and then frozen
but customs and repatriation issues to the us meant it was easier , according to mr drake , to undertake cryoprotective perfusion of matheryn naovaratpong âs brain in thailand
after two weeks , the body reaches deep cryofreeze at -196 Ë c. matheryn naovaratpong underwent a procedure called a ' neuro '
it is now sitting in a stainless steel , vacuum - insulated container in arizona filled with liquid nitrogen at -196 Ë c. but the question still remains as to how - if science did eventually progress enough - any frozen body would actually be revived
' and for matheryn naovaratpong 's family , it provides peace of mind and gives them some solace from the tragedy of her death
