president obama will once again stop short of calling the 1915 massacre of armenians a genocide , prompting anger and disappointment from those who have been pushing him to use the politically fraught term
as a candidate for president in 2008 , obama promised to use the term to describe the mass murder if elected but has not followed through despite calls from the most famous armenian-american , kim kardashian , and the pope for the world to recognize the killings as a genocide
kim kardashian , whose armenian heritage comes from her father , the late robert kardashian , has used her celebrity since at least 2011 to bring awareness to the genocide
she last week traveled to the country for the first time with her husband kanye west , sister khloe and cousins kara and kourtni
but the white house still refuses to call the mass killings of ethnic armenians a ' genocide ' for fear of offending ally turkish slaughter : historians estimate that 1.5 million armenians were killed by ottoman turks during world war i. above , armenians are made to march in this picture from the 1915 massacre kim kardashian , in red , and khloe kardashian , in blue , walk in the plaza at the dzidzernagapert last week

the white house said u.s. officials pledged to armenian - u.s. leaders that the u.s. would use this week 's 100th anniversary of the killings ' to urge a full , frank and just acknowledgement of the facts , ' but a statement about the meeting did not include the word ' genocide
' historians estimate up to 1.5 million armenians were killed by ottoman turks , an event widely viewed by scholars as a genocide
the pope has also called the slaughter ' the first genocide of the 20th century ' kim kardashian and kanye west are pictured here with daughter north west and khloe as they walk inside church hallways to view art prior to baptism in at cathedral of sts
' the white house also announced that treasury secretary jacob lew will attend a ceremony in armenia friday making the anniversary

' during their trip last week to her ancestor 's homeland , kim kardashian , khloe and their cousins met with the country 's prime minister , hovik abrahamyan , who ' expressed how proud they are that we are proud armenians and we have not forgotten our roots ! ' kim kardashian said in a tweet

ties that bind : the kim kardashian family tree that traces back to two armenian families home : kim kardashian 's ancient ancestors fled the armenian village karakale ( pictured recently ) to escape a prophecised genocide that did come to pass genocide : the village of karakale ( pictured in the 19th century ) was among hundreds destroyed as the ottoman turks laid waste to the region
residents - possibly including the kardashians - can be seen standing by their traditional houses disputed : armenian lands ( in red ) were disputed just after the turn of the 20th century , with bloody consequences armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were killed between 1915 and 1917 as the ottoman turks was falling apart and have long sought to win international recognition of the massacres as genocide
