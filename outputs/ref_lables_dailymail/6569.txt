a new study has uncovered evidence that a relative of tyrannosaurus rex , called daspletosaurus , may have indulged in cannibalism
paleontologists have found bite marks on the fossilised skull of a juvenile daspletosaurus , which lived around 75 million years ago
this artist 's reconstruction shows a daspletosaurus feeding on the body of another in an act of cannibalism while some of the injuries appear to have been sustained during combat with other tyrannosaurs , others appear to have occurred after death
the scientists believe that another daspletosaurus , which could grow to nine metres ( 30ft ) as adults and weigh up to four tons , fed on the youngster 's body
scientists believe they have evidence that the top predatory dinosaurs were highly intelligent pack animals , despite tyrannosaurus rex being popularly depicted as a dangerous but dim - witted loner
tarbosaurus , a cousin of tyrannosaurus rex that lived around 70 million years ago , was a two - legged predator up to 12 metres long and weighing five tonnes
' the researchers , whose work is published in the journal peerj , were examining the skull of a daspletosaurus found in a quarry in the dinosaur provincial park close to calgary , alberta in canada in 1994
daspletosaurus , which means ' frightful lizard ' , is thought to be a close relative of the more famous tyrannosaurus rex and roamed north america between 77 million and 74 million years ago
the researchers found numerous injuries on the skull , several of which appeared to match the teeth of tyrannosaurs
the skull of the juvenile daspletosaurus ( above ) was covered in bite marks made by tyrannosaur teeth hone ( left ) and darren tanke ( right ) studied the fossilised skull at the royal tyrrell museum one bite to the back of the head broke off part of the skull and left a circular tooth - shaped puncture through the bone
the fossilised skull of daspletosaurus was found in a quarry in dinosaur provincial park in alberta , canada daspletosaurus , shown in the artists reconstruction above , led a violent life the study suggests tyrannosaurus rex is also thought to have indulged in cannibalism , according to a study in 2010
writing in the journal , dr hone and his colleague darren tanke from the royal tyrrell museum in drumheller , alberta , said the daspletosaurus appeared to have lived a violent life involving battles with other members of its own species
