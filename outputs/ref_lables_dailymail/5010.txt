a woman who was sexually abused as a child by her step - father has spoken out for the first time after a confession to her fiancÃ© led to her attacker being jailed
kim , from suffolk , has bravely waived her right to anonymity and spoken about how she was abused by derek osborne from the age of four
the now 31 - year - old revealed she was forced to dress up in her mother 's lingerie at the age of eight , and was even made to watch pornographic films
kim ( left ) was abused for years by her step - father but never revealed her past until her partner rob ( right ) encouraged her to approach the police about her attacker
the couple pictured on their wedding day in 2013 for years , kim bottled up the painful memories until she met her husband rob , 34 , who guessed that she had been abused and helped to put derek osborne behind bars 20 years after the offences
while planning their wedding in 2013 , rob asked his fiancÃ©e if she had been abused as a child due to her withdrawn nature
his question finally prompted kim to confess what happened to her
the mother - of - two says that rob 's question finally gave her the nudge that she needed to reveal her past
derek osborne ( left ) abused kim ( right as a child aged seven ) from a young age encouraging her to get into his bed for ' cuddles ' at the age of nine derek osborne ( pictured ) forced kim ( pictured left as a child ) to dress up in her mother 's lingerie and watch porn films ' when rob asked me it was my chance to share the painful secret i 'd been hiding â that the man i had called dad had abused me
' she told rob how her step - father made her climb into bed with him and kiss and cuddle him
speaking about the abuse , kim , who married rob in 2013 , said : ' i did n't know any different so i accepted what he was doing as normal
' kim 's biological father died when she was young and she was aged three when derek osborne began a relationship with her mother
she says that as a young child derek osborne 's attention was originally welcomed in her large family
but i was always derek osborne 's favourite
kim never revealed her past until rob asked her if she had been abused ahead of their wedding ' he often called me into his bed at night for a cuddle , so he could touch me under the covers
' aged seven , kim was taught sex education at school which soon made her realise that her step - father 's actions were not normal
' kim was too scared to approach anybody about her attacker and the abuse continued
she said : ' when i was nine , he forced me to dress up in mum 's underwear , then he made me watch sick porn films
' but that all changed when aged 10 , kim saw a television programme about sexual abuse
' however to kim 's horror her mother wanted to keep derek osborne around as a father figure
' ahead of the wedding kim reported the abuse to the police where it was revealed derek osborne had abused other girls although she had finally escaped her attacker kim was still living with the effects of the abuse
' although kim met a man aged 18 and had a daughter at 23 , the relationship did not work out
she found it difficult to trust and stayed away from the dating scene until a friend set her up with rob
' kim and her daughter moved in with rob after six months and just weeks later in august 2010 he proposed
kim said she was able to seek justice after confessing all to rob
' while searching for wedding venues , rob asked her if she had been abused as a child
' after her brave confession kim discovered that she was not alone and derek osborne had attacked a string of victims
' i was the first victim to come forward but soon other victims spoke out and said derek osborne had abused them too
' kim has started her own blog to share her experiences and inspire others when he was arrested , derek osborne denied all the offences and even claimed one of the girls had made sexual advances towards him
with the trial looming , in september 2013 kim and rob tied the knot
' in may 2014 , derek osborne , then 72 , of lowestoft , suffolk , appeared at ipswich crown court where he admitted 16 counts dating from 1982 and 2004 , including eight of indecent assault and seven of indecency with a child , related to kim and two other schoolgirls
he was jailed for 21 years
kim said : ' i went to see him sentenced
' judge john holt said derek osborne 's victims had all suffered ' devastating ' psychological effects
' rob is there with me every step of the way and i know he 's so proud
' i 've had so many victims of sexual abuse thank me for telling my story and showing you can put your abuser behind bars â even years later
