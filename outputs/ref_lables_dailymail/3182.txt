it âs the changing face of russian politics
when russian president putin appeared on tv today to insist none of the country âs troops are positioned in the ukraine , he looked decidedly fresh - faced for a man accused of war - mongering
putin appeared on russian tv today like you have never seen him before - leading to questions that he has had cosmetic surgery to get rid of the bags under his eyes , wrinkles and make his face more chiseled his appearance this week is radically different to how he was previously pictured in 2007 ( left ) and 2010 ( right )
in both photographs the skin of putin 's face is more saggy , and he has visible dark circles under his eyes and as this series of pictures show , the russian president 's face has changed dramatically over the years â amid persistent rumours he has undergone cosmetic surgery to give himself a more youthful look
pictured here announcing his intentions to run to become the president of russian , journalists wondered if that bid sparked the surgery putin 's face was puffy but relatively wrinkle - free in december 2013 when he attended a conference in moscow plastic surgeons at the time told mailonline that botox injections , a facelift , cheek - fillers , a brow lift and removal of the bags under his eyes would have helped improve his ageing features â although his spokesman denied at the time he had had any work done
in december 2013 , after around two years in office as president , he looked vastly different again , his face puffy but wrinkle - free
and in march this year , the kremlin was forced to deny rumours that he was unwell â or had undergone surgery â when the president disappeared for 10 days , cancelling a string of appointments and public appearances
