a top justice judge has said that australian women should have the choice to be paid to be a surrogate mother
speaking at the university of queensland in brisbane on friday night , justice diana bryant told a room full of journalists that surrogacy laws currently in place need a major overhaul to prevent cases of abandonment
she said she believes that because commercial surrogacy is banned in australian , hopeful parents are forced to enter into unlawful arrangements overseas
' if we allow it in australian , we then can regulate it and ensure that it 's done on ethical terms
' her statement is backed up by a recent bout of child abandonment cases , where parents have refused to carry through with overseas surrogacy deals

the indian case is similar to the controversial baby gammy scenario
child protection officials in australian are still conducting an ' extensive and rigorous ' assessment into the welfare of gammy 's twin sister pipah , pictured with david and wendy farnell ' i think the government could eliminate some of the worst aspects of international surrogacy by devising some ethical requirements that need to be met before intending parents are permitted to bring a child back into australian , ' justice bryant said
