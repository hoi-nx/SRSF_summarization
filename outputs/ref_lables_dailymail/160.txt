johnson last night urged ukip voters to ' swing behind the tory ' to avoid the ' nightmare ' of a ' backward - looking labour government ' propped up by an ' even more left - wing ' snp
the london mayor claimed ukip supporters are in ' increasing psychological conflict ' as they realise a vote for nigel farage 's party is a ' vote for ed miliband '
any gain by ukip is a gain by ed miliband , ' he told the daily mail as he campaigned in the thanet , the kent seat where mr nigel farage is standing
' the risk is that would let in a labour / snp government which would be a catastrophe for the country '
mr johnson 's intervention signals that the tories are determined to ramp up their warnings over a minority labour government dependent on the votes of snp mps
miss nicola sturgeon has ruled out any deal with the conservatives and said she would be prepared to put mr ed miliband in number ten even if labour wins fewer seats in a hung parliament
a partnership between labour and the snp would mean mr ed miliband being subjected to ' a daily dose of political blackmail ' from an snp determined to ' create merry hell ' in order to bring about the end of the union , he said
mr johnson leaves a walkabout in ramsgate , kent , with lipstick on his cheek ' these are the same politicians that during the referendum campaign urged scotland to lead the uk not leave the uk
' what these westminster parties fear - and what many people in england would welcome - is not just the size of the snp , but the majority for progressive politics that would come from it , ' he said mr ed miliband , who has repeatedly refused to rule out relying on the support of the snp to get into downing street , also reacted angrily
' even one former tory cabinet minister expressed unease , claiming the party 's campaign attacks on the snp risk undermining the future of the uk
snp leader nicola sturgeon was mocked by ex-pm sir john major over her demand to play a role in propping up a labour government mr ed miliband yesterday claimed cameron was ' setting up one part of the uk against another ' ' i am responsible for lots of things
' mr cameron said the snp would want voters across the uk to feel by the end of five years of chaotic administration that ' the country does n't work , that the government does not work , that the country should break up '
' mr johnson , campaigning in thanet , said : ' ukip voters can see the argument that we have got the plan for the economy , and i hope very much that they will think sensibly and carefully
they are thinking they could end up with something â a backward - looking labour government propped up by an even more left - wing snp â that would really set the country back
