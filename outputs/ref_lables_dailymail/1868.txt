the apple is officially going on sale today - but none of its stores will have them in stock apple launches its first smartwatch today - but anyone turning up to buy one from a store will be disappointed
for although the apple is officially going on sale , none of its locations will have them in stock
instead , consumers willing to shell out between $ 549 to $ 17,000 - for the gold edition - have to pre-order the watches online and wait for their arrival until june
usually , apple launches generate long lines outside stores
but analysts believe the company feared the lines might be embarrassingly short and so opted to launch the watch with more of a whisper than a bang
analysts believe apple is sitting on some two million pre-orders and that sales could top 20 million this year
the launch of the watch into stores is being handled by apple retail chief , angela ahrendts , who is very familiar with the world of designer labels
she told apple staff via video message earlier this week that the decision to make the watch only available through online orders is because demand has exceeded supply
' the biggest problem apple looks to be facing , is not if people will buy one , it 's whether they are going to be happy to wait until they can get one , ' he said
