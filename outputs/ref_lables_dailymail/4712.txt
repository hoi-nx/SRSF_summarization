maastricht university students who smoke cannabis can expect to get lower grades across the board but especially if they are studying maths , a new study has revealed
statistics collected at maastricht university in holland , where cannabis is decriminalised , have shown that students who were able to buy the drug from coffee shops were five percent less likely to pass their courses
at the same time , foreign students who did not have ready access to the mind bending drug did better on average , the observer reported
the study will rankle with the increasing number calling for the legislation of cannabis around the world economists olivier marie from the dutch university and ulf zã¶litz of iza made their findings based on what happened in maastricht in 2011 when the city let only german , dutch and belgian nationals have access to its 13 coffee shops , where cannabis was sold
in a paper recently unveiled at the royal economic society conference in manchester the economists showed plainly that those without easy access to the drug did better in their studies on average
students who were able to buy the drug from coffee shops were five percent less likely to pass their courses marie was quoted as saying the difference was found to be similar to those observed in the us when students reach legal drinking age
the pair also came to stark conclusions when looking at stats for maths students
for those stuying courses with numerical skills the policy effect was â five times larger â , the maastricht university ( pictured ) study stark concluded while there is increasing clamour for the legalisation of cannabis across the world , the economists say there is very little evidence of how the drug â which has been linked to psychosis â affects society
