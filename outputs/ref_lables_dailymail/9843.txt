the initiatives come as the tech giant this year met a self - imposed goal of powering all its u.s. operations with renewable energy to reduce carbon emissions â initiatives that have won high marks from environmental groups
on thursday , it 's also promising to use more renewable power overseas , where apple relies heavily on contract manufacturers â and where a top executive acknowledged the company can do more
' the new solar project in china has a capacity of 40 megawatts , which is smaller than some projects apple has announced in the u.s.
that project will produce enough energy to power all of apple 's california offices , a computer center and 52 retail stores
still , the china project will produce more than the amount of energy consumed by apple 's 19 corporate offices and 21 retail stores in china and hong kong , jackson said
she added that apple uses renewable energy for 87 percent of the power at its facilities worldwide
with the new project in china , apple is looking to improve its own operations first
' before we go somewhere else and start asking and eventually requiring clean energy , you want to make sure you show folks how to do it , ' said jackson , who was u.s. environmental protection agency administrator during president barack obama 's first term
jackson declined to say how much apple is investing in the china project , which is being built in partnership with u.s. energy company sunpower and four china firms
meanwhile , apple pledged an unspecified amount of money for a virginia - based nonprofit , the conservation fund , to purchase two large tracts of timberland on the east coast
' apple believes that paper , like energy , can be a renewable resource , ' the pair said in a blog post announceing the deal
' apple wo n't necessarily buy paper made from trees on that land , but jackson said the investment will increase the supply of sustainable wood fiber
