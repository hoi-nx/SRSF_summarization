bond would have lasted just seven minutes into his last movie skyfall before succumbing to fatal wounds from a uranium shot if the secret agent played by daniel craig was real
a group of medical experts watched the 23rd outing for ian fleming 's hero and concluded that bond would have been unlikely to survive to the end of the two hour film , and would have died or been critically injured several times
within the first seven minutes , bond is hit by a depleted uranium shell - an armour - piercing round normally used to destroy tanks that would almost certainly have killed the hero
according to the experts , bond 's depleted uranium wound would have been fatal as it ' would have turned his lungs inside out and killed him '
bond cheats death throughout the two hour film , including when he is locked in a gunfight on the streets of istanbul as he attempts to chase villain patrice for a hard drive containing details of undercover agents the hero effortlessly performs surgery on himself , but would have been likely to have lost too much blood not that growing old gracefully was ever likely for bond , who at one stage performs surgery on himself to remove a bullet , where he ' risks blood loss , lack of consciousness , nerve and muscle damage '
7 mins - bond is shot in the chest by a depleted uranium bullet , likely to kill
31 mins - after being shot bond bravely removes a bullet from his shoulder
while the temperature alone would have presented problems , fighting underwater would have significantly depleted bond 's oxygen supply and could have caused him to drown
while bond 's aston martin db5 has survived since 1960 , it is unlikely the man himself would have however , filming the movie can prove slightly dangerous as daniel craig has recently required knee surgery after hurting himself while performing a stunt in his final bond movie spectre
