this is the extraordinary moment a brave hippopotamus stood its ground against two hungry lions and managed to send them on their way after charging towards them
these incredible pictures show the hungry three - year - old big cats attempting to hunt the much larger hippo in the depths of zimbabwean 's national park
at first , as the lions approach the large mammal , the hippo tries to scare them off before wandering towards nearby water
the 37 - year - old said : ' the two male lions in the photos are just three - years - old and left their pride a few days before these shots were taken
' as the lions continue to taunt the hippo , the large mammal turns around and charges out of the water towards the two young lions the stand - off was caught on camera by researcher brent stapelkamp , who has been studying the behaviour of lions in the area for years the three - year - old lions , who may be trying to land their first catch , finally back away from the hippo as it continues to charge at them the hippo retreats to others of its kind as the lions finally leave the pack alone and instead simply look on from afar
