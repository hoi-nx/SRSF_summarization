danish 's crown princess mary might have wowed in a succession of evening gowns last week but sunday was all about low - key family time for the australian - born royal
mary , 43 , treated her three youngest children , isabella , seven , and twins josephine and prince vincent , four , to a day out at a farm in kirke hyllinge , a village in zealand
but not everyone fancied a day out at the farm , with mary left without her husband frederik , 46 , and eldest son prince christian , nine , for the outing
having a cuddle : the family met the calf during a visit to a farm in the village of kirke hyllinge going green : the moment came during eco day , an annual event in danish now my turn : mary 's youngest son , prince vincent , four , approaches the calf for a cuddle slow down ! mary holds tight to prince vincent after the active four - year - old scaled a fence for a better look kicking off with a glitzy gala dinner last wednesday night , festivities continued with a balcony appearance and parade through the danish capital the following day
