a dramatic virtual environment has been created using a headset that shows how passengers would survive a plane crash landing on water
the short film has been developed on an oculus rift - a virtual reality headset - by italy 's university of udine 's hci lab. it is hoped the simulation can make people aware of the correct processes to follow for a landing on water the video is based on an actual event when , on january 15 , 2009 , miracle on the hudson was forced into a landing on water
following a series of bird strikes , both engines failed , and the airbus a320 , piloted by captain chesley b. sullenberger was forced to land in the hudson river
the start of the virtual reality programme starts casual enough as the passenger moves to their seat a large bang is heard on the simulation before the plane starts to rapidly descend once seated the film jolts into action when a loud bang is heard , and the plane rocks from side to side
as the plane descends quickly and abruptly , the user is told that the ' goal is to come out unharmed from the aircraft by following safe procedures
the video pans to the passenger reaching into the overhead lockers for their luggage but doing this results in putting yourself in immense danger of drowning in the incoming water there are cries , screams and shouting , just what you would expect from the real thing
this is shown when , after grabbing the luggage , the passenger is overcome with water - this actually forces the man who has taken the simulation on to remove the headset and puff his cheeks
speaking to mailonline travel , chittaro , head of the project , said : ' the ' emergency water landing vr ' demo we have just released for the oculus rift was developed in the last year , and is just one of a series of aviation safety education games we are developing for all possible technological platforms , not just the oculus rift
