the last two weeks have showcased all that is best about hamilton
he has driven supremely well , gaining the congratulations of the man he hopes to emulate as a triple world champion , sir jackie stewart
but seeing the two men on the podium â one as the winner of the bahrain grand prix , the other conducting the post-race interviews â was a reminder of what differentiates them as individuals as well as what binds them together as exceptional grand prix drivers
hamilton could do considerably worse than learn a few things from and about sir jackie stewart
hamilton is interviewed by three - time world champion sir jackie stewart after the bahrain bahrain grand prix hamilton crosses the line in bahrain ahead of raikkonen to claim his third win from four races this term hamilton probably will not want to hear it , judging by how he has previously dismissed jackie stewart âs opinions , honestly given when sought as a pundit who speaks with all the authority of the most successful formula one driver in history
hamilton said grouchily , that he was disappointed ex-drivers were not being more supportive , as if blind adoration was his birthright
here are just a few reasons why hamilton should listen to sir jackie stewart
the 30 - year - old briton celebrates his second straight win in bahrain to extend his lead in the championship hamilton finished ahead of raikkonen ( centre ) and mercedes team - mate nico rosberg in the gulf kingdom i wish hamilton could show a little bit humility towards the past
he might not spray champagne into the face of a girl on the podium as he did in china last week â hardly a hanging offence but , given that she could not respond , an inconsiderate act and an ungallant one
he might not gracelessly sulk , as he did most memorably at monaco last year to jackie stewart âs stated chagrin , when he is beaten
f1 supremo bernie ecclestone is pictured speaking to nico rosberg ahead of sunday 's bahrain grand prix rajab charged with ' false ' claims the usual , tedious political narrative accompanied the bahrain grand prix
the complaint is that he has been wrongly arrested by the bahrain authorities , who are suppressing freedom of speech
but it is worth recording that he has been charged with falsely ( according to the government ) accusing coalition forces in yemen â including bahrain â of promoting ethnic cleansing by targeting women , children and religious structures
