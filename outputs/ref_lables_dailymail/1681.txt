the result puts laurent blanc 's men top of ligue 1 again , and is a serious dent to marseille 's hopes
it all looked so different at half time , when an gignac double had his side 2 - 1 up
the local - born hero first rose above marquinhos at the back post to head past sirigu on the half - hour , before slotting past the italian shortly before half time to restore the lead
both goals had an element of fortune , with gignac climbing all over his defender to convert dimitri payet 's cross , and marco veratti gifting him possession through on goal for the second , but nonetheless he took both well
david luiz is brought down , and the brazilian defender was forced off soon after with a hamstring injury which looked serious marseille took the lead twice in the first half , but on both occasions they were unable to stay ahead for too long gignac celebrates his second goal , and the marseille striker was only denied his hat - trick by an acrobatic save from sirigu ibrahimovic looks on unimpressed during a difficult first half for the french champions , but his side kept responding to going behind marquihos wheels away after scoring his goal , which made the score 2 - 2 early in the second half , and changed the momentum of the game the fiery atmosphere bubbled over late on , as ezequiel lavezzi was targeted with missiles and laser pointers while trying to take a corner the home fans produced a passionate atmosphere in the cauldron of the veledrome as they pursued the french title against their rivals
