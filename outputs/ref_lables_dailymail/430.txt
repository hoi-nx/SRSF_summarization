a virginia man has won the right to see his son , even thought the child was conceived through the woman using a turkey baster , a court has ruled , boardwine provided his friend joyce rosemary bruce with sperm and she impregnated herself using the kitchen accessory in 2010
she had opted for the bizarre method of conception because she believed that the absence of intercourse would mean mr boardwine had no parental rights
after the boy was born , the pair disagreed on the level of involvement mr boardwine would have in his son 's life , with ms joyce rosemary bruce intent on raising him alone
unusual method : a court in richmond , virginia , has ruled that even though joyce rosemary bruce impregnated herself using a turkey baster and boardwine 's sperm , he still has parental rights mr boardwine had envisioned being more involved in the child 's life , telling a lower court he had hoped to ' attend the boy 's sporting events some day ' , and have a say in major decisions such as school
the virginia court of appeals ruled tuesday that as the child 's biological father , mr boardwine is more than a sperm donor and is entitled to be a part of his son 's life
' the path to fatherhood may have been unconventional , ' the court said , but it does n't remove boardwine 's parental rights
according to court filings , ms joyce rosemary bruce impregnated herself with a turkey baster , believing that mr boardwine would not have any parental rights because they did not have intercourse
however , ms joyce rosemary bruce wanted him to be only ' as involved as her other friends ' , a lower court was told , while he sought a more active role â attendance at the boy 's sporting events someday , and a voice in major decisions
