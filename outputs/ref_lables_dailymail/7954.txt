harrowing images reveal one of west - african 's vast electronic graveyards where ' millions of tonnes ' of discarded appliances from all over the world - including the uk - are being dumped every year
thousands of broken televisions , computers , microwaves and refrigerators are being illegally exported to african countries and dumped gigantic landfills like agbogbloshie in ghana because it costs less than recycling them in their countries of origin , campaigners claim
41 million tonnes of ' e-waste ' worth over Â£ 34billion were discarded globally in 2014 , according to a shocking report by unu who claim only 6 million tonnes of that was recycled properly
that dwarfs the 1.9 million tonnes produced by the whole of african and yet the continent 's western nations have become a dumping ground for the world 's defunct products
some of the appliances even leak toxic elements such as lead and mercury which harms the environment and the young men who trawl through the broken goods hoping to find something worth selling
the shocking images taken by e-waste campaigners qamp reveal how countless household appliances have contaminated what was once the ' pastoral landscape ' of agbogbloshie in accra
' developed countries export millions of tonnes of electronic waste annually into developing countries such as ghana , ' the group based in the country claims on its website
when massive containers arrive in ghana and nigeria , they are trucked to remote locations where the locals can buy the products directly without testing them to later sell in markets , dr ruediger kuehr told mailonline he believes legal shipments can help close the digital divide between african and the west but said : ' if it turns out that this equipment arriving in african is no longer of use , there is no longer a market existing or that they are getting real waste â¦ then we are having a real issue
' aid : unu believes legal shipments of electronic appliances can help people in african who burn components ( pictured ) to extract scrap metal which they can sell broken : but the head of the organisation dr ruediger kuehr told mailonline that most of the material being shipped to african ' is nothing more than junk ' useless : 1.8 million tonnes of ' large equipment ' including washing machines ( pictured in agbogbloshie ) , clothes dryers , dishwashers and electric stoves was discarded world wide in 2014 profit : locals in ghana 's capital accra intercept trucks carrying the discarded products and buy the products without testing them - to later sell them in the city 's market ( pictured ) target : african nations like ghana are inundated with the world 's waste because the continent 's eastern and southern countries are implementing measures to prevent the dumping of e-waste ( pictured ) victim : ghana produced only 38,000 metric tonnes of e-waste in 2014 compared to the uk 's 1.5 million but its landfills have become a graveyard for the world 's useless microchips , light bulbs and motherboards ( pictured ) inexpensive : even old wiring is dumped in agbogbloshie ( pictured ) because it is cheaper to ship them to african than it is to recycle it in european union nations this sometimes - illegal and environmentally damaging practice plaguing ghana is driven by cheap dumping prices in comparison to the cost of recycling in the countries where it comes from
' the ' recycling ' of e-waste in agbogbloshie is a dangerous business which often involves burning it in unmonitored landfill sites , according to unu
the waste discarded in 2014 contained around 300 tonnes of gold , 16 million tonnes of iron and nearly two million tonnes of copper as well as significant amounts of silver , aluminium and palladium
yepoka adds : ' the electronic waste leaks lead , mercury , arsenic , zinc and flame - retardants
' dumped : e-waste graveyards in african ( pictured ) are damaging the health of the scavengers and the local environment , according to a unu report poverty : unu claims the recycling of e-waste can help developing economies by giving shipping over cheap appliances but most of the equipment reaches african broken and useless ( pictured ) scavengers : the young men who look through the wreckage in agbogbloshie , accra ( pictured ) are exposed to toxic materials which seep from some discarded products danger : young men brave toxic fumes and explosive appliances in agbogbloshie ( pictured ) , in what one local journalist calls ' the chaotic heart of one of african 's biggest economies ' hazardous : yepoka yeebo - a photographer who has visited the fields of agbogbloshie - says the electronic waste ( pictured ) ' leaks lead , mercury , arsenic , zinc and flame - retardants ' many old fridges that now reside in filthy landfill sites such as agbogbloshie contain chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons ( cfcs ) which damage the ozone layer
' health : the toxins leaking from discarded appliances in accra 's agbogbloshie landfill could be causing irreparable harm to the young men ( pictured ) who scavenge through the site decay : despite millions of tonnes of e-waste and appliances making its way to african , much of it can not be sold and is left to rot in the huge landfills desperate : local ghana 's sift through mounds of old chargers in the hope that some of the still work and can be sold at market the weight of last year 's e-waste is comparable to over 1.1 million 18 - wheel trucks - enough to form a line from new york to tokyo and back
