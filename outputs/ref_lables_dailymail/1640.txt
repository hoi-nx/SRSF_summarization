globally two - thirds of people consider themselves religious
â the study , published in pnas , took into account variables associated with the environment , history , and culture and involved experts in biology , ecology , linguistics , anthropology , and theology
it began when evolutionary ecologist dr botero plotted ethnographic data of societies that believe in moralising , high gods and found that their global distribution is quite similar to a map of cooperative breeding in birds
he took the link to mean that ecological factors must play a part in the spread of religion , and another study has recently found a connection between a belief in moralising gods and group cooperation
professor gray said : â although some aspects of religion appear maladaptive , the near universal prevalence of religion suggests that there 's got to be some adaptive value and by looking at how these things vary ecologically , we get some insight
