jay brittain , 63 , was worried that the baby owls at small breeds farm park and owl centre , herefordshire , look so similar at birth that he could end up overfeeding them , which can be fatal for the birds
so he instructed workers at the farm to varnish the claws of each fluffy owlet using nail polish in their very own ' talon salon '
staff use ordinary nail varnish for the job staff at the farm park have to feed baby mice to the little owlets within 12 hours of hatching and initially three or four times every day
but after three days their feeds reduce to three times a day and , by two months , they need to eat twice a day mr jay brittain said : ' it is just normal ladies ' nail varnish
