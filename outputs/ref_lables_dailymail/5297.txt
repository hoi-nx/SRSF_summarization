ipsa chief sir ian kennedy launched a bid to keep mps ' receipts private all mps ' expenses receipts will have to be published after a court threw out a bid to keep them private
the commons expenses watchdog , the ipsa , had launched a bid to keep mps ' original claims secret
but the court of appeal ruled today that it must release all the copies of receipts and invoices which have been submitted by politicians
the legal action centred on whether copies of original documents should be published - rather than a summary of the claim put in by mps
the case stems from a freedom of information request to ipsa in 2010 - just a year after the mps ' expenses scandal erupted - asking for three specific receipts submitted by politicians in support of their claims
but instead of providing the original receipts , ipsa sent back a typed - up summary of the claims
voters reacted with fury at the list of extraordinary claims submitted by mps - with jaw - dropping details of fraud , fake receipts and payouts for ornamental duck houses and moat cleaning
' we were right to test the point of law through an appeal to see whether images of receipts add anything additional to all the information about mps ' expenditure that we already release
he said ipsa publishes details of claims on its website but does not publish copies of the supporting invoices or receipts
parliament 's expenses watchdog has fought plans to keep mps ' original receipts secret - arguing that it should only have to publish a summary of their claims the mps expenses revealed a series of extravagant claims - including for the repair of a ' stockholm ' duck house by tory mp sir peter viggers the judge said ipsa responded ' with a transcript of information contained in the documents , including information additional to that published on its website , but refused to provide copies of the documents themselves '
