bumping into peter in mothercare in palma just over a year ago was not such a big surprise , since we both have houses in majorcan where i now live most of the year
however , it was a scene that would have amused anyone who had known us both , or had read about us in gossip columns , in our heyday in the eighties
there we were , two gentlemen in our 70s ; me , a former newspaper editor and peter a well - known businessman , with more than our fair share of silver hair
we were both pushing a buggy with a tiny baby inside : me , my son ben , now four , who was born when i was 73 ; peter , his daughter rosabella , who arrived when he was 72
our beautiful and much younger wives ( a 40 - year gap in his case , 25 in mine ) were there too and it was smiles and congratulations all round
donald trelford ( left ) had his son ben ( back right ) when he was 73 and his daughter poppy ( held by donald trelford ) when he was 76 - years - old since then claire , 52 , and i have had a second child , poppy , while it has just been announced that 74 - year - old peter and bella are expecting a sibling for their 20 - month - old daughter
i was 76 when poppy came along last may , making me , i believe , the oldest living british new father
so what advice could i give to other would - be septuagenarian fathers ? well , i know from experience that two children are more than twice the work of one
you have two minds and sensitivities to cope with , so to prevent jealousy equal attention is essential
for example , as she is only ten months old , poppy âs cot is in our bedroom
much effort is required to stop ben thinking he is being excluded when he sleeps on his own
then there âs the feeding , the nappy changing , the crying in the night and the wearying lack of sleep
the sheer physical effort of coping with children at this age can be demanding
so much so that i have to take a brisk daily walk and use an exercise bike and some modest weights to revive my shrinking muscles
after all , toddlers can be heavy and buggies even heavier
then there is the manhandling of a mountain of luggage whenever we travel : suitcases , car seats , pushchairs , carry - cots and toys
travelling with children is not easy , anyway , as i once discovered when i was bringing ben back to majorcan on my own after a family trip to the british
donald trelford ( pictured with ben ) says the physical effort of coping with young children at his age can be demanding but he takes daily walks and uses an exercise bike to keep fit ben and i managed to edge our way to the loo without making eye contact with other passengers and thankfully things were soon put right
besides the occasional blip , raising a child , no matter your age , is a huge pleasure
feeding a baby its bottle is one of the great joys of life for a father and one of the few things one ever does that is unquestionably useful
then there is the novelty of exchanging pleasantries in halting spanish at my son âs school gates with yummy mummies who must be at least 50 years younger than me
â in fact , the gap between my oldest and youngest daughters is even bigger : 49 years
whereas before i could write if i felt like it , or go for a walk , or read a book , or watch some sport on tv , there is now a prior , and sometimes rather insistent , call on my time
when poppy arrived fit and healthy via a caesarean , the doctors had to give claire emergency pain relief for several hours , during which time i was left holding the baby
along with the inevitable anxieties there are many small pleasures of late - life parenthood : the warming smile of recognition in the morning , that look of unconditional love , the noisy ecstasies of splash - time in the bath , the heart - bursting pride as baby takes its first steps
for them , too , there is the inevitable trauma of losing a parent while they are young
a curious family oddity is that my father was born in 1911 and ben in 2011 ; my mother was born in 1914 and poppy in 2014
we called her poppy before realising how appropriate a name it was for someone born on the centenary of world war i. i have to admit that it can be a strange and unsettling experience being so old a new father , especially when both children look like me ( friends call ben â a little donald trelford â )
