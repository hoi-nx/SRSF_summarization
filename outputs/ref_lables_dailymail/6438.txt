the bbc filled more than half its election tv debate audience with left - leaning voters , some of whom were brought in from scotland and wales , it emerged last night
the audience at the filming of thursday night âs debate in westminster repeatedly cheered calls for more public spending and strong defences of immigration
when ukip leader nigel farage interjected and said they were prejudiced , â even by the left - wing standards of the bbc â , the audience only booed him further
but the latest icm poll for the guardian put the tories on 39 per cent and ukip on 7 per cent â a total of 46 per cent overall
â out in the cold : ukip leader nigel farage cuts a isolated figure at the end of the bbc tv debate on thursday the bbc told icm to make sure a fifth were so - called floating voters , and for every five labour supporters in the room , it made sure there were five for the conservatives , four for the liberal democrat , two for the snp , two for the green party and one for plaid cymru
it also selected a â small number â of snp and plaid cymru from scotland and wales using an undisclosed method â reasonably decided upon by icm â
â our data shows the number of audience contacts were heavily influenced by the issue being raised during the debate and therefore we wo nât be giving out figures , â a bbc spokesman said
conservative mp andrew percy said : â the audience should reflect the opinion polls and the fact is that nearly half of the country say they would vote conservative of ukip , â â you have to ask yourself what would have happened if the audience had been right of centre
