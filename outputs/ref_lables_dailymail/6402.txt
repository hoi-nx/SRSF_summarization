then clasp your hands together so your fingers entwine â do nât overthink it ! now look at your thumbs
now unfold your hands and take a look at your fingers , in particular your index finger ( next to your thumb ) and your ring finger ( next to your little finger )
in women the two fingers are typically the same length
of course , we all have different skills and interests , but some are considered more typically male , and occur more commonly in men , while others are described as more typically female , and occur more commonly in women
women , on the other hand , are said to be better at empathy and understanding what another person is feeling or needs
this is the stuff of jokes and self - help books â but it is also shown to be true through science
the question is , do these tendencies result from nature â with the biological gender we are born with deciding our interests and personalities â or do they result from nurture , with society and upbringing creating the differing ways that men and women behave ? in the sbs one series horizon professor alice roberts and dr mosley examine the links between gender and the brain the sbs one series horizon asked professor alice roberts and me to investigate
alice thinks apparent brain differences between the sexes have been exaggerated by how our culture treats boys and girls
almost immediately , the girls start rough - housing and playing with trucks , while the boys are treated far more gently by the adults around them
she argues that parents â unconscious actions â such as being gentler with girls and letting boys behave more roughly â often mould children into men and women who embody gender stereotypes
while i agree that lots of wild generalisations about men and women are bandied around , i also think there may be something in claims that our fundamental biology influences how we behave
professor simon baron-cohen , an expert on the brain who i visited at cambridge university , has done a lot of pioneering work on this
while professor simon baron-cohen accepts social pressures are important in influencing choices and behaviour , his studies suggest the hormones babies are exposed to in the womb can also shape the brain
higher levels of testosterone in utero , for example â as measured in long - term studies that took samples from pregnant women then followed their children from birth â are associated with offspring who are less empathetic but better at some mental skills later in life
in other words , more testosterone during pregnancy produces babies with a more male brain ( we âre not yet sure why some mothers produce more testosterone )
dr mosley will examine if habits , characteristics and preferences are a result of ' nature or nurture ' empathisers , on the other hand , are more typically â female â brained as they are more typically women an indirect way of assessing how much testosterone you were exposed to is by looking at your fingers
a number of studies have shown that the greater the difference between the length of the ring finger and the index finger , the more â male â your brain is likely to be
mine is slightly more â male â than average but much less so than , say , a professional footballer , who is typically male brained with great spatial awareness skills
professor simon baron-cohen does these studies because he is interested in autism , which he describes as an extreme version of the male brain â more interested in systems and often struggling with empathy
when he started his research there was a lot of criticism , based partly on the fear studies like his will be used to support unhelpful stereotypes â suggesting men ca nât excel in female areas and vice versa
a number of studies have shown that the greater the difference between the length of the ring finger and the index finger , the more â male â your brain is likely to be although men were more inclined to give themselves the benefit of the doubt , the majority , 54 per cent , still agreed â women â were more stoical
but is this right ? one way to find out is to get male and female volunteers to take part in a cold water immersion test
indeed , jeff imagines a future where pharmaceutical companies produce pain - killing drugs that are specific to one gender
so perhaps we âll have pink painkillers for women , and blue ones for boys , each honed to work on the specific male or female brain
is your brain male or female ? documentary premieres on sbs one on monday at 7.30pm a couple of years ago , i was in a large military hospital in afghanistan , filming a series called frontline medicine for the bbc
i saw a number of soldiers , male and female , with serious head injuries
progesterone is best known as a female hormone , involved in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy , but it is also important for the development of neurones â the cells that carry messages in the brain
animal studies and a few small human trials have shown that giving progesterone soon after suffering a brain injury improves survival and recovery
