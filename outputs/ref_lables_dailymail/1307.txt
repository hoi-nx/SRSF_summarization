online blogging sensation zoella has come under fire from jamie oliver 's company over adverts for unhealthy foods that appear next to her vlogs on youtube
internet star zoella , real name zoe elizabeth sugg , has enjoyed meteoric success after her blog and video posts amassed a huge teen following on social media
jamie oliver 's company , an enduring advocate for promoting healthy eating , has warned that young stars such as zoella , 25 , and fellow vlogger and boyfriend alfie deyes , 21 , should be more aware of the adverts that appear alongside their posts
wise words : jamie oliver 's company has said that influential vloggers such as zoella ( right ) should try and ensure adverts for unhealthy foods do n't appear next to their posts it comes after an investigation found that video blogs - known as vlogs â popular with children aged 11 to 17 are being hijacked by 30 - second adverts for junk food and online gambling sites
jamie oliver 's own company says it has a deal with youtube that ensures that the chef 's channel on the video sharing website actively stops sugary food and drinks from being promoted next to his videos
her boyfriend has achieved similar success with more than three million subscribers signing up to his youtube channel
although the advertising standard authority ( asa ) currently prevents food that is high in fat , salt or sugar from being advertised on television shows that appeal to children under 16 , there are no guidelines about video bloggers , despite their growing influence
matt wilson , spokesman for the asa told femail that while ' television - like content ' posted on youtube was not yet subject to the same guidelines , the asa was ' keeping an eye on the situation '
' star couple : the young web - savvy entrepreneurs can count a beauty line and several books between them but should they be more conscious of what they 're promoting to their young audience zoella 's boyfriend , alfie deyes , a hugely successful blogger in his own right featured jamie oliver on a vlogging post last year
the luxury property is in the seaside town of brighton the vloggers are unlikely to have control over which adverts appear next to their posts although jamie oliver 's company is suggesting that such influential stars should be proactive in requesting that certain brands , such as haribo and coca-cola , do not appear
when jamie oliver appeared alongside alfie deyes , who is dating zoella , ads for mcdonald 's and coca-cola appeared
a representative from the chef 's company told the ipaper that while they could n't control what appeared on others ' channels , they did have a ' firm agreement ' with youtube about what could appear on jamie oliver 's own food tube channel
â the couple are n't the only ones to feel the wrath of the jamie oliver in recent weeks
