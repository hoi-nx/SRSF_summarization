a study found that uk selling their properties refuse to admit the housing market has cooled and mistakenly believe they are sitting on a goldmine
buyers must now increasingly treat asking prices as a starting point for negotiations as sellers demand silly prices , it is claimed
sellers are now wildly over-valuing their houses by around Â£ 74,000 â forcing buyers to barter them down , analysis shows while average sale prices are about Â£ 207,000 in the uk , advertised asking prices are typically Â£ 74,000 higher at Â£ 281,000
researchers analysed sold price data from the office for national statistics , land registry , halifax and nationwide and compared it to asking prices on the uk âs largest property website rightmove
online estate agent emoov said many sellers still believed they were selling at the market âs peak and were routinely over-pricing their property , encouraging buyers to put in cheeky offers
a report said : â previous high demand in many areas caused house prices in england and wales to soar , with many sellers now looking to cash in as a result of a particularly buoyant market
â but as the market begins to cool , those looking to sell are doing so at increasingly unrealistic prices
the study said a recent fall in activity in the housing market had also prompted some estate agents to over-value properties in a bid to secure custom from depleted numbers of sellers
a study found that uk selling their properties refuse to admit the housing market has cooled and mistakenly believe they are sitting on a goldmine â understandably the seller opts for the agent that claims they can get the highest price , as we are all motivated , to some extent , by money
â a survey of 2,000 sellers in england and wales , carried out by emoov , found that that more than half of sellers would list their property at a price recommended by their agent
â he added : â the difficulty is trying to get vendors to put their home on the market for a realistic price to get buyers through the door
