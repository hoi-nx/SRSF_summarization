scroll down for trailer ... together again : carrie , who is reprising her role as princess leia , and mark , who is luke , were arm in arm on the stage in anaheim on thursday before the second trailer for star wars : episode vii - the force awakens was rolled out in recovery mode : not on hand was ford , who is the franchise 's han solo
director jj abrams explained the 72 - year - old was ' resting ' after miraculously surviving a march plane crash in la ; here the actor is seen in july after an accident on the star wars set it was announced early on that ford would not be a part of the panel ( though later he was the high point of the trailer )
' he 's not here today but he 's in everyone 's thought , ford , he 's a total bad a * * *
' the amazing thing about ford â and i do n't think anybody out there will be surprised â is he is the only person who could make an emergency landing on a golf course in front of two doctors , ' producer kathleen kennedy said
the a team : kathleen kennedy , pictured center , said , ' the amazing thing about ford â and i do n't think anybody out there will be surprised â is he is the only person who could make an emergency landing on a golf course in front of two doctors ' ; to her left is director jj abrams they have a bond : both mark and carrie thanked the fans for their support over the decades the vet meets the new faces : carrie smiled as she posed with boyega and daisy kathleen kennedy said he was home resting , and getting well as fast as he can
the way they were : ( from left ) mark , carrie and ford in the original star wars movie in 1977 ' he 's more of a hero in that move than in all the films he 's been in , ' he added
' jj abrams also called the veteran actor , who is married to calista flockhart , a ' real hero
' ford was also injured on the set of the star wars film and production was brought to a halt
carrie came out on stage in a black blazer and red skirt
' chewbacca , we 're home ' : ford was featured at the end of the trailer for episode vii she 's taking care of him : ford 's wife calista flockhart has been seeing to her husband 's needs ; here they are pictured in 2008 when asked about her iconic hairstyle , carrie said , ' the buns are tired now so i do n't think we 'll have the futuristic buns but we will have an alternate that will not include the metal bikini
' she also thanked the fans and made a twisted joke about how she is glad people have played with toys of her - referring to her princess leia dolls - which drew laughs
mark added , ' george originally called the film the most expensive small film he ever made
' on the run : daisy and boyega can be seen running from an explosion in the trailer r2d2 then appeared on stage and an image from the movie was shared with the robot in it
next came bb-8 , a rolling droid that appeared in the first episode vii trailer
he was joined by chewbacca at the end of the trailer and is heard saying , ' chewbacca , we 're home
a hint of the old era : a skull of anakin skywalker - aka anakin skywalker - is shown in the beginning of the clip we hear mark 's voice reprising a line from the 1983 film : the force is strong in my family
he then appears to hand a lightsaber to another unseen character - a strong suggestion luke has had a child
ford appears with chewbacca only at the very end
the menace is always there : stormtroopers are also seen in the trailer , and they are located in a snowy location where is this ? : in the opening scene , a desert planet is shown that is not tatooine , but rather a new place jj abrams said was jaku - it is not known how that is spelled or what lives there star wars celebration is a multi-day festival produced by lucasfilm that 's dedicated to star wars past and present
' i was 11 years old when star wars come out , ' he said
' the droids showed up too : also on stage were the new robot bb-8 ( left ) and the old robot r2d2 ( right ) , which looked a bit banged up behind the scenes : not only was the trailer shared , but so were shots from the making of the movie british actress ridley is the next new star to appear as she drives a hover vehicle towards a desert town , while oscar isaac is seen as a fighter pilot , looking rather like a young luke when he 's headed for the death star
the man with a plan : jj abrams spoke about the exciting project on stage the veterans : mark , carrie and anthony daniels waved to the crowd of loyal followers dark side : several storm troopers attended the event as they walked in a uniform line while standing in the background at the event the gang 's all here : several star wars diehards posed for snaps together while dressed in their costumes
