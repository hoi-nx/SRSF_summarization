hillary clinton 's ' everyday americans ' video has been given an 18 rating by a russian television network - because it features two men holding hands
dozhd tv , an independent network , fears the video launching clinton 's white house bid may fall foul of putin 's ' gay propaganda ' laws - which allows the imposition heavy fines for promoting homosexuality to people under the age of 18
clinton 's video not only features democrat campaigners jared milrad and nate johnson , from chicago , illinois , holding hands , but talking about their up - coming wedding
restricted : a russian television network has given hillary clinton 's video an 18 rating because it features a gay couple , who are planning a summer wedding , holding hands equality : jared milrad ( pictured right ) and his fiancÃ© nate johnson , were delighted to be included in the video , saying it showed off the changing attitudes of the u.s. jared milrad 's voice is heard in a voiceover saying : ' i âm getting married this summer to someone i really care about
however , dozhd , an opposition network , told abc news it had acted before being instructed by the russian government
if they had aired it without the warning , the company could have faced a fine of as much as Â£ 13,200 under 2013 's gay propaganda laws
backwards : but while the u.s. may be becoming more inclusive , russian has recently been putting in place more repressive laws as the government becomes increasingly anti lgbt rights fine : opposition television network dozhd decided to give it the rating to avoid getting a Â£ 13,200 fine differing views : putin ( left ) and clinton ( right ) are on other sides of the divide when it comes to lgbt rights - with the former first lady being a staunch supporter of equality but it is not just the u.s. and russian as countries which are at odds with each other : putin and clinton hold very differing views personally as well
meanwhile , the same year putin signed the gay propaganda law into being , secretary of state clinton had publicly come out in support of gay marriage
