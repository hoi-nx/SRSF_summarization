benaud made commentary look easy
i had the great honour of doing a stint on channel 9 in australia during an ashes test a few years ago
they âd only recently introduced the concept of using three commentators in one go and , as usual , benaud was keeping his contributions to a minimum
anyway , benaud had noticed something out in the middle and flicked what we call the lazy switch , so he could have a quiet word with the producer without the viewers hearing him
he wanted some footage of an incident he âd spotted a couple of overs earlier â shane warne had done something in the slips and it had passed the rest of us by
benaud was one of cricket 's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge benaud was the voice of cricket for generations , commentating in his native australia and for the bbc benaud , pictured on his wedding day to wife daphne , and during his later years in august 2005 benaud was a daring captain and became the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in tests finally , the producer located what he wanted
benaud said : â shane warne âs just put a marker down
i thought of benaud during the world cup final last month
how we missed benaud that evening
david gower , geoffrey boycott and benaud assembled a formidable line - up for the bbc in 1995 a master with the microphone to his lips , benaud also was well aware of the power of silence australia cricket legend benaud shakes hands with hm queen elizabeth ii during his playing days i remember talking to michael slater , who teamed up with him in the commentary box in his later years
he spoke about one day when benaud did two half - hour stints as one of three commentators , and did not say a single word
it might be the top 10 leading runscorers at a particular ground , or something similar , and they just read out the list ! it âs incredibly lazy
benaud would consider the list , and then say something like : â and no 4 could soon be moving to no 2
the chemistry he had with the likes of tony greig and bill lawry was amazing

one evening , benaud , ron and i were treated to dinner in birmingham by the news of the world , who we were all working for at the time
benaud was nât a big drinker , but he âd allowed himself a couple of glasses of red , and he started telling this story about the great australian leg - spinner bill oâreilly
it âs fair to say the story was on the longish side and by the time ron had disappeared into the night and benaud was being bundled into a waiting taxi , we were still learning all about bill oâreilly â¦ he had this wit that made all other commentators want to be like him
tributes are seen at the statue of benaud at the sydney cricket ground after his passing aged 84 â ah , there âs lloyd , â benaud said
he was a great leg - spinner , a superb captain , and a lovely bloke
â benaud , it âs safe to say , never suffered from the same affliction
on commentating ' what i want most from being a television commentator is to be able to feel that , when i say something , i am talking to friends
' ' my mantra is : put your brain into gear and if you can add to what 's on the screen then do it , otherwise shut up
' on captaincy ' the hallmark of a great captain is the ability to win the toss , at the right time
' ' he 's not quite got hold of that one
if i offered you 10,000 dollars to hit a tin can , you 'd never take your eyes off it
' on twenty20 cricket ' if any form of game can pull 20,000 spectators into a game of cricket it 's great for the sport
i think it 's wonderful
' on shane warne 's ' ball of the century ' gatting has absolutely no idea what has happened to it
' on 1981 's ' underarm bowling ' scandal ' a disgraceful performance from a captain who got his sums wrong
' ' he 's usually a good puller - but he could n't get it up that time
