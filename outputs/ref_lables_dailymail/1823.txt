three more of hillary clinton 's ' everyday americans ' have been revealed to have strong links to the democrat party - including one who could be set to support a rival bid for the white house
julie stauch and married couple sean bagniewski and reddy all appear in on the video announcing clinton 's 2016 bid
they are part of a diverse group of people - from young mothers and people preparing for retirement , to spanish - speaking brothers preparing to start a business and an asian - american college graduate looking for her first job - chosen to show aspirational citizens as clinton looks to speak to to wide demographic of voters
' americans need a champion , and i want to be that champion , ' clinton says on the video
' but far from being ' everyday americans ' , as the two minute video claims , julie stauch and sean bagniewski are directly involved with the democrat party - just like campaigners milrad and johnson , from chicago , illinois , who discuss their upcoming wedding plans on screen
sean bagniewski , who lost in 2013 , is also said to be in talks with o'malley âs people and may support him lawyers sean bagniewski and reddy are shown in their home in des moines city council , iowa , discussing their plans for 2015
however , their plans for this year may not involve actually supporting clinton 's white house bid
indeed , sean bagniewski revealed to the register that he had been hosting an event for o'malley last thursday
but it seems clinton 's campaign team can breathe a sigh of relief : sean bagniewski went on to tell the register : ' o'malley 's great - but for me , hillary clinton is just head and shoulders above all the competition
' julie stauch is another person who appears on the video with strong links to the democrat party julie stauch , an iowa resident , is the former state senate campaign manager for democrat wendy davis meanwhile julie stauch , who is filmed in her west des moines garden , is a former state senate campaign manager for democrat wendy davis , who unsuccessfully ran to be governor of texas in 2014
milrad ( pictured right ) and fiancÃ© johnson have also been revealed as campaigning democrats the couple , who are planning a summer wedding , were featured walking hand in hand during clinton 's video the video , which has had 3,477,630 on youtube since its launch on sunday , has quickly become one of the most viewed political broadcasts of the year - a fact which will no doubt help clinton as she begins meeting people in iowa today
featuring snappy music , and showing clinton for less than half the running time , it is a dramatic departure from the campaign launch of seven years ago , which showed the secretary of state on a couch , talking about ending the iraq war , shrinking deficits and expanding affordable health care
' milrad , who did not know they would be on the video , said he was overjoyed to be part of the clinton rollout - and part of a large - scale change in u.s. social attitudes
the couple told the blade that they would be making financial contributions to clinton 's campaign and would volunteer
