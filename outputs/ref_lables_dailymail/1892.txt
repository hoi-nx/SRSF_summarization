ever wondered if your personality was decided at birth ? it turns out , the order in which you were born can not only have an effect on your personality , but also your chances of academic success
according to canadian duo mitchell moffit and greg brown , from toronto , who present an online science show , several theories suggest that where you are in your family determines who you are
the kardashians are a strong example of a large celebrity family where the siblings share very different personality traits on asapscience on youtube , the pair discuss how being the first , middle , youngest , or an only child affects us
the personality traits are also supposedly affected by whether parents have high expectations and how strict they were
first - borns according to mitchell moffit and greg brown , first - born children are expected to be higher academic achievers and more ambitious

oldest children tend be ambitious and have strong leadership skills they also tend to have better leadership skills than other birth orders
the explanation is because although they get a lot more affection and attention from their parents , their parents have higher expectations as the first child
as their parents have already had other children , they tend to be a lot less strict and are a lot more lenient with their youngest children
parents ' expectations will also be lower
being a parent 's only child , expectations are always high , but unlike a first - born , they never need to fight for the attention of their parents
mitchell moffit and greg brown reiterate : ' some aspects may be true for you , or make a lot of sense , but it would nât be the same for every single person around the world in your specific birth order
