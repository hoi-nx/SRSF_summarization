elijah mccrae 's heartbroken parents , jessica and andrew , remembered the ' happiest baby ever ' , after he died in his mother 's arms on monday evening
' it is with a heavy heart , that our baby little elijah has passed away
they tried to revive him but we knew he was telling us it 's his time
' it is with a heavy heart , that our baby little elijah has passed away
he passed peacefully in my arms ' in a series of heartbreaking posts , ms mccrae documented the gut - wrenching final stages of their beloved son 's fight for life
' i became so overwhelmed at knowing that one day i will be in the house without him in this world
' on the morning of april 19 , the parents were overwhelmed by love and hope , and shared a picture of little elijah in his hospital bed
' tomorrow we discuss little elijah 's end of life care in a multidisciplinary meeting
' that hope was replaced by fear later in the day , when little elijah took a turn for the worse
' about an hour and a half ago i saw little elijah stop breathing , ' she posted about 8pm on april 19
little elijah suffered with the fatal genetic disease spinal muscular atrophy ( sma )
amid the unimaginable dread , his parents were given a moment of immense happiness , when their baby little elijah began ' smiling like nothing happened ' after the scare
hours later , little elijah died in his mother 's loving arms
the first item ticked off ellijah 's list was a trip to the easter show so he could meet all of the animals andrew , jessica and little elijah had a day out at the easter show earlier this month little elijah is pictured with some of his furry friends
his parents had hoped to take him to sydney and featherdale wildlife park as well his parents created the to - do list after he was diagnosed with a genetic illness that meant he would likely not live to see his second birthday
little elijah suffered from type 1 spinal muscular atrophy ( sma ) , which saw him get weaker as he got older
the family , from penrith in sydney 's west , were able to visit the easter show - ticking off one of the items on the bucket list
the list included plans to take a road trip to queensland to watching the sunrise , and visits to sydney 's aquarium and opera house , ms mccrae told daily mail australia
they created the list out of their love for their son , and heartbreak at seeing other happy families having fun with their grown children
' i thought , " let 's make a bucket list
' i 've got my own - like travelling the world - but ( little elijah ) wo n't ever be able to do things like that
' the family had made a fundraising page in the hope they could use the money to complete the list together
but the item they want the most is to celebrate little elijah 's first birthday with a big party , and had hoped he would make it to that milestone
we do n't get to see him enjoy these things when he 's like 10 , we have to do it now ' ' the hardest thing is seeing other families , especially when you go out and see these families having fun , ' jessica said little elijah was born very strong but has lost a lot of muscle because of his condition
