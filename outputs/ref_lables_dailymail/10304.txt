haris vuckic stands as the one bonus from a now infamous deal
while the other members of the newcastle have managed a paltry 44 minutes of football between them , the slovenian has positively thrived at rangers
so much so , in fact , that he admits any possibility of staying at ibrox beyond the end of this season would be an immensely attractive option
haris vuckic has denied a report on tyneside stating he had already declared his intention to quit st james park , where he has one year left on his contract
haris vuckic has thrived at rangers under new manager mccall by then , he will also know whether rangers have fulfilled their aim of promotion via the play - offs
certainly , he has done much so far to try to make premier league football a reality at ibrox once again
haris vuckic has scored six times since signing for rangers , including three in his last two appearances as the revival under mccall has gathered momentum
having begun to stagnate on the fringes of the newcastle squad , he feels revived by life in glasgow
â i âm really enjoying playing my football and i âm training hard , â said haris vuckic
â at newcastle , i did nât have that chance
â but it âs nonsense that i have said i am going to quit newcastle
i still respect newcastle because i have a year left there
and i also respect rangers because i have a loan deal here
â we will see what is going to happen in the transfer window and what newcastle have to say
â and if rangers were to make an offer for his services come the end of the season ? haris vuckic has won over rangers fans with six goals from 10 games , including this strike against hearts â that would be a good option because i âm really enjoying my football here , â replied haris vuckic
i feel from newcastle to rangers on loan i took that step back but now i want to go forward
â if i go back to play under - 21 games with newcastle i would go even more back
â when i was 18 or 19 years old i was getting a chance in the first team at newcastle but i broke my hand on my debut against fulham
â the 22 - year - old celebrates scoring a goal for newcastle , but could find himself leaving st james ' park haris vuckic was deemed sufficiently surplus to requirements to be shipped out in a mass deal arranged when the previous board were still in place
gael bigirimana will not play this season because of an unspecified â medical condition â he admits was there before he joined rangers
it was recently revealed that rangers will have to pay newcastle Â£ 500,000 for the privilege of the loans if they gain promotion
