man utd 's humiliation of their noisy neighbours city at old trafford led the club 's official website to claim the city was turned red once more in the space of 90 minutes
yet was this the case ? was that 4 - 2 win a sign that man utd are the dominant force in manchester again , or should we just chalk it off as nothing more than a bad game for the defending champions ? city had , after all , beaten man utd four consecutive times going into the derby , so should the red half of manchester be so confident sitting four points ahead ? here is sportsmail 's verdict on the issues
is manchester red again ? of course not , it is neither red or blue
man utd âs website declared this to be the case and they will rightly revel in sunday âs victory for a while
man utd 's players celebrate together during the derby win for the red half of the city mata salutes the old trafford crowd while young and rooney celebrate his goal with man utd setting their own sights no higher than a return to the top four , the club from the other side of town were the least of their worries
yet here we are in april with city already being lapped by league leaders chelsea and man utd now easing away from them in third
apr 18 - chelsea ( a ) apr 26 - everton ( a ) may 2 - west brom ( h ) may 9 - crystal palace ( a ) may 17 - arsenal ( h ) may 24 - city ( a ) apr 19 - west ham ( h ) apr 25 - aston villa ( h ) may 3 - tottenham hotspur ( a ) may 10 - qpr ( h ) may 17 - swansea city ( a ) may 24 - southampton ( h ) man utd won the battle against city but the war is still ongoing with six premier league games remaining man utd manager louis van gaal thanked supporters for their patience after sunday 's victory why do man utd suddenly look like a good team again ? their manager louis van gaal has not been too proud to learn from his mistakes
at times , van gaal âs hand has been forced by injuries but his faith in players such as young and antonio valencia â players whose old trafford career looked over during pre-season â has its roots in what he has seen on the training field
mata runs away in celebration after scoring one of man utd 's four goals against their great rivals city rooney , young and mata celebrate as they all rightfully earn their first - team places for man utd angel di maria ( third right ) and falcao ( right ) were left out of the starting xi by van gaal on sunday what has been the secret behind the renaissance of players like young and fellaini ? van gaal is a coach âs coach who believes in the value of the training ground
a man who swears by systems and training ground drills , the man utd manager has followed a mantra of â repeat , repeat , repeat â ever since he arrived in manchester and , at last , it has paid off
fellaini celebrates scoring in this brilliant photograph taken by sportsmail snapper ian hodgson young celebrates after bringing man utd level having earlier trailed against city from the eighth minute players once moaned about , such as fellaini and young , are now pivotal parts of man utd 's team van gaal âs belief in the value of repetition has worked and players like young and fellaini have benefited did n't louis van gaal consider selling fellaini last summer ? yes , he did
he began the season convinced that 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 was the way forward for this man utd team and certainly there would have been no room for fellaini in that system
over the course of the season the south american has refused to recognise the problems of using yaya toure as part of a central midfield pair and indeed the fact that his favoured 4 - 4 - 2 system can lead to his side being overrun in the middle of the field against really good teams
fellaini helped as man utd tore city apart at old trafford to move four points clear of their noisy neighbours fellaini has illustrated the value of flexibility and objectivity when it comes to managing players and teams it was only an injury that prevented fellaini from joining napoli in loan last august from man utd should pellegrini be worried about his position at city ? 5-games lost by city in 2015 , one more than the whole of 2014
13 - city 's position in the premier league form table after losing four and winning two of their last six
4 - the first time since losing 4 - 3 to man utd in 2009 that city have conceded four in the league
9 - city have nine points fewer than they did at this stage last season
70.8 - city 's pass completion rate percentage at old trafford was their worst of the season
however , footballers â body language can undo a manager almost as quickly as results and , from that point of view , the signs were bad for pellegrini at old trafford
for all man utd âs improvement , they are not a side that should be putting four past the champions but this was a city team seemingly unwilling to run , chase and do the ugly stuff on sunday and the club âs hierarchy have noticed
pellegrini could be worried about his position at city after losing against their fierce rivals segio aguero , yaya toure and james milner look dejected as they await kick - off after a man utd goal frank lampard applauds the travelling fans off at old trafford as he and goalkeeper joe hart leave the pitch what does the summer hold for both clubs ? man utd will spend heavily on key positions such as central defence and centre forward and also buy a right back
falcao came on as a second - half substitute for fellaini at old trafford against city van gaal shakes hands with his opposite number pellegrini after the final whistle at old trafford
