kenyan has bombed two al-shabaab camps in somalia in the first major military response to last week 's attack by the militant group on a kenyan university that left 148 people dead
air force jets blitzed compounds in gondodowe and ismail , both in the gedo region bordering kenyan on sunday , a kenya defence forces source said today
cloud cover made it difficult to establish how much damage the bombings caused or estimate the death toll
' we targeted the two areas because according to information we have , those ( al-shabaab ) fellows are coming from there to attack kenyan , ' the source said
kenyan army spokesman , colonel david obonyo , later said : ' the two targets were hit and taken out , the two camps are destroyed
kenyan has struggled to stop the flow of al-shabaab militants and weapons across its porous 700km border with somalia
al-shabaab militants have killed more than 400 people in kenyan since april 2013
an african union peacekeeping force that includes kenyan troops carried out arrests and seized ammunition in an al-shabaab camp in gondodowe last august
news of the bombings came after it was claimed kenyan special forces took at least seven hours to respond to the brutal massacre at garissa university college
elite troops were called in from nairobi to garissa , some 225miles from the capital , to aid in the pre-dawn attack on the university , but soldiers did not arrive until the afternoon , local media claims
the critique comes as one of the four gunmen responsible for the brutal mass - murders has been identified as a lawyer son of a kenyan government official
paraded : the naked bodies of the alleged attackers were driven around garissa before the pickup truck parked at a primary school in the primary school playground , hundreds gathered to look at the bodies of the men accused of being the attackers kenyan 's elite recce company in nairobi were called in as soon as the first reports of thursday 's attack emerged , which took place around 5.30am at garissa university college
however , as troops were flown in from the capital , help did not arrive at the scene until just before 2pm , kenyan newspaper nation reports
' some journalists based in nairobi who drove to garissa after hearing the first reports of the attack arrived before the special forces , who came by air
foreign minister amina mohamed defended the slow response time to the massacre , where 148 people were killed , using a football analogy
kenyan troops searching the building were alarmed when they heard sounds coming from inside a wardrobe
' speaking later in hospital , the survivor said she told officers from inside the wardrobe : ' how do i know that you are the kenyan police ? ' ' i was just praying to my god , ' ms cheroitich , a christian , said

kenyan 's interior minister , joseph nkaissery said the four terrorist gunmen had strapped themselves with explosives
kenyan security officials said dozens of hostages were freed and four of the gunmen , believed to be armed with ak-47s , were killed
four were kenyan of somalia origin , and the fifth was tanzanian , the ministry said
' in a chilling warning , the terrorist group said more attacks like the university massacre were planned
' kenyan cities will run red with blood , ' al-shabaab said in a statement , according to the site intelligence monitoring group
the militants said the barbaric attack was in retaliation for killings carried out by kenyan troops fighting the rebels in somalia
' this will be a long , gruesome war of which you , the kenyan public , are its first casualties
' kenyan 's president uhuru kenyatta said that those behind the attack were ' deeply embedded ' in kenyan , and called on kenyan muslims to help prevent radicalisation
' our task of countering terrorism has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities , ' he said in a televised speech
