sherwood has warned tottenham to keep pace with harry kane âs rapid rise or the england striker might one day be too big for the club
harry kane was handed his first premier league start for tottenham by sherwood 12 months ago and has taken the top - flight by storm this season , scoring 29 goals in all competitions
he penned a new five - and - a - half year contract at tottenham in february before scoring 78 seconds into his england debut last month
sherwood believes tottenham need to keep pace with harry kane 's progression or risk losing him harry kane has scored 29 goals so far this season and also netted on his england debut in march villa striker christian benteke scored a hat trick in the 3 - 3 draw with queens park rangers on tuesday â i would nât want to put a price on him , they would nât want to sell , â said sherwood
â sherwood joked that he would be the first to try to tempt harry kane away from tottenham by bidding in the summer but said the form of christian benteke and gabriel agbonlahor would keep out the 21 - year - old
â with christian benteke banging the goals in and gabriel agbonlahor playing like he is i have nât got room for harry kane ! â he laughed
christian benteke has scored seven goals in his last five games and has a decision to make on his future once the season is over
sherwood also praised the form of christian benteke 's strike partner , gabriel agbonlahor ( right ) sherwood believes christian benteke 's upturn in form is a result of improved service for the belgium striker christian benteke will look to continue his scoring form for villa when they take on tottenham and harry kane on saturday sherwood said christian benteke âs improved form , having only scored three times before villa sacked paul lambert , was down to the medicine of greater service
