volvo teamed up with a swedish start - up to make a light reflective spray for cyclists , called life paint volvo is known for making cars packed with safety features but it âs a low - tech safety solution for cyclists that has proved a surprising success
the car manufacturer teamed up with a swedish - based start - up to make a temporary light reflective spray for cyclists , called life paint
the paint has proved so popular that the trial cans up for grabs at certain cycling shops in london were snapped up in days
and some of these are now on sale on ebay for Â£ 45 ( $ 66 ) at the time of writing
it contains powder - fine reflective particles designed to react to a car âs headlights , alerting drivers to the presence of cyclists in the dark
a trial began in london bike shops on 2 april to gauge public interest and 2,000 cans were given away free as word of the popular product spread
at the time , volvo said that if the paint proved a hit , the project â will expand nationally and internationally â
it washes off but can last for days on bike frames ( pictured ) life paint is a reflective safety spray
consequently , information about how much it may retail for has not been revealed , but there is still a chance cyclists might be able to buy life paint in the future in cycling shops or even at volvo garages
the lack of concrete plans has led cyclists eager to try the paint to attempt to get hold of some on ebay , where cans are on currently on sale for Â£ 45 ( $ 66 )
life paint is made by a swedish start - up called albedo
it currently sells four different types of spray : a light - reflective spray for metal , wood and plastic , an invisible reflective spray for textiles , a pale grey version of the same kind , and even a light - reflective spray for pets on its website
