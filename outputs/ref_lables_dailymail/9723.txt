this eighteen - month - old boy pulled a rice - cooker brimming with boiling water down on his head , burning deep scars into his face and leaving him almost blind
as a crack team of surgeons from the australians charity , interplast , worked last march to save the sight of little baby seng , from vientiane , laos , inspirational burns survivor turia watched on
that 's because she knows that if she lived in a country like seng 's , she would n't be here
' i would n't have survived , ' she said during a candid interview ahead of hosting a fundraising gala on thursday which aims to raise funds for more volunteer medicos to head overseas to save lives and livelihoods
turia witnessed the operation seng 's sight was saved by keen doctor volunteers from interplast
turia told seng was ' for sure ' one of her inspirations in working for interplast fitter and stronger than ever : turia 's recovery from the horrific burns that left her clinging to life is inspirational
she recently ran a half - marathon and beat the time she ran before the 2011 kimberley blaze turia , who has been operated on more than 200 times since she was caught in the flames , believes australians take their medical system for granted
few would have thought she would be more athletic now than she was before she was seared with burns while running the kimberley ultra-marathon three - and - a - half - years ago
' i 'm fitter now than i was before ! ' turia told seng
nervous about medical complications , turia was ' dumbfounded ' when she ran a half - marathon last month at a quicker pace ( 1hr 45mins ) than her time before she was burned ( 1hr 50mins )
powered by a fierce determination to prove herself , turia is fitter than ever , embarking on a ferocious fitness program in a bid to compete in the 2016 melbourne ironman
the six - day - a - week program features three major planks , working on the burns victim 's already impressive cardio fitness , strength and flexibility
if it sounds daunting , never fear - even turia admits she struggles with staying motivated sometimes
' the program cardio : 2 x 2.5k swims per week and she runs around 30kms a week strength : 2 personal training sessions per week , involving conditioning exercises including box - jumps and squats flexibility : 2 yoga sessions each week , ' just to get a good stretch ' ' maybe i 've got something to prove ... i think i am more motivated ' asked about what motivates her to keep so fit , she told seng there are bigger obstacles in life than running a marathon
turia experienced many dark moments during her recovery that required her to draw upon not only her own strength , but others as well her partner michael hoskin ( left , pictured during a hike recently ) has been turia 's most steadfast supporter throughout the entire ordeal on thursday , turia will hold a gala to raise funds for the same charity that saved baby seng 's sight , interplast
given the nature of her work with interplast , appearance was another topic turia dwelled upon while talking to seng
' all i do is wake up and try and get the most out of each day , ' turia told seng
