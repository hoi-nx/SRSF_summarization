foreign gps now account for 11 per cent of family doctors , new figure show the number of gps from abroad is up by 11 per cent in a decade as the nhs tries to combat a shortage of staff
foreigners now account for almost one family doctor in five although in some areas the proportion is more than two - thirds
senior doctors say the number will rise further over the next few years because the nhs is so short of homegrown medics
the nhs is facing a shortage because many gps are retiring early
the royal college of gps estimates that the nhs will need to hire at least 8,000 more doctors over the next five years to keep pace with a rising , and ageing , population
this is up from 6,921 in 2004 when there were 34,855 family doctors in total
