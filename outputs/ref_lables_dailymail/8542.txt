but one australian woman got so sick of her friend 's constant updates about her baby daughter that she wrote her a scathing letter demanding the mother stop - claiming she is ' p * * * * * g a lot of people off '
ruthven , 33 , was so upset by the ' poison pen ' note that she got her own back by forwarding it onto comedian rusciano - who shared it with her thousands of followers on social media
but we do n't ram it down everyone else 's neck ! ! ! ' she wears a new outfit - well take a photo and send it privately to the person who gave it to her - not to everyone ! ! ! ' she crawls off the mat - we do n't care ! ! ! ! ! she 's 6 months old - big deal ! ! ! ' stop and think - if every mother posted all that c * * p about their kid - i 'm sure you 'd get over it pretty quickly , ' we ca n't wait for you to get back to work - maybe you wo n't have time to be on facebook quite so much
' the letter claims to show what ' people really think ' about mother ruthven 's constant facebook updates , adding : ' we ca n't wait for you to get back to work - maybe you wo n't have time to be on facebook quite so much '
ruthven says the attempt to shame and isolate her has â backfired â , as she is â feeling more loved and supported than ever â the dental hygienist still does nât know who was responsible for the letter
ruthven ca nât think why anybody would feel the need to be so nasty after saying they think the offending child is ' gorgeous ' and they ' love her ' , the writer continues - adding that ms ruthven is ' p * * * * * g a lot of people off '
' we all thought it might ease off after the first month , but it has n't ' , it adds
' for ms ruthven the letter came completely out of the blue and was like a slap in the face , particularly as she is a first - time mother trying to find her feet
never in my wildest dreams did i expect what was in it ! â ruthven told daily mail australia
ruthven and her husband ryan ( pictured with their daughter addison ) were both very angry but chose to try and see the funny side of the ridiculous letter â my husband ryan was just as angry as me but we soon decided to laugh it off as a bad joke
â the cruel nature of the letter spurred ruthven to stand up for herself
â but it takes a lot more to keep me down than a nasty letter ! â however , ruthven wants the coward author to know their nasty act has not brought her down
â no way did i feel self - conscious or consider changing my online activity , â laughs ruthven
â rather , it is an opportunity for her to set an example for her daughter and support other new mothers ruthven was accused of ' p * * * ing ' everybody off by posting too many photos of her baby daughter on facebook comedian rusciano wrote an 870 - word opinion piece about the letter for australian website news.com.au , after ruthven sent it to her through facebook
questioning why the offended women did n't just speak to ruthven or ' unfollow ' her on facebook , ms rusciano said : ' it âs not like she busted into their houses armed with life - size portraits of her child dressed as a tiny adorable pumpkin and demand that they be hung on every wall
worthy of an anonymous poison pen situation , no. ' ms rusciano added the ' mean ' letter represents the ' holy trinity ' of anxiety
' it honestly does nât feel as though â the girls â just wanted ruthven to change a particular behaviour , ' it feels as though they wanted her to feel c * * p about herself
