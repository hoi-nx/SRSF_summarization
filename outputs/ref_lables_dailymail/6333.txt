lewis hamilton is creating a bit of a track record for himself - and this one is n't on the starting grid
celebrating his win at the chinese grand prix on sunday , he sprayed champagne straight into the face of one of the hostesses

others have called the driving ace an ' embarrassment to the uk ' , while another said his behaviour showed that he was an ' ignorant clown '
' if this if the case we think lewis hamilton should apologise for his actions and think carefully about how he behaves in the future
' it 's unfortunate that a great victory has been marred by what appears to be selfish and inconsiderate behaviour
they do n't like it ' , while one outraged user said he was a ' scumbag - an embarrassment to uk '
' and one tweeted : ' shame on you formula one and lewis hamilton for disgraceful treatment of women during champagne celebration # sexism
