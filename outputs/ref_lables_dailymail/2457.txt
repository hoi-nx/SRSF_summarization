as the world cup draws closer , it is not just in the rugby heartlands that they are beginning to feel the excitement
in newcastle , st james â park , usually a footballing stronghold , is another ground about to host rugby âs premier competition , and as former bath , saracens and england prop flatman has been finding out , from the north east to east london , england is getting rugby - fever
david ' flats ' flatman has been driving around the world cup venues preparing for the tournament london 's olympic stadium may not be a traditional rugby ground , but the buzz around the game is palpable â going to all these places and seeing the buzz around the world cup already , is great , â says flats on the drive between stratford and twickenham , as he tours around the country visiting the stadiums that will host matches come this autumn as part of bt sport 's tour de flats
â you kind of expect that kind of a buzz in rugby cities , like cardiff and exeter
but flats is confident that , long term , this world cup is going to have a lasting effect
â there are bound to be studies that come out , or bits of research , 15 minutes after the final whistle of the world cup final , and say there are only seven more children in europe playing rugby than there were on tuesday , â he jokes
flats talks to sportsmail 's jonny singer on arrival at twickenham at the end of his ' tour de flats ' england came up short against france in the six nations , but their style of play earned plenty of plaudits â but i think what it needs is a concerted effort to make as much noise , constructive noise , about the world cup as possible
â at the heart of the â legacy â debate , as it was with the olympics , is the discussion over grassroots sport , and it âs something that flats â tour has been focused on
â of course , as well as investment and infrastructure , what this world cup will bring , stuart lancaster will hope , is an england team playing with confidence in front of their own fans
for the world cup to be the inspiration it has the potential to be , england âs performances will matter
if stuart lancaster 's side can repeat their flowing rugby at the world cup , they can win the sport fans flatman says picking the likes of danny cipriani is key to england bringing in new fans during the tournament â a lot of the buzz and the legacy around the world cup will be how england play , â admits flats
â playing attractive rugby is not just a question of attitude , it also depends on personnel , and that is why the former england prop is so glad to see the return of one of the country âs most exciting players , danny cipriani
danny cipriani may have a reputation as a â pretty boy â but , for flats , that ca nât mask the fact that he is a top player
danny cipriani was recalled for the six nations after impressing at club level over the past few seasons flats says investment in the grass - roots will also be important if the world cup is to have a legacy â you ca nât have a prima donna in the forwards
â we talk about inspiring young people , who do you think the kids â are â in the playground now , playing rugby ? â a lot of them will be saying , â i âm danny cipriani â
â so , if england play at their fluent best , and the grass roots get the funding they so badly need , could the rugby world cup produce a new generation of players and fans ? flats thinks so , but only if the tournament is made accessible
