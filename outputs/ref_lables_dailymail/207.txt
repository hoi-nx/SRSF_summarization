paul lamkin , editor - in - chief of wareable told mailonline : ' it 's hardly surprising samsung has announced plans for a circular smartwatch , the orbis device has been on the web rumour mill for a while ' asus claims the Â£ 119.99 vivowatch ( shown ) has a 10 - day battery life
paul lamkin , editor - in - chief of wareable told mailonline : ' it 's hardly surprising samsung has announced plans for a circular smartwatch , the orbis device has been spinning on the web rumour mill for a while now but the timing , on apple watch launch day , is a little puzzling
' samsung 's betting big on its own proprietary software and it makes sense to get developers in early to pack out the tizen app store with circle - friendly apps
' after all , with 3,000 apple watch apps reportedly already on offer , the korean company is playing catch - up to its long - time rival , despite the fact it âs been in the game a lot longer
apple 's watch officially went on sale today but anyone turning up to buy one on the high street will be disappointed as none of its stores have them in stock
