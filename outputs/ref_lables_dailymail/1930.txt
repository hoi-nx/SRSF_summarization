andy flower , england team director who guided sides to three ashes triumphs and the world no 1 spot , will not be interfering in any way with the work of the next director of england cricket
the england cricket gave andy flower the confusing title of technical director of elite coaching after he renegotiated a new role at significantly lower pay after resigning as team boss following the last ashes whitewash
this has led to speculation that andy flower âs continuing role on the england cricket staff would conflict with the job description of the new appointment
former england team director andy flower is now technical director of elite coaching at the england cricket but effectively andy flower is now running the england cricket academy at loughborough and working with young players in a coaching role , and liaising with counties
only the england cricket âs hopeless media team could launch the domestic t20 blast , which needs all the promotional hype it can muster to compete with the ipl and big bash , on the same day as an england test match
and only the england cricket , having brought in former ashes hero andrew flintoff to drum up publicity for the launch , could then decide he should nât speak to national newspapers
andrew strauss is part of sky âs top - heavy team of cricket pundits for the ashes series
but that commitment should not prove an obstacle to him becoming director of england cricket , a position for which he is one of the front - runners
andrew strauss is one of the weak links in the commentary box - sir botham is the other - and looks far more suited to be a hugh morris - style leader of england cricket if that âs what the england cricket decide they âre looking for
former england captain andrew strauss is a front - runner to becoming director of england cricket such is the friendship between hampshire chairman rod bransgrove and sir botham , who are each building houses on st kitts , that the new restaurant in the hilton hotel that is part of the ageas bowl outside southampton is to be called botham âs despite botham having no association with hampshire .
