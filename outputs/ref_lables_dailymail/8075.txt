the apes , which are found in the forest of south east asia , produce a variety of soft call types , known as ' hoos ' , that are almost inaudible to the human ear
the researchers found that predator ' hoos ' in particular were produced at frequencies well below the threshold of hearing for eagles and other birds of prey
a dictionary that decodes the calls produced by gibbons is being developed by scientists
gibbons singing usually consists of a crescendo of notes , particularly in response to predators
this suggests the quiet calls were designed to alert other gibbons nearby without alerting the raptors
similarly biologists studying lar gibbons found they used a different whisper call to when a tiger or leopard was in the area
dr esther clarke , who led the research at the durham university , said the findings could also help to provide valuable clues about human speech evolved and perhaps even why humans began using whispers
' in the future , gibbon vocalisations may reveal much about the processes that shape vocal communication , and because they are an ape species , they may be one of our best hopes at tracing the evolution of human communication
' gibbons have one of the loudest calls in the natural world , creating whoops that can travel for miles through the dense forests where they live
however , dr clarke and her team , whose work is published in the journal bmc evolutionary biology , decided to focus on the softer hoo call types
while these calls have been known about since the 1940s , they have not been studied in detail due to their low volume and because they are almost indistinguishable to the human ear
lar gibbons used hoo calls to warn each other of predators but also during more intimate moments like this the researchers used models like of this snake to test whether certain hoo calls were specific to predators different hoo calls appeared to be related to the activity the gibbons were taking part in like foraging ( above ) using modern recording technology and computer analysis , dr clarke and her colleagues have been able to detect subtle differences in frequency , pitch , length and volume of these calls
they recorded 450 hoo sounds and found there were six different types of calls being produced by the gibbons
the researchers spent almost four months following lar gibbons around the forests of mo singto in khao yai national park , north east thailand recording their calls and behaviour
they found that the gibbons produced individual hoo calls in different situations , including when they were foraging , when they encountered neighbours , during duet songs between paired mates and when they detected predators
this model of a bird of prey produced short , low frequency and extremely quiet calls from the gibbons this model of a leopard also produced low frequency and quiet calls from the gibbons when they spotted it the researchers used a series of models of predators to test whether the calls were associated with specific predators
while both gibbon sexes displayed similar hoo calls , female calls were lower in frequency than male ones
this video shows a white handed gibbon singing the more distinctive and audible calls while in a zoo enclosure males , however , often interacted with neighbouring individuals
the acoustic variation seen in gibbon hoos in particular may be similar to human speech , in which subtle acoustic parameters , like pitch , can be important carriers of meaning
