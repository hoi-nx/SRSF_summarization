many of us may not have the billionaire lifestyle or scientific prowess of marvel 's iron man , but we can now at least get his trademark hi - tech gloves at home
laser expert priebe created a working iron man - style arm and hand that fires beams from the back of the wrist or from the wearer 's palm
and in a video , the contraption is shown popping balloons and lighting matches from feet away
earlier this year , mr priebe built a laser weapon , inspired by the gatling gun
the inventor said , although it is only strong enough to pop balloons , it is still too dangerous to be used outside a video shows the rapid - fire weapon popping 26 balloons mounted on a wall
as the barrel spins , the lasers - powered by lithium - ion batteries - are shot out
the gadgets are powered by lithium - ion cells and output ranges between 0.2w and 1.2w
he has previously built a spiderman - style web shooter and cyclops style laser glasses
