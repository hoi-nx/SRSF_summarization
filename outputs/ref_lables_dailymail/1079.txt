channel 4 's indian summers star olivia headed to phuket in thai before the start of filming the second series i âve always had a love affair with thai
at the end of filming channel 4 âs indian summers last year , i headed to koh phangan , an island off ko samui , and did a week - long meditation and yoga course
so i jumped at the chance of heading out to thai again before the start of filming series two
i was staying at the luxurious sri panwa resort , which comprises a series of minimalist villas complete with surround - sound systems pumping out enya , and each with their own saltwater private infinity pool facing out on to the shimmering andaman sea
villa co-ordinator pim immediately apologised for the increased security around the resort ( a thai princess and liam from one direction were there )
seduction turned out to be off bangla road , the heart of phuket âs red - light district
olivia did yoga at sri panwa âs cool spa , on a breathtaking platform called baba nest , which offers 360 degree views of cape panwa ( pictured ) bangla road in phuket comes to life when the sun goes down
the road is shut to cars and becomes 1,312ft of neon lights , loud music and cheap beer there are thai versions of cabaret clubs such as crazy horse and moulin rouge , while street hawkers sold tickets to â ping - pong shows â , which i later discovered were not as innocent as they sounded
norman had just started his set and was whipping up a good - looking thai crowd , all of whom seemed as if they were probably doing an ma at central saint martins in london , into a frenzy
room with a view ! the luxurious sri panwa resort in phuket features an infinity pool overlooking the andaman sea i always get a bit nervous at buffets
it has to be a carefully managed procedure , and with only a certain amount of space and a plethora of choice , i did an almost ridiculous amount of hovering before settling on a rather ad hoc selection of banana pancakes followed by a thai fish curry
the james bond island is a popular feature in phang nga bay , phuket i then headed up to sri panwa âs cool spa , where you can practise yoga on a breathtaking platform called baba nest , which offers 360 degree views of cape panwa
our thai yoga instructor , who coincidentally had a body which looked as if it had been carved out of mahogany , performed the chaturanga at sunset with a sinuousness that reminded me of that scene featuring the yoga instructor from couples retreat , for anyone who knows that film
then , after a fabulous dinner at sri panwa âs beautifully appointed thai restaurant soul food , where the â squid on hot plate â sizzled satisfactorily and the green curry with prawns was to die for , i submitted to the jet - lag and crashed out on pillows on which the maids had placed a shell and an orchid
the dj also stayed at the sri panwa and performed at a nightclub called seduction the hotel is much more of a retreat than sri panwa and puts a lot of emphasis on being an eco-friendly , sustainable resort
but this resort is also beautiful
each of the villas contains a double bed with white mosquito nets hanging from interwoven horns , the bathrooms have beautiful copper standalone basins , and from the sunken bath there are exquisite views of the strange islets of phang nga bay
back at sri panwa and there was just enough time to indulge in one more asian - style breakfast curry before take - off
it âs a normal tuesday night in phuket for me too
rates at sri panwa start at Â£ 336 per pool suite per night
