the levy would be used in part to deter people from buying holiday homes in the first place , but the money generated could be used to support schools , post officers and other services which can become unviable without sufficient permanent residents
on a campaign visit in st austell , cornwall , mr clegg said the move could help ' particularly in such a wonderful part of the country as this where there are so many people with second homes and where the prices because of that are way beyond the reach of many young people wanting to get their feet on the first rung of the property ladder '
the clegg leader even claimed second home - owners would ' like to chip in a bit extra ' to fund the communities in which they they spend their holidays
mr clegg , who visited newlyn fish market and harbour with st ives candidate andrew george as he launched his countryside charter , told itv news : ' it is giving councils the freedom to raise a bit of money from those who holiday in a community but do n't live in a community all year round so that local public services can be properly supported for those people who do live in their community all year round
