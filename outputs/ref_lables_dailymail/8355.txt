it has spent four years orbiting the closest planet to our sun , but despite desperate attempts to extend the life of messenger spacecraft , it is slowly spiraling towards mercury 's scorched surface
yet even as its mission draws to an end , the final weeks of nasa 's messenger spacecraft are revealing the planet in unrivaled detail
messenger is currently 18 miles ( 29.1km ) above mercury after nasa engineers used the last of its fuel in a last ditch effort to push the spacecraft higher into orbit after it dropped to within nine miles ( 15km ) of the surface
among the images sent back by messenger as its mission draws to an end is this picture of 2km high cliffs cutting through the carnegie crater
they are thought to have formed as mercury has cooled and contracted the spacecraft , however , is expected to smash into the planet 's surface on 30 april
but as messenger drops ever closer to mercury 's surface , it is sending back some of the most detailed images ever obtained of the smallest planet in our solar system
but spectral data from mercury suggests its surface contains very little nanophase iron , certainly not enough to account for its dim appearance
data sent back by mercury suggests these cliffs , or lobate scarps as they are called , have formed as mercury has cooled and contracted over time , creating dramatic tectonic faults on the surface
' this image by messenger shows the distinctive hollows on the floor of the zeami impact basin on mercury this ghostly crater filled with lava oozed from volcanic vents on mercury leaving just the outline of the rim this crumpled crater has been deformed after it filled with lava and then ridges formed as the surface cooled launched in august 2004 , messenger has traveled more than 4.9 billion miles ( 7.9 billion kilometers ) during its mission to mercury
the above graphic was released by nasa to mark ten years since the spacecraft was launched in 2004 its journey included 15 trips around the sun before it entered orbit around mercury in 2011 - the first spacecraft to ever do so
on 6 april engineers used the last of the messenger spacecraft 's hydrazine fuel to try to push it into a higher orbit
this image shows some of the mysterious irregularly shaped hollows on mercury 's surface in greater detail they hope to raise it further with another burst of helium on april 14
' this image shows fine - grained volcanic material that has blown across impact craters almost like snow this colour image of mercury was one of the first sent back by messenger as it approached the planet in 2008 the above artist 's impression shows messenger as it orbits above the surface of mercury
it is due to impact on the surface at the end of april as the planet 's gravity slowly pulls it down out of its current orbit messenger has also revealed the temperature of mercury 's surface
