a 21 - year - old man with depression has made the most gut - wrenching final goodbye video to his family , telling them not to blame themselves and reassuring them there is nothing they could have done to stop him taking his own life
while the chilling song ' goodbye my lover ' by james blunt is playing in the background , the distressing three - minute footage shows chris ball repeatedly saying that no one should take the blame for his disease and expressing his unconditional love for his mother , four siblings and his girlfriend
on september 14 last year , chris ball 's brother jayden - who is only one year younger - and their stepfather found chris ball 's body along with a usb stick containing the video sitting on top of a piece of paper which simply said : ' mum and dad , please watch
' his family have shared the heartbreaking video publicly to raise awareness of the crippling disease , which takes the lives of more young australia than car accidents and skin cancer , as part of a petition to call for more beds for suicidal youths in hospitals
' chris ball then signs off by naming all of the most important people in his life - his parents , four siblings and his girlfriend , holly
' holly do n't blame yourself - it 's not your fault - same with my family - mum , dad , maddy , lara , matt , jay - all of you just did n't do it alright ? this is me , myself - i love you - goodbye
' chris ball ( left ) was taken by his mother kerrie ( right ) to the hospital 11 days earlier but was sent home with 10 valium because there was a shortage of beds the five people in kerrie 's family who committed suicide : her nephew andrew ( top left ) , her brother andrew ( bottom left ) and son chris ball ( centre ) , her sister and andrew 's mum - lenore ( right ) and her sister leeann ( bottom right ) if anyone knows about the devastating impact of suicide it 's kerrie keepa who has lost her brother , two sisters , nephew and now her son , chris ball , to depression
kerrie said her son would still be with her today if chris ball had not been sent home from redland hospital in brisbane 11 days earlier because he was told there were not enough beds available
a metro south health spokeswoman said it would be inappropriate to provide any details of chris ball 's care while the coroner was still investigating the matter
' however , metro south addiction and mental health service did provide extensive support to mr chris ball and sufficient mental health beds are available within the metro south health area , ' she said
' i said to him " please do n't take this lightly - there is a history of mental illness in my family " and he just said that there were no beds
' chris ball said in his video that his family and girlfriend were not to blame for his ' disease ' ' i 've been feeling lonely for a while , i know i could get better - i keep trying to tell myself that but i just ca n't see it , ' he said in his video although chris ball had been suffering from depression for the past two and a half years and had spent two weeks in the hospital during that time after making an attempt on his life , kerrie said it was the worst state that she had seen her son in
' ten days later , chris ball told his mother that holly was picking him up and taking him to his place so he could have a few drinks with his friends
' before chris ball became unwell two years ago , he was a happy and outgoing boy chris ball with his girlfriend holly and his beloved dog , bear , in happier times kerrie , who works for the health department as an aged care nurse , has started a petition to call on the government to urgently implement emergency suicide training in hospitals and dedicate more beds to suicidal youths in hospitals
