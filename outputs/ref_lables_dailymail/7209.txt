one of the earliest spitfires ever to go into action has gone on sale for Â£ 2.5 million after spending 40 years buried in sand on the french beach it crashed on
the mark 1 version of reginald mitchell 's famous design was among the first built in march 1940 but spitfire p9374 , once flown by an airman involved in the great escape , never made it to the battle of britain as it crash - landed in may 1940
in 1980 the wreckage was discovered when part of it was spotted poking out from its sandy grave beached : german soldiers sitting on the spitfire p9374 brought down on the wet sands at calais by flying officer cazenove
the plane was consumed by the sandy beach and remained there for 40 years captured : the fighter plane ( pictured left ) was being piloted by flying officer cazenove ( right ) over dunkirk when it was hit by a single bullet from a german dornier bomber
