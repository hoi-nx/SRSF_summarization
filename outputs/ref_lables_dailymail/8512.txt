home secretary theresa may said the tory manifesto will spell out plans to negotiate a new deal with europe , including curbing access to benefits under the proposals , unemployed eu migrants in britain will be banned from receiving state support , and would be deported if they do not get a job within six months of arriving
there will also be a ban on ' exporting ' child benefit for children living in other eu countries
the crackdown was ordered after the government failed to meet cameron 's target of cutting net migration to the tens of thousands
mr cameron rowed back from plans to limit freedom of movement across the eu after a backlash from german chancellor angela merkel
but mrs may today said the benefits changes would act to limit the appeal of coming to britain from poorer parts of the eu
' our plan would remove a huge financial incentive for europe migrants to come to britain for the wrong reasons , ' she told the sun. ' instead of claiming in - work benefits , under our plans the vast majority will pay into the system , contributing thousands of pounds
' net long - term migration to the britain was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending september 2014 , a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier she said the tories had made the immigration system ' fairer and more effective ' than it was in 2010 , but more was needed
' the changes to welfare to cut eu migration will be a key part of our renegotiation with the eu , and we will put our reform package to the britain people in a straight in - out referendum by the end of 2017
' under the plans , migrants with jobs will only receive in - work benefits , such as tax credits , and social housing once they have been in the britain for four years
and no child benefits or tax credits for children living elsewhere in europe will be paid out , regardless of how long an eu migrant has paid into britain coffers under the plans
