clooney , who has recently purchased a Â£ 10million manor house with his barrister wife amal ( right ) on an island in the thames in sonning , berkshire , is also building a home cinema and it is unlikely that hollywood celebrities such as clooney are waiting for films to come out on dvd â no doubt eager publicists and production companies send george et al movies even before they are issued on general release
a planning application submitted for david beckham 's ( above ) home earlier this week showed plans for a ' cinema room ' williams has sought planning permission to build an underground complex that features a pool and home cinema ( although winner had already installed an impressive cinema with photos of his own movies on the walls )
however , as well as these celebrities , russian oligarchs and retail tycoons , there is an increasing trend for normal families to install home cinemas
rees , owner of chelsea connected , an audiovisual and internet installation firm , says : â like swimming pools , home cinemas set the status of the house
so , how much does a home cinema cost ? â i âve installed all the technology â projector , screen , amplifier , speakers and control unit â for less than Â£ 10,000 , â says mrs rees
â but with the average cost of a family visit to the cinema costing Â£ 100 ( including tickets , transport and food ) , it almost starts to look like good value

while the home cinemas found in celebrity homes might have popcorn makers , it is easy to make some yourself here are the best ways to get your home cinema up and running ... under Â£ 1,000 at this level , buying a projector is out of your league
your best bet is to shop around for a discounted 55in tv , such as the samsung ue55h6670 â Â£ 799 from currys
to improve the sound quality , invest in a soundbar â a slimline unit that houses lots of small speakers â such as the yamaha yas103 , available from richer sounds for Â£ 149 ( richersounds.com )
this leaves you with Â£ 52 to spare , which you may consider spending on six old cinema chairs currently available on ebay for Â£ 48
with the remaining Â£ 4 , you can buy four boxes of butterkist salted microwave popcorn , available from tesco for Â£ 1 per box
sherlock actor benedict cumberbatch ( above ) also has a home cinema under Â£ 5,000 although you can buy a decent projector for under this price , that will leave you with very little for speakers , seating and all those other extras
the best package for all this is the sonos playbar + sub + 2 x play : 1 , which costs Â£ 1,534 ( smarthomesounds.co.uk )
the epson eh-tw9200 costs Â£ 2,799 and is almost as good as what you âll get at the cinema
