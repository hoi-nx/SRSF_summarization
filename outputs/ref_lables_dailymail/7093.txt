rewind those seven decades and guernsey 's only five - star hotel â pitched on the hillside above the harbour in the capital st peter port â would have been home to a decidedly less relaxed atmosphere
seventy years on : st peter port in guernsey is one of the key locations for the heritage festival during the german occupation of the channel islands ( 30 june 1940 to 9 may 1945 ) , this stately retreat was commandeered as the general staff headquarters
by april 1945 , they would have been wearing sour expressions as the tide of conflict turned back on berlin , and the channel islands â bypassed by the d-day fightback of ten months earlier - awaited their salvation
the ongoing channel islands heritage festival ( 3 april â 11 may ) is a five - week hurrah of history , parades , concerts and food that will unite most of the archipelago â guernsey , alderney , jersey , herm and sark
liberation day itself will turn st peter port and jersey 's capital st helier into swirls of people and music
it is not difficult to find traces of guernsey 's harrowing half - decade
the occupation lingers in the old german fortifications that litter the coastline â the swarthy , sinister tower of fort saumarez which rears up on the west coast ; the similarly menacing fort hommet in the north
coastal curves : guernsey 's dramatic shoreline includes the wide expanse of bay you can go further into guernsey 's wartime heritage
what appears to be a car park behind la colinette hotel on the western outskirts of st peter port reveals itself as the hub of enemy communications in the channel islands
hidden down a damp flight of stairs , the former german naval signals headquarters is all but invisible unless you know it is there
german signs and instructions are still daubed onto the walls
the german occupation museum at les houards offers further perspective , flitting from frivolity to fear â on one hand the photo album of freda oliver , a local girl who dated ( and married ) a german officer ; on the other , exhibits on the inevitable fate of the island 's jewish population , and copies of the guernsey evening press turned to propaganda sheet
this enormous labyrinth was carved out by the slave - labour sweat of prisoners of war â plenty of whom died in the process
as did many of the injured german troops brought here from france after the d - day landings
an island guardian : mont orgueil castle has protected the east coast of jersey since the 13th century the picture is replicated 27 miles to the south - east
jersey is a short hop from guernsey â around an hour by fast ferry , less by air
glorious video footage shows euphoria in st helier as the news of german surrender broke ; the union jack being hoisted at the pomme d'or hotel
the hotel came to symbolise the channel islands ' moment of deliverance
the jersey museum and art gallery has a catalogue of copies of the jersey evening post dating back 125 years , its photos recalling the war era in day - by - day detail ( albeit through a fog of strict german control )
the nearby maritime museum proffers the occupation tapestry gallery â a montage of bright images , stitched by islanders for the 50th anniversary of liberation in 1995 , which depict jersey brought to heel â armed troops in the streets , the island hemmed in by a ragged circle of fire
in the summer of 1940 , it was another german outpost , requisitioned as a hang - out by luftwaffe pilots
