fewer than one in five massachusetts residents want boston marathon bomber tsarnaev to be executed believing a quick death would be ' too easy an escape '
tsarnaev , who killed three people and injured 260 others in the april , 2013 bombings , is due back in court today where his defence team will begin to make its case
fewer than one in five massachusetts residents believe boston marathon bomber tsarnaev , seen here gesturing at his jail cell camera while awaiting trial , should be handed a death penalty however a poll for the globe newspaper found less than 20 per cent of massachusetts residents questioned believed he should be put to death with 63 per cent in favour of a life sentence
and in the city of boston itself the figure falls to just 15 per cent of residents in favour of the death penalty and 66 per cent arguing he should be caged for life
frank perullo , president of sage systems llc , which conducted the poll on behalf of the globe said : ' it seems that voters have concluded that tsarnaev does not deserve a quick death , but rather should spend the remainder of his days in a windowless cell contemplating the heinous acts that put him there
' if he does escape the death penalty , tsarnaev is likely to spend the rest of his days in one of u.s. 's supermax prisons where inmates are kept mainly in solitary confinement and have minimal contact with staff or fellow prisoners
last week protesters demonstrated against the death penalty outside the courthouse holding up banners , one of which read : ' why do we kill people who kill people to show that killing people is wrong ? ' jurors were selected in part for their openness to imposing the death penalty , controversial in a state that has executed no one since 1947 and where catholic bishops oppose capital punishment
three people were killed and 260 others injured in the attacks on april 15 , 2013 an earlier poll carried out by cnn found that just over half of u.s. ( 53 per cent ) , said tsarnaev should get the death penalty
seventeen of those charges carry the possibility of the death penalty
victim : last week the court heard how richard , 8 , suffered a slow and painful death in the trial 's first phase , the defense tried to show that at the time of the attacks , tsarnaev was a 19 - year - old college student flunking out of school and heavily influenced by his radicalized older brother , tamerlan , 26
among those who have come out against the death penalty are bill and denise richard , whose eight - year - old son martin was killed and seven - year - old daughter , jane , lost a leg in the blasts
' we know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty , but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives
demonstrators against the death penalty stand outside the moakley federal court during first day of the penalty phase hearing on tuesday , last week jurors were played an audio recording of the reaction of the crowd outside the forum restaurant between the time of the first and second blasts and heard from some of those who suffered appalling injuries
on tuesday , the court was shown a picture of tsarnaev flipping off a surveillance camera in his cell three months after his arrest , revealing utter disdain and lack of remorse for the death and destruction he had wreaked
