the philadelphia office of transportation aims to get the city 's pedestrians off their phones by sending a man in bubble wrap out to spread their safety message to the people
the campaigners are seen talking to residents about the dangers of not looking up from one 's phone , including the fact that 37 people died from being hit by cars last year
while other safety programs are directed at keeping motorists from hitting and killing pedestrians , the philadelphia 's is focused on those walking around the city
a ' tech guy ' in a helmet with flashing lights on his body also gave information to residents , including that 37 pedestrians died last year the safetysuiters ( played by different actors ) are part of a campaign to drive down pedestrian deaths among young people , based around a series of slogans including ' it 's road safety , not rocket science ' large signs in philadelphia that say ' pick your head up ' are also part of the bid to end phone use , which is thought to contribute to five people being hit per day
the campaign , which has more slogans such as ' it 's road safety , not rocket science ' and ' jaywalking can lead to not walking ' , also includes signs meant for drivers on its website
some have criticized the philadelphia campaign for focuses too much on pedestrians and blaming them for getting hit by cars
some have found philadelphia 's safety slogans such as ' jaywalking can lead to notwalking ' to be ' tone deaf ' some pedestrian advocates and urban planners have criticized certain safety education efforts for placing blame on those who are hit by cars
backlash against the campaign follows a similarly controversial public education effort in montgomery county , maryland , outside of washington dc. posters with tire marks over young people 's faces were seen as blaming them for their own deaths , though the pedestrian safety coordinator told wtop that the street smart campaign was an attempt to humanize victims
