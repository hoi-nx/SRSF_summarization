it may sound like the stuff of science fiction , but this stunning image shows that a white dwarf star ripped apart a planet as it came too close
astronomers say the unique event happened in an ancient cluster of stars at the edge of the milky way galaxy
a white dwarf star - the dense core of a star like the sun that has run out of nuclear fuel - may have ripped apart a planet as it came too close , they believe
nasa says a white dwarf star - the dense core of a star like the sun that has run out of nuclear fuel - ripped apart a planet at the edge of the milky way galaxy
when a star reaches its white dwarf stage , nearly all of the material from the star is packed inside a radius one hundredth that of the original star
for example , the gravity at the surface of a white dwarf is over ten thousand times higher than the gravity at the surface of the sun using several telescopes , including nasa 's chandra , researchers have found evidence that a white dwarf star - the dense core of a star like the sun that has run out of nuclear fuel - may have ripped apart a planet as it came too close
when a star reaches its white dwarf stage , nearly all of the material from the star is packed inside a radius one hundredth that of the original star
for example , the gravity at the surface of a white dwarf is over ten thousand times higher than the gravity at the surface of the sun ' a planet is first pulled away from its parent star by the gravity of the dense concentration of stars in a globular cluster , ' the experts write
' when such a planet passes too close to a white dwarf , it can be torn apart by the intense tidal forces of the white dwarf
' the planetary debris is then heated and glows in x-rays as it falls onto the white dwarf
the rate at which the x-ray brightness dropped agrees with theoretical models of a disruption of a planet by the gravitational tidal forces of a white dwarf
the researchers estimate that the destroyed planet would have contained about a third of the mass of earth , while the white dwarf has about 1.4 times the sun 's mass. while the case for the tidal disruption of a planet is not iron - clad , the argument for it was strengthened when astronomers used data from the multiple telescopes to help eliminate other possible explanations for the detected x-rays
