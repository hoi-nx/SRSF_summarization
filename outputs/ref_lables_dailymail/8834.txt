if manuel pellegrini leaves the premier league at the end of this season â and it is by no means certain â then he will leave behind barely a trace
inside city , the chilean has always provided a welcome contrast to the emotional stresses of life epitomised by his predecessor roberto mancini but â on the field and across the landscape of english football â manuel pellegrini has made the shallowest of footprints
at city , however , the fact is that the identity of the manager represents only a small part of the problem
manuel pellegrini could be out of a job in the summer , and if he is , he will have left little behind city captain vincent kompany has fallen well short of the standards he set in recent seasons manuel pellegrini leaves the stadium as city suffered their fifth defeat in seven matches as reported in sportsmail after city âs defeat in barcelona last month , there is no particular desire at the club to sack manuel pellegrini
there are some issues with manuel pellegrini
some city players think he is too nice â a soft touch who does not inspire with words or his substitutions and who displays a fondness for a 4 - 4 - 2 formation that they feel leaves them vulnerable
the more significant problem is that city âs squad , constructed carefully and expensively , is too old , too foreign and has not been improved by recent transfers
james milner is one of very few englishmen in a first team squad that is too foreign and too old city signed defender eliaquim mangala for Â£ 32million last summer and he has been poor wilfried bony was signed in january from swansea for Â£ 28m but has only scored once since arriving city have had a very good team for quite a while now
signing david silva and toure in 2010 and sergio aguero a year later lifted them to their current level but nothing since the first premier league title has hinted at the further progress many presumed would be inevitable
vincent kompany , for example , no longer seems capable of looking after his own performances , never mind that of his team
txiki begiristain ( left ) has failed to live up to his reputation , and city 's recruitment has been poor stevan jovetic , a Â£ 22m signing from fiorentina , could find himself shipped out as city try to deal with financial fair play samir nasri gives a thumbs up despite city 's defeat at crystal palace , and the frenchman 's poor form wary of financial fair play restrictions , city can not spend enormous sums on targets such as juventus midfielder paul pogba without first selling
it could be that city âs climb back to the very top will be slow
odd as it sounds , however , the identity of the manager is currently not city âs biggest issue .
