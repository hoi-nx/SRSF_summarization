nevertheless , on sunday there were signs of weakness in this manchester united side that van gaal perhaps presumed he had banished
manchester united âs left defensive flank , meanwhile , represented a permanently half - open door as mcnair and luke shaw struggled to deal with the rather predictable threat from everton âs surging right back coleman
regardless , his suggestion that his team lost three individual duels in the build - up to the first goal was telling and james mccarthy âs strike illustrated how the afternoon was to play out for both sides
england midfielder barkley tracks manchester united 's spain international juan mata as the visitors dominated possesion blind ( right ) and mcnair both pulled out of a tackle inside their own box , to allow james mccarthy in to score roberto martinez celebrates as his side take the lead , thanks to james mccarthy 's calm finish , with an enthusiastic fist pump fellaini clatters into the back of gareth barry as he endured a difficult return to goodison park on sunday afternoon fellaini was booked early on , as well as blazing an excellent chance over the bar , against the team he represented for five seasons manchester united had begun reasonably well
as soon as the ball broke loose 10 yards inside the everton half , though , it seemed as though manchester united were already in trouble
seeing green grass ahead of him , james mccarthy strode forward to feed coleman to his right
the everton defender tried to find lukaku breaking through the centre but it was when the ball broke from a red shirt that manchester united really failed
the next goal was always likely to be crucial , however , and once everton scored it 10 minutes before half - time the road back already looked too long for van gaal âs team
on this occasion the manchester united defence cleared for a corner but when baines delivered , john stones arrived to head his first everton goal
de gea looks exasperated after seeing his side fall further behind , as he could not repeat his heroics against everton from earlier in the season fellaini , who was replaced at half time , prepares to kick off after everton 's second goal , as rooney looks on dejected falcao came on at half time for fellaini , but was unable to have much of an impact as manchester united continued to struggle for penetration luke shaw slides in hard on barkley but it was the everton man who came out on top in the battle between the england starlets rooney and juan mata look to break down the everton defence but without joy as gareth barry and leon osman close them down phil jagielka slides in brilliantly to stop rooney 's progress as everton limited manchester united 's chances while capitalising on the break everton aston villa ( away ) - may 2 sunderland ( home ) - may 9 west ham ( away ) - may 16 tottenham ( home ) - may 24 manchester united west brom ( home ) - may 2 crystal palace ( away ) - may 9 arsenal ( home ) - may 17 hull ( away ) - may 24 barkley was , in truth , having a mixed afternoon
eventually , however , the 21 - year - old got it right , playing the ball smartly over the top towards substitute kevin mirallas with 16 minutes left
however , the ball had been played in the direction of kevin mirallas , and as the manchester united defence looked for a flag , the belgian eased clear to beat david de gea comfortably and intelligently with his right instep
ashley young is forced to wrestle everton 's on - loan winger aaron lennon , who put in another excellent display , to the floor kevin mirallas slots home to finish off manchester united with a cool finish after the visiting defence had completely switched off it was a difficult day for england captain rooney , who was replaced late on after appearing to be injured , against his former club falcao managed to find the net late on , slotting past tim howard , but the whistle had long gone with the colombian comfortably offside
