a grieving son was forced to dig his mother 's grave after a council ' co-ordination error ' meant work had not been done to the burial plot

mr gee planned to place his mother , elizabeth hobbs , who died last year , with his father , alex gee , who died in 1964
mr gee makes the journey to the site every year to remember his father , and this year he wanted to follow through on a promise he made to his mother to reunite the pair
gee had planned to reunite his mother , elizabeth hobbs , with his father , alex gee , who died in 1964 ' it was shattering , ' mr gee told daily mail australia
' ' luckily i had a small spade with me and i was able to dig. ' ' it was shattering , ' mr gee told daily mail australia , after he had to dig the hole himself ' we get out there and there was no hole dug - nothing , ' mr gee said mr gee said he had organised the day with the western downs regional council to ensure everything would run smoothly
' western downs regional council can confirm that after receiving an application from mr gee for a second internment of ashes in an existing burial plot , an accidental internal coordination error meant that the planned preparation work at the burial plot were not carried out , ' mr brown said
mr gee makes the five - hour journey to his father 's grave - site every year to look after it ' council , and particularly the staff involved in arranging the works , again apologise and express sincere regret at having caused distress and upset to mr gee and his family
