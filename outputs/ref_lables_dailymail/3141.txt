ask any peru where the best place to party is and you 'll always get the same reply : ' puno ! ' the city 's colourful fiestas , combining spanish and inca traditions , often last for days
reeds all about it : hand - crafted boats on the gentle surface of lake titicaca arriving in puno , you wonder at first where on earth the inhabitants get their energy
this city of 100,000 souls on the shores of lake titicaca could leave you breathless for all the wrong reasons
though its architecture is underwhelming ( with the exception of a splendid central square ) , what entrances every visitor to puno is lake titicaca
one of the world 's largest lakes , and its highest navigable one , it stretches 110 miles by 38 miles across peru and bolivia
it was built in london in 1862 , then transported , piece by piece , across the andes to puno , where it ferried people around for 70 years until the roads made it obsolete and it was left to rot
local life : the ingenious floating uros islands in the middle of lake titicaca are made from totora reeds the accommodation onboard is suitably nautical - you sleep in bunk beds
the port is the gateway to puno 's fascinating islands
a standard , full - day tour will first take you to the uros islands , originally built by the uru people as a way to escape rival tribes
these man - made floating structures are hewn from mats of totora reeds , which grow abundantly in the shallows of the lake
a glimpse of traditional peru : you can meet uru islanders , and go inside their homes , on the lake like sark , cars are banned here , but the island 's elders also forbid beasts of burden , such as donkeys and horses , which leaves the locals to lug everything around on their backs
early evening in puno and the streets are abuzz
being so close to the bountiful lake titicaca , puno has some of peru 's best ceviche restaurants
