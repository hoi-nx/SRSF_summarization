former hewlett packard head fiorina is attributing the years - long drought in california to ' liberal environmentalists , ' whom she says brought on the state 's water shortage with their policies
' it is a man - made disaster , ' she told beck during a monday radio interview
' with different policies over the last 20 years , all of this could be avoided
' the ' tragedy ' of california , fiorina , a maybe presidential candidate , said , is it ' has suffered from droughts for millennia , ' and still ' liberal environmentalists have prevented the building of a single new reservoir or a single new water conveyance system over decades during a period in which california âs population has doubled
with the drought stretching into its fourth year , california 's democrats governor jerry brown last week signed an executive order limiting water consumption
republicans in the u.s. house of representatives approved a bill at the end of last year allowing water to be redistributed from the sacramento-san joaquin delta to drought - affected areas of the state , but the legislation died in the then - democratically - controlled senate
the measure was opposed by environmental groups , who said the water transportation system would disrupt the habitat of certain fish species , and the white house had said the president would veto the bill if it passed

' that 's because you ca n't store what 's not there , ' she said
' a spokeswoman for fiorina doubled down her boss ' claims in an email to daily mail online , saying , ' it is clear that the radical environmental lobby would prefer to ignore the facts on this one
' ' we are n't storing rainfall or building water conveyance systems in california because they are willing to put fish before people , ' fiorina spokeswoman flores said
