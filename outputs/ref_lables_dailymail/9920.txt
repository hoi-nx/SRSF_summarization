they were once sprawling palace compounds that were used to intimidate and strike fear into the hearts of libyans
four years after the 2011 revolution that saw gaddafi 's hold on libyans crumbled , the once feared bab al-aziziya , situated in the capital city of tripoli , resembles a wasteland
following an uprising as part of the arab spring in 2011 and ensuing civil war , he was hounded out of tripoli and killed by members of the national transitional council
' people were afraid even to look at the walls , for fear of being arrested , ' he said
all that remains of the palace , which had been hit in a 1986 united states air strike before being pounded by nato four years ago , are a few ruined buildings , the green flooring of gaddafi 's home and a dug - up network of underground tunnels
then : a mural of a smiling gaddafi was painted on the side of the bab al-aziziya palace , but was a symbol of fear and terror to libyans growing up gaddafi 's children enjoyed their own fairground within the palace in tripoli - yet millions of libyans people suffered under his reign now : the palace has lain in ruin for almost four years , after it was hastily bulldozed by rebels once they took control of it in 2011 nowadays , only shabby outbuildings are left on the palace grounds , covered in graffiti and revolutionary slogans , while holes leading to a network of underground tunnels that once ran under the stronghold can still be accessed the monument of a gold - coloured fist clenching a united states fighter plane was vandalised and sent off to misrata , a rebel bastion during the revolt which ousted and killed gaddafi
apart from the bedouin tents on which gaddafi prided himself and which accommodated him on travels abroad , the compound once showcased a zoo , an indoor pool , countless murals and a fairground in its gardens
rebels posted for photos in a foreign dignitaries reception room at bab al-aziziya when they stormed the building in 2011 the rebels later bulldozed the palace - but the green flooring from gaddafi 's home is still visible in parts of the derelict site gaddafi had expanded the grounds by knocking down adjacent neighbourhoods
today , we have destroyed this symbol , we have demolished and razed it to the ground , ' said farina , tourism ministry spokesman of a tripoli - based government
a libyans army soldier patrols the heavily - fortified compound in march 2011 , before the beginning of the civil war and fighters took it over having taking control of the palace in late 2011 , rebels used a crane to remove the statue of the united states plane clutched by a fist outside the building rubbish now piles up at the site of the former tripoli palace
the site of gaddafi 's palace in the libyans city of benghazi is now a market place , packed with traders selling bric and back , clothes and pets a libyans man holds high a bird , available to buy from the market
the former palace in benghazi is now a dumping ground for people 's rubbish , having once symbolised gaddafi 's grip on libyans
