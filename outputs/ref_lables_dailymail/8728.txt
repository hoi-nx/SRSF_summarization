not a day goes by that 14 - year - old jonathan does n't scream in pain
born with epidermolysis bullosa - or ' butterfly skin ' - his body is covered with deep blistering wounds that will never heal
his skin is as fragile as a butterfly 's wing team work : jonathan , 14 , said he could not get through life without his mother tina who carries and feeds him ' you never know exactly what epidermolysis bullosa is unless you have it ... just the feel of it , the pain that you live in every day , ' the bandaged teenager remarks in an interview with the ottawa citizen
' unless a cure is found , jonathan will likely only live to 25
but in a tone well beyond his years , ottawa - based jonathan says frankly : ' i just have to get on with it
healthy skin is made up of three layers , but jonathan is missing the middle layer which holds the inner and outer layers together
he is pictured here with a vikings junior ice hockey player difficulties : both tina and jonathan say they try not to think about the fact that he has a life expectancy of 25 inspiring : he says he can even feel pain when he is asleep but is trying his best to ' live in the moment ' sufferers are dubbed the ' butterfly children ' due to the fragility of their skin : as breakable as a butterfly wing
the condition has outlined jonathan from many childhood activities
a sports fanatic , he played hockey and loved gym class until his condition meant he could not compete with the other children
mason has the rarest form of epidermolysis bullosa where blistering occurs at the junction between the epidermis and the dermis
' i just studied different options - if i ca n't do this i 'll think of other options
' i ca n't play sports but there 's much more to sports than players
jonathan credits these attributes to his condition : ' because i ca n't play sports , i stay with the adults
' his mother , tina , said it is a struggle every day as she bathes him , knowing he is in pain
