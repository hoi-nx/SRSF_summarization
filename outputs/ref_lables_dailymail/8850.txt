twelve months ago , liverpool were a free - flowing , potent attacking force with the ss firing on all cylinders - the pair would eventually end up scoring 52 of liverpool 's 101 goals in the premier league.this season , however , the goals have dried up
luis suarez and sturridge ( right ) scored 52 premier league goals for liverpool last season raheem sterling has struggled in front of goal this season , scoring only scored six premier league goals jordan henderson ( centre ) celebrates scoring sixth goal of the season , a penalty against arsenal on saturday with just seven games of the season left liverpool have scored just 45 goals - compared to 84 at the same stage last season - and their top scorers - raheem sterling , jordan henderson and steven gerrard - have scored six goals each
to put that into context , only crystal palace ( dwight gayle and mile jedinak - four ) and sunderland ( adam johnson and steven fletcher - four ) have top scorers with fewer premier league goals than liverpool
while aston villa 's top scorers christian benteke and gabriel agbonlahor have also only managed six each
harry kane ( centre ) did n't score against burnley on sunday , but has 19 premier league goals this season diego costa is the joint top scorer in the premier league with 19 goals in his first season in england liverpool fans would argue that in sturridge , who scored 21 league goals last term , they do have a player capable of scoring 20 + goals a season - and they are right
the england striker has had a frustrating season due to various injuries , and that is unfortunate , but liverpool 's others goal threats - raheem sterling , mario balotelli and rickie lambert - simply have n't met the standards set by the ss last season
only sunderland and crystal palace have top scorers with fewer premier league goals than liverpool this season
liverpool - raheem sterling , steven gerrard , jordan henderson
