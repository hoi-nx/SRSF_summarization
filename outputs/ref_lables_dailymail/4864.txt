wisden , the cricket bible , has launched a stinging attack on english cricket and says that the national team have lost touch with the game 's public
editor booth , also a respected cricket writer with sportsmail , uses his notes to take england to task after a tumultuous year spent trying to recover from the bitter fall - out of losing the last ashes series 5 - 0
english cricket , says booth in the 152nd edition of the fabled almanack , which is published on wednesday , ' repeatedly lost touch with the basic idea that the national team belongs to us all '
wisden editor booth has launched a stinging attack on the ecb 's handling of kevin pietersen the star batsman will ply his trade for surrey in a bid to reclaim his spot in the test team and he continues : ' a few wins might have deflected attention from a charge sheet that would include the mishandling of the kevin pietersen affair , worrying test attendances outside london , a head in the sand attitude to the one - day team and - not yet a decade after the 2005 ashes had presented english cricket with a golden chance to attract a new generation to the sport â a fall in the number of recreational players
' starting with the drubbing in australia , england lost eight full series out of all across the formats in 2014 , to say nothing of their defeat by the netherlands at the world twenty20
' the wisden editor is just as scathing about england 's decision to sack alastair cook as one - day captain on the drink of what turned out to be the most disastrous world cup in england 's history
moores presided over a disastrous world cup but was labelled ' the outstanding coach of his generation ' by the ecb 's new managing director paul downton the beleaguered alastair cook was stripped of the one - day captaincy before the world cup debacle ' to leave the sacking of alastair cook so late made little sense , ' says booth
) ' trouble was , alastair cook had become more than just a cricketer : cast by his employers in the role of latter - day saint to kevin pietersen 's fallen angel , he was now an article of faith
the test win over a supine india did not mean alastair cook would effect a similar transformation of the one - day side
' but booth , who also writes for sportsmail , says alastair cook 's eventual sacking so late made little sense national selector james whitaker ( right ) had called alastair cook ' our exceptional leader ' kevin pietersen appeared on the graham norton show - the presenter suggested ' team sport 's not for you ' england also come under attack for the way they handled the sacking of kevin pietersen , a situation where they had right on their side - plus the support of the bulk of those who follow the team around professionally - but somehow allowed the maverick to claim the morale high ground
' the ecb 's comments on the fall - out with kevin pietersen should have been clear and concise , ' writes booth
" this year 's wisden also includes both a withering review of kevin pietersen 's nasty book by the mail on sunday 's patrick collins , who retired this year after a distinguished career , and an excellent piece of the aspect of his career totally overlooked by kevin pietersen in his book â batting that touched genius
gary ballance has been named one of wisden 's five cricketers of the year in the new edition ballance 's yorkshire team - mate adam lyth , called up by england , is also in the top five jeetan patel ( left ) and angelo mathews make up the remainder of booth 's top five cricketers sri lanka 's brilliant kumar sangakkara clinched the title of leading cricketer in the world australia 's meg lanning ( batting against england ) is honoured with the inaugural women 's award the thousands of disciples of wisden always look immediately at who the editor has chosen as his five cricketers of the year , one of the oldest and most highly regarded prizes in sport
booth has chosen well and predictably in the cases of moeen ali , who has the honour of being pictured on the front cover , gary ballance , adam lyth and angelo mathews and enterprisingly in jeetan patel , who is rewarded for his prolific season for warwickshire
for instance , how good would it be if , on his retirement , a player would be described as a five - time wisden cricketer of the year ? booth is a progressive , brilliant , imaginative editor but perhaps such a move would be just a little too controversial for such a traditional vehicle as wisden
the brilliant kumar sangakkara , who will be delighting championship audiences with surrey this summer , is the leading cricketer in the world while , for the first time , there is an international woman cricketer of the year
australia 's meg lanning is honoured with the inaugural women 's award
as ever , wisden is a must for any cricket fan and even at a time of continuing turmoil for the england team and genuine concerns about cricket 's future world-wise , it is a reassuring presence however critical the editor is of it
and , when he was promoted to open for the one - day side , he scored the third - fastest hundred by an england batsman , from 72 balls against sri lanka in colombo
