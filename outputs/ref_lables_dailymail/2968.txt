the senate voted on thursday to approve lynch as president obama 's next attorney general , ending a five - month deadlock that made lynch wait longer for confirmation than the last seven attorneys general combined
the first black woman to become the top american law enforcement official , lynch , 55 , was approved by a 56 - 43 vote
curiously absent from the final vote was texas senator cruz - a key opponent of lynch 's nomination
a copy of a cruz for president invitation later began flying around twitter that showed the gop presidential candidate had skipped town early to make an appearance at a fundraiser at the home of former texas rangers owner and billionaire tom hicks
president obama said in a statement after that the vote that ' american will be better off ' having lynch as its next top cop
' lynch âs confirmation ensures that we are better positioned to keep our communities safe , keep our nation secure , and ensure that every american experiences justice under the law
' ten republicans voted for lynch , including senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and expected presidential candidate lindsey graham , the senior senator from south carolina
cruz tried to block lynch from clearing a procedural hurdle earlier in the day , giving an impassioned speech on the chamber floor urging his colleagues to oppose her nomination , but was missing when the final tally was taken
' the gop majority , if it so chose , could defeat this nomination , ' the 2016 oval office candidate said said during the debate on whether to take a formal vote on her nomination
tom hicks , who is currently in the process of selling his estate , on the market for $ 98 million as of last month , is a neighbor of former american president george w. bush , also a gop and a former co-owner of the texas rangers
missing : cruz was not present for today 's final vote on lynch
a copy of a cruz for president invitation that later began flying around twitter indicates the texas senator skipped town early to make a fundraiser at the home of former texas rangers owner and billionaire tom hicks the voting margin reflected many gop ' disapproval of lynch 's support for an executive order issued by obama in november that was meant to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from the threat of deportation
senate democratic leader harry reid berated gop for delaying the confirmation and said lynch was ' as qualified a candidate ' as he 'd seen in almost 30 years in the senate
after winning november 's midterm elections , gop asked the democratic - led senate not to shove a vote on lynch down their throats
democrats had balked at an anti-abortion provision included in that bill , and senate majority leader mcconnell put a hold on all business until that issue was resolved
he is a neighbor of former american president george w. bush , also a republican and a former co-owner of the texas rangers mystery solved : minutes after a spokesperson for cruz told daily mail online that the senator had a prior commitment in texas that caused him to miss the vote , this cruz for president invitation began circulating online
the vip portion of the event begins at 6pm central , meaning cruz needed to leave the east coast to by mid-afternoon arrive at the party on time despite the delay , she was widely seen as less controversial than eric holder , who often clashed with gop
