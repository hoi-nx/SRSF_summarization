it was the sort of training ground accident that can happen to anyone , but it had far - reaching consequences for philipp lahm
philipp lahm 's tackle on a team - mate at bayern 's training ground on the outskirts of the city appeared innocuous enough , until a scream of pain pierced the morning air and a frantic wave signalled he was in trouble
to the dismay of guardiola , there was n't a single qualified doctor on site
bayern doctor hans-wilhelm muller-wohlfahrt quit this week after a reported rift with guardiola the pair fell out over an injury to philipp lahm during training as early as november last year as philipp lahm lay on the turf with what was later diagnosed as a broken ankle , the physio tended to him as best he could , while an ambulance was summoned to take him to a local hospital
it was last november , and from that day on , the 72 - year - old 's days as head of bayern 's medical department were numbered
they finally ended after bayern 's champions ' league defeat at porto , when guardiola went public with his displeasure over recovery rates for injured players by blaming a lengthening injury list for his side 's quarter - final first - leg demise
not as long as guardiola holds the reins
the bayern boss is aware manchester city long to install him as replacement for manuel pellegrini , even if it means waiting another 12 months for his contract to expire , but the latest ructions at the allianz arena have evidently done nothing to increase their chances
bayern doctor hans-wilhelm muller-wohlfahrt is a world - renowned specialist and quit after guardiola 's injury complaints the 72 - year - old had been at bayern for almost 40 years but is now unlikely to return to the bundesliga club unseemly though his undermining of hans-wilhelm muller-wohlfahrt may have been , there was only ever going to be one winner
dispiritingly for manchester city , the former barcelona manager reaffirmed , at his friday press conference , that he will ' for sure ' honour the remaining year on his contract , ruling out any hope of a deal being struck with etihad bosses this summer
beyond that , he could even commit himself to a further spell in charge , according to a bayern insider , who told sportsmail : ' there is no question that bayern will do absolutely everything in their power to persuade guardiola to sign another contract
hans-wilhelm muller-wohlfahrt ( fourth from left ) sits behind guardiola during the defeat by porto this week manchester city long to bring in guardiola to replace manuel pellegrini but they may have to wait for him ' that was a problem , because they had many disagreements over the treatment of injured players
sportsmail has learned that one of guardiola 's stipulations , after taking over from jupp heynckes , was that the club doctor should be at the training ground every single time the players were there
dante , sebastian rode , philipp lahm and robert lewandowski ( l-r ) trudge off the pitch after defeat in porto hans-wilhelm muller-wohlfahrt has worked with the german national team as well as athletes including usain bolt hans-wilhelm muller-wohlfahrt has often courted controversy with his methods
irked by hans-wilhelm muller-wohlfahrt 's defiance , it soon became apparent to guardiola that they were diametrically opposed when it came to policy over ushering players back from injury
in a nutshell , guardiola wanted players declared fit and pencilled in for selection as rapidly as possible , whereas care and caution were the key words for hans-wilhelm muller-wohlfahrt
' guardiola wanted players declared fit as rapidly as possible , but hans-wilhelm muller-wohlfahrt wanted care and caution hans-wilhelm muller-wohlfahrt prescribed a course of action for a nagging injury to thiago but was overruled
guardiola was having none of it and , instead , arranged for thiago to undergo treatment in barcelona , where , to hans-wilhelm muller-wohlfahrt 's exasperation , surgery was followed by recuperation and an eventual return to the bayern squad
usain bolt was one of many athletes to benefit from hans-wilhelm muller-wohlfahrt 's treatment at the london olympics guardiola is now in the strongest position he has ever been at bayern and he could agree a new deal there if protesting to the bayern boss was futile , trying to appeal to thiago was just as pointless
the odds were stacked ever - higher against hans-wilhelm muller-wohlfahrt , and his resignation on friday morning was merely confirmation the guardiola empire is not about to be overthrown
