but have you ever stopped to think about where the ones you 're eating have come from ? forget sun - kissed seas and a lone fisherman casting his nets into the indian to haul in his catch
a new study by experts at consumer reports in the us has found 60 per cent of packaged prawns tested were found to contain traces of harmful bacteria experts in the us found the majority of the shrimp sold on supermarket shelves arrive there after starting life on vast prawn farms in south east south-east asia
many prawns sold in the uk also come from places such as thai and indonesian
they tested 342 packages of frozen shrimp - 284 raw and 58 cooked samples - from large , chain supermarkets and natural food stores in 27 cities across the us
and their investigation revealed 60 per cent of the prawns were found to have traces of harmful bacteria , including e.coli , which can cause violent food poisoning
furthermore , in 11 samples researchers detected antibiotics , and seven samples tested positive for mrsa - an infection that is resistant to a number of antibiotics
other traces of bacteria included salmonella and vibrio , both of which can cause serious food poisoning
dr urvashi rangan , executive director of consumer reports food safety and sustainability centre , warned : ' bacteria and algae can begin to grow and disease can set in , prompting farmers to use drugs and other chemicals that can remain on the shrimp and seep into the surrounding environment
' vibrio is the most common cause of food poisoning from eating raw oysters
' scientists found traces of e.coli , mrsa , salmonella and vibrio - a major cause of food poisoning responding to the discovery of mrsa , dr michael crupain , director of the consumer reports food safety and sustainability centre , said : ' it 's spread through contact , so if mrsa gets on your skin while you 're preparing raw shrimp , it can potentially cause an infection , especially if you have an abrasion or cut
the vast majority of prawns eaten on these shores come from such farms in india , indonesian and thai
there , prawns are ' farmed ' in huge industrial tanks , or shallow , man - made ponds that can stretch for acres
a large number of the prawns available on supermarket started life in vast prawn farms in thai , india and indonesian
