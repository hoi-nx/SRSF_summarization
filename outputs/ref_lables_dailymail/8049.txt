two buddhist monks chatting against the imposing backdrop of trongsa dzong ( left ) while a mountain dzong is equally as elaborate i removed my shoes to circumambulate the huge prayer wheels before entering one of the dimly lit shrine rooms where every inch of wall space was covered in exquisite frescoes of gods and demons.pilgrims prostrated themselves in front of a huge golden statue illuminated by hundreds of flickering butter lamps while red - robed monks sat crosssweet legged , mumbling prayers in a hypnotic chant accompanied by the sound of tinkling bells and clashing cymbals
