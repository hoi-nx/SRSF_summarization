british 's only surviving mobile cinema has gone on sale for Â£ 120,000 as the owners who spent years of their life restoring it and touring the country now want to enjoy parenthood
emma giffard , 36 , and ollie halls , 37 , from somerset , bought the cinema for just Â£ 1,200 in 2005 and spent Â£ 35,000 on restoring the vintage classic with friends in north devon over five years
restored : british 's last - ever mobile cinema has been brought back to its former glory after film buffs found it rotting in a field in 2005 but now the pair have decided the time has come to sell the bus , which has taken over their lives for more than a decade
since then , ollie halls has had to spend five months a year on tour while emma giffard stays at home with the children and he 's now looking forward to having more time with iona and ivy
love affair : emma giffard and ollie halls outside the bedford cinema which has taken over their lives since they restored it ten years ago iona may giffar halls , two and a half years old , sits outside the mobile cinema
' it 's now listed on ebay for Â£ 120,000 which is 100 times what they originally bought it for , but it 's not just a bus , it 's a piece of british history , listed as ' the soul survivor ' of the original fleet
it 's one of just seven mobile cinemas originally commissioned by the ministry of technology in 1967 , to promote british industry as a global leader by visiting factories to show films about modernisation
with a plastic perspex bubble at the front and a tardis - like interior with a 26 - seater cinema inside , the bedford sb3 looked like something from the future as they toured the country promoting the ' white heat of technology '
the vintage mobile cinema is one of just seven mobile cinemas originally commissioned by the ministry of technology in 1967 a piece of history : this was how the buses were advertised when they toured factories to promote british industry in the 1960s super seven : the vintage is the soul survivor of a fleet of seven and was rescued from a field in essex where it sat for 14 years promoting industry : bosses and workers at factories would enter the visiting bus to learn about the ' white heat of technology ' but like all modern creations , soon enough they grew old and it was n't long before this particular cinema was on the road to being forgotten
it was owned by the transport trust between 1975 and 1990 but after that it sat in a field in essex for 14 years until it was rescued by a previous owner based in somerset
in 2005 , ollie halls and emma giffard of the vintage mobile cinema company bought it for just Â£ 1,200 and brought it to north devon , where they carefully restored it with the help of friends
they spent Â£ 35,000 on the restoration which put the vintage cinema back on the road and touring a series of shows at north devon schools and villages and beyond
listed : the rare bedford mobile cinema was fully restored between 2005 and 2010 and is now on offer on ebay for Â£ 120,000 oliver and emma giffard are hoping that someone else might take up the mantle and continue touring the bus but at this point the future of the cinema is uncertain
ollie halls said : ' it could go any which way - a collector in this country or abroad , someone wanting to run the business , or a group putting together a bid to bring it into a trust
the vehicles originally towed huge exhibition trailers and remarkably the cinema has now been reunited with its trailer - after being separated for 23 years
re-united : the owners got a call ' out of the blue ' from someone who knew where the buses trailer was after they had been separated for 23 years
now the pair have come together again - but the trailer is a restoration project in itself for the new owner ' we got a phone call out the blue , ' said ollie halls
' ollie halls had been promised the trailer from an owner sympathetic to their project around four years ago but when he finally got it , it 's actually what convinced the family to part with the bus
