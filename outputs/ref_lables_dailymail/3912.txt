kellie-jones suffered from hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ) , a type of brain damage that occurs when the brain does not receive enough oxygen or blood
to control the condition caitlin was placed in a special cooling wrap within 40 minutes of her birth to keep her at the target temperature of 33.5 degrees for 72 hours
nicola kellie-jones and partner paul with children caitlin and dylan are raising money to help other children medics gave little caitlin , pictured , hypothermia in a bid to prevent any brain damage caitlin , pictured , was diagnosed with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy minutes after she was born it allows the brain to cool down and minimises the damage from the lack of oxygen
thankfully , caitlin , now ten months old , recovered from hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and is able to feed and play
her parents , nicola and paul , are hoping it will not have affected her ability to walk and talk but they must wait to find out
she was whisked away by doctors immediately to be placed on a specialist cooling machine
despite her ordeal , caitlin , who is now 10 months old , seems to be developing normally ms kellie-jones , right , wants to raise Â£ 16,000 for additional cooling machines to help save other babies ms kellie-jones said : ' my mum was a neonatal nurse for many years and i often visited her at work and would see all of these babies in their little incubators and see families in and out visiting their babies , but i never imagined it would be me
' paul was the opposite , he wanted to know the best possible outcome
' caitlin was born and treated at royal preston hospital , where there are only two cooling machines available
' i 'm trying to raise money now for two cerebral function machines for the hospital , which monitor brain activity for any signs of brain damage , and , if i raise enough , another cooling machine for the neonatal unit
' my target is to raise at least Â£ 16,000
