a new zealand couple needed a home upon returning home after living in the uk , so they built one on the back of an old flatbed truck
hannah and alex purchased a 1986 hino flatbed and undertook their year and a half labor of love
the result was a solar - powered two - bedroom , wood and steel home that now allows them to live almost self - sufficiently in nelson , new zealand
how a truck becomes a home : a new zealand couple built this country home on the bed of a flatbed truck making do : alex ( left ) and hannah ( right ) wanted a home that was cozy and all their own , but could n't afford to buy a full - sized lot ' we came back to new zealand from the uk in 2009 , ' alex told smoking tire
' so , the couple started building
once they finished , the couple drove their truck home out to a lot they 'd purchased in nelson , new zealand
ingenuity : the couple started with a steel frame and slowly , project by project , built a home in about a year and a half gorgeous : hannah and alex now have a gorgeous , wood - lined home in a lot surrounded by trees and a babbling brook details : the couple has a wood - fired stove to keep out the cold , stained glass windows and other creature comforts they 're nearly self - sufficient , too
' all told , the project cost hannah and alex about $ 25,000
