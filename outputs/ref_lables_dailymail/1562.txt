a holidaymaker still has sickness issues , nine months after he first contracted food poisoning on holiday in egypt
james and his girlfriend , vicki hood , had saved up for months for the sunshine break at the sonesta beach resort in sharm el sheikh
but within just hours of arriving at the first choice resort , which is described as five - star on its website , the couple say they became violently ill with sickness and diarrhoea and were barely able to leave their room
james fell ill while on holiday with his partner vicki hood last summer at the sonesta beach resort in sharm el sheikh , and is still suffering nine months on james , 30 , who works for a publishing company , has since developed ibs ( ibs ) , a digestive complaint which he admits can leave him in crippling pain with him sometimes needing the toilet several times an hour
vicki hood , 22 , claims she too has been plagued by sickness including a kidney infection
but instead james said : ' on the first night we got there in time for the end of dinner and that 's where it all started to go wrong
we thought it would be safer than the buffet but it just made us ill all over again
mr james took a photo of a piece of mouldy bread while he was on holiday in sharm el sheikh ' we were both so ill we were crying
' james claims they asked to get earlier return flights but were told it would cost them hundreds of pounds
after investing around Â£ 1,500 already in the all - inclusive deal , he says they were forced to sit it out in the blistering heat
and once at home james told how the health problems continued with ibs still causing him to take time off or away from work nine months on
' the other day i had to stop twice on the way to work to go to the toilet and it 's only a 20 - minute drive
' james says he was offered a Â£ 50 ' goodwill voucher ' but no apology from first choice and has now instructed law firm slater and gordon to launch a civil case against the travel company , part of the tui group
a spokesperson for first choice told mailonline travel : ' first choice is sorry to hear of the couple âs experience during their holiday in egypt
' the sonesta beach resort in sharm el sheikh will provide bad memories for james richard duxbury , a specialist travel lawyer from slater and gordon , representing mr james , said : ' mr james and his partner paid a substantial amount of money to go on what they thought would be a relaxing getaway
' instead the holiday was ruined by entirely unacceptable hygiene standards which have left both of them still suffering the effects several months after returning home
james says numerous meals at the sonesta beach resort made him and his partner sick comley fell ill during a family holiday to the sonesta beach resort in egypt easyjet pilot comley , 33 , from bracknell , berks , booked a 10 - day break to sonesta beach resort in sharm el sheikh , egypt last july with tour operator thomson with his wife louise , 36 , and two - year - old son sebastian
