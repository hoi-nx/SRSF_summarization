rangers boss mccall says he is already working on a dossier of signing targets for next season - even though he may not be around to parade them
so far , everything is going to plan with gers second in the scottish championship table and destined for a semi-final play - off slot
mccall says he is already looking at transfer targets for next season , though he may not be at rangers but with 12 players out of contract , mccall knows the light blues will need to strengthen if they have any chance of keeping pace with rivals celtic next season - if they go up - and is already piecing together a wish list of potential new arrivals
he said : ' i 've been speaking to a lot of agents and putting things in place for if and when ... even if i 'm not here , if i 'm getting players put to me who would like to come to rangers regardless of the manager , then we build a little portfolio of positions that we will be needing next year
' mccall is compiling a dossier on targets as he looks to put the club in the best possible position rangers have operated a haphazard transfer policy since re-emerging from the embers of liquidation
the club 's team of scouts were jettisoned under the disastrous craig whyte regime and former boss ally mccoist was largely forced to turn to a list of former ibrox servants he had personal knowledge of when trying to bolster his squad
but mccall revealed the club 's new board are now starting the process of re-establishing their spying network - albeit on a smaller level than before
' i do n't think rangers will be at the stage yet next year where we need international scouts everywhere
rangers have expanded their scouting network after a haphazard system over the past few years ' but certainly a scouting network needs to be put in place
' so yeah we need a scouting network but at this moment where rangers are , not to the extent where we have scouts all over europe
mccall 's side are still in line for promotion , sitting in the play - off positions in the scottish championship peter houston 's bairns - five points behind fourth - placed queen of the south with two games to play - need an unlikely series of results to make the play - offs but mccall says that raises more questions than answers
' it will take a difficult set of results for them to get into the play - offs so i do n't know if they will come here and think the pressure is off and play care free
