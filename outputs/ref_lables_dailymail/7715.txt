cook must somehow shut out the deafening noise enveloping english cricket and concentrate on what has become one of the most important test series of his career
defeat against west indies in a three - test battle that begins here on monday is simply unthinkable for an england captain who is desperate to avoid being distracted by the seismic changes going on all around him
there has been so much happening , from the demise of paul downton , to speculation surrounding the new director of cricket and the ever - present spectre of pietersen , that the imminent first test has barely registered
cook in the nets ahead of the first test in the west indies of a vitally important series for his career cook and his england team - mates share a few words in practice ahead of the first test on monday west indies ( probable ) : k braithwaite , smith , samuels , chanderpaul , darren bravo , blackwood , ramdin ( captain and wkt ) , holder , benn , taylor , roach
england ( probable ) : cook ( captain ) , jonathan trott , ballance , bell , root , stokes , buttler ( wkt ) , jordan , broad , tredwell , james anderson
26 Â° c yet cook knows that he , and coach peter moores , can afford no slip - ups in what should be the least taxing assignment of england âs ridiculous schedule of 17 tests in the next nine months
in less chaotic times james anderson âs 100th test appearance and his chances of securing the four victims he needs to overtake sir ian botham and become england âs leading test wicket - taker would dominate the agenda
equally , the return of jonathan trott , who looks set to open with cook , 18 months after he left england âs ashes tour in a state of turmoil is a significant development that has virtually passed under the radar
cook ( left ) and coach peter moores ( right ) know they ca n't afford any slip - ups in the carribbean this month cook has slightly altered his batting stance after working with graham gooch in his enforced off - season he made three half centuries in his last four test innings against india last summer while leading england to three successive victories , yet the disaster of a world cup that went on without him has heaped pressure back on his side
that pressure can only have been increased by the somehow inevitable news that pietersen had smashed a huge century on his return to the domestic game with surrey yesterday , albeit against the students of oxford mccu
england , both publicly and privately , still insist that nothing has changed regarding pietersen and there seemed a genuine indifference from cook when asked about the sacked maverick for the umpteenth time on sunday
pietersen hit 170 off 149 balls against oxford mccu as he put on a show for surrey james anderson ( left ) will make his 100th test appearance as cook looks to get the tour off to winning ways â i âm pleased he scored runs for surrey but it is exactly what i said before we came here , â said cook
â the difference now , of course , is that the two men most responsible for jettisoning pietersen after the ashes have gone , paul downton having been sacked and former ecb chairman giles clarke now marginalised as the new president
it was paul downton who put so much faith in cook to lead a new england era that the captain still believes is full of promise
â jonathan trott has returned to the test side equally , cook did not want to think about the implications of what will happen when the new men at the helm in chairman elect colin graves and new chief executive tom harrison continue their revolution of the english game
