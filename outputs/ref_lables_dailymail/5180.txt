a man has spent a year losing 70lbs so he could donate his kidney to his wife
spraggins was delighted when he discovered he was a perfect match for wife tracy , who was told her life - long battle with lupus would kill her if she did n't get a transplant
but the next day the couple from birmingham , alabama , were dealt a blow : his blood pressure was too high to perform the operation
refusing to accept the diagnosis , pj embarked on a relentless fitness regime
on the transplant list , she would have had to wait seven years made it ! after a year of grueling dieting and exercise , pj was given the green light to undergo surgery ' we both just feel amazing
she was placed on the transplant list in 2013 - just a few months after her 34 - year - old sister , who also had lupus , died following complications from a kidney transplant
knowing that the seven - year wait might be too long , pj , a self - employed musician , submitted himself for the weeks - long evaluation to assess whether he could donate his kidney
' they said i was a perfect match but they wanted to check i was healthy and met their requirements
they sent me a blood pressure monitor , but they did n't like the numbers
' my blood pressure was all over the place
' i put that blood pressure monitor on and lay in bed all day
and thankfully , it all came back good ! ' undergoing the four - hour surgery together on february 24 , the couple took a beaming photograph in matching hospital gowns
