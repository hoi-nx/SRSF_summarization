claims by the country 's biggest food bank network that it served a million hungry people in a year were exposed as false yesterday
after the labour party and trades union congress seized on the figure , with shadow work and pensions secretary rachel reeves describing it as ' shocking ' , the trussell trust admitted in a climbdown that ' these are not all unique users '
in the announcement of its food bank users , the trussell trust â which has 445 food banks run in its name â declared that ' more than one million people received three days ' food '
however the trussell trust has now acknowledged that the claim was based on the number of food parcels given out , and not the number of individuals asking for help
claims by trussell trust that it served a million hungry people in a year were exposed as false yesterday charlie elphicke , the conservative candidate for dover and deal , said : ' their use of unverified figures is irresponsible and borders on scaremongering
' it comes from confusing the number of different people using trussell trust food banks in a year with the number of times they use the food banks
' full fact said that even trussell trust 's figures for the number of food parcels handed out â from 913,138 in the 2013/14 financial year to 1,084,604 in the financial year which ended in march â did not mean that demand for free food was going up
trussell trust chairman mould said : ' the number of times people were given three days of emergency food rose over a million during the year
