a local council has been criticised for banning an indian food stall from a st george 's day event because it ' only wanted english food '
british - born stall - holder tania rahman , 27 , was asked by salisbury city council if she wanted to run a stand at the celebration later this month
but when she asked to be counted in she was told her stall , chit chaat chai , would not be allowed because it is not ' english - themed '
' discriminatory ' : tania rahman received a letter from salisbury city council telling her it would not accept her offer to run a food stall at a st george 's day event because it ' only wanted english food ' the council has now apologised after their response sparked a backlash from locals - who pointed out that chicken tikka masala is a british - made dish
ms tania rahman , of andover , hampshire , was one of many food stall - holders who applied to take part in the event planned for sunday , april 26
' i consider myself to be english - i was born in this country
how far does it go ? can only english people attend the event ? u-turn : the council has since apologised for the letter and reversed their decision by inviting ms tania rahman to run a stand on the day ' it is the utter ignorance of it all that makes me most upset
' questioning the wording of the letter , she added : ' in all respect , with english cuisine in modern day english what can we actually define to be english food ? ' to say that one food is english cuisine and another is n't , i beg to differ
' chicken tikka masala is the nation 's favourite dish and st george himself was born in palestine
for them to turn around and say they do n't want my food there because it is n't english enough is discriminatory
' ms tania rahman has raised some very interesting points about modern english and the council will wish to reflect upon these issues when setting the theme for the st george 's day in 2016 and onwards
' the council is delighted to offer ms tania rahman an opportunity to trade at the st george 's day event as part of our apology to her
