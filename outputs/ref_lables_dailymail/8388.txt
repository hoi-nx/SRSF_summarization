a new york - based documentary photographer has spent three years traveling the u.s. photographing and interviewing gay veterans and servicemen to share their stories of suppression , sadness and silence in a moving photo essay
vincent cianni , 63 , said he embarked on the project , gays in the military , to better understand why homosexuals would enlist in the military to begin with ; voluntarily signing up for a system that did , and in many ways still does , oppress them
' it seems i spent most of my life uninterested in knowing about the military because i supported peace , the fight to end violence and injustice , and the sanctity of life , ' the photographer told vice
' i could n't understand why anyone would join the military , much less why gay people would join the military , an organization that shunned them
' pieced together , vincent cianni 's photos show commonalities between the subjects despite their different journeys , from a 92 - year - old world war ii veteran to young soldiers who recently returned from afghanistan
many were discharged because of their sexuality , others were raped , assaulted and bullied , causing ongoing psychological damage
a major turning point for gay people in the military came in 2011 with the overturning of dadt ( dadt ) , a discouraging policy signed by bill clinton in 1993 that continued a ban on gay soldiers enlisting , but stopped investigations and ' witch hunts ' into whether soldiers were gay
the bill was designed to protect the soldiers by keeping their sexuality a secret , however it forced them into the closet and further internalized their struggles

he has served since 2002 and is still serving before dadt , which was enacted in 1993 , homosexual behavior was considered a criminal offense within the military
' in many cases , the people i interviewed and photographed had no recourse to their discharge , ' vincent cianni said
