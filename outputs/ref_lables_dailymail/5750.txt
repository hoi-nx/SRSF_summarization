various types of renewable energy such as solar and wind are often touted as being the solution to the world âs growing energy crisis
but one researcher has come up with a novel idea that could trump them all - a biological solar panel that works around the clock
by harnessing the electrons generated by plants such as moss , he said he can create useful energy that could be used at home or elsewhere
a university of cambridge scientist has revealed his green source of energy
by using just moss he is able to generate enough power to run a clock ( shown )
he said panels of plant material could power appliances in our homes
and the technology could help farmers grow crops where electricity is scarce dr bombelli will present his research as part of the pint of science festival , which is running from 18 to 20 may in 50 cities across nine countries
he demonstrated how a smartphone - sized block of moss could be used to power a digital clock
dr bombelli , with his moss - powered clock , is one of the scientists taking part
â in that movie , they try to generate electrical energy , power , from humans , â he explained
at the moment , dr bombelli is trying to find a way to increase the â flux â of electrons emitted by a plant , making more energy available
â in that movie , they try to generate electrical energy , power , from humans , â he explained , shown in this image from the movie
the ultimate goal is to develop panels that generate five watts per square metre ( 11 square ft )
he is adamant that regular moss ( stock image right ) could provide an additional source of renewable energy to complement others that are available for example , he said people could have one of these panels on the roof of their house to power certain appliances in their home
dr bombelli said in regions where people do nât have access to energy , biological solar panels could be useful for tasks such as growing crops
it could help power technology in areas where electricity is scarce , possibly increasing yields
nonetheless he thinks it could be part of a â portfolio of renewable technology â to generate electricity
