a tiny oil painting that was kept in an attic for years and thought to be worth just Â£ 300 has now sold for more than Â£ 120,000 at auction
the oil painting - which measures nine inches by seven - of a catholic saint was believed to be the work of a ' follower ' of 16th century renaissance master el greco
but the selling price suggests the untitled , undated and unsigned painting may actually have been done by the artist himself
auctioneer bromell ( pictured ) gave the tiny painting an estimated value of about Â£ 300 to Â£ 400 but it ended up selling for more than Â£ 120,000 it was acquired by the owner 's late father in the 1970s for very little
auctioneer bromell , of charterhouse auctioneers of sherborne , dorset , gave the work an estimated value of between Â£ 300 and Â£ 400
but after advertising the sale , interest in the work took off
and feverish bidding , final hammer price was Â£ 98,000 and came to Â£ 120,932 with all the fees added on
