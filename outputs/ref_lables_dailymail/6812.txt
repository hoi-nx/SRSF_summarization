now new research revealed that male and female stegosaurus had different shaped plates running along their backs
it raises the prospect that the dinosaurs used its giant bony protrusions , which could reach up to 2.5 feet , to attract a mate
scientists have found that male stegosaurus ( top ) had different shaped armoured plates to females ( bottom ) palaeontologists say male stegosaurus could have used them to show off their prowess in much the same way as peacocks do today
the research has also helped to answer a problem that has baffled palaeontologists for decades
a pair of turkey - sized â egg thief lizards â dubbed romeo and juliet were found lying next to each other in a 75 - million - year - old rock in the mid- 90s , but it has taken until now for experts to determine the sex of the ' lovers '
now , researchers believe they have come up with a way to tell fossils of small feathered male dinosaurs from those of females
paleontologistsat the university of alberta examined a pair of fossils found in mongolia , which were first described in 2001
some stegosaurus individuals have been found with wide plates while others had tall plates with a sharper tip that were 45 per cent smaller
experts believed that these may have been two distinct species or individuals of a different age
they found dinosaurs that had both sets of plates in the graveyard , suggesting they lived side - by - side
the research team believe that the males may have had the larger , broader plates for use in mating displays while the females had the sharper taller plates , that may have helped to discourage unwanted attention or predators
' these broad plates would have provided a great display surface to attract mates
stegosaurus ( above ) lived around 150 million years ago but scientists have been baffled by differences between the shape of the plates on some fossils - leading some to believe they were different species the new research on the armoured plates may help scientists determine whether ' sophie ' , the stegosaurus at the natural history museum in london pictured above , really is a female or if it was in fact a male dinosaur some dinosaur experts have speculated that the bony plates may have been covered in skin filled with blood vessels so they could flush with colour
