there ca n't always be a tv camera rolling when the big news happens - and snl has taken network news to task for how they paper over the cracks
the nbc sketch show parodied the daytime cnn , which turned into a series of let - downs when it emerged there was no footage for the stories they were covering
above was ' their impression ' of what the doomed pilot of the crashed germanwings jet may have looked like trying to get into the cockpit real thing : above is an actual animation cnn aired to illustrate the pilot not being able to get back in an informative graphic of a man opening a door , and a producer 's image of what the doomed pilot going to the bathroom may have looked like graced the screens , mocking their coverage of the tragedy
' the problems continued when cnn was unable to get a fly - on - the - wall view of iran 's nuclear negotiations - and went for a puppet show instead
bobby moynihan , playing a reporter on the ground , explained by saying : ' we could n't get any footage from the actual negotiations - but once again cnn has the next best thing '
' next best thing ' : for its next story , cnn had no footage of the iran nuclear animations , so went with muppets - style puppets absurd : the network was imagined providing imagery for coverage of indiana 's religious freedom law through the medium of interpretative dance viewers were confronted with four muppets - style puppets , including one representing john kerry
the theater of the absurd peaked when the network admitted it had n't bothered to send anybody to indiana to cover the controversial religious freedom law there - so demonstrated with an interpretative dance instead
brenna williams , an associate producer at the network , said in response to the iran sketch : ' do n't be surprised if i pitch a puppet politics piece on monday ' however , one high - profile dissenter was donald trump , who called laughing at the air disaster ' disgusting '
