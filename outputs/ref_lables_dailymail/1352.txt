fashion - conscious militants fighting for the islamic state in syria have been dealt a blow after their commanders banned them wearing products made by nike
banned : the sports brand features prominently ( circled ) on a leaflet distributed in the terror group 's de facto capital raqqa warning isis jihadis about items of clothing they are no longer allowed to wear not allowed : the leaflet threatens both the buyer and seller of nike products with punishments ranging from a small fine to whipping or even imprisonmen images of the leaflet banning nike clothing was shared online by the activist group raqqa is being slaughtered silently who translated it from arabic
they said nike was singled out because of its associations with the greek goddess of the same name and because the word apparently sounds similar to phrases of a sexual nature in arabic
fashion - conscious : the ban comes despite the fact one of the group 's most famous commanders , abu waheeb , is well known for wearing western sportswear , including items made by nike and adidas the wearing of nike products has long been contentious among isis jihadis , due to the fact the name was inspired by a greek goddess and reportedly sound like several words of a sexual nature in arabic the news comes shortly after one militant decried the popularity of nike among isis fighters , comparing the brand 's famous ' tick ' logo to wearing a christian cross
his comments prompted a fierce debate with fellow jihadis who argued that it was perfectly acceptable to wear nike products because they are ' comfortable ' a recent ban of men wearing jeans - apparently because the clothing ' provokes sexual desire , and shows the attractions of men 's body ' - has been strictly enforced
to help non-english speakers recognise the banned terms , the isis leaflet helpfully provides a long list of swear words alongside their arabic translation
