earlier this month the tracksuit tycoon ashley agreed to buy a plot of land in chelsea from the retailer john lewis for somewhere in the region of Â£ 200million
in five years , when the operation to build the properties is concluded and they have been sold to high - end buyers , ashley will add something in the region of another Â£ 1bn to his net worth
there have been empty seats at st james â park recently as fans let their feelings about ashley be known the weekend defeat by swansea was a seventh straight premier league loss for the magpies toon keeper tim krul had to pick the ball out of his net three times against swansea ashley looks after the money , obsessing over the finances at his business empire , which includes sportsdirect , tesco and his football club in the north east
the biggest motivation in ashley âs life is to make money , something reflected in newcastle united âs latest accounts , which are showing another decent profit and Â£ 34m in the bank
the money men at newcastle united are already aware that the team could play in an empty stadium when the new television deals crystallise at the start of the 2016 - 17 season and still turn a profit based on current income and expenditure
ashley , the club âs owner , does not appear to be listening
he is not a football man , certainly not in the same way as the increasing number of disillusioned supporters at st james â park
ashley ( right ) has never been mr popular at st james â park but the protests have been ramped up recently a fan appeared to have a go at interim manager carver during the latest loss at st james â park the view from the bench has n't been pretty for carver and the newcastle united staff during the last few weeks he should address it because his ability to make money should be one of his most powerful weapons at newcastle united
â so what is so wrong with that , especially when the owner of the club still has an interest - free loan of Â£ 129m marked in the latest newcastle united accounts ? it is the job of newcastle united âs chief scout graham carr , along with his staff , to identify and recruit the players who can improve this team
newcastle united fans held a protest urging fellow supporters to ' show ashley the red card ' they responded by recruiting dusan tadic , graziano pelle , fraser forster , florin gardos , shane long and sadio mane for an outlay of around Â£ 56m
they are a fine example to the teams outside the top four because southampton ( with an annual income of Â£ 90m ) , swansea ( Â£ 84m ) and newcastle united ( Â£ 110m ) can not compete on the same financial terms
swansea , who beat newcastle united 3 - 2 last saturday , have also had a recent change in management after promoting garry monk
toon fans held up the cards during the latest protest against owner ashley even with the loss of wilfried bony , sold to manchester city for Â£ 28m in january , they are on course for a top - eight finish because of their own financial prudence and some smart recruitment
