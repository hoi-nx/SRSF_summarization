v.stiviano , the alleged mistress of clippers owner donald , who he showered with expensive gifts , has been ordered to pay his wife $ 2.6million
lawyers for donald had claimed that money used to buy stiviano a house , luxury cars and stocks was her community property the couple had acquired over six decades of marriage
stiviano 's lawyer had argued that the gifts were made when donald and shelly were separated and that shelly could n't seek them from a third party
in the recordings on stiviano 's iphone , she and the 80 - year - old billionaire are heard discussing how to shield gifts from his wife
donald testified that he paid for the entire house , though stiviano said she had contributed an unknown amount of money given to her in small bills by family members that she saved in a bedroom drawer
during the course of their 2 1/2 years together , donald had given stiviano a ferrari , a bentley and a range rover , and paid the lion 's share of a $ 1.8 million duplex donald said stiviano had n't contributed ' 50 cents ' to the house and , noting that stiviano is part black and hispanic , said she illegally got her name inserted into escrow documents by befriending hispanic bank and escrow employees
shelly filed the suit against stiviano about a month before the recording of donald telling stiviano not to associate with black people created an uproar and led the nba to ban him for life and fine him $ 2.5 million
in closing arguments , late last month , shelly 's lawyer had relied on the words of miss stiviano to show that the elderly billionaire was her sugar daddy
testimony in los angeles superior court was n't as clear - cut even after donald 's lawyers went to great lengths to show that checks donald drew from his real estate business ended up in accounts that financed most of stiviano 's $ 1.8 million spanish - style duplex near beverly hills
while an accountant for sterling conservatively estimated that stiviano got more than $ 3.6 million in sterling gifts that included a ferrari and paris shopping spree , pierce o'donnell said he would only seek return of the house and more than $ 1 million in cash , saying the lower figure lined up with stiviano 's own admissions on the witness stand , depositions and court filings
stiviano , 32 , pictured arriving at los angeles superior court last month , painted two conflicting portraits of donald , saying he was a kind , generous mentor and father figure to her but also a ' bigot ' who was mean to others judge richard fruin jr had noted earlier that there was no clear documentation that funds went from the donald family 's real estate company to stiviano 's bank accounts
it was stiviano who recorded the now - infamous conversation with donald in which he berated her for associating with black people and urged her not to bring minorities with her to clippers basketball games
in the furor sparked when the remarks were made public , the nba banned donald from the league for life , and he was ultimately forced to sell the clippers franchise he had owned for 33 years for a record $ 2 billion
shelly , who accused stiviano of fraud when she testified , painted her rival as a gold digger who seduced her husband into lavishing her with money and gifts and was now out to hurt him
wife speaks : shelly , estranged wife of former clippers basketball team owner donald , and her attorney pierce o'donnell arrive at los angeles superior court last month
mrs shelly painted stiviano as a gold digger who seduced her husband into giving her cash and gifts stiviano , seen here outside the court during last month 's trial , testified that tolerating sterling 's racist moments was ' part of the job ' platonic relationship : the 32 - year - old repeatedly stated under oath that her relationship with the clippers owner nearly five decades her senior was spiritual in nature stiviano never not disputed donald 's largesse , though she quibbled with the sums at stake and emphatically denied that she used sex to manipulate him
the apparent contradictions finally led shelly 's lawyer , pierce o'donnell , to confront stiviano with the question : ' who is the real donald ? ' ' the real donald is a con artist , a bigot ... he 's mean , he 's despicable , ' stiviano replied , before quickly adding that to her , he was ' kind , loving , sweet ... a mentor , a father
the judge allowed the testimony as stiviano 's lawyer tried to show where large , unexplained checks may have gone from donald 's real estate company that his wife claims were used to pay for a $ 1.8million duplex , luxury cars , jewelry and shopping sprees for the woman shelly asserts was his mistress
