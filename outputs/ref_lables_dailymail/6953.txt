nbc news has changed its account of how chief foreign correspondent richard engel was kidnapped in syria , saying he was now most likely taken by sunni rebels who tried to convince their victims they were government militants
the broadcaster had previously reported that the 2012 kidnapping of mr richard engel , which saw him held for five days and expecting to be killed , was carried out by forces associated with president bashar al-assad
but mr richard engel has revealed that following analysis of his kidnapping it is likely the men that took him were in fact a sunni group who had tried to convince their victims that they were shi - ite rebels affiliated to the government
' this , of course , does not make our kidnappers or the five days they held us at gunpoint any less dangerous
the new york times claimed that nbc news executives were informed of the suspicions about the kidnappers ' identities during and after mr richard engel was taken
mr richard engel was convinced by his captors that he had been taken and held by government affiliated forces but immediately after his release mr richard engel appeared on today and in a vanity fair interview claiming he had been taken by the shabiha group , government militia loyal to president bashar al-assad
he made these assertions based on what he had been told by his captors , which included that they had been rescued by sunni rebels
the paper claimed that when the captors realised other rebels were trying to free the victims they had actually staged a rescue so they could blame the kidnapping on the bashar al-assad regime
richard engel and his crew , including producers ghazi balkiz and aziz akyavas , as well as cameraman john kooistra , were taken hostage on december 13 , 2012 , while reporting in syria
the foreign correspondent said they had met a man who had claimed he was a syria rebel commander who had promised to take them across the border to see iranian and lebanese prisoners being held by rebels
richard engel and his crew were believed to have been taken near ma - arrat misrin , and were pictured in captivity with arabic sprayed on the wall behind them
â a statement published by nbc news said it was clear that the group were released for propaganda purposes during the five days they were held mr richard engel reported apparently hearing one of the rebels they were with being shot , and constantly being subjected to the sounds of guns being loaded - believing each day was his last
