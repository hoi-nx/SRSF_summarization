but barden has the heartbreaking task of arranging both her daughters ' funerals , knowing that neither will make adulthood because of an incredibly rare illness
mrs barden , 28 , is mother to eight - year - old ella and one - year - old chloe , who both suffer from cockayne syndrome and have a life expectancy of just 12
cockayne syndrome is a rare genetic disorder , which is characterised by a failure to gain weight , premature ageing , an underdeveloped nervous system and a small head
she is pictured here with daughter ella , who ages prematurely due to the syndrome sufferers usually do n't live to see their teenage years and usually die from pneumonia
given her children 's prognosis , mrs barden has already made arrangements for both daughters ' funerals with her husband , luke , who is also 28
the former graphic designer , who is now the girls ' full - time carer , said : ' there 's no cure for what they have and there 's not much the doctors can say , so we just try and keep them comfortable while they 're with us
ella currently has a tremor , which makes drinking from a beaker difficult , and she only says words like ' yes ' and ' juice '
chloe is n't walking yet and probably wo n't ever reach this milestone
but while they can not speak , mrs barden said they do not fail to communicate their desires through gesturing

however , some rare cockayne syndrome patients live significantly longer

' i was pregnant with chloe at the time and that 's when we found out she would be born with the same disease

now , she and her husband are trying to make the most of the time they have with their daughters , as well as their four - year - old son alex , who does not suffer from the disease
mrs barden said her son is ' fantastic ' with his sisters
