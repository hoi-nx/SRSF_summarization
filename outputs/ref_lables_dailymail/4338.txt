iran supreme leader ayatollah ayatollah khamenei on thursday demanded that all sanctions on iran be lifted at the same time as any final agreement with world powers on curbing tehran 's nuclear program is reached
' the state department on thursday repeated its position that sanctions against iran would be removed gradually
' under the agreed - upon parameters , sanctions will be suspended in a phased manner upon verification that iran has met specific commitments , ' state department spokesman jeff rathke said during a daily press briefing
' state department spokesman jeff rathke held firm , saying ' sanctions will be suspended in a phased manner upon verification that iran has met specific commitments ' one of those statements , from ayatollah khamenei , accused the white house of misleading the world with its claims of what was in the framework agreed to in switzerland
' americans put out a statement just a few hours after our negotiators finished their talks ... this statement , which they called a " fact sheet , " was wrong on most of the issues , ' ayatollah khamenei said during his speech
' in the americans , omri ceren , press director at the israel project , told daily mail online that tehran has a good chance of winning a tug - of - war over what secretary of state kerry and his iran counterpart javad zarif actually agreed to
' the iran have a 100 per cent record of forcing the americans to bow to their interpretation whenever there 's a dispute over iran concessions publicly declared by the obama administration , including and specifically on fact sheets , ' ceren said thurdsay
' we are also concerned the obama administration is so desperate for a nuclear deal , that washington will give more concessions to tehran , ' he added
' secretary of state kerry played a major role in nuclear negotiations that some observers now say are unraveling quickly ayatollah khamenei claimed thursday that the white house had lied about the substance of talks in switzerland another area in which the parties seem to disagree is the question of monitoring and access to iran 's nuclear sites
while kerry and obama have emphasized expectations that iran will let iaea inspectors tour and inspect their facilities at any time , ayatollah khamenei threw cold water on the idea
ali alfoneh of the foundation for defense of democracies said his group is ' concerned the obama administration is so desperate for a nuclear deal , that washington will give more concessions to tehran ' ' no such agreement has been made , ' dehquan said
' ayatollah khamenei and hassan rouhani spoke during a ceremony on thursday marking iran 's national day of nuclear technology
' our goal in the talks is to preserve our nation 's nuclear rights , ' hassan rouhani said
' the iran nation has been and will be the victor in the negotiations
' the americans and eu sanctions have choked off nearly 1.5 million barrels of iran exports per day since early 2012 , reducing its daily oil exports by 60 percent to around 1 million barrels
negotiators from iran , the americans , germany , france , britain , russia and china will resume negotiations in the coming days to pave the way for a final deal
since relations with washington collapsed after iran 's 1979 islamic revolution , enmity towards the americans has always been a rallying point for iran hardliners
' i was never optimistic about negotiating with americans ... nonetheless i agreed to the negotiations and supported , and still support , the negotiators , ' ayatollah khamenei said , ' i support a deal that preserves the interests and honor of iran
israeli defense official amos gilad predicted that when iran sanctions are dropped , ' they will get rich ' and ' will have the power to support the entire network of missiles and rockets ' ayatollah khamenei is now saying no foreign inspectors , including those from the iaea , will be allowed to tour the military facilities where iran 's nuclear operations are housed ayatollah khamenei ruled out any ' extraordinary supervision measures ' over iran 's nuclear activities
' iran 's military sites can not be inspected under the excuse of nuclear supervision , ' he said
france , which has demanded more stringent conditions on iran , said the comments by the iran leadership showed that reaching a final deal would be difficult and that in any case there would need to be a mechanism in place to restore sanctions if tehran violated its commitments
