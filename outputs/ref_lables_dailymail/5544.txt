planners in windsor have allowed two costa cafes less than 500 yards apart coffee addicts in windsor wo n't have to go far for a fix â after planners in the royal borough allowed two costa shops less than 500 yards apart
less than 500 yards away is a costa which replaced a cycle shop earlier this year
one resident , samantha taylor , wrote online : ' i think it 's mad and i wish our local councils could see that we are drowning in fast food and coffee shops in windsor
' surely places like costa coming in rather than another fast - food shop or betting shop - there will soon be three within a mile - is that a sign that this part of windsor is on the up ? ' costa 's planning application says the new shop would be a ' significant driver to local trade '
