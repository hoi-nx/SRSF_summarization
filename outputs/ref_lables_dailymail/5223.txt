politicians who begged scottish to stay in the union should not complain if the snp calls the shots at westminster after the election , sturgeon said last night
polling last night showed that the nationalists are extending their lead â threatening to all but wipe out labour north of the border
but ed miliband yesterday refused four times to rule out going into a power - sharing agreement with the snp if its mps hold the balance of power for the first time
while he has rejected a formal coalition he did not address questions as to whether he was prepared to go into downing street propped up by miss sturgeon on a â vote - by - vote basis â
the snp leader used a bbc tv debate on thursday night to offer to â lock cameron out of downing street â â even if labour has fewer seats than the tory in a hung parliament
sturgeon dominated the so - called â challengers â debate â on thursday and her party is threatening to all but wipe out labour north of the border â it âs completely unacceptable now for those politicians to say , when scottish is perhaps going to make its view heard by voting snp , to say your voice ca nât be heard in the british
â ed miliband knows as well as i know that if there is an anti-tory majority after the election , then the only way cameron gets back into downing street is if ed miliband is prepared to stand back and let him back in downing street , â miss sturgeon told sky news
cameron warned last night that voters across the british would face higher taxes to fund profligate public spending if labour does a deal with the snp
the prime minister said mr ed miliband must â level with the british people â and admit that his â only route into number 10 â is with the support of the snp
â miss sturgeon âs predecessor as scottish first minister , alex salmond , who is bidding to return to the commons , suggested that an snp deal with a minority labour government was â probable â
