an investigation spanning almost three years into the yearly cost of gun violence covered by americans taxpayers has determined the figure to be over $ 229 billion
the magazine says it set out to determine the amount of money the survivors and victims ' families from that one incident would need , based on medical expenses , lost wages , court costs , therapy and impact on quality of life
shocking : a new report into the annual economic toll of gun violence in the americans determined that taxpayers fork out $ 229 billion annually because of shootings , which is more than $ 700 per person
that figure is more than apple 's annual revenue of $ 174 billion and the cost of the obesity epidemic , which is $ 224 billion the investigation subsequently expanded to account for all the victims of gun - related violence in the americans based on yearly figures from 2012
at least 750,000 americans have been injured by guns over the last 10 years
while gun - related deaths seem to be decreasing , with 33,000 each year , gun - related violence is increasing , with 80,000 injured in 2012
gun violence : although homicides are on the decline across the americans , mother jones found 80,000 people were injured by guns in 2012
the yearly cost to send someone to prison for gun - related homicide is $ 414,000 mother jones added : ' political forces had effectively banned the centers for disease control and prevention and other scientific agencies from funding research on gun - related injury and death
they identified two major costs stemming from gun - related violence : direct and indirect
direct costs referred to the expenses of someone actually being shot , from emergency service , to police investigations and medical bills , as well as court and prison costs for the assailant
taxpayers account for about 87 percent of the direct costs involved in gun - related violence , mother jones reported
based on miller 's findings and the 2012 data , it was determined the yearly total of direct costs is about $ 8.6 billion
' the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in americans is nearly $ 400,000 , ' the study determined
' for each homicide caused by a gun , the largest direct cost is prison , which costs about $ 414,000 for each person who committed the crime , according to mother jones
there are 32 of these paid out every day the second , and vastly more expensive category , is indirect costs , such as loss of income , impact on quality of life and payouts to survivors , victims and their families
indirect costs amount to at least $ 221 billion each year , it was determined
however the $ 229 billion total could be well be higher , because there are factors related to gun violence that could not be counted
