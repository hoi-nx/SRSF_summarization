an explorer who plans to spend a year living inside a ball - shaped capsule on top of an iceberg is seeking funding for his daring project
italian alex bellini is to be subjected to the full force of the iceberg as it melts , cracks and even flips - while hopefully staying safe inside his small spherical cabin
he will live inside a contained ball ( artist 's illustration shown ) , with no means to escape for 12 months
the capsule will be 10ft ( three metres ) wide and could fit 10 people - but mr alex bellini will remove all of the seats apart from one , for himself mr alex bellini , 36 , is seeking funding for his project , called adrift , which he hopes to begin in november 2016
mr alex bellini will use one at the upper scale , 10ft ( three metres ) wide - although he âll remove all the seats except one for himself
inside he âll have exercise equipment , such as a stationary bike , in addition to supplies for the year such as food and water
but his latest venture represents a whole new challenge as he will have to deal with intense isolation and undergo serious psychological tests as he copes with being alone for 12 months
perched on top of an iceberg in north west greenland , he will be alone and unable to leave the capsule , leaving him vulnerable to whatever is in store - on the iceberg , or in his cabin
comparable feats of endurance , such as the solar impulse mission , have also seen people remain in isolation for days , but mr alex bellini will have to cope for a whole 365 by himself

mr alex bellini âs plan is to place his capsule on top of an iceberg and stay there but , if the iceberg were to flip , he could quite suddenly find his capsule thrown into the air
mr alex bellini âs plan is to place his capsule on top of an iceberg and stay there but , if the iceberg were to flip , he could quite suddenly find his capsule thrown into the air the interior of the capsule may be placed on roller balls to alleviate some of the sudden movements if the iceberg flips , but mr alex bellini also plans to use sensors to detect tremors in the iceberg , suggesting it might be about to flip , so he can get himself into a safe bracing position and as it melts , it âs also possible the capsule could fall down a crack , or find itself encased under thousands of tons of ice
in case he does become stuck somewhere , mr alex bellini will have a beacon on board so rescuers can locate him , while the capsule will also be equipped with wi-fi , a wind generator and solar panels
despite the hardships , mr alex bellini feels there is an important goal - bringing the issues of global warming and climate change to people âs attention
