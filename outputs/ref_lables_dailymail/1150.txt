it was a vision that apparently led the biblical paul the apostle to become one of the most influential figures in early christianity by helping to spread the religion around the world
but now astronomers believe the bright light in the sky that triggered the conversion of paul the apostle may have actually been a falling meteor 2,000 years ago
they say descriptions of paul the apostle 's experience - in which he was blinded for three days after seeing a bright light - match accounts of the fireball that streaked across the sky above chelyabinsk in russia in 2013
paul the apostle was blinded for three days and he heard a divine voice or sound
the experience apparently so affected paul the apostle that he converted to christianity and undertook several influential missions to spread the word of christ around the mediterranean
many believe paul the apostle 's preaching led to the rise of much of the theology and traditions in the roman and protestant faith strands that exist today
however , some have attempted to explain paul the apostle 's vision as being the result of some kind of seizure or of sunstroke
dr hartmann , however , says the description of the light in the sky , the thunderous sound and the temporary blindness all match the events of a meteorite
he said that the bright light in the sky - which was ' brighter than the sun , shining round me ' - matches videos of the chelyabinsk meteor , which was estimated to be three times as bright as the sun. its movement across the sky created fast moving shadows that would have given the impression of the light moving around paul the apostle
the meteorite that streaked across the sky above chelyabinsk in russia ( above ) created a bright light and noise that may have been similar to those experienced by paul the apostle in 30 ad , claims astronomer the shockwave caused by exploding meterorite over chelyabinsk shattered windows and apparently caused the roof of this zinc factory in the city to collapse
100 people were injured by flying glass from the blast dr hartmann says that the shockwave created by an exploding meteor could also have been responsible for knocking paul the apostle and his companions to the ground after the light
the fireball that above chelyabinsk ( above ) was captured by a number of dashboard cameras in cars paul the apostle 's temporary blindness could also have been caused by the intense ultraviolet radiation from the meteor - creating a condition called photokeratitis
dr hartmann said : ' among the most impressive , unexpected consistencies with modern knowledge is the first - century description of symptoms of temporary blindness caused by exposure to intense radiation , matching a condition now known as photokeratitis
' in chelyabinsk the radiation given off by the meteor was strong enough to cause sunburn and some temporary blindness
' the 20 - ft - wide hole in the ice of a frozen lake was created by the falling fragments of the chelyabinsk meteor he added that unfamiliar natural phenomena like an exploding meteor are often interpreted in the context of ' current cultural conceptions '
even if his theory does prove to be correct , others say that it is unlikely that christianity would not have spread if paul the apostle had not encountered the meteor
