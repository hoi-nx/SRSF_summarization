justin rose will try to take a leaf out of rory 's book after kickstarting his season with his share of second place in the masters
rose arrived at augusta having missed the cut in three of his previous five tournaments on the pga , but left with renewed enthusiasm and a 14 - under - par total which has only been bettered six times in masters history
it 's a good momentum starter for me , ' said rose , who was looking to become the first european player to win the open and masters 2015
justin rose was unable to take victory at the masters , despite carding 14 - under - par for the tournament rose believes that his finish of second at augusta can boost his season with some big events ahead rose wants to follow the lead of rory , who had a relentless winning streak in the summer of 2014 ' i tried to really tell myself that this year for me is going to be about april to september when the big tournaments come around and that 's when i want to play well
' rose began the final round four shots behind spieth and closed to within three on three separate occasions on the front nine , but was never able to get any closer
you can think that 14 under par , i 'll take that next year and i 'll take that the year after and i 'll take it the year after , so i have to take a lot of confidence from that , ' he added
rose had struggled to hit top form going into the masters but now hopes to sustain his augusta form rose ( left ) congratulates tournament winner spieth and praised his performance level for the week ' but you 've got to play it on the day , too
i felt that if i make my birdie putt and jordan misses for par , it 's a two - shot swing and i 'm two back with two to play
