computers may soon be able to transmit the complexities of human personalities , the stanford university professor who originally set up google 's x laboratory has claimed
sebastian thrun , who founded the google x laboratory where the internet search giant has developed google glass and driverless cars , said it was often difficult to grasp concepts before they come to fruition
' maybe we 're going to have a demo at some point where the computer runs ' sebastian thrun , '' he told a symposium thursday evening at stanford university
it 's very doable , ' said the german - born computer scientist , who remains a fellow at google
other upcoming inventions predicted by sebastian thrun include flying cars , computers that are implantable into the human body , and medical treatments that will drastically curb unnatural deaths
sebastian thrun was speaking as part of events to mark the premiere of ' the demo , ' an experimental opera about the 1968 data transmission test by scientist doug engelbart that helped pave the way for the creation of the internet

google has already developed a system to allow robots to download new personalities online
the patent says that the personality could replicate the robot 's owner , ' a deceased loved one , ' or ' a celebrity , ' google 's patent details a cloud - based system where a personality could be downloaded to a robot , in the same way one might download an app. ' the robot personality may also be modifiable within a base personality construct ( i.e. , a default - persona ) to provide states or moods representing transitory conditions of happiness , fear , surprise , perplexion ( e.g. , the woody allen robot ) , thoughtfulness , derision ( e.g. , the rodney dangerfield robot ) , and so forth , ' states the patent

google 's patent drawings reveal the system can share personalities and download them ' in particular , but without limitation , the disclosure provides for a robot that operates with personality attributes and related capabilities drawn from cloud computing capacities
' google already owns several firms developing robotic technology , including atlas , 6.2 feet of metal with a plastic body that can walk , run , jump and even open doors
this is latest version of the atlas robot created by boston dynamics , a google - owned robot firm
it demonstrates strong balancing skills and composure and showcases the agility of the google - owned machine , said the firm
