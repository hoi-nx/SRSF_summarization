for more than 2,000 years , invaders have been fighting over glorious kefalonia
so instead of fast - food restaurants you will find charming family - run tavernas that make this island a foodie heaven
the famous curve of myrtos beach , as well as many little inland villages , are seen on the road to fiscardo inland , the roads , winding around mountains whose accessible slopes are swathed in olive groves and vineyards are blessedly free of excessive traffic
we landed at the island 's only airport near the capital town of argostoli , took a five - minute walk to the car - rental office and were quickly on our way to the village of spartia on the southern coast - our first base of a two - centre holiday
richard johnson rejoices in unspoiled kefalonia we were staying first at the superb villa hephaestus
the sweep of lourdas bay , with its long sandy beaches , was spread out below us , while the neighbouring island of zakynthos could be seen in the misty distance
the proprietor is a local fisherman , so the best of his catch goes to the kitchen , which is presided over by his wife , while his charming daughter tepsi is in charge of front of house
from lourdas bay you can see zakynthos island , where the beautiful shipwreck beach ( pictured ) is found a sweeping view across the turquoise waters of lourdata bay and the white stands of lourdas beach the island is replete with diverse things to see on day trips but the nightlife is virtually non-existent , so we decided to stay home in the evenings and explore during the day
we checked out the string of beaches around lourdas bay and found plenty of good restaurants
at the top of a flight of easy steps from lourdas bay beach , we found lorraine 's magic hill restaurant , with superb food lovingly prepared by the eponymous owner with ingredients from her husband 's organic farm
the portions are generous and there 's a great view across the bay to fellow ionian isle zakynthos
the popular golden skala beach is just at the end of the bay with the nearby metaxa beach bar good for coffee the town of argostoli 's port is ideal for picking up supplies , including catch - of - the - night fish from the boats enjoyable excursions to the countryside took us to the ruined hilltop castle of st george , near peratata , and the monastery of st ayos
the monastery of saint geronimo is situated in a vine - clad valley north - east of the castle
we loved our stay in the south , but for the second week of our stay it was time to take the 35 - mile drive to fiscardo , on the island 's north cape
fiscardo , once a remote fishing port , has been transformed into a world - class yachting centre , with smart restaurants and boutiques jostling for every inch of the quayside
the second week of our stay was a 35 - mile drive away in the fishing village of fiscardo , in the island 's north ' it 's like st tropez in the old days , ' i mused
we found some attractive beaches a few minutes ' drive from fiscardo
apart from one afternoon of rain ( we were on a boat trip to lefkas but 30 minutes out of fiscardo , an unexpected squall hit us and it rained for the remainder of the trip ) , the weather was perfect
