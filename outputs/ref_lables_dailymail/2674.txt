it is almost 70 years since he fled the violence that followed the partition of india , and he is still regarded as a second class citizen in india kashmir â unable to own property or vote in state elections
but now ram and thousands like him are daring to hope they will finally be able to shed the refugee status that has plagued them for decades , after prime minister narendra modi 's hindu nationalist party won a share of power in india 's only muslim - majority state
ram was 14 when he fled to kashmir as a refugee - now an old man , for the past 70 years he has been denied citizenship rights a hindu , traditional healer ram lives a slum house within india 's only muslim - majority state
its rulers have refused to give the wpr ( wprs ) the right to own property or vote in state elections - meaning three generations are caught in abject poverty â if something can be done , then maybe i will finally have some enjoyment in this life , â the traditional healer said from his slum home on the outskirts of jammu region , kashmir 's winter capital
â ram , a hindu , was born in an area of punjab province , part of modern - day west pakistan but within india âs boundaries before the country became independent in 1947
around one million people were killed in the bloody war between the two countries ram , aged 82 , with the success of prime minister narendra modi 's hindu nationalist party at a recent state vote , he says he is hopeful change will come for the west pakistan refugees : ' if something can be done , then maybe i will finally have some enjoyment in this life ' around 100,000 people are classified as refugees - despite most of them never visiting west pakistan , and living in the jammu region region of india most of those refugees were quickly absorbed in towns and cities of the newly - independent nations
however the fate of the wpr ( wprs ) like ram who decamped to jammu region and kashmir state became mired in the dispute with west pakistan over the territory

the area has evolved into one of the many slum settlements in hind - dominated areas of the city region of jammu region , within india 's only muslim - majority state generations of families have become stuck in poverty because of their continuing refugee status
successive governments have failed to act to due , say commentators , to a fear of upsetting the demographic balance of the state between the muslim and hindu populations the wprs , whose families mainly originate from punjab , have fallen foul of a pre-independence law that only grants citizenship to people born - or descendants of those born - in the old undivided kingdom of kashmir
the same legislation has allowed around 35,000 hindu who have fled west pakistan - controlled kashmir since partition to be granted citizenship
