after his grandfather passed away when he was just 12 - years - old , cordina resigned himself to the fact that his beloved wwii medals were gone forever
after searching far and wide for two years , the 36 - year - old amazingly found the medals in the nt and drove over 3500 kilometres in four days to be reunited with the family treasures
but on his arrival at the darwin , mr cordina was refused the medals and told that they ' were more important to the museum
' medals include an airforce cross , war medal 39-45 star , a queen elizabeth ii coronation medal and others cordina ( pictured here with his son zac ) drove for four days to find his grandfather 's medals ' i searched for years and really thought they were lost forever , ' mr cordina told daily mail australia
' mr cordina then began a national search and found clues that brought him to darwin after two years of searching
captain slade was a flight lieutenant in wwii and received many distinguished service medals he has received of 15,000 signatures in under 24 hours and is overwhelmed by the public 's support
the medals for mr slade 's service included the distinguished airforce cross , an order of the british empire , a war medal 39-45 star , a queen elizabeth ii coronation medal among various others
but mr cordina 's biggest regret is that his ill mother will not get to see her father 's medals again
the donor was mr slade 's wife , mel slade , who has also since passed away
mr cordina said he never knew about the will as his family did not have a relationship with mr slade 's second wife
' i only found out about this last night as it was never mentioned to me , not even my emailing back and forth with the museum , ' mr cordina said
' mr cordina is still hoping for the museum to override the board 's decision
