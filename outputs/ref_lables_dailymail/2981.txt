encounters with common dolphins off the west of scotland have more than doubled over a decade , according to experts
common dolphins were once a rare sight in the hebrides , preferring warmer waters found further south , leading experts to believe that global warming has led to pods moving north
encounters with common dolphins ( a stock image is shown ) off the west of scotland have more than doubled over a decade , according to a leading research body
monitoring by hebridean whale and dolphin trust teams has seen the number of encounters increase by 68 per cent over the past 12 years monitoring by hebridean whale and dolphin trust teams has seen the number of encounters with common dolphins increase by 68 per cent over the past 12 years
the dolphins come to the hebrides in spring to take advantage of seasonal food stocks , travelling in large groups and sometimes forming â super-pods â of thousands of individuals
while they were once drawn to warmer waters above 10 Â° c south of the area , climate change is causing sea surface temperatures in the hebrides to rise by around 0.5 Â° c a decade
and warmer water species appear to be colonising new areas further north or closer to shore , the trust said
while the shift could create new feeding opportunities for the common dolphins , it could increase competition between other types of dolphin or seabirds
an oystercatcher on the isle of mull is shown the shift north could be creating new opportunities for the common dolphins to find food in new areas , but may mean the species is competing for fish with other types of dolphin or seabirds
dr conor ryan , sightings and strandings officer at hebridean whale and dolphin trust said : â an increase in common dolphins means that those wishing to encounter dolphins in the wild are in luck - but further research is needed to explain why this is happening , the extent to which it has been caused by human activity and the implications for other cetacean species
