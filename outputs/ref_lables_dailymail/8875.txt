now , researchers have created a special robo - explorer to borrow into the ice and record the first footage of what lies on the seabed below the ross ice shelf
the icefin was deployed ( and retrieved ) the vehicle through a 12 - inch diameter hole through 20 meters of ice and another 500 meters of water to the sea floor
a first - of - its - kind robotic vehicle recently dove to depths never before visited under antartica 's ross ice shelf and brought back video of life on the seafloor
' we built a vehicle that 's a hybrid between the really small probes and the ocean - going vessels , and we can deploy it through bore holes on antartica , ' said schmidt , an assistant professor in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences at the georgia tech. , and the principle investigator for the icefin project
the technologies developed for icefin will also help in the search for life on other planets , namely europa , a moon of jupiter
' at the same time , we 're advancing hypotheses that we need for europa and understanding ocean systems here better
' we 're also developing and getting comfortable with technologies that make polar science -- and eventually europa science - more realistic
' the robotic vehicle carried a scientific payload capable of measuring ocean conditions under the ice
icefin 's readings of the environment under antartica 's ice shelves , and video of the life that thrives in these harsh conditions , will help understand how antartica 's ice shelves are changing under warming conditions , and to understand how organisms thrive in cold and light - free environments

the icefin was deployed ( and retrieved ) the vehicle through a 12 - inch diameter hole through 20 meters of ice ( pictured ) and another 500 meters of water to the sea floor
' our vehicle has instrumentation aboard both for navigation and ocean science that other vehicles do not
' we saw evidence of a complex community on the sea floor that has never been observed before , and unprecedented detail on the ice - ocean interface that has n't been achieved before , ' schmidt said
video captured by icefin shows eerie footage of an active seafloor 500 meters under the ross ice shelf
' biologists at mcmurdo were just amazed at the amount of biology at that location which included sea stars , sponges and anemones that were at the ocean bottom , ' west said
' to have our very first deep - ocean dive happen through a small hole in the ice and go all the way to the ocean bottom and get the video we did was pretty amazing
bore holes are often drilled on antartica for ocean moorings and sediment sampling
' those are important processes that we can work out here in our backyard at the same time as we 're answering how an ice shell would reflect the ocean chemistry on europa , ' schmidt said
