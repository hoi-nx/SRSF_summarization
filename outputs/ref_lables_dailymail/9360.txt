hamilton 's love of the shanghai continues to show no bounds as the reigning formula one champion again claimed pole position for the race
the 30 - year - old briton ultimately finished just 0.042secs ahead of his mercedes team - mate nico rosberg to give the team another front - row lock out
ferrari 's sebastian vettel , a surprise winner last time out in malaysia , will start third , albeit down by nine tenths of a second on hamilton
1 hamilton ; 2 nico rosberg ; 3 sebastian vettel ; 4 felipe massa ; 5 bottas ; 6 kimi raikkonen ; 7 ricciardo ; 8 romain grosjean ; 9 felipe nasr ; 10 ericsson â oh come on , guys â , nico rosberg exasperates after missing out on pole by 0.042secs
hamilton fails to improve on his time , but it does nât matter as nico rosberg ca nât beat his lap. it is hamilton âs pole
here we go â¦ meanwhile ... sebastian vettel crosses the line to go fourth fastest as he splits the williams pair of felipe massa and bottas
kimi raikkonen is the first of the ferrari drivers to post a time and he is the best part of two seconds slower than hamilton on a used set of option tyres
what can nico rosberg do ? the mercedes man is 0.280secs slower than his team - mate
so , we âre already underway with the final session to determine the top 10 â¦ surely , hamilton wo nât be stopped in his quest for a third straight pole this year ? so , surprisingly both toro rossos fail to make the top - 10 shootout with verstappen and sainz to start 13th and 14th tomorrow
sebastian vettel crosses the line to go faster than kimi raikkonen , but he is half - a - second off hamilton âs mighty lap. kimi raikkonen goes third - fastest with a 1:37.1 , but the finn is seven tenths slower than hamilton â¦ what can sebastian vettel do in the sister ferrari ? neither ferrari driver are yet to post a time , so the best of the rest behind the mercedes pair is currently the lotus of romain grosjean , 1.6 seconds slower than hamilton
nico rosberg follows hamilton across the line , but he is three tenths slower than his mercedes team - mate
the briton really appears to be a class above his mercedes team - mate this weekend
jenson button , fernando alonso and the team have been speaking with plenty of optimism this weekend , but they will start tomorrow âs race only 17th and 18th
so , the mclaren drivers do not make it out of q1 and jenson button and fernando alonso will start on the penultimate row for tomorrow 's chinese grand prix
jenson button , also on the soft compound , is faster than fernando alonso by four tenths , and he slots his mclaren into p7
so , with 10 minutes to go , hamilton leads the way from nico rosberg , nico hulkenberg , felipe nasr , sebastian vettel , kimi raikkonen and the ever - impressive max verstappen
nico rosberg is the next driver to cross the line and he posts a lap of 1:38.496 which is some two tenths off his team - mate
here comes hamilton , who looks at ease in his mercedes , and the british driver is 1.6 seconds faster than sebastian vettel
kimi raikkonen crosses the line to post a 1:40.917 , but he appeared to be struggling with plenty of understeer on that lap and sebastian vettel crosses the line to go one second quicker than his ferrari team - mate
â nico rosberg has been challenged by mercedes chairman niki lauda to raise his game this weekend after being outclassed by hamilton in both races so far this term
the 30 - year - old posted a time of one minute 37.615secs , finishing 0.226secs quicker than team - mate nico rosberg
after hamilton led nico rosberg home in a mercedes one - two at the curtain raiser in melbourne , we were told a year of domination from the silver arrows loomed
sebastian vettel , in his ferrari , upset the odds to roar to victory in malaysia to blow the race for the championship back open and give mercedes food - for - thought ahead of this week âs chinese grand prix and for the remainder of the campaign .
