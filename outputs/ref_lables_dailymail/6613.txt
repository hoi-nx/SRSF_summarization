arrested : doug hughes was put under arrest for his gyro - copter stunt and charged with operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace the postal carrier who flew a gyrocopter onto the lawn of the us capitol is facing two criminal charges
but he 's being released from federal custody to return to florida
doug hughes made his initial appearance in u.s. district court in washington on thursday
that 's one day after he steered his tiny aircraft onto the capitol 's west lawn after flying through restricted airspace around the national mall
he was charged with operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace
doug hughes said it was a political protest
doug hughes was released on his own recognizance afterward and instructed to check in weekly with authorities in tampa starting next week
in a soft voice , doug hughes appeared to ask the judge a clarifying question about that obligation but otherwise he did not say anything significant
homeland security secretary johnson said thursday that the copter ' apparently literally flew in under the radar , ' as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why
johnson said it 's too soon to say whether wednesday 's incident should prompt changes in security procedures
but lawmakers said the incident exposed a gap in security , especially amid revelations that the pilot , florida postal worker doug hughes , was interviewed by the secret service almost two years ago
cummings spoke thursday with the secret service director
' i think that there 's absolutely a gap , and it 's a very dangerous gap , with regard to our airspace , ' cummings said

the stunt has n't cost him his freedom , yet , but means he must check in with authorities every week as he awaits trial johnson said the secret service passed along the information from the interview with doug hughes , who was to appear in court thursday afternoon , to ' all of the appropriate law enforcement agencies
' ' what safeguards can we use ? we do n't want to be a place where we 're saying ` this is an iron - clad capitol
' the tiny , open - air aircraft landed without injuries to anyone , but the incident raises questions about how someone could be allowed to fly all the way from gettysburg , pennsylvania , right up to the capitol
doug hughes has said he was making the flight to publicize his concerns about the corrupting influence of money in politics , and deliver letters to all 535 members of congressional on the topic
we do n't have fences around our airspace , so we 've got to find the right balance between living in a free and open society and security and the protection of federal buildings , ' johnson told reporters on capitol hill
' still , lawmakers questioned why , if authorities had been in touch with doug hughes , no action was taken to stop him
practice run : doug hughes flies his gyrocopter near the wauchula municipal airport in wauchula , florida prior to his ' insane ' stunt on wednesday before doug hughes made headlines by flying his open air helicopter onto the us capitol grounds , he blogged about his intention to undertake the ' non-violent demonstration
corruption in washington has robbed the us citizens of the representative government that is our birthright
protest flight : doug hughes took off from an undisclosed location in washington and landed his gyro - copter on the west front lawn of the us capitol building ' my concerns are the prior notice that he was going to do this and the lack of response , ' said rep. mccaul , r-texas , chairman of the house homeland security committee
' these small aircraft or uav devices concern me because they could go undetected and cause damage , so that 's something we 're taking a look at , ' mccaul said , adding he might hold hearings on the issue
johnson defended existing protocols for dealing with the restricted airspace over washington , federal buildings and monuments
he said his first reaction on hearing of the incident was to ask , ' what 's a gyrocopter ? ' it 's not unusual for a small aircraft like a gyrocopter to go undetected by conventional radar
the landing on the capitol grounds ' just illustrates how hard it is to have an impermeable barrier
it 's very hard to hermetically seal airspace , ' said john hansman , a massachusetts institute of technology aeronautics professor
