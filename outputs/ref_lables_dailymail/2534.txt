rather than lightening as early humans migrated north from africa around 40,000 years ago due to lower levels of sunlight , these first homo sapiens retained their dark skin colour
it was not until 7,800 years ago , when the first farmers migrated from the near east through turkey that two key genes that provide lighter skin appeared
new research suggests caucasians were a recent addition to the area , arriving on the continent 8,000 years ago europeans had dark skin for far longer than previously though
it also shows that a population of hunter gatherers living on the site of motala , southern sweden , had already developed both skin - lightening genes around 7,700 years ago together with a third that gave them blue eyes
' ' we find a surprise in seven scandinavia hunter - gatherers from the motala site in southern sweden who lived around 7,700 years before present
' while the western hunter - gatherers of central and southern europe largely have the ancestral allele at the two major european skin pigmentation loci , the closely related scandinavia hunter - gatherers have both the derived alleles contributing to light skin pigmentation at high frequency
' the study , which is also published on the open access site biorxiv , compared the genomes obtained from the remains of 83 people found at archaeological sites across europe along with the genomes of modern europeans
the researchers found five genes associated with changes in diet , body size and skin pigmentation that underwent natural selection in the past 8,000 years
pictured is an early neolithic 35 - 40 year old male from , czech republic , who was part of the first mass migration to europe two of the genes were associated with producing light skin - slc24a5 and slc45a2
they found that the remains of early hunter gatherers who lived in spain , luxembourg and hungary around 8,500 years ago , they lacked these key gene variants
however , in the remains of hunter gatherers that had lived in motala 7,700 years ago , they carried both variants of slc24a5 and slc45a2 that produced lighter skin
dr mathieson and his colleagues also found that when the first farmers from the near east arrived in europe , they carried with them genes for light skin
previously , researchers had believed it spread 8,500 years ago , when the first farmers from the near east , now modern day turkey , brought it to europe these gene is known to account for between 25 - 40 per cent of the skin tone lightening in europeans
the study also showed that around around 4,800 years ago a group of herders known as the yamnaya migrated from the stepps between the black sea and the caspian sea , carried with them genes for tallness to northern and central europe
' archaeologists had thought that europe showed a relatively simple succession from hunter - gatherers in the mesolithic to early farmers in the neolithic , with the basic assumption that the arrival of farming significantly altered the biology of those first farmers , after which they gradually developed into the europeans of today
' but from ancient dna it now looks like the first farmers in mainland europe were still relatively dark - skinned and dark - eyed , and lacked the ability to digest milk properly until only about 4,000 years ago , while contemporary hunter - gatherers in scandinavia may have been lighter - skinned but with a surprising frequency of a gene found in oriental populations today , suggesting they would have resembled them in hair form and the distinctive morphology of their front teeth
