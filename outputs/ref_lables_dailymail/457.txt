albarn said modern pop stars are part of a ' selfie generation ' that just sings about platitudes he was once the driving force behind britpop in the 1990s and became known for his very public spat with oasis ' gallagher brothers
and now blur frontman albarn , who lives in kensington and chelsea in london , has returned to pick a fight with even more people in the music industry
albarn has criticised today 's pop stars for ' talking platitudes ' and singing only about themselves , at a time when , he believes , they could be using their music to make political statements in the run up to the general election
' modern day musicians are talking platitudes now and it 's not interesting to me , ' albarn told the sunday times ' culture magazine
his comments are timely as blur releases its first album in years this month
albarn 's criticisms are also likely to resonate with people who have been scornful about the work of modern day pop stars such as taylor swift and sam smith who are known for using their singles to express their emotions about failed relationships
sam smith , recently credited the man who broke his heart for inspiring his award winning album taylor swift is known for using her music to criticise her ex-boyfriends and reveal her struggles in love albarn said he would like to see popstars talking about what is going on around them and using their music to comment on modern society and politics
