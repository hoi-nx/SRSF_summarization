the collapse in mancini 's relationship with city was rooted in his dismay at the quality of english players signed by the club
when names like scott sinclair , jack rodwell and to a lesser extent johnson were signed , he could barely disguise his contempt , feeling none of them would help him take on barcelona and real madrid in the champions league
tottenham defender danny rose has been linked with a move to city mancini was sacked in 2013 and nearly two years on , brian marwood has a new role at the academy with a spaniard , txiki begiristain , in his old job with the title director of football
and yet the dilemma remains the same : how do city buy enough top english players to fulfil quotas for homegrown players without breaking fpp ( financial fair play ) regulations again ? it wo n't be easy and could explain why city â who have slumped to fourth in the league â are being linked with less glamorous names like danny rose and aaron cresswell
it 's a sobering thought that jack rodwell made only seven premier league starts in two seasons for city after a Â£ 12million move from everton
scott sinclair started just twice after signing from swansea and is currently on loan at aston villa
plenty of things at city have been carefully planned and executed well since the club 's owners from abu dhabi took over in 2008

arsenal manager arsene wenger signed theo walcott , alex oxlade-chamberlain and calum chambers and man united bought wayne rooney , phil jones and luke shaw as teenagers
most spectacularly , liverpool bought players like jordan henderson , daniel sturridge and sterling and invested in making them better
only chelsea face similar issues to city
scott sinclair ( left ) and jack rodwell are two english players who were bought by city in the premier league , you must have eight homegrown players if you fill your squad of 25
city 's six premier league homegrown players are : joe hart , richard wright , dedryck boyata , gael clichy , frank lampard and james milner and there lies a major problem for next season
gael clichy has endured a poor season and city will want a new left - back while dedryck boyata , a belgian who has been at city since he was 16 , is not good enough to win a regular first - team place
man united signed both wayne rooney ( left ) and luke shaw as teenagers the champions league squads of 25 also require eight players to have been trained in england , but four of those must have come through the ranks at city
but whichever way they look at it , city have three options which carry a downside : 1 ) spend big on the best english players 2 ) find their own from their academy or 3 ) buy cheaper english players who might not be good enough
daniel sturridge ( left ) and jordan henderson are two players liverpool bought to boost their english quota for option one , supply and demand is a problem
there are probably only three england players most people would call good international - class and therefore worthy of a place in the city team should they want to win titles at home and abroad
joe hart is already there , wayne rooney is at man united and presumably unattainable while sterling would be a premium price
' can you get sterling ? maybe if you go to liverpool with Â£ 100million you can , ' complained manuel pellegrini recently
no wonder city appear ready to open negotiations at Â£ 50m
bryan is one of the young players at city who is tipped to go on to big things midfielder bryan ticks all the boxes for what city hope to achieve in the future
a box - to - box midfielder from manchester , he joined city at the age of 11 and has gone on to be an england youth international at different age levels
city will hope starlets like jose pozo , thierry ambrose , mathias bossaerts , seko fofana , jason denayer and bryan will become their homegrown first - teamers of the future , but they are unlikely to make a major contribution next season
it might not be the best idea for the players themselves , johnson said after he was sold to sunderland that the move to city can turn sour for young players
jack rodwell is now at sunderland too , while scott sinclair will make his loan move to aston villa permanent provided they stay up
city association - trained homegrown players : joe hart , richard wright , gael clichy , james milner , frank lampard
