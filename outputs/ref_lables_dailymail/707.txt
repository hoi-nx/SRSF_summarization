murray has a fairly simple message for any of his fellow british tennis players who might be agitated about the imminent arrival of bedene into the home ranks : do nât complain
instead the british no 1 believes his colleagues should use the assimilation of the world no 83 , originally from slovenia , as motivation to better themselves
at present any grumbles are happening in private , and bedene âs present ineligibility for the davis cup team has made it less of an issue , although that could change if his appeal to play is allowed by the international tennis federation
bedene is pictured at his british citizenship ceremony in hatfield on tuesday morning murray says british players anyone questioning the move should work on their world ranking bedene poses for a picture with friends and family outside the petty sessional court building in hatfield last year , when bedene stated he intended to try to make the switch , the then british no 3 evans expressed some doubts about its legitimacy , wondering why he would wish to do it
but murray thinks anyone questioning the move , now it has become official , would be better working on getting their ranking closer to his
â if he was 500 in the world they would nât be that fussed about it but obviously he threatens their position a bit , â said the 27 - year - old scot
â and he âs obviously the british no 2 , comfortably
â i would hope that all the guys who are below him now , like james ward , kyle edmund and liam , will use it as motivation
â he âs a good player but so are james ward and kyle edmund , and liam has improved
â murray admits bedene 's stance threatens certain players position as he is on tour every week james ward ( left ) and kyle edmund should try to use bedene as motivation to get better as a player bedene ( right ) with girlfriend kimalie , who is a pop singer in her native land of slovenia for the first time , murray , who has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the top 100 , gave his opinion of bedene : â he âs a good player with a very good serve
the davis cup is a greyer area as from january 1 playing for two countries in a career was outlawed and he was picked for the slovenia squad three times â but he will argue his intentions were clear before then and his citizenship was being held up by bureaucratic process
â murray says bedene is a great server who could possibly move up the rankings murray gets pumped up on his way to victory over kevin anderson at the miami open murray proudly poses with a cake , saying ' it 's an amazing feeling ' after winning his 500th game switching nationalities is always a contentious issue in any sport and evans âs questions have some pertinence to them
