lorraine valentine , 42 , calls herself the ' real life vampire ' as she has a rare medical condition meaning she is allergic to the sun miss lorraine valentine suffers from erythropoietic protoporphyria ( epp ) which causes her skin to burn and become unbearable itchy when she is exposed to sunlight now , as temperatures in the uk are set to soar , she is desperate for a drug that can help her
miss lorraine valentine , of bournemouth , said : ' it 's always worst when the sun first comes out because i have no time to adjust
' she was first diagnosed with epp , a rare blood condition which attacks the liver , when she was nine
the condition â which is incurable - is caused by a build - up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood
as blood passes through the skin , the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues
the nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain , and it can also cause the tissues to swell up
for miss lorraine valentine , even tasks like going to the supermarket are painful , as uv light reflects up from the floor , burning her skin
epp occurs when there is a build - up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood
the skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths ( uva ) and to visible light
the condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling , itching and burning when exposed to sunlight
