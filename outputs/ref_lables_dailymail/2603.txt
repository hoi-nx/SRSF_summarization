nearly 15 years ago an amazing story emerged of how a young japanese woman had travelled half - way across the world to try and find a suitcase stuffed with $ 1m dollars that had been buried in the snow
it was claimed that takako had believed the film fargo , fargo was real - after all the hit movie begins with the words ' this is a true story - when she was found dead in a mini-skirt and high - heeled boots in the frozen wastes of minnesota just days after arriving
now takako 's incredible story has been made into a film of its own - kumiko , the treasure hunter - newly released by american filmmakers , and brothers , david and zellner - that dramatizes the myth of her journey and sad end
what is certain is that takako 's body was found by a hunter in some woodland near detroit lakes , a town in minnesota some 50 miles east of the real town of fargo , in the neighbouring state of north dakota , in november 2001
but she did n't die in search of the cash buried in front of a roadside fence under the snow by steve buscemi 's character in the 1996 coen brothers film
berczeller told mailonline : ' the coen brothers started it really by putting the line " this is a true story " at the start of fargo
peter berczeller used an actress to play takako in his 2003 film this is a true story , which told the real tale mimi ohmori in berczeller 's film ( left ) and rinko kikuchi in the zellner brothers ' new release ( right ) in the new film takako sets out with a crudely drawn treasure map across the frozen tundra of minnesota in search of her mythical fortune a still from this is a true story in which takako 's body is depicted exactly as it was found , right down to the black thigh boots , miniskirt and coat which she was wearing despite the freezing temperatures ' it was a half joke , half trick
' when the story of takako came out the mix between fiction and reality started by the coen brothers , that fuelled the whole story in a way
the fantastical story of how takako travelled all the way from tokyo in search of the lost money began to spread not long after her death
this is a still from kumiko , the treasure hunter berczeller ( right ) told mailonline : ' the coen brothers started it really by putting the line " this is a true story " ( left ) at the start of fargo ' a scene from this is a true story
officer jessie heliman actually spoke with the real takako before she died the zellner brothers ' new film has been a critical success but is no more a true story than fargo itself ' takako did n't speak any english and the police did n't speak any japanese so basically they made it up - they did n't lie about it , it was like a game of telephone [ chinese whispers ]
' so the story of takako , which sprung from the outlandish tale of the film fargo , was based on a simple misunderstanding
and yet this has n't stopped kumiko , released in february in the uk and starring rinko kikuchi as a version of takako , become a critical hit
takako had apparently been chasing an american banker she 'd met in tokyo who 'd moved to singapore and was originally from the town of fargo
the story of takako , which sprung from the outlandish tale of fargo , was based on a misunderstanding in kumiko , the treasure hunter , the 28 - year - old meets up with local cops just as she did in real life detroit lakes in minnesota
takako 's body was found by a hunter in woodland not far from the small town the relationship ended but he was the last person she spoke to the night before she died , spending $ 88 on a 40 - minute call to singapore which berczeller managed to trace
