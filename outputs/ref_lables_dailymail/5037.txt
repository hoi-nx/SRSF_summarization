a mexican archaeologist hunting for a royal tomb in a tunnel beneath a towering pre-aztec pyramid has made a discovery that may have brought him a step closer : liquid mercury
in the bowels of teotihuacan , a mysterious ancient city that was once the largest in the americas , earlier this month sergio gomez found ' large quantities ' of the silvery metal in a chamber at the end of a sacred tunnel sealed for nearly 1,800 years
and because of the potential supernatural significance of liquid mercury in ritual ends , deeper into the complex sergio gomez hopes to find the elusive last resting place of a king
if sergio gomez is right , it could help settle a debate over how power was wielded in teotihuacan , a city boasting massive stone pyramids that was home to as many as 200,000 people and the heart of ancient empire that flourished between 100 and 700 a.d. some archaeologists believe the toxic element could herald what would be the first ruler 's tomb ever found in teotihuacan , a contemporary of several ancient maya cities , but so shrouded in mystery that its inhabitants still have no name
teotihuacan , or ' abode of the gods ' in the aztec language of nahuatl , was distinct from the mayan civilization
royalty : sergio gomez said that he is unsure as to why the mercury was in the tunnel ( pictured ) , but he hopes that it will lead him to the tomb of the city 's king digging : inah ( inah ) archaeologists work at a tunnel that may lead to a royal tombs discovered at the ancient city of teotihuacan in 2011
mexican archaeologist linda manzanilla believes that at its peak , the city was ruled not by a single king , but a council of four lords , and that sergio gomez may find the remains of one of them
