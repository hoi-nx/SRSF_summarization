countdown co-presenter rachel riley was left embarrassed on a recent episode of the show when contestants offered up a rather rude eight - letter word as their answer to the word game
host nick hewer faced a conundrum of his own as he tried , and failed , to stifle his giggles as a blushing ms rachel riley spelt out the word ' erection '
nick hewer , who first found fame as lord sugar âs sidekick in the apprentice , was clearly trying not to laugh when dubliner gerry tynan and anne lewin , from brighton , both offered up the double entendre
it is not the first time the show 's host has struggled to contain himself when a rude word has popped up - last year hairy biker dave myers offered up the seven - letter word ' todgers ' , causing much hilarity among the hosts
it is not the first time nick hewer ( pictured ) has struggled to contain himself when a rude word has popped up in 1991 , two contestants offered ' w * * * ers ' , and in 2010 another suggested 's * * tface '
it 's not the first word to have left rachel riley blushing
