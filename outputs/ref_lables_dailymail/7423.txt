cameron will today promise extra free childcare for 600,000 children a year to counter spiralling costs
the conservatives have pledged to reduce tax relief on pension contributions for people earning more than Â£ 150,000 to fund additional free childcare places
that â s right â 30 hours of free childcare a week â worth Â£ 5,000 to working families
â that means over 600,000 extra free childcare places available for families every year â nine million extra hours of childcare a week and parents able to work an extra 78 days a year without any childcare costs â all by 2017
â mr cameron will also argue â that true compassion is nât giving people a benefits cheque â it âs giving them a chance â
â we , the conservative party , have been using all the tools at our disposal â the tax and benefit system ; childcare and the minimum wage , to turn that around
this goes to the heart of the country we are trying to build : one based on the principle of something for something , not something for nothing â where those who put in , get out , where hard work is rewarded â where we make work pay
the new 30 hours entitlement will cost just under Â£ 350 million a year .
