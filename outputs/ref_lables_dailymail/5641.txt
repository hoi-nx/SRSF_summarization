help for heroes has launched a fundraising drive to keep second world war veteran robert in his own home after a north london council refused to pay for his ongoing care
brent council said it was no longer able to afford to pay for a live - in carer to stay with the 96 - year - old former prisoner of war , despite the fact that mr robert spent his Â£ 50,000 life savings on contributing to his care
now , the council want to move mr robert from the house he has lived in for the past 50 years into a care home because they claim it is cheaper
the charity has already given mr robert and emergency grant to fund his immediate care needs , but they are seeking the public 's help to secure his future
' mr robert is one of britain 's oldest surviving prisoners of war - and one of the few britain soldiers to survive hitler 's 1,000 - mile death march - has been given the emergency grant through the help for heroes quick reaction fund
having spent his savings on home care , mr robert , from brent council , north west north london , faced being forced out of his home into a residential care home , something he said would ' remind me of being a prisoner of war '

now a great - great - grandfather and one of britain âs oldest surviving pows , mr robert is registered blind , deaf in one ear and is dependent on a wheelchair
for the past two years he has used his Â£ 50,000 savings to pay towards a Â£ 960 - a - week live - in carer , while brent council contributed Â£ 350 a week
but as his money runs out , the council is refusing to increase its funding and mr robert may have to go into a care home instead
â despite tens of thousands signing the petition to allow mr robert to stay in his own home , brent council said they will not increase their funding for a live - in carer
â however â¦ the care package that mr robert is choosing is not affordable to council taxpayers given the constraints of local government funding and the need to be consistent for the 2,900 people we support
â he added : â mr robert owns his home , so there is absolutely no question of brent council evicting him despite what has been suggested in this petition
â the council said mr robert âs needs can be met in a care home for Â£ 451 a week
