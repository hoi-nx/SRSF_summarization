this is the birth of a child who will be in line to the throne
royal sources say the only difference between the birth of prince george and his brother or sister will be that there will be less ceremony around the delivery of the piece of paper from the lindo wing of st mary 's to buckingham palace
the birth of prince william was first announced on an easel outside buckingham palace in 1982 prince william 's birth announcement was signed by the doctors who delivered him with the duchess due to give birth any day , one gambler has bet Â£ 10,000 that she will give birth to a girl
the duchess in march at one of her last public appearances before the birth of her new baby the man said : ' i 'm not really bothered by the royals , but i 'd just had a big win and my missus reckons it 's a girl , so that 's a good enough reason for me
william and kate 's fourth wedding anniversary on wednesday april 29 is now one of the favourite arrival dates at 4/1
cameron has defended william and kate for opting to use private health services rather than the nhs
asked if he was disappointed the royal family did not use the nhs , mr cameron told murnaghan on sky news today : ' i think it 's a total matter of choice for people - what they use and where they have their babies
' he added : ' the nhs is superb and i 've seen that in my own life in so many different ways but i believe in choice , i believe in people being able to do what they want to do , and as i say i 've only got one thought about the royal baby which is a happy and healthy arrival
' the baby will officially be overdue if kate has not given birth by may 1 , and even kate herself has said the baby is due mid to late april
when kate gave birth last time on july 22 , it was the day of a new full moon .
