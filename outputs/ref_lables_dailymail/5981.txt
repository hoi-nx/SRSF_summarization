more than half of scotland plan to back the snp in the general election , shattering miliband 's hopes of securing a labour majority
snp leader sturgeon has been buoyed by a series of tv debates opposing austerity cuts , despite threatening another referendum on independence
a new tns survey shows the snp has almost doubled its lead over labour in a month , with 52 per cent now backing ms sturgeon with only 24 per cent of scotland planning to vote for mr miliband
the snp surge since the independence referendum in september puts labour on course to lose dozens of seats , robbing mr miliband of any chance of winning the election outright
it comes on the day that mr miliband used labour 's manifesto launch to insist he is ' ready ' to be prime minister
the poll is a blow to mr miliband on the day he used labour 's manifesto launch to insist he is ' ready ' to be prime minister but labour and the snp have clashed on ms sturgeon 's call for full fiscal autonomy for scotland , and her suggestion that another referendum could be held before 2020
the tns survey covered the period of the uk - wide tv debates , although it closed before the impact of the scotland leaders ' tv debates could be taken into account
tom costley , head of tns scotland , said : ' the official election campaign has got off to a great start for the snp , undoubtedly helped by sturgeon 's strong performance in the uk - wide tv debate
snp leader sturgeon has been buoyed by a series of tv debates opposing austerity cuts , despite threatening another referendum on independence the most popular single option is a labour - snp coalition , with 25 per cent support
both parties have ruled this out , but the response suggests that some form of snp - labour co-operation has significant backing , tns said
if the snp holds a majority of scotland 's 59 seats in a hung parliament , voters are evenly divided between those who want the snp to work with labour ( 34 per cent ) and those who want the snp to remain a separate bloc in the westminster parliament ( 32 per cent )
