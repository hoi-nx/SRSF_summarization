england international morgan has delivered an encouraging fitness bulletin as he continues to recover from a season - ending injury and retain the hope of keeping alive his world cup dream
the gloucester no 8 has not played since breaking his left leg during an aviva premiership game against saracens in early january
but the signs suggest he is on course to play a part during england 's world cup warm - up period ahead of the tournament kicking off in mid-september
morgan is hopeful of featuring for england at the forthcoming world cup despite his long - term injury morgan last featured for england when he scored two tries during their victory over australia five months ago
the 26 - year - old , though , remains an integral part of england boss stuart lancaster 's world cup plans , and the current prognosis is a good one after morgan recently underwent final surgery to remove a pin from his leg
' to be honest , i have not found this difficult at all , ' said 27 times - capped morgan , after watching his gloucester colleagues continue their preparations for friday night 's european challenge cup final against edinburgh
' i am really positive and using this as a great experience to make myself better for when i come back
who else gets six months off to rest up and train hard ? ' yes , i will be at a disadvantage in terms of the fact i have n't played any rugby
' but looking at the world cup in particular , there will be lads who would n't have played for probably two and a bit months going into the first ( warm - up ) game , so everyone is going to be on an equal playing field
i am just trying to make sure i get back healthy when i come back
gloucester no 8 morgan broke his left leg playing against saracens in the aviva premiership in january ' i have a lot of strengthening to do around my legs - in the early stages you do n't want to rush that
' stuart lancaster is due to name a 45 - man world cup training squad next month , followed by his final 31 - man group for the tournament in late august
england 's world cup preparations , meanwhile , also feature home and away games against france in august , plus a september appointment with reigning six nations champions ireland at twickenham
morgan last played for england during his side 's victory against the australia at twickenham in november reflecting on the injury , morgan added : ' it was tough , but it was one of those things
how long is it going to take me to get back ? '' ' ideally , i would like to be back playing in those warm - up games because that gives me a shot of getting in the squad
