jesus christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals , according to a writer and leading atheist activist
david fitzgerald , a san francisco based author , believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves jesus christ did not exist
he claims there are no contemporary mentions of jesus christ in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived , yet other jewish sect leaders from the time do appear
instead he insists the disciples of jesus christ were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence
historical researcher paulkovich has claimed that jesus christ did not exist after being unable to find any verifiable mention of jesus christ in historical texts by 126 writers during the â time of jesus christ â from the first to third centuries
he claims that he is a fictional character invented by followers of christianity to create a figure to worship
â the 126 texts he studied were all written in the period during or soon after the supposed existence of jesus christ , when paulkovich says they would surely have heard of someone as famous as jesus christ - but none mention him
' when i consider those 126 writers , all of whom should have heard of jesus christ but did not - and paul and marcion and athenagoras and matthew with a tetralogy of opposing christs , the silence from qumram and nazareth and bethlehem , conflicting bible stories , and so many other mysteries and omissions - i must conclude that jesus christ is a mythical character , â he writes
â " jesus christ " was nothing more than urban ( or desert ) legend , likely an agglomeration of several evangelic and deluded rabbis who might have existed
â in a new book due to be published later this year , he will argue that the figure of jesus christ was actually a combination of pagan rituals and stories about other people
speaking to mailonline , he said : ' there is a paradox that jesus christ did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years
' the first gospel of christianity appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray
' it appears that early christianity managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of jesus christ
' mr david fitzgerald , whose first book ' nailed : ten christian ' was published in 2010 , believes it is no longer reasonable to assume there has to be a single historic figure who began christianity
mr david fitzgerald says there are inconsistencies in the gospels of the christian bible ( pictured above ) that suggest jesus christ was a literary allegory and these accounts were written decades after his supposed life the statue of christ the redeemer ( above ) in rio de janeiro , brazil , is one of many depictions of jesus christ but mr david fitzgerald says that many of the early depictions were unable to agree on his appearance mr david fitzgerald said : ' there is nothing implausible to think that jesus christ was a real person , but i just do n't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all
' we also have no mention of jesus christ in other historical texts from the time
' during this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than jesus christ , but all of them managed something jesus christ did not - to make a dent on the historical record
others have said there could have been several people named james , whose father was called joseph and had a brother called jesus christ living in jerusalem at the time
' mr david fitzgerald argues that many of these stories were in fact incorporated into the story of jesus christ as literary devices rather than as a historical account
he said : ' there is also no evidence for the tradition that sees barabbas - an anti-roman rebel and murderer - being released while jesus christ , an innocent , is condemned to death
