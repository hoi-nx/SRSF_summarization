patents have already hinted that apple is looking to boost the cameras in future models of the iphone and ipads , but its latest acquisition confirms it
the tech giant has bought israel - based link computational imaging in a deal reportedly worth $ 20 million ( Â£ 13.5 million )
linx makes ' multi-aperture ' cameras small enough to fit into smartphones and tablets that come with depth - sensing technology - as seen on htc one m8 's m8 duo - camera
linx makes ' multi-aperture ' cameras small enough to fit into smartphones and tablets that come with depth - sensing technology
this technology could be added to the next - generation iphones and ipads rather than capturing a flat 2d image , the technology is able to sense the depth of each object in a photograph
this lets people refocus an image after its been captured , or measure the dimensions of a room , for example
' utilising state - of - the - art multi aperture imaging technology that combines innovative image processing [ with ] advanced sensor and optics technology , our cameras set new standards for image quality parameters such as low light performance , refocusing and more , ' said the firm
rather than capturing a flat 2d image , the technology is able to sense the depth of each object in a photograph
this lets people refocus an image after its been captured or measure the dimensions of a room , for example
the first sensor captures the image , while the the second captures depth information
' linx cameras are significantly smaller than any camera on the market today , leading the way to dslr performance in slim handsets
the first sensor captures the image , while the the second captures depth information
for example , ufocus lets users switch the focal point of an the shot , even if they appear blurry in the original picture
foregrounder and seasons lets users add effects such as a zoom , blur , snow and rain to an image
while dimension plus uses data from both cameras to let people change the perspective of the photo by tilting the phone
apple has confirmed the acquisition but not revealed any more details

similar technolgoy is seen on the htc one m8 ( pictured ) in the form of its duo camera linx 's website said its state - of - the - art multi aperture imaging technology combines image processing with advanced sensor and optics technology
' our cameras set new standards for image quality parameters such as low light performance , hdr , refocusing , and more , ' said the firm and if a patent awarded earlier this month is anything to go by , the camera on the iphone 7 could take even better photos
the technology is already fitted to a range of laptops and last week intel 's boss brian krzanich unveiled a version designed for smartphones and tablets ( refocusing examples pictured ) ' first , second , and third image sensors are provided , each being positioned to receive a respective one of the colour components that emerge from the faces
a patent filed by apple in 2011 and awarded earlier this month details a three - sensor camera ( illustrated ) that uses mirrors to split incoming light in three - namely green , red and blue these beams of light are then projected onto three sensors
to showcase how good this technology apple has launched a marketing campaign that only uses images shot on its latest handsets
