these dramatic images show the moment an audi pulled out of a road and deliberately crashed into the side of a bus as part of a Â£ 1million ' crash for cash ' scam
the elaborate fraud involved cars and vans being driven into the side of first group buses so passengers - who were mainly friends and relatives complicit in the scam - could falsely claim from insurers
the crashes took place between october 2010 and january 2012 and earned ringleader john smith 45 , from connah 's quay , north wales , Â£ 159,000
in each case , the driver of the car would admit full liability , allowing all of the passengers from the bus to submit personal injury claims
he then personally processed 218 personal injury claims - which totalled more than Â£ 1million - to no win no fee lawyers
all of the bogus claims submitted by the john smith 's company were for whiplash and ' soft tissue injuries , ' meaning they could not be verified by the insurance companies
