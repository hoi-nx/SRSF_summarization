the idea was inspired by a popular ' anime ' cartoon character whose ribbon - bound arms and chest has become her signature
the trend is inspired by the anime character hestia from is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon the ribbon is tied under the breasts and over the arms so that they are uplifted every time the arms are raised the trend has seen many japanese women uploading pictures of their successes online but bizarrely hestia 's signature has taken off with the fans of the show
it has not only been picked up by cosplayers , who like to dress up as their favourite anime characters , but it has also been copied by ordinary girls who have been posting their own hestia - inspired images online
while some women opt for a single loop around their chest and arms , others tie the ribbon once under their breasts and then around once again to rest on the upper arms to give cleavage a bigger boost when lifting their arms
