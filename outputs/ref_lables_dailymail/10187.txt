nearly 500 british holidaymakers were stranded overnight on an impounded cruise ship in lisbon harbour after its owners were served with a summons for an allegedly unpaid debt
the passengers coming towards the end of a 15 night cruise became the unwitting pawns in a legal wrangle between a former crew member and the owners of the mv azores
the ship had been set to leave lisbon at 7pm on tuesday night with its 489 passengers heading back to bristol after a round - trip tour that took in la coruna in spain , the azores , and madeira
but that was scuppered when lawyers slapped a court order on the ship over an ' unresolved ' and ' historic ' financial wrangle
the harbour master then refused to let the ship leave for bristol
the british cruise firm , which had nothing to do with the financial wrangle , eventually came to an arrangement with portugese authorities which allowed the ship to sail - 19 hours late - at 2pm wednesday
cruise & maritime voyages 's commercial director coates said : ' the delay of the mv azores overnight in lisbon related to a historic local issue with the vessel 's owning company , portuscale cruises from whom cruise & maritime voyages charter the ship using our own crew
wrangle : the legal dispute was between owners portuscale cruise - from which they were chartering the vessel ( file photo ) - and one of that company 's former staff going nowhere : the harbour master then refused to let the ship leave the port and passengers eventually arrived back in the british 19 hours late ' this dispute involved a previous crewing issue going back to 2014 and was settled first thing this morning
the ship is now heading en - route back to the british
