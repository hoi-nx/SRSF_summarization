sauntering down leafy avenues past typical dutch step - Â­ gabled buildings , carpets of crocuses , the occasional cyclist whooshing quietly by and the sun bouncing off the canal , i can think of few more pleasant places to spend a spring weekend than hague
this is also the home of girl with a pearl earring , the ' dutch mona lisa '
but i am not only here for the vermeer , rembrandt and hals
much more than a village : the parliament building stands proud in hague - a hidden gem of a city there is the escher gallery ( devoted to that geometry - Â­ defying genius ) , the contemporary art gemeentemuseum and more
' city ? this is european 's biggest village , ' says my guide , remco dã¶rr
he is right : the hague , despite being home to holland 's royal family and an eye - Â­ catching parliament , was classed as a village until louis bonaparte ( napoleon 's brother and king of holland ) set up here in 1806
the hague is home to one of the cornerstones of european art - vermeer 's girl with a pearl earring you have to love that kind of dutch logic - though it does n't seem to apply to cyclists , who rule the place
the most prized dutch colony was apparently run from hague ( aka ' the widow of indonesia ' )
my art gorging finishes at the panorama , an extraordinary , 14 ft - Â­ high circular panorama of the hague 's seaside resort , scheveningen , painted by hendrik mesdag
the hague has netted a new fan
