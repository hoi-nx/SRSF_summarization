they are the peculiar concrete markings that have been spotted all across us , prompting hikers and travellers to wonder what on earth they could mean and where they are pointing to
dotted among scrubland , placed in seemingly random spots , these huge arrows were once markers for early airmail flights across the us - forming the first land - based navigation system in the world
a huge concrete arrow is found in perfect condition in bloomington , washington county , utah the bloomnigton arrow was one of 102 found by retired couple brian and charlotte smith , who have travelled across the us to photograph the monuments the concrete arrows were placed at the base of lit beacons near airways , showing pilots the direction they needed to fly in to reach the next stop - off to deliver mail
as the flights got longer , with more frequent stop - offs , so the beacons and arrows were placed to help pilots on their way
the arrows define a moment in history at the beginning of the 21st century when the us postal service began delivering air mail perfectly set against the snow - capped mountains of nevada , this arrow was photographed in golconda , humboldt county captured near the tiny town of medicine bow in wyoming , this beacon was on the famous new york to san francisco route one of the most important flight routes and the first to be completed , stretched across the us from new york to san francisco the giant arrows started to be placed across the country , sometimes at 10 - mile intervals , from 1924
medicine bow town in carbon county has a population of just 284 and was originally established due to the construction of a transcontinental railroad not all the arrows are in good condition , with each passing winter more cracks appear in the concrete , such as with this arrow in mote , nevada pumpernickle n nevada has its own concrete arrow too , which one again is overlooked by the state 's beautiful mountains in the days before radio and satellite communications , the arrows were a way to ensure pilots could find their way , even in poor weather
while the arrows are now long - forgotten , with many lost forever , there are fans who , having stumbled upon an arrow or two in the countryside , have started mapping those concrete markers that have been left behind
arrowheads and ancient earth mounds have been discovered at poverty point , in utah , but it also has a more recent concrete arrow a beacon has survived in good condition in new mexico ( left ) and at cottage grove in oregon ( right ) - many of these were lost as the metal was used in the war effort during the second world war at thayer juntion , in wyoming , there are boards that supply information about the arrows and their use to passers - by ' our interest grew out of an email circulating in august 2013 , we wanted to know where they were , and set out to find them
