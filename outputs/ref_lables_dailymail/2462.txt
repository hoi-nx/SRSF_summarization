young women can still get cheaper car insurance than young men despite sex equality laws , an economist warned yesterday
insurers are dodging the rules that ban them from charging female drivers less by offering lower premiums to motorists who have jobs that are done mainly by women , he said
stephen mcdonald , of newcastle university , analysed this pay - by - job system
they meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies , including â female - focused â insurers sheilas â wheels he found car insurance costs have plunged for young dental nurses and social workers , which are female - dominated roles
someone who tells their insurer they are a 21 - year - old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011 , he said
this difference in premiums based on occupation was not seen in older age groups , but only for young drivers â â where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest â , he explained
someone who tells their insurer they are a 21 - year - old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011 eu court of justice law bans them from giving more generous annuities to men , who do nât usually live as long as women
â however , for young drivers , for whom the difference in risk between males and females is greatest , there is evidence that firms are engaging in indirect discrimination using occupations as a proxy for gender , with insurance prices becoming relatively lower for those in female - dominated jobs
