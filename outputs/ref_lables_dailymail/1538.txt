the broadcaster , who recently hosted coverage of the boat race , has vowed to do less after presenting everything from the bbc 's rugby league coverage to crufts
she told radio times magazine : ' i used to say yes to everything i was offered because i thought it would all stop tomorrow
' in 2014 i did n't do a single panel show because they get repeated so much
from december 10 last year when i hosted sports personality until i did crufts on march 10 , i was not on television presenting anything
' the 44 - year - old , who married alice arnold in a private ceremony earlier this year , said that it was ' exhausting ' to be constantly asked about being gay
i suspect gabby logan is n't asked about being married or being a mother , ' she said
but the facts do n't necessarily support that i do too much , and i get asked about being gay all the time
but it can get a bit exhausting
' the 44 - year - old , who married alice arnold in a private ceremony earlier this year , said that it was ' exhausting ' to be constantly asked about being gay balding added : ' i have never wanted children
' my brother andrew 's relationship with his wife anna lisa is almost as long - standing as mine with alice , and all they were ever asked is ' when are you getting married ? ' and ' when are you having children ? '
