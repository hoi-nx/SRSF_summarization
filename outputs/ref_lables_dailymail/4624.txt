overcoming terminal cancer through healthy eating - that statement in print appears dubious at best
but it becomes completely believable when it is brought to life through the inspirational , optimistic , comeback story of a charismatic , beautiful , young woman named belle
wellness warrior belle has admitted that she never had cancer and does not want forgiveness now that belle has admitted she made her story up , we ask ourselves , how could we have fallen so hard for an account of what many have called a medical miracle , without a shred of supporting evidence ? the answer is very simple
and we did not so much believe in belle â´ Â´ s story , as we believed in belle â´
we were enchanted by belle â´ s journey , as well as by belle herself
a beautiful , young , inspirational woman , we fell in love with her story as well as with her â which caused us even to downplay the rumours and suspicions of sceptics within the medical community as the fabric of her brave fight against cancer began to unravel
she founded the whole pantry - a book and app which over 300,000 people have downloaded appearances are reality â and seeing is believing believe it or not , studies show that people can not distinguish between behaviour that is honest and behaviour that is deceptive
when someone relays a heart - warming story , as belle did , what is she getting out of it ? while many people do not want to spoil a happy ending with a cloud of suspicion , examining prospective outcomes for the storyteller often raises suspicions about potential ulterior motives that might otherwise never come to light
