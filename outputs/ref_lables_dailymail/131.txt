breakthrough ? : early tests carried out on cancer cells have shown survival rates in mice were boosted by more than 50 per cent a new technique that effectively gives a personal treatment for cancer has been found by scientists
scientists have found a system of priming the body âs immune system to recognise , attack and kill off cancerous cells in lung , skin and bowel tumours
the team which carried out the research found that early trials â profoundly retarded â tumour growth in mice
survival rates were boosted by more than 50 per cent , according to results published in the journal nature last night
the scientists are now recruiting patients with skin cancer for the first clinical trial on humans
scientists last night welcomed the german team âs breakthrough
advances : people with skin cancer are now being recruited for the first human trial â rapid production of purpose - built vaccines appears possible and can now be tested in carefully designed clinical trials
the treatment was shown to boost the body âs t - cells , which detect , hunt down and destroy cancer cells
professor peter johnson , from the cancer research uk centre at southampton general hospital , said : â this technique provides the first evidence that it may be possible to direct the immune system to fight cancer using personalised vaccines
