the fbi is facing accusations that it is ' whitewashing ' possible saudi arabia involvement in the 9/11 terrorist attacks
a commission designed to review evidence about the world - changing bombings has not delved into an fbi agent 's claims that a saudi arabia florida family had ties to the hijackers after the agency said that the report was ' unsubstantiated '
relatives of homeowner ghazzawi lived in the plush sarasota dwelling until they fled and left cars , furniture and food in their refrigerator behind right before the 9/11 , prompting some to say they knew about the attacks
an fbi agent who investigated the disappearance after neighbors thought it was suspicious said that the family had ' many connections to individuals associated with the terrorist attacks on 9/11/2001 '
the 9/11 commission wrote that ' the fbi told the review commission that the [ fbi report ] on which the news article was based was " poorly written " and wholly unsubstantiated ... ' ' when questioned later by others in the fbi , the special agent who wrote [ it ] was unable to provide any basis for the contents of the document or explain why he wrote it as he did '

the fbi 's dismissal of the report has led some to question whether the agency is covering up evidence of possible saudi arabia backing for 9/11
' the congressional joint inquiry into the attack , which graham co-chaired , contained 28 fully pages that are said to have spoken about who financed 9/11 that were fully redacted by the bush administration
senator graham said the pages ' point a very strong finger ' at the government of saudi arabia , rather than wealthy saudi arabia individuals , as the backers of the attack
the fbi told the 9/11 review commission that the original report about the sarasota family 's connections was unsubstantiated
