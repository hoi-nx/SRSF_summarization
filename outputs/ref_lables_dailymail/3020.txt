the information from the satellites has been transformed into an interferogram , which provides a colourful and highly detailed view of the earth 's land mass. by comparing before and after images , scientists have discovered everest shrank by about one inch due to the land that was shaken in the natural disaster
the tallest point in the world , however , still stands at 29,029 feet , according to the weather channel
additionally , an area 75 miles ( 120km ) by 30 miles ( 50km ) has lifted up 3.2ft ( 1 metre ) from the ground around the capital , kathmandu
interferogram over kathmandu , nepal , generated from two sentinel-1a scans on 17 and 29 april 2015 â before and after the 25 april earthquake
the large amount of fringes indicates a large deformation pattern of 3.2ft ( 1 metre ) from the ground around kathmandu scene : a rescue chopper prepares to land , evacuating climbers from higher camps to everest base camp , nepal
new radar images have shown that everest shrank one inch following the nepal earthquake this week these are the first radar images to reveal the destruction caused by the 7 - magnitude earthquake that killed 5,000 people and affected millions more
he explained that what scientists count are the coloured ' fringes ' in the interferogram , of which there are about 34 from this quake
to the north of kathmandu , the interferogram suggests that the ground receded , and it also shows how a fault ruptured east from the epicentre , but did not break the surface
an overall area of 120x100 km has moved â half of that uplifted and the other half , north of kathmandu subsided
vertical accuracy is a few centimetres sentinel-1a interferogram over kathmandu , nepal , showing deformation induced by the 25 april 2015 earthquake
the interferogram combines two sentinel-1a images from 17 and 29 april 2015 launch : 3 april 2014 french guiana life : minimum of seven years mass : 2300 kg ( 5070 lbs ) dimensions : 9.2ft ( 2.8m ) long , 8.2ft ( 2.5m ) wide , 13ft ( 4m ) high mission : monitoring sea ice , oil spills , winds and waves , land - use change and to respond to emergencies such as floods and earthquakes how it works : radar works by sending out radio waves and timing how long it takes for them to reflect back
sentinel-1a 's swath width of 155 miles ( 250km ) over land surfaces has allowed for an unprecedented area size to be analysed from a single scan
this is because it uses radar which works by sending out radio waves and timing how long it takes for them to reflect back
radio waves travel through air virtually unimpeded , but materials like metal , rock and water act almost as mirrors which can help reveal those areas inundated by floods
' the satellite imagery is used to create maps to support relief efforts , such as this â grading map â of kathmandu showing topographic features and crisis information
it also provides data to map changing land cover and deformations such as those produced by saturday 's devastating earthquake in nepal ( right ) everest before and after the earthquake
