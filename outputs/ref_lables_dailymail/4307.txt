this is the shocking dashcam footage which shows a halford 's mechanic taking a customer 's car for a joyride at almost double the speed limit when he took it in for an mot
shaun ingram booked his ford focus st in for a major service and mot at halfords in plymouth last month , costing Â£ 255
but when he went to collect his car , he was shocked to discover that a mechanic had taken it for a spin after his dashcam recorded footage of it being driven at 57mph in a 30 mph zone
the mechanic was abusing my car and my trust
' from now on i will always wait by the car whilst it is being serviced
' mr shaun ingram , who is a married father - of three and works as a large goods vehicle assessor for dairy crest , said that the dashboard camera was not switched but was on standby mode on a motion sensor
i bought the camera - ironically - from a halfords store in plymouth last year
the dashcam captured seven hours worth of footage after mr shaun ingram left his car at the plymouth branch of halfords footage showing the car being taken out on a test drive captured by the dashcam
it also showed included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test - driving the car ' i have it in for road safety purposes because of the way some people drive
the biggest file on there was the road test where the mechanic was doing nearly twice the speed limit
there was one clip of him reversing the car off the mot bay and leaning over to tell a colleague â you wait til i road test this later
â ' that shows that it was something that was pre-planned and not a spur of the moment thing when he was driving my car
mr shaun ingram says the dashcam had been switched to standby mode and came on due to its motion sensor ' there is another clip of him constantly swearing when he ca nât find the key sensor
' halfords have explained that the mechanic who drove the car was a temporary employee at the branch in plymouth , who has since been removed from this role
' we are treating this isolated incident as a priority and can confirm that the mechanic no longer works at halfords
