labour will today accuse the tories of making it harder to see a gp as they attempt to put the nhs back at the centre of the election campaign
shadow health secretary andy burnham will say the figures are a timely reminder of the â nhs crisis â as patients turn to stretched a&e departments as they struggle to get an appointment with their gp on the first working day after the easter break
but the tories last night claimed many of the problems stemmed from labour âs 2004 changes to gp contracts that allowed them to opt out of providing care outside office hours
the original poster depicts a queue to an unemployment office mr david cameron repeated the pledge at last week âs televised leaders debate , claiming he wanted gps to open â all the way through the week â
labour said this means 590 fewer gp surgeries are now open at evenings and weekends compared to its last year in office
nhs england âs annual gp - patient survey of 900,000 patients also shows growing unhappiness with gp surgery opening hours between 2012 and the latest figures for 2015 , according to the party
mr andy burnham will say : â today , across the country , people will face the frustration of joining a queue to see their gp â in some places the lines will go out of the surgery door
â one of david cameron âs first acts as prime minister was to cut labour âs extended opening hours scheme and scrap our guarantee of an appointment within 48 hours
â former prime minister margaret thatcher acknowledges a crowd on october 13 , 1989 , at the end of the conservative party conference in blackpool mr hunt last night said that when the 2014/15 figures for gps opening at evening and weekends are published they will show that the number has actually increased since 2010 because of new initiatives
he said : â labour âs figures are wrong
shadow health secretary andy burnham will say the figures are a timely reminder of the â nhs crisis â â we are extending this scheme to cover over 1,400 additional practices , helping 10 million extra people by this time next year
â the next conservative government will deliver a truly seven - day nhs , putting right a problem which began with labour âs disastrous 2004 gp contract
