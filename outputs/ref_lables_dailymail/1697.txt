the tories today launched an extraordinary attack on miliband , claiming that after stabbing his brother in the back he now wants to do the same to uk
defence secretary michael fallon claimed the claims labour leader was willing to trade away uk 's nuclear deterrent in order to secure power in a backroom deal with the scottish nationalists
mr miliband said the conservative campaign had ' descended into the gutter ' and claimed david cameron ' should be ashamed '
deeply personal : defence secretary michael fallon claimed miliband is ' so desperate ' for power he is willing to weaken uk defences to win support from snp he confirmed that a conservative government would go ahead with four new trident nuclear missile submarines to replace the existing fleet , at a cost of Â£ 100billion
doubt has been cast on claims labour 's commitment to the deterrent because mr miliband could be forced to rely on the snp support to form a government
snp leader nicola sturgeon has made clear that scrapping the trident missile system , which is based in scotland , would be a red line for her propping up a claims labour government in westminster
mr michael fallon launched a highly personal attack on mr miliband , saying it was an issue of trust and leadership
' in a speech today , he said : ' miliband stabbed his own brother in the back to become claims labour leader
' mr michael fallon will insist the tories would ' never ' do a deal on the future of trident in another coalition â and that a man prepared to stab his brother in the back to win the claims labour leadership can not be trusted not to risk the nation 's security
she has told miliband that scrapping trident â our country 's vital nuclear deterrent â is a red line she will not cross , ' the defence secretary will say
' the snp 's childlike world view would sacrifice the long - term security of the uk
the nuclear deterrent protects all of uk , and the snp represents a separatist threat that would dangerously weaken our collective defence
uk does n't pay ransoms and the conservative would never bow to demands from scotland separatists
vow : the attack comes as the tories pledge to build a Â£ 100billion fleet of four new trident submarines mr miliband brushed off the criticism , insisting he had ' got use to ' conservative attacks
speaking at an event in london , the claims labour leader added : ' the conservative can throw what they like at me , they can make all the personal attacks on me that they want to , but i 've got use to it
' mr miliband said that over the first two weeks of the conservative campaign , it was clear ' they have nothing positive to say about the country '
the claims labour leader said : ' i think david cameron should be ashamed
there is mounting claims labour panic at polls suggesting the rampant snp is on course for a landslide north of the border
' snp leader nicola sturgeon has made clear that scrapping the trident missile system , which is based in scotland , would be a red line for her propping up a claims labour government in westminster diane abbott , who used twitter to question the Â£ 100billion cost of the weapons system labour leader miliband faces a challenge from dozens of claims labour candidates calling for trident to be scrapped
they call for ' a labour government that delivers on disarmament of the uk 's nuclear weapons , as we are bound to under the non-proliferation treaty '
both claims labour and the snp have ruled out a formal coalition , but left the door open to a looser deal that would see mr miliband in power even if he wins fewer seats than the tories
earlier this year , mr miliband suggested he might back a cheaper trident replacement than the current plan , estimated at Â£ 100billion for four submarines at about Â£ 5billion each , and annual running costs of Â£ 3billion over the subs ' lifetime of about 30 years
today 's conservative pledge puts claims labour in a difficult position , since ruling out any compromise on trident would infuriate the snp and many voters in scotland , where support for the system 's renewal is lower than in the rest of the uk
voters can only conclude he would be prepared to trade uk 's security just to get his hands on the keys to downing street
' nick harvey defence spokesman sir nick harvey said he did not see any need for trident to be patrolling the seas 24/7 while the uk has ' no known nuclear adversary '
