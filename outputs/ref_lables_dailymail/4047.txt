uk 's first black prime minister will be a conservative , cameron will claim today
in a bid to woo ethnic minority voters , mr cameron will say the tories are the party of opportunity for people from all backgrounds who want to get on
he will also set out targets for ethnic minority recruitment designed to persuade voters the party is on their side
the party of the first jewish prime minister
and i know that , one day , we âre going to be the party of the first black or asian prime minister
it is designed to tackle the tories â long - standing difficulty in attracting support from uk âs growing ethnic minority electorate
the claim will be seen as a tacit endorsement of the leadership ambitions of culture secretary sajid javid ( pictured ) , the only current asian tory seen as a potential contender a report by the runnymede trust think - tank last week warned that suspicion of the tories among ethnic minority voters could cost the party nine seats at next month âs election and 50 within a decade
some senior tories believe mr cameron has done too little to address the party âs reputation among ethnic minority voters â and warn that the party could face similar problems to the us republicans unless it acts quickly
mr cameron will today pledge to ensure that , by the next election , at least 20 per cent of tory candidates in seats where a tory mp is standing down will be from an ethnic minority background
but the prime minister will today set targets to achieve 20 per cent ethnic representation in the recruitment of police officers
new targets will also be set to increase by 20 per cent the number of black and ethnic minority students going to university , being offered apprenticeships and getting jobs
