it claims irobot 's machines will interfere with its sensitive radio telescopes which astronomers are using to pick up signs of alien life
our quest for the perfect garden could be ruining our chances of making contact with et. this is according to the national radio astronomy observatory who is objecting to proposals by irobot to release a radio wave - guided lawnmower
irobot is famous for creating self - guided roomba machines the problem is the frequency band proposed for the lawnbot is 6240 - 6740 mhz - the same one several large radio telescopes operate on
' irobot , who has created self - guided roomba vacuum cleaners , has filed a request with the u.s. federal communications commission to use airwaves for its latest design
the massachusetts company says its vision is to create lawnmowers that are guided wirelessly from beacons on poles stuck into the lawn
astronomers that the frequencies irobot wants to use are the same as they use to detect methanol â a key sign of star formation
according to bloomberg , irobot claims the astronomers ' concerns are exaggerated and said the chances of its gardening technology will interfere with space exploration are ' infinitesimal '
but the national radio astronomy observatory argues that the frequencies irobot wants to use are the same as they use to detect methanol â a key sign of star formation
irobot has offered to place a notice in user manuals that states : ' consumer use only ; use must be limited to residential areas
irobot responded by saying : ' the national radio astronomy observatory observatories for the most part are not closely surrounded by residential areas , at least no residential areas with lawns
