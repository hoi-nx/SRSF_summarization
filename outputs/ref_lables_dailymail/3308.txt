a coroner has ruled that doctors and social services in charge of looking after ms donna , made five ' significant ' failures
but at the end of a three day inquest into their deaths , coroner lynch said that despite the family slipping under social services ' radar ' nothing could have be done ' to foresee the deaths ms lynch concluded at the end of a three - day inquest that ms donna , who suffered chronic anxiety , unlawfully killed her son
' the coroner identified five separate failures by doctors and nurses at the london and maudsley nhs foundation trust and croydon child protection services , who first came into contact with ms donna in late 2012
she also was using cocaine regularly for six months and became convinced she had caused lasting damage and her anxiety worsened , the inquest heard ms donna took an overdose of tablets while visiting a friend in rotherham , south yorkshire , on december 13 2012
after a follow up appointment back in london a few days later no - one liaised with rotherham and ms donna was not reassessed
as a result the maudsley nhs foundation trust failed to check on ms donna 's condition when she missed a number of appointments in early 2013
zaki 's grandmother , carol oettinger , wept as the the coroner recorded her daughter 's death as suicide and the unlawful killing of zaki
the coroner said : ' with respect to donna the only appropriate conclusion in this case is a matter of law i conclude to be one of suicide
' at the end of the hearing the coroner pleaded that the horrific nature of zaki 's death and its link to ms donna 's health did n't undo work to end stigma around mental illness
the mother and baby were seen lying on the tracks at a south london station , before their deaths ' zaki was a happy child who was very much loved by all those around him and would n't have had any time at all to understand what happened to him
no one could have fought harder than donna 's mother , carol , to try and get the care her daughter desperately needed when she became ill. ' the coroner has heard that there were serious shortcomings in care at the croydon mood anxiety and personality disorder team ( map ) which was managed by the london & maudsley nhs foundation trust
' nothing will bring donna and zaki oettinger back , but it is hoped that something may be learned from this family 's experiences given the detailed investigation that has since taken place
