newly - discovered medical records have finally revealed the fate of pre-raphaelite artist rossetti 's muse cornforth and how she died a tragic , death penniless death
the details of where and how the west sussex born model and mistress of rossetti died remained a mystery for years until her biographer recently tracked her down through hospital records
they revealed the orange - haired beauty - whose face graced many of her lover 's paintings - died in the sussex county asylum in poverty and suffering from clear symptoms of dementia
rossetti 's famous painting aurelia ' fazio 's mistress ' ( pictured ) was a portrait of his muse cornforth fair rosamund , painted in 1861 ( left ) , and 1886 's lady lilith ( right ) also used cornforth as the model the records revealed she died at the graylingwell hospital on february 24 , 1909 , at the age of 74
at the time of her death , she was suffering from ' senile mania , confusion , weak - mindedness and an inability to sustain a rational conversation , a poor memory and sleeplessness ' , the guardian reported
believing raphael , michelangelo and leonardo had proven a corrupting influence on art , they wanted to return to the intense colour and detailed compositions that characterised 15th century italian art. founded by william , john everett millais and rossetti , the trio later welcomed rossetti 's brother , william , james collinson , frederic george stephens and thomas woolner to their circle .
