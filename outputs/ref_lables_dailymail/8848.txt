labour will â never â walk away from the eu , ed miliband will say today
in a rare foreign policy speech , the labour leader will pledge to â restore our commitment â to the eu and other international groups such as the united nations
mr ed miliband has all but ruled out a referendum on european , saying it is â very unlikely â there will be a transfer of powers to the eu that would trigger one
and he will pledge to embrace the eu in a bid to secure reforms
â we will be rebuild our influence , and that starts with the eu , â he will say
â i want a clear message to be sent to our european partners that an incoming labour government will be serious about leading once again in european and serious also about reforming european
â leaving european would be profoundly damaging to the lives of our people and the future of our country
â his comments echo a controversial intervention this month by tony blair , who said britain âs membership of the eu was â too important â to put to a public vote
but ukip has insisted st george would be welcome in britain today because of his skills as a dragon slayer
mr oâflynn said : â well , i guess dragon - slaying is a skill but whether it is one that âs in short supply for the needs of the britain economy , we will leave to our migration commission
â the party said it wanted to end a â cultural self - loathing â about being proud to be english
â mr ed miliband âs decision to turn his back on a referendum has angered some senior labour figures , who fear it leaves the party looking dangerously out of touch with public opinion
but he will claim today that britain âs hopes of achieving reform in brussels have been weakened by mr david cameron âs pledge to hold an in / out referendum by the end of 2017
â this government âs approach to european means that even when britain âs interests are shared by other member states , eu leaders are reluctant to support us because they think we already have one foot out of the door , â he will say
in an incendiary claim he will warn that mr david cameron â has presided over the biggest loss of influence for our country in a generation â
but the labour leader will accuse the tories of failing to learn the lessons of the iraq war
he will also commit to putting climate change â at the core of labour âs foreign policy â , including pushing for costly targets to cut carbon emissions to zero
he told channel four news : â people like labour âs values and feel they are more in touch , but they have a problem about their record from the last government , and the last two years where people feel , fairly or not , that we allowed debt , borrowing and the deficit to run away from us
â lord mandelson also acknowledged there was â quite of lot of fear â among business leaders about the prospect of a labour government
mr ed miliband ( pictured above ) is accusing david cameron of â taking britain to the edge of european exit â with only david cameron or ed miliband in a position to be prime minister after the election , voters face a stark choice on immigration policy
