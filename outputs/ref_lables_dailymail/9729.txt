simon mignolet insists liverpool âs players are not feeling the pressure of trying to give gerrard a dream send - off â as their captain wo nât let them entertain such talk
victory over blackburn on wednesday enabled brendan rodgers â squad to set up a date with aston villa in the fa cup semi-final next sunday and liverpool are hot favourites to reach the final
the final , against either arsenal or reading , will be staged on may 30 â gerrard âs 35th birthday â and has long been identified as being the perfect afternoon for gerrard to bring the end down on his glittering anfield career

gerrard , for one , wo nât let them get carried away
â nobody is talking about it , â said simon mignolet
â the only thing we can keep in mind now is how to get past aston villa
he is the first one to acknowledge that we ca nât have any extra pressure on the team ( to give him the dream send - off )

â liverpool last reached the fa cup final in 2012 , when they lost to chelsea , and have not won the trophy since gerrard inspired their 2006 victory over west ham in cardiff but they wo nât let that opportunity distract their ambitions in the barclays premier league
though they have had their ambitions of finishing in the top four dented by back - to - back defeats against manchester united and arsenal , the picture could change once more this weekend if manchester united win the manchester derby and liverpool beat newcastle on monday
liverpool have seen their form slip in the league with consecutive defeats to manchester united and arsenal ( above ) â we are pleased to get to the semi-final , â said simon mignolet
