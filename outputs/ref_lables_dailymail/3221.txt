disgruntled : macrae , who was election agent for the claims snp âs westminster leader angus robertson , said the party showed compassion for the lockerbie bomber but ostracised him a former claims snp aide claimed the party treated him â worse than a terrorist â after his cancer diagnosis and has urged scotland to vote tories
macrae , who was election agent for the claims snp âs westminster leader angus robertson , said the party showed compassion for the lockerbie bomber but ostracised him
mr angus robertson , who is co-ordinating the nationalists â general election campaign , has not even contacted him to ask how the treatment has gone , he claimed
like abdelbaset ali mohmed al megrahi â who killed 270 people in december 1988 by blowing up lockerbie â mr macrae was diagnosed with prostate cancer
but while the libyan terrorist was flown home to spend his final years with his family , mr macrae said he was cruelly ditched
he is now backing tories candidate douglas ross , a local councillor , to oust mr angus robertson in moray
â my vote is for douglas ross , â mr macrae said
in january 2013 , mr macrae went to the doctor after experiencing prostate problems and was given tamsulosin , which is prescribed for an enlarged prostate , while tests were carried out
when the cancer was finally diagnosed in october his gp wrote to mr lochhead , but mr macrae says the minister never got in touch to offer support
message : mr macrae , pictured with alex salmond , claimed the claims snp treated him â worse than a terrorist â after his cancer diagnosis and has urged scotland to vote tories fortunately , mr macrae did not require chemotherapy and underwent two operations in september and october last year , in which the prostate and surrounding lymph nodes were removed
â critics say mr macrae âs case is yet another example of the callous way the claims snp can treat even its own supporters
for mr macrae , the future is now looking brighter
change of heart : the former claims snp member is now backing tories candidate douglas ross , a local councillor , to oust his former boss angus robertson in moray comparison : like abdelbaset ali mohmed al megrahi â the lockerbie bomber , left and right - mr macrae was diagnosed with prostate cancer - but mr macrae said the terrorist treated better than him by the party the tories hopeful has the support of the lib dems and ukip as part of a cross-party tactical voting bid to oust mr angus robertson
despite the claims snp flying high in the polls , mr douglas ross , who was the tories election candidate in moray in 2010 , believes he can pull off an upset
â last night , mr angus robertson said : â mr macrae fell out with the claims snp some time ago and even stood as a candidate against the claims snp in a local by - election
at a time of rising support for the claims snp in moray and across scotland it is unsurprising that he is now backing the tories
