after more than two years of inexorable decline the patience of tranmere 's faithful finally snapped when oxford moved decisively ahead , in an effortless manner reminiscent of the previous saturday 's boat race
the loathing was directed mainly at manager micky adams , who was announced on sunday morning to have left the club by ' mutual consent '
the tranmere players look down after the final whistle , as the prospect of relegation looms large this is how it ends in football sometimes : standing in the dugout having a season ticket thrown in your face by an incandescent supporter , who you then see given a standing ovation by some sections upon being escorted out
the fear involves dropping out of the football league a week on saturday after 94 years of membership , something which provoked an angry demonstration by some 150 supporters outside the gates afterwards
micky adams departs with two games to go and after a 3 - 0 defeat against a thoroughly professional oxford side the wirral 's only professional sports outfit are one point behind cheltenham and two behind hartlepool
relegation to the national league â the grand - sounding new title for the conference but do n't be fooled â may partly be down to prenton park legend and ex-manager ronnie moore , sacked by the club last season for a minor betting offence , and now masterminding hartlepool 's unlikely survival
and it could all happen under the ownership of former fa chief executive mark palios , knowledgeable football man and esteemed former tranmere player who took over the club late last summer
kemar roofe celebrates scoring , as a professional oxford side eased past sorry tranmere the battle between barnet and rovers to win automatic promotion to the football league will go down to the last game
barnet , who lead the conference by one point , have a home game against mid-table gateshead on saturday while rovers face a potentially more difficult match at home against fourth from bottom alfreton , who almost certainly need to win themselves to avoid being relegated
rovers looked as if they would head the table after the weekend âs games but conceded a goal with two minutes left to draw 1 - 1 at dover
that put barnet , who dropped out of the football league two seasons ago , in the driving seat after a 1 - 1 draw away to kidderminster
nobody questioned his judgement in october when , with the team bottom of the table , he replaced the inexperienced rob edwards with a seasoned operator like micky adams
micky adams played the selection and recruitment game like a man on the fruit machine , continually pulling the handle in the hope that the right combination would come up in alignment
it was not long after full - time that you could catch assistant manager rogers , part of a distinguished list of former tranmere players who graduated to a higher level , stripping the paint from the dressing room walls
micky adams has left the club by mutual consent , with tranmere bottom of the league with two games to go rogers â now in charge for the next fortnight â then had to deny that micky adams 's decision to dodge the media was of any significance
