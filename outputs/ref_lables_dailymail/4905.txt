it has been 40 years since the historic evacuation of the of saigon as the north vietnamese army descended upon the city , and among the many stories of heroism and bravery is that of a father who piloted a military helicopter to fly his family to safety
nguyen was able to fly a chinook , the largest helicopter in the south vietnamese army , with his three young children and wife out of the city and into the south china sea where they were all ultimately saved by the uss kirk
this after nguyen somehow managed to pilot the helicopter while getting out of his flight suit and jumping into the ocean just seconds before it crashed - all on his own
on april 29 , 1975 , nguyen moved his family to his mother - in - law 's house , telling them he would be back the next day in the chinook , and that they would hear him coming when he was close
shortly after however , they realized they were running low on fuel , and that is when nguyen reached out to the uss kirk asking for permission to land
' i must land or crash into the sea , ' nguyen said
' bravery : nguyen then flew back out to sea ( above ) and jumped from the helicopter safe : he managed to avoid the large amounts of shrapnel ( above ) when the plan crashed heading back : a motorboat soon grabbed him from the sea ( above ) as he wore just a shirt and his boxers the uss kirk however was not large enough to withstand the force of such a large helicopter , which would likely sink the ship and cause the death of everyone onboard
and so it was decided that nguyen would at least try and save his family
that is when he went back out to sea and managed to do the impossible and somehow pilot alone , get out of his suit and jump into the water seconds before the helicopter crashed and sent shrapnel flying everywhere
the nguyen family would be part of the 30,000 south vietnamese refugees ultimately rescued by the uss kirk
unbelievable : nguyen somehow managed to operate the plane and it 's intricate system ( above ) alone after everyone jumped over : ' it was a happy ending to a shi * * y war , ' said chipman , one of the sailors on the kirk of nguyen 's ( above ) feat that was just the beginning for nguyen though , who now had to start over in united states and try to support his family
' he was reunited with the crew from the uss kirk in 2009 , finally revealing his identity after keeping it secret for years , and awarded an air medal for bravery
