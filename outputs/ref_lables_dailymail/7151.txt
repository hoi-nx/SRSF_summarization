here , sportsmail looks at five winter - window arrivals who have disappointed for their new employers â¦ juan cuardrado arrived at chelsea for Â£ 23m from fiorentina but has failed to impress at stamford bridge juan cuadrado ( chelsea ) for a fee in the region of Â£ 23m and arriving from fiorentina with a reputation bloated by his impressive performance for colombia at last summer âs world cup , cuadrado was expected to help fire chelsea towards the premier league and champions league crowns
wilfried bony ( man city ) with sergio aguero perennially troubled by injury problems and edin dzeko about as reliable as his team - mate âs hamstrings , Â£ 28m swansea striker wilfried bony was supposed to be the man to take on the scoring mantle and see home man city âs defence of their title

the scotland international was one of the stars of wigan 's unlikely fa cup victory in 2013 he has nât featured for over a month and , in that time , west brom have slid back towards the relegation mire
