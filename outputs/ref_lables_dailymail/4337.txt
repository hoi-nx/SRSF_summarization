a mother managed to raise Â£ 2,000 in just 24 hours to pay a special helmet for her son , who was born with flat - head syndrome
kate roberts , 24 , noticed her son miles had a slightly different shaped head when he was born , and at three months , he was diagnosed with brachycephaly , also known as ' flat head syndrome '
doctors believe it is caused by babies sleeping on their back , and as it is not medically dangerous , the nhs does not pay for treatment
it is thought to be caused by babies sleeping on their back but after doing some research mrs thomas was shocked to discover the condition can lead to facial disfigurement and even blindness
the mother - of - two visited a private clinic and was told miles , now eight months , needed cranium orthosis treatment , known as ' helmet treatment ' , that costs around Â£ 2000
' miles was referred to sunderland hospital in january 2015 , where doctors carried out x-rays to rule out craniosynostosis , a more serious head condition that can cause headaches , learning difficulties and eye problems
they found he did not have this condition and diagnosed flat head syndrome
as it is a cosmetic , rather than medical problem , the nhs said it would not pay for treatment
doctors say if parents move their babies onto their tummies during the day , as well as changing them from different chairs , so there is n't constant pressure on the back of the head , the condition should improve within eight weeks
babies sometimes develop a flattened head when they 're a few months old , usually from sleeping on their back
it 's known as ' flat head syndrome ' or ' moulding '
source : nhs choices but mrs thomas became worried about the shape of miles ' head , and began researching the condition online
' ' we went to a private clinic and they said he could have serious facial disfigurement and that he could lose sight in his right eye
' the clinic recommended a treatment known as helmet therapy , in which babies wear a custom - built helmet which applies pressure to the bulging parts of the baby 's skull and relieves pressure from the flatter parts , allowing growth in these areas
the controversial treatment is not available on the nhs as doctors say there is not enough evidence it works if parents change their babies position in the day
worried about miles ' eyesight , mrs thomas decided to raise the money for the special helmet , which costs around Â£ 2,000
as flat head syndrome is considered a cosmetic problem , the nhs does n't fund treatment
but mrs thomas went to a private clinic who warned miles could lose his sight due to the condition thanks to donations from friends and strangers , miles will be fitted with a custom - built helmet later this month , which he will have to wear for six months to change the shape of his head ' a man from newcastle that i do n't even know donated Â£ 500 and simply wrote " hope this helps " as his message on the site
' miles will be fitted with a helmet on april 30th and will need to wear it for five to six months to change the shape of his head
mrs thomas said she is relieved her son will be treated and believes more research should be carried out into flat head syndrome
