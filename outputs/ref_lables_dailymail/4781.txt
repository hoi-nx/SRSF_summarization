walter smith is reluctant to predict a permanent end to hostilities
two years since he stepped down as chairman of rangers , the crackle of gunfire still reverberates in his ears
dave , the chairman - elect , has still to obtain the sfa clearance he needs for a seat in the boardroom
and the championship promotion play - offs threaten more landmines than the somme
yet before participating in the annual charity golf day of the john hartson foundation , the rangers icon expressed hope that the worst is over
that rangers can put down the circus tent and become a football club once more

' in the last three weeks there has been a lack of headlines and that 's the first step forward for rangers
' they have to get back to resembling rangers
no club wins all the time and rangers have had down periods before , even if this one is different
' they trust the people are there for rangers â and that 's a big start after three or four years of upset
' walter smith exposed himself to the crossfire when he returned â against his instincts â as chairman
asked if he would offer help or assistance to the new regime , walter smith said : ' i think they are unlikely to do that

the sfa are gathering evidence on this and until they pass judgment one way or the other , dave has agreed to stay off the rangers board
he does n't have to be chairman or run the show to invest cash , but walter smith believes it would be better if the two ran hand in hand
' the courts seem to think he 's ok , ' said walter smith on the issue
' dave has stepped in , so i do n't see things changing in terms of how rangers moves forward if he is officially or unofficially a part of it
they have obviously got to show a bit of care with rangers after what has gone on
i do n't think it will make a massive difference to rangers one way or the other
