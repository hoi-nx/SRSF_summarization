the last two ' doolittle ' presented the group 's congressional gold medal for permanent display at the national museum of the air force on saturday , 73 years to the day after their daring bombing attack on japan rallied us in wwii retired lt col richard ' dick ' cole , age 99 , gave the medal to the museum 's director in a ceremony at the museum attended by military and political officials and relatives of the original 80 raiders
the medal , awarded by congress earlier in the week , arrived in a ceremonial b - 25 flight
last month , lt col hite ( pictured ) , one of the three remaining raiders , died after a battle with alzheimer 's disease at the age of 95 retired staff sgt david thatcher , 93 , came from missoula , montana , for the event , and said the medal was for all 80
richard ' dick ' cole recalled wryly saturday that on the evening of april 18 , 1942 , david thatcher was on the beach in chinese helping save his crew after a crash - landing , ' and i was hanging in my parachute in a tree
david thatcher was engineer - gunner aboard the 7th plane , nicknamed ' the ruptured duck , ' whose crew 's crash - landing and evasion of japan troops in chinese was depicted in the movie thirty seconds over tokyo
david thatcher , who was played by robert walker in the movie while spencer tracy portrayed doolittle , chuckled as he recounted how the raiders had given little thought at the time of the raid about earning a place in history
in the years afterward , though , he said , they realized : ' it was an important event in wwii ' richard ' dick ' cole said : ' we proudly hand over our congressional gold medal to [ museum director retired lt gen ] hudson , who we trust will respectfully guard it and have it securely displayed ... for the world to see and appreciate
' their medal will join the museum 's diorama about their raid
' the doolittle , also known as the doolittle , on april 18 , 1942 , caused negligible material damage to japan the raid by the us boosted us morale in the wake of japan 's attack on pearl harbor on december 7 , 1941 three raiders have died since their 70th anniversary reunion at the museum in ohio , two of them this year
hite was also the last of the eight raiders who were captured by japan soldiers
three other raiders were killed soon after the bombing run , as most crash - landed or had to bail out
david thatcher joined richard ' dick ' cole and lt. col. saylor at the museum less than two years ago for a public ' final toast ' in which they lifted specially engraved silver goblets for the traditional toast of their reunions to those who have gone
the medal will join a diorama about the raid and museum director john hudson ( right ) pledged the story will live the doolittle , also known as the doolittle , on 18 april 1942 , was an air raid by the us during wwii the raid , led by lieutenant colonel james ' jimmy ' doolittle , caused negligible material damage to japan , but helped to boost a wounded nation 's morale in the aftermath of japan 's attack on pearl harbor on 7 december 1941
once at sea , the rest learned targets - factories , plants , military facilities on mainland japan
they knew the uncertainties : what if the navy task force was attacked ? what defences would they face ? and with b - 25s unable to land on a carrier decks , could they reach friendly bases in chinese ? aircraft : the raid , led by lieutenant colonel james ' jimmy ' doolittle , b-25b mitchell medium bomber launched without fighter escort from an aircraft carrier in the pacific the raiders brushed aside doolittle 's assurances that anyone was free to withdraw
they narrowly stayed ahead of japan searchers , who killed villagers suspected of helping the us
bird 's eye view : the 16 planes , loaded with one - ton bombs , would fly over military targets in japan and try to land in chinese with the hope that the chinese would help them to safety
