it has been almost 90 years since the electricity pylon as we know it was introduced into the uk
called the t - pylon ( artist 's illustration shown ) it is a third shorter than the old lattice pylons
but it is able to carry just as much power - 400,000 volts
it is designed to be less obtrusive and will be used for clean energy purposes national grid is building a training line of the less obtrusive t - pylons at their eakring training academy in nottinghamshire
uk 's first pylon , erected in july 1928 near edinburgh , was designed by architectural luminary sir reginald blomfield , inspired by the greek root of the word â pylon â ( meaning gateway of an egyptian temple )
these stand some 50 metres high , weigh around 30 tonnes and carry up to 400,000 volts of electricity over thousands of kilometres to some of the most exposed , weather - beaten parts of uk
each t - pylon measures about 115ft ( 35 metres ) tall - about a third shorter than the old pylons , which were about 165ft ( 50 metres ) tall
â despite being shorter , the new tower is able to transport a similar amount of power to its predecessor - 400,000 volts - and each arm can support 60 tonnes of weight
national grid is building a training line of six t - pylons at their eakring training academy in nottinghamshire despite being shorter , the new tower is able to transport a similar amount of power to its predecessor - 400,000 volts - and each arm can support 60 tonnes of weight despite being shorter , the new tower is able to transport a similar amount of power to its predecessor - 400,000 volts - and each arm can support 60 tonnes of weight
the new pylons wo nât replace the 88,000 lattice pylons currently in use ; rather , the national grid will use them separately
they plan to use the first t - pylons with the hinkley point c nuclear power station in somerset today there are more than 88,000 lattice pylons in the uk , including 22,000 on national grid âs main transmission network in england and wales
