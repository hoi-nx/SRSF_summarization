they have become one of the most irritating accessories carried by tourists in recent years , but it appears the selfie stick has been a nuisance for three decades
hiroshi ueda , a photographer who worked as an engineer for camera company minolta , claims that he first invented the selfie stick in the 1980s
he said he came up with the idea after struggling to get pictures of himself and his wife together while they were in europe
the ' extender stick ' , as he called it , was designed for use with new compact cameras that were being developed at the time
whether taking in a spectacular panorama , visiting a famous landmark or watching a concert ; the chances are your view has been ruined by a selfie stick on at least one occasion
now the situation may be about to get a whole lot worse , because there âs a next - generation stick that can grasp a tablet as well as a mobile phone
the supersized stick is available on the website accessory geeks for just $ 23 ( Â£ 16 ) , suggesting that they could be coming to a street near you soon
he added a mirror to the front of the camera so that photographers could see exactly what they were doing
despite being patented in 1983 , the extender stick failed to become a success - mainly due to the poor image quality it captured
but that did not stop mr hiroshi ueda from compiling a family album of family ' selfies ' using his device
perhaps ironically , apple - the company that could be blamed for kickstarting the selfie phenomenon by putting a camera on the front of its phones in the first place - has also banned them from its next conference
mr hiroshi ueda used his ' extender stick ' to take pictures of himself with his family while on holiday in europe ( above ) modern versions of the extender stick allow a smartphone to be held aloft and use a remote trigger to take the photograph or video
mr hiroshi ueda 's patent ran out in 2003 , however , so he has not benefited from the recent boom
mr hiroshi ueda said : ' my idea came too early , but that 's just one of those things
