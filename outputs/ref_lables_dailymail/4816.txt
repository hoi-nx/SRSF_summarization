binge drinking as a teenager can cause long - lasting damage to the brain well into adulthood , a new study has warned
this is because drinking excessive amounts of alcohol when young can damage the brain and cause permanent changes to dna
alcohol changes genes in brain cells , which stop the cells developing connections between them , altering behaviour , they said
however , they discovered a cancer drug may reverse the damage
binge drinking as a teenager can cause long - lasting damage into adulthood , putting young people at risk of anxiety disorders and alcoholism professor pandey , of the university of illinois college of medicine , explained that binge drinking during the teenage years disrupts the brain 's normal development
he said : ' our study provides a mechanism for how binge - drinking during adolescence may lead to lasting changes that result in increased anxiety and alcoholism in adults
' intermittent alcohol exposure ' degrades the ability of the brain to form the connections it needs to during adolescence , he explained
alcohol causes changes in the dna in brain cells
however , researchers discovered a cancer drug may be able to reverse the changes they showed increased anxiety - like behaviours and drank more alcohol in adulthood
professor pandey explained that epigenetic changes are chemical modifications of dna , or of the proteins around which dna is wound , like thread on a spool
genes that lie within dna that is tightly wrapped around the histones are less active than if the dna is loosely wrapped
these epigenetic changes were linked to lowered expression of a gene that nerve cells need in order to form new connections between cells , known as synaptic connections
but a cancer drug known to block the activity of hdac2 could be used to treat them , he said
