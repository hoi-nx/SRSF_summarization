as one might imagine , benitez 's arrival at stamford bridge as interim manager in 2012 came as quite a slap in the face to chelsea fans still hurting from roberti di matteo 's untimely departure just months after winning the champions league
this was a man who had beaten the blues in two champions league semi-finals with drab defensive tactics - meaning that a sub-standard liverpool side reached two finals , while jose mourinho 's team of world class individuals missed out
benitez is set to leave napoli this summer and will have a host of clubs after his services benitez was made chelsea interim manager in 2012 but it 's fair to say the fans never warmed to him cody taylor is a fan writer on 90min.com he did little to bring the support on - side in his the first few weeks either
chelsea drew benitez 's first two games 0 - 0 , before a 3 - 1 defeat against west ham in a london derby - embarrassing
benitez also managed to get a better return from fernando torres - a player that was pretty much useless at chelsea before and after
people often forget that in 2011/12 chelsea finished 6th in the premier league - the lowest in 10 years - a fact conveniently masked by two cup wins
as chelsea fans , we certainly did n't like him , but looking back we hate to think what might have happened without him
benitez got the best out of his squad for the rest of the season and he got the best out of fernando torres chelsea won the europa league in 2013 under benitez after beating benfica in amsterdam one chelsea fan thanks benitez for his efforts on the last day of the season in 2013 at stamford bridge the rumours are that he could now be on for a return to the premier league - he knows english football inside out and would actually be perfect for several clubs
