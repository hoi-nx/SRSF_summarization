a vaccine has been developed to help prevent the recurrence of prostate cancer a vaccine has been developed to help prevent the recurrence of prostate cancer , and potentially other cancers
it 's designed to teach the immune system to recognise compounds found in prostate cancer cells and is being given to men who have already been treated for the cancer
the vaccine is made from pieces of a protein called tarp that 's found in about 95 per cent of prostate cancers
animal studies have shown that the protein can effectively stimulate the immune system to attack the cancer
the thinking is that the vaccine will prime the immune system so that it creates antibodies when it detects tarp - related cancers
then , should the cancer reappear , the antibodies will be dispatched to attack the malignant cells
those antibodies , along with other immune cells , can then destroy cancer cells without harming non-cancer cells , so minimising side - effects
it is initially being tested as a way to treat cancer that has returned but , if successful , could be used as a first line treatment for prostate and potentially breast cancer in the future
tarp is also found in about 50 per cent of breast cancers
prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the britain , with more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year
researchers at the u.s. national cancer institute are using the vaccine on 70 men who have been treated for the cancer , but whose psa is rising again ( posed by model ) once they have been treated , men are monitored with regular blood tests that check for a protein called prostate specific antigen or psa , which can indicate cancer
the number of men in britain with , or who have had , prostate cancer professor raj persad , urology consultant at the bristol urological institute , says that the idea of boosting the body 's own immune defences is an ' excellent strategy ' for preventing a recurrence of the disease
the theory is that the vaccine stimulates the immune system , which then spots and attacks the hpv virus and the warts it had previously overlooked .
