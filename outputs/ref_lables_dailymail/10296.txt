when a young mum posted images of her post-pregnancy body on instagram to inspire others , she might have anticipated a raft of supportive comments for her bravery
hannah moore , 20 , from broxburn in west lothian , did n't get that far though ; her images of the stretchmarks on her tummy were vetoed by the world 's biggest photo - sharing website within minutes of her posting them
the mum - of - twins claims her account was deleted because the images were deemed to contain inappropriate ' nudity and violence ' which breach the site 's decency guidelines
she gave birth to twin girls lily and grace ( pictured above with fiance david johnstone , 22 ) in june last year hannah moore suffered from stretch marks after giving birth to twin girls lily and grace with fiance david johnstone , 22 , in june last year
hannah moore said : ' nobody could get on my instagram and nobody could search for it so someone had obviously reported the picture for nudity - all it was was a picture of my belly and it has just took my confidence away
' it 's yet another example of instagram coming under fire for refusing to publish certain images , particularly photos that are dedicated to showing the female form in its most honest state
shots of menstrual blood , stretchmarks following childbirth , pubic hair and naked breasts have all felt the wrath of the site 's censors
just last week , instagram , which boasts 300 million monthly users , announced that it has toughened up its rules on the types of pictures users can post in a bid to cut down on pornography and harassment
samm newman received an apology from instagram for removing these images of her in her underwear
a spokesman for the site said : ' we know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature , but for a variety of reasons , we do nât allow nudity on instagram
one rule for one : images such as the shot above , taken from the picture stream of us social media star dan bilzerian , appear liberally on the site star support : willow smith joined the campaign to use images of bare breasts by tweeting this picture on her @ officialwillow twitter page last year the # freethenipple campaign saw a host of web users staging their protests against what they perceived as sexism by instagram ' this includes photos , videos , and some digitally - created content that show sexual intercourse , genitals , and close - ups of fully - nude buttocks
tonje says you do n't need to wander very far on instagram to find images of photos of other women in a similar pose , which have all been published by the site , leading to accusations that she was discriminated against because she was bigger than some of the bikini models who feature
elsewhere , earlier this year , an australian media agency sticks and stones claimed the site had removed one of its images which showed two women wearing bikinis and showing some pubic hair
ainsley hutchence , the agency 's director , said at the time : ' unfortunately instagram has ruled out natural hair that appears on all bodies of women that do n't trim their bikini lines
' this shot , published by australian media agency sticks and stones , was banned by instagram for showing public hair
' we know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature , but for a variety of reasons , we do nât allow nudity on instagram
' its censoring filter may have received attention but as our images show , there are plenty of photos that might cause offense that have made it through : when global music star bublã© posed in front of a female in miami last week to deliberately highlight her bottom , the image was promptly published to his million - strong following on instagram
many instagram users will be baffled as to why an image depicting a woman who is practically topless , as her shirt is tied beneath her bust , has been allowed to stay on the site
hypocritical ? instagram says it does n't allow nudity on the site , yet enables shots such as the above to appear on the page of us poker player dan bilzerian only words , say instagram ... this image promoting the use of guns was published by user andygotphotos beyond the pale ? a young user came under fire for describing her father as her ' man crush monday ' every day
despite ongoing bloodshed in syria , positive messages and pictures of the country 's president , bashar al-assad , are regularly uploaded to the site , with no objections from instagram
