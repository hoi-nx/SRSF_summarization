parametric speakers use ultrasonic waves to create a very narrow , audible beam , which should only be heard by one sleeper , allowing their partner to continue to doze
the alarm clock pivots ( pictured ) to make sure it targets a person accurately , even if a couple are cuddled up the wakä alarm is affixed to the wall behind the bed
â wakä uses a parametric speaker ( like a laser beam of sound ) to deliver focused , soothing sounds that start quietly , and grow louder slowly as the light beam grows brighter , â according to the device âs kickstarter page

â you can always snooze or deactivate any alarm using the wakä app. â the wakä app works like a regular alarm clock app so users can say how and when they want to wake up , hit the snooze button and , importantly , tell the device which side of the bed they sleep on
the alarm costs $ 250 ( Â£ 167 ) to pre-order on kickstarter and is due to ship in september
