finding the time to exercise when you 've got heaps of housework - and laundry - piling up can be difficult , but this piece of gym kit means you 've got no excuse not to work up a sweat
china designers have developed an contraption called the bike washing machine that contains a washing machine drum in its front wheel
china designers have developed a washing machine so cyclists can clean clothes while exercising ( above ) a generator inside the bike also creates electricity which can be stored for future use
the designers , based at dalian nationalities university , do not say whether the bike will automatically fill and drain with water too
by changing the front wheel of the exercise bike into a washing machine drum it will spin as the user pedals a generator attached to the pedals ( shown above ) also produces electricity which can be stored for later use the invention could also find use in remote areas where people do not have access to reliable supplies of electricity
they said : ' riding a bike is a popular exercise , washing laundry is something that you might do on daily basis or at least once a week , unless you keep buying new clothes and underwear , so why not combine them into a single useful equipment / appliance ? the designers say the device is perfect for those struggling to find space for both a washing machine and an exercise bike ' bike washing machine combines a stationary bicycle and washing machine , you can exercise while at the same time simultaneously washing your clothes
' when you ride this bike , the pedalling motion causes the drum of the washing machine to rotate , at the same time , the superfluous electricity is generated which can be used to power the display screen or stored for future use
the wheel washing machine , dreamed up by south korean designer ryu , would also generate electricity that could be used to power other household appliances
