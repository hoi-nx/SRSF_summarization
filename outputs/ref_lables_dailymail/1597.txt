lib dems leader lib dems , making play dough at tops day nursery , corfe mullen in dorset , said he would demand education spending be protected from cuts as the price of propping up another coalition mr lib dems said the first of what he dubbed his ' premier league policies ' is a Â£ 5billion commitment to protect the entire education budget in real terms
the first of what he dubbed his ' premier league policies ' , which the party would insist upon as a condition of propping up a government , is a Â£ 5billion commitment to protect the entire education budget in real terms
it would mean raising spending on education every year from 2018 onwards and at all stages ' from cradle to college ' , which goes further than the tories or labour have promised
mr lib dems said : ' i can confirm a lib dems red line â a pre-condition for government â is increasing spending on education
the pledge would mean raising spending on education every year from 2018 onwards and at all stages ' from cradle to college ' , which goes further than the tories or labour have promised the lib dems admitted today that their best hope is to end up with 30 - something mps after may 7 , compared with the 57 elected in 2010 inviting criticism that the rest of his policies are all negotiable , he said he would fight for everything in the manifesto but that ' here are some premier league policies and others which do n't assume quite the same significance '
a promise on education spending is intended to win over floating voters in key seats where the lib dems are facing the tories , to capitalise on concerns about cuts to public services
mr lib dems would not comment on numbers of seats and simply said his party would do better than dire opinion polls suggest .
