sharmeena : the teenager flew in secret to syria the jihadi bride who persuaded three friends to follow her to syria was brought up in a strict muslims household which turned to islamic state apologists cage when she disappeared , it emerged yesterday
sharmeena begum , 15 , was raised by her uncle miah , a devout muslims and former religious scholar
he blames the airport authorities , police and her school for letting sharmeena flee the country last december , flying from gatwick to turkey before crossing the border to syria
it is where sharmeena lived with him , her mother shahnaz â until her death from cancer aged 33 last year â and her grandmother , jahanara , 66
close to tears , he disclosed how his niece used Â£ 1,000 to go to syria , money given by relatives after her mother âs death as a traditional gift in bangladesh families to show respect for the deceased
â at first her nan â my mother â kept the money safe
â she also pressed to keep her passport in her bedroom and we allowed that too
if her mother had not died , she would never have had money to go
â she grew up in my house with her mother shahnaz , my sister

mr miah has been interviewed by police about his missing niece and the disappearance of her three classmates : shamima begum , 15 , kadiza sultana , 16 , and amira , 15 , earlier this year
it is thought that sharmeena was the ringleader , inspiring the other three to follow her to syria
she boarded a plane for syria from heathrow on the same saturday which sharmeena flew from gatwick
this girl âs parents alerted police , the jet was stopped on the runway and she was removed
but her uncle denies his devotion to islamic influenced sharmeena
he has already been asked by police if she was radicalised at home
â he feels let down by police and the school , alleging that neither care about sharmeena â because she is a muslims girl â
i am really scared of what they might do to me if i am blamed for her going to syria
i do nât think she will ever be allowed to return to our home
â we realised she was abroad and i rang the local police , who said she was a missing girl who would come home , â said mr miah
â i also feel let down by the authorities , who allowed sharmeena out to syria and then three of her friends , all from the same school
â i said parents should be warned their daughters might go to syria
â frustrated , mr miah turned to officials at cage , who told him sharmeena went to syria â to get married â or â for radicalisation â by is
â we think only of sharmeena and worry if she has enough food to eat in syria
