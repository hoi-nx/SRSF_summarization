a pair of turkey - sized â egg thief lizards â dubbed romeo were found lying next to each other in a 75 - million - year - old rock in the mid- 90s , but it has taken until now for experts to determine the sex of the ' lovers '
now , researchers believe they have come up with a way to tell fossils of small feathered male dinosaurs from those of females
they say that the key differences between the sexes lie in bones near the base of the tail
a pair of turkey - sized â egg thief lizards â dubbed romeo were found lying next to each other in a 75 - million - year - old rock ( pictured ) in the mid- 90s
palaeontologists led by persons ( pictured ) believe they can tell males and females apart from certain tail bones paleontologistsat the university of alberta examined a pair of fossils found in mongolia , which were first described in 2001
â because soft anatomy seldom fossilises , a dinosaur fossil usually provides no direct evidence of whether it was a male or a female
examples include the fans of peacocks , the tall crests of roosters or the long tail feathers of some birds of paradise , which are used to attract and court mates
they are almost always much larger in males who do the courting , than in females , who do the choosing
they suggest that male oviraptors had broader and longer chevron bones in their tails so they could shake their feather - tipped tail to woo potential mates ( illustrated ) , much like modern peacocks the team theorised that like birds , small feathered dinosaurs such as oviraptors used long feathers on their tails to attract mates , rather than for flying
after studying the fossils carefully , his team found signs of sexual dimorphism in the length and shape of blade - like bones called chevrons , which point downwards from the vertebrae near the base of the tail
the researchers suspect that male oviraptorosaurs shook their tail feathers in intricate displays to woo potential mates , akin the behaviour of modern - day peacocks
their mating ritual may bear some resemblance to that of small feathered dinosaurs scientists have shown that peacocks ( stock image ) shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear scientists have shown that peacocks shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear
male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers , with males shrieking out in response
â we discovered that , although both oviraptors were roughly the same size , the same age and otherwise identical in all anatomical regards , â romeo â had larger and specially shaped tail bones , â mr persons said
â by comparison , the second specimen , juliet , had shorter and simpler tail bones , suggesting a lesser capacity for peacocking , and has been interpreted as a female
according to persons , the two may very well have been a mated pair , making for a romantic story , as the dinosaur couple was preserved side by side for more than 75 million years
