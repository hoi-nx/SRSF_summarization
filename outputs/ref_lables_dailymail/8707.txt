founded by former nida graduate shannon dooley , 30 , the aerobics classes with a twist are all about ' making fitness fabulous '
described as ' freestyle aerobic workout , ' retrosweat is inspired by the era of old - school vhs workouts made famous by jane fonda , and involves choreography to match the eighties soundtrack
' there 's a fusion of jogging , jumping , athletic movement and dance - and a lot of huffing and puffing ' says shannon dooley
' eighties alter ego : shannon dooley says class goers tend to adopt a complete alter ego as their costume collection grows iconic : olivia newton-john 's aerobic anthem let 's get physical inspired many a skimpy lycra ensemble ' being freestyle though , i like to change up the tracks and let people request songs , but also give people the structure of the same key moves each week
' and according to shannon dooley , there 's nothing else like it on the market
' what makes it different is it 's theatrical - people can come into a space that âs all about the 1980s and escape 2015 for an hour , ' says shannon dooley
' and it 's not just for those stuck in a eighties time warp either
' overall shannon dooley says people just like to come along because they love eighties music , want to put an amazing costume on , feel fabulous - and release endorphins - ' it âs one big healthy party ! ' when asked where she got her inspiration , surprisingly it was n't from watching her mum do jane fonda workouts
diva demographic : shannon dooley say there 's no set demographic - attendees include men and women aged from their twenties to sixties ' no strangely
my mum was actually an amazing tap dancer so while all my friends were in aerobics classes i watched my mum do tap exams , ' says shannon dooley
' on her own wardrobe , shannon dooley takes her job very seriously , admitting she 's never worn the same outfit twice , ' an i 've been teaching for three years - so yes my lycra costumes take up a whole room now ' - ( 65 leotards to be precise )
fit and fun : shannon dooley says unlike treadmill workouts , retrosweat is about having fun and forgetting it 's fitness ' i like to set the standards through my face , hair and body so people feel invited to be themselves , ' she says
aside from the costumes , music and theatrics , shannon dooley also throws in some novelty competitions and spin off seventies and nineties classes to mix it up for regular aerobic goers
fonda fitspo : shannon dooley credits jane fonda as one of her main sources of inspiration behind retrosweat ' when we do seventies class i will mix it up with a disco ball ! ' shannon dooley says the seventies and nineties nights she likes to throw in for good measure and to mix up the moves , as well as give herself a break from eighties decade for a bit
' my class is all about the simplicity of moves ' : shannon dooley says those with two left feet wo n't have any difficulty ' a lot of exercise these days is scientific , counting reps and scooping protein powder
my exercise has always been jumping on my bed and having fun , and i know there is a big group out there that has brains that work the same as mine , ' says shannon dooley
shannon dooley now runs additional side business ' dial - a - sweat ' where she takes hens parties for a class , and has travelled all around sydney from bowral , newport and kirrabilli overlooking the harbour bridge
and with two current locations in alexandria and surry hills that run weekly ( and bondi for a while ) , shannon dooley believes the demand is strong and she already has her eyes on even bigger things
