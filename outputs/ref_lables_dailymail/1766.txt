locke will be confirmed as killie âs permanent manager on friday - exactly eight weeks after he was asked to take charge until the end of the season
an announcement will be made by the rugby park club on friday morning , with the former hearts boss being given a three - year deal
and on thursday the 39 - year - old paid tribute to the players whose efforts have helped him win favour with new chairman mann since he replaced johnston on a caretaker basis in february
killie will confirm locke as the club 's new permanent manager on friday â i âd be over the moon to get it as it âs something i âve worked hard towards , â said locke while negotiations were being finalised at the ayrshire club
i âm fortunate i was put into this position at a great club
â i âve got broad shoulders and i know what to expect but i ca nât praise the players highly enough
â ex-killie and hearts player locke , who was crestfallen not to be retained by the tynecastle club as head coach after they were relegated last season , added : â ( coaches ) alan robertson and billy thomson have done a fantastic job in helping me , too
â locke , who returned to rugby park last summer , had been working as no 2 under johnston when the manager announced in february that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season , indicating that the Â£ 150,000 sale of teenage forward robbie muirhead to dundee united had been a factor in his decision
after johnston was immediately relieved of his duties by the club hierarchy , assistant locke was put in charge and was initially regarded as a stop - gap appointment
but he quickly won over the players and a team that had previously been struggling in the league went unbeaten in their first six games under his stewardship
they only suffered their first reverse under locke when ross county beat them 2 - 1 in dingwall two weeks ago
killie went unbeaten during locke 's first six games in charge of the club he has impressed mann not only with results but with the way he has conducted himself during his two months at the helm
killie are currently eighth in the premiership and still remain in the hunt for a top - six place
it was expected that locke would have been appointed permanently before now , but he dismissed reports that talks had stalled due to a clause that would see him sacked if the club failed to achieve a top - six finish this season
â having resolved his own situation , locke will next week turn his attention to the futures of nine first - team players at killie â manuel pascali , alexei eremenko , craig slater , craig samson , sammy clingan , greg kiltie , conor brennan , chris chantler and mark oâhara â who will become free agents this summer
