the future of murray âs coaching arrangement with amelie mauresmo looks shrouded in doubt after he confirmed that they will take a prolonged break from each other after wimbledon
amelie mauresmo , who is expecting a baby in august , will be replaced by bjorkman in the lead - up to the us open and quite possibly after that , depending on how she assesses her priorities
the 27 - year - old scot , who is in munich for this week âs bmw open and joined in the 100 - year celebrations at the iphitos tennis club on monday night , parted company with lendl last year because the czech was no longer able to spend half the year travelling

murray originally considered bjorkman as a replacement for lendl so if their current trial works well , it is likely he will take a more significant role than as an assistant to amelie mauresmo
it quickly became clear to murray that the respected bjorkman might be used in an increased capacity after amelie mauresmo told him in february that , eight months after they had formalised their agreement , she was expecting â initially saying she had â something personal â to tell him
â murray and amelie mauresmo look likely to part ways when his coach gives birth later on in the year jonas bjorkmann ( left ) will work with murray until the end of the us open and then maybe longer amelie mauresmo is not in munich this week for murray âs first tournament on the clay since he got married
