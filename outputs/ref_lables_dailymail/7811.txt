from identical shirts to shaving razors , deodorant and even children 's chocolate , a new website has exposed that australian women are paying more than men for the same everyday consumer goods
since campaigning group getup launched gender price gap website last week , members and everyday consumers have identified nine separate products that have identical female versions which cost more
getup 's new website , gender price gap , has exposed nine everyday items that cost more for women this is despite the products being identical in almost every way except whether they are targeted towards women or men however , the exact same shirt advertised under the men 's clothing section is advertised for only $ 49.95
meanwhile a packet of five gillette disposable razors for women was photographed costing $ 4.50 at a supermarket while the men 's version , a packet of 10 disposables identical in everything but colour , cost $ 8.91
i 'm not privy to the conversations going on in these organisations , so i 'm not sure , but i dare say that if they can find a way to make a profit on women 's products by making them cost more , then they 'll probably continue doing it
