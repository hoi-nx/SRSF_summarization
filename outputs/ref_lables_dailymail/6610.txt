mcilroy âs official coronation will come at augusta national on sunday if he wins the masters 2015 to complete the career grand slam and consign the tiger woods era to the history books
that âs because each of mcilroy âs four major victories so far has come on courses which have been subjected to heavy rain at some point during the week
wet conditions hand mcilroy a massive advantage : his huge hitting with sky - high ball flight means he can still fly his ball miles
mcilroy shields himself from the rain on tuesday - but a wet course will play into his hands augusta national looks at its finest in the sun , but the world no 1 has won all of his four majors after rain and that is no good at augusta national , where precise approaches are vital to the most strategically demanding greens in major championship golf
only his second masters but played augusta national many times as a college student
tiger woods ( 45 - 1 ) â ok , so no - one knows which tiger woods will turn up , but this could be one of the all - time cheeky punts
bubba watson , with two wins in three years , scott and angel cabrera are all big - hitting recent champions , but examine the list of leaderboards in recent years and you âll find them dominated by players whose favourite club in the bag is driver
mother nature looks set to smile on mcilroy again this week with heavy rain forecast , particularly on friday and saturday
bubba watson 's power has taken him to two masters victories , but his last title defence ended badly tiger woods has the skill set to succeed for a fourth time at augusta national , but he must answer big questions mcilroy ( 6 - 1 ) heads that pack , closely followed by bubba watson ( 11 - 1 )
australia âs jason day ( 14 - 1 ) and scott ( 20 - 1 ) , and sweden âs stenson ( 22 - 1 ) are joined by american gunslingers dustin johnson ( 16 - 1 ) and jimmy walker ( 22 - 1 ) as the big hitters who have shown best form so far this year
the masters , played on the modern - day augusta national , is the one major of the year where a formula for a winner can be identified : long driving + strong early season form + course experience + the week of their lives = green jacket
brooks koepka ( 5 - 1 ) â it âs always tough to know how a player with no experience of augusta national will take to the place , but this monster - hitter looks to have the perfect game
their only problem is that mcilroy has used it to taste success on four occasions in majors , and bubba watson two , while they are all still waiting to dine at the top table
jason day has a brilliant record at augusta national and the final step left for the australia to take is victory dustin johnson 's colossal power means he has the weapon most needed to conquer augusta national jimmy walker chips onto the second green during practice , and could be set for a big week but the pressure is mounting on mcilroy as he bids for golfing immortality
defending champion : bubba watson ( 11 - 1 ) bookies â favourite : mcilroy ( 6 - 1 ) best bets : jason day ( 14 - 1 ) dustin johnson ( 16 - 1 ) jimmy walker ( 22 - 1 )
