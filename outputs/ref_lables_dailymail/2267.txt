prison officials must treat an inmate 's gender identity condition just as they would treat any other medical or mental health condition , the justice department said in a court filing friday
the southern poverty law center in february filed a lawsuit against georgia department of corrections officials on behalf of diamond , a transgender woman

prison officials must treat an inmate 's gender identity condition just as they would treat any other medical or mental health condition , according to a justice department ruling in the case of transgender inmate diamond a photo of diamond compared to her georgia department of corrections mugshot shows the drastic difference without maintaining treatment the justice department filed a brief in the case friday saying it 's not taking a position on the accuracy of diamond 's claims , but reminding prison officials that the eighth amendment of the u.s. constitution requires them to provide inmates with individualized assessment and care for the condition
' diamond , who 's 36 , has identified as female since she was a child and began hormone therapy when she was 17 , the lawsuit says
only inmates identified as transgender during their initial intake screenings are eligible for gender dysphoria treatment under georgia department of corrections policy , but the personnel who do those screenings often are n't familiar with the condition , the lawsuit says
despite having noticeable feminine physical characteristics and telling department staff she was transgender and receiving hormone therapy , diamond was not evaluated for gender dysphoria and was n't referred for treatment and her hormone therapy was halted , the lawsuit says
though medical personnel subsequently evaluated her and determined she had gender dysphoria and that hormone therapy and female gender expression were medically necessary , department officials refused to authorize the treatment , the lawsuit says
