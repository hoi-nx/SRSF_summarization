pellegrini should be given the chance to turn things around at city next season , according to neville
the former united defender has been critical of pellegrini 's side in recent weeks as the reigning premier league champions have seen their chances of retaining the crown slip following a dismal run of form and results
but , despite the chilean being the favourite with many bookmakers to be the next managerial casualty and jurgen klopp available in the summer after announcing he is to leave borussia dortmund , it is understood city chiefs are not entertaining the idea of replacing pellegrini at present
pellegrini should be ' able to correct the things that have gone wrong ' , according to neville and neville , talking at a budweiser dream goal event in regent 's park , believes keeping faith in pellegrini would bring some much - needed stability to the etihad stadium
' i hope that pellegrini stays at city and i hope he is able to correct the things that have gone wrong in the last four months
' he used the term " garbage " in recent weeks when discussing city 's form and four wins in 15 games for a club like city is not right and i hope he stays to correct the performances and can complete the job
but sky sports pundit neville has backed pellegrini and says only minor changes need to happen this summer ' these players are n't finished , this team are n't finished
' the premier league holders sit fourth in the league , 12 points adrift of chelsea after two straight losses
