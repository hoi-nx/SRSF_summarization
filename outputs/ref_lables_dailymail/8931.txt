the renowned sports psychiatrist dr peters claims he did little more than give trott the tools to rebuild his england career
warwickshire batsman trott touched down in the west indies with england on thursday night , back in the international set - up for the first time since leaving last winter 's ashes tour with a stress - related illness
trott has spoken openly of his struggles since , but has slowly rehabilitated his career with both warwickshire and the england lions and is now on the brink of returning to tests
trott returns to the england set - up for the first time since taking a break with a stress - related illness the 33 - year - old has worked extensively with dr peters during the last year , learning from a man who has done notable work with the british cycling team , liverpool and ronnie o'sullivan , and who introduced the ' chimp paradox ' in a bid to help people better manage their own minds
but speaking in the independent , peters said there is no magic cure and that trott had worked hard to counter his problems , which he described as ' situational anxiety '
dr peters worked with the batsman and gave him the necessary tools to return to the game ' he 's an incredible cricketer
you can have periods in sport , sometimes a whole season , when things just are n't happening and you 're just digging even harder to make it happen again - that 's effectively what trott has done
trott has impressed since returning for warwickshire and the england lions , earning his return to the squad ' from a psychological point of view , trott is quite robust and certainly determined
' peters , who helped mentor the golden generation of british cyclists and also worked with ronnie o'sullivan for his last two world titles , can see no reason why trott will not make a successful return to test cricket
peters ( left ) has worked with liverpool , ronnie o'sullivan and the england football team in recent years ' he was very open , hard - working , and what i effectively told him to do was to get some insights into the way his mind was working
