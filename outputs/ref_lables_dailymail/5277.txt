comedian rik mayall failed to leave a valid will to deal with his Â£ 1.2 million estate , which experts say could leave his family with a large inheritance tax bill
rik mayall , who played scheming tories mp alan bâstard in itv series the new statesman , and a host of other comedy characters , died suddenly aged 56 last june
but probate records reveal he had no will â even though he suffered serious head injuries and nearly died in a quad - bike accident in 1998 â which could mean complications for his wife of 29 years , barbara , and their three adult children
lawyers have always advised that people should have a valid will to avoid tax pitfalls
rik mayall , one of the leading â alternative â comics of the 1980s , surprised doctors by making a good recovery after his accident and returned to work in 1999 , but he developed epilepsy and took daily medication
rik mayall ( pictured ) died suddenly aged 56 last june his personal estate would be divided according to government intestacy rules , which take into account marital status , children or surviving relatives
kidd , a specialist probate solicitor and partner in south-west london law firm clintons , said that rik mayall âs children would be automatically entitled to a share of his net estate of Â£ 1,192,701 after funeral and legal expenses , meaning they could inherit an amount liable for inheritance tax
but mr kidd said the amount of any tax payable would depend on the value of rik mayall âs chattels or personal belongings which would go to his wife under intestacy rules
mr kidd said that the rules for a married father like rik mayall meant his wife would be due to receive Â£ 250,000 plus all his â chattels â , which would include any personally owned cars , furniture , ornaments , books and jewellery
by law , rik mayall âs children would then automatically get half the remaining value of the estate , creating a potential tax bill if the amount is more than the inheritance tax limit of Â£ 325,000
rik mayall âs widow would have received a life interest in the remaining half â meaning she could not touch or transfer that money but could claim interest on it
mr kidd added that rik mayall âs family could seek to avoid the tax by drawing up a deed of variation to split up his estate , reducing any sum left to the children so it was below the tax threshold
mrs mayall declined to discuss the estate and the apparent lack of a will
