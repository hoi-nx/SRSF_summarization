but while we 're all well aware of the presence of dust mites lingering in every corner of our house , little do we know just how prevalent they are and how detrimental they are to our health
new research has shown that the average australians sheds the equivalent of a 50 gram packet of chips every week in dry skin , feeding an army of dust mites into our couches and beds
sleeping soundly ? an army of dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions what lies in your bed ? the oddly - shaped dust mites live for three to four months and live off human and animal skin dust mites are the number one cause of allergies in australians homes and may be the reason why you have a runny nose or watery eyes
the odd shaped critters increase two to three fold during late autumn to winter leading thousands of australians to suffer from common cold or flu - like symptoms
putting it into perspective , more than 1,000 dust mites live in just one metre square of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime
they live for three to four months and feed off animal and human dead skin
disgustingly , dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions
where you lay your head : an average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time , however it 's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions , but their droppings an average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time , however it 's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions but their droppings
considering the average australians breathes 22,000 times a day , draws 12,000 litres of air into their lungs each day and spends 90 per cent of their time indoors , dust mites are a huge problem when it comes to keeping healthy in the colder months
new research by yahoo , which polled 1,187 readers on their sheet - washing habits , indicates that just 44 per cent of women wash their sheets on a weekly basis - however scientists recommend a weekly wash as the minimum needed to ensure a totally bacteria - free environment
according to dr philip tierno , jr. , the director of clinical microbiology and immunology at new york university âs langone medical center , after just one night of use , your bed sheets can accumulate a horrifying array of dead skin , bacteria , fungus , mites , and even faeces
the harsh reality : putting it into perspective , more than 1,000 dust mites live in just 1m2 of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime research suggests that each and every time you use your bed , you are depositing more dead skin , in addition to any dirt , sweat or grease that may have also built up on your skin throughout the day
' it sounds gross there âs a packet of crisps in your bed but there are a lot of measures you can take to decrease dust mites , ' she said
talk to the experts : dr penny adams ( pictured ) told daily mail australia there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them ' if you âre allergic to dust mites you basically ca nât avoid them , they 're everywhere ' dr adams told daily mail australia
while she said there is no evidence that anything can be done to rid our houses of dust mites , she revealed to daily mail australia that using a vacuum with a hepa filter can help
' dr adams said she was surprised at the statistic that australians spend 90 per cent of their time indoors but admitted that in the winter months people are susceptible to illnesses due to spending more time at home
' in winter we spend more time at home than we do in summer months therefore allergy sufferers come into closer and more regular contact with allergens such as dust mites and pet hair , ' she said
distrubing fact : the average australians shed the equivalent of a 50g packet of chips in dead skin every week , most of it ending up in our beds ' wash and dry hands thoroughly and regularly to avoid contamination , ' she said
dr penny adams recommends dyson 's first ever humidifier to relieve symptoms of dry air and their v6 vacuum cleaner , which has a hepa filter included to capture allergens and dust mites .
