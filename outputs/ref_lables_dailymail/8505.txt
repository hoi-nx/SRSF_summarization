google has developed a system to allow robots to download new personalities online
' above it atlas , which according to google - owned boston dynamics , is a ' high mobility , humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor , rough terrain
according to google owned boston dynamics , atlas is a ' high mobility , humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor , rough terrain
' atlas can walk bipedally leaving the upper limbs free to lift , carry , and manipulate the environment
' in extremely challenging terrain , atlas is strong and coordinated enough to climb using hands and feet , to pick its way through congested spaces
' google 's patent details a cloud - based system where a personality could be downloaded to a robot , in the same way one might download an app. ' the robot personality may also be modifiable within a base personality construct ( i.e. , a default - persona ) to provide states or moods representing transitory conditions of happiness , fear , surprise , perplexion ( e.g. , the woody allen robot ) , thoughtfulness , derision ( e.g. , the rodney dangerfield robot ) , and so forth , ' states the patent
' the firm also explains ' this disclosure relates to a robot imbued with a personality , or personalities
' google already owns several firms developing robotic technology , including atlas , 6.2 feet of metal with a plastic body that can walk , run , jump and even open doors
this is latest version of the atlas robot created by boston dynamics , a google - owned robot firm
google 's patent drawings reveal the system can share personalities and download them darpa expects at least twenty teams to compete in the drc finals
the teams using the darpa - developed atlas robot will use an entirely new version , which is battery powered for the first time
the atlas robot created by google - owned firm boston dynamics is a formidable figure at 6ft 2in tall and weighing in at 330lb
atlas will also now carry an onboard 3.7 - kilowatt - hour lithium - ion battery pack , with the potential for one hour of ' mixed mission ' operation that includes walking , standing , use of tools , and other movements
the upgraded atlas is 75 percent new â only the lower legs and feet were carried over from the original design gill pratt , of darpa said : ' atlas unplugged is the upgrade to allow it to run entirely on batteries
' ' the new atlas is 75 % new , it has much more dexterity and is quieter , and stronger
' the introduction of a battery and variable - pressure pump into atlas poses a strategic challenge for teams , ' said pratt
given their identical hardware , the atlas teams will have to differentiate themselves through software , control interfaces , and competition strategy
darpa demonstrated the new atlas with a fall arrestor in place
the atlas robot has already shown it can walk , jump and even drive a car however , it 's not just karate - ian has another trick up his sleeve - software written by the florida institute for human and machine interaction which allows him to drive a car
the ' crane ' stance , being held by karate kid daniel larusso ( played by ralph maccio left ) in the 1984 film inspired the latest movements of the atlas robot
it demonstrates strong balancing skills and composure and showcases the agility of the google - owned machine , said the firm atlas is a high mobility , humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor , rough terrain , boston dynamics said
the atlas robot has an articulated sensor head includes stereo cameras and a laser range finder so it can ' see ' where it is going
