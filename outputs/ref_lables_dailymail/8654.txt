at his lowest point in the 1980s , bruce wanted to flee to europe for gender reassignment surgery and return to u.s. as his children 's heather
that was around the time his young sons asked their mother why their father had breasts
as diane sawyer 's explosive tell - all with bruce came to an end last night , his second wife published a blog detailing their love affair , idyllic marriage and the gender dysphoria revelations that led to their divorce after two sons and a seemingly picture perfect malibu life
linda thompson , now 64 , met bruce at the playboy mansion when he was separated from his first wife , chrystie crownover , the mother of his two eldest children
but when brody was 18 months old and brandon was three , bruce revealed to linda thompson the secret that he finally told the world friday night
with a ' somber look ' bruce told linda thompson - who had braced herself for the revelation of perhaps an affair - that he identified as a woman
' what does that mean ? and just as he told diane sawyer , bruce told his wife of four plus years that as long as he could remember , he felt wrong with the reflection staring back at him in the mirror
according to linda thompson , her handsome husband told her , ' i have lived in the wrong skin , the wrong body , my whole life
family : the couple 's youngest son , brody ( left ) , was 18 months old and brandon ( right ) was three when bruce revealed to linda thompson ( center ) the secret that he finally told the world friday night - that he identified as a woman ' champion ' : on friday , linda thompson , now aged 64 , took to instagram to express her support for her former husband unlike bruce 's third wife kris jenner , who walked in on jenner in a dress , linda thompson says there was no evidence he had ever raided her closet or wore any women 's clothes
' she quotes the doctor as telling the couple of the sobering suicide statistics of transgender people at the time - 25 per cent committed suicide - and told linda thompson she could stay with bruce as he became a ' she ' or linda could divorce him
according to linda thompson , bruce ' considered traveling out of the country , possibly to denmark , to have the gender - confirmation surgery and then come back to the u.s. identifying as female
in the years during and after the couple split , bruce started taking female hormones
tearful : bruce revealed that he identifies as a woman in his explosive interview with diane sawyer last night transitioning : ' one day , after having spent a little time at bruce 's house , both boys came into the kitchen and said to me , ' mommy , we saw daddy getting out of the shower naked , and daddy has boobs ! ' writes linda thompson ' thirty years ago the only hair removal that was permanent was electrolysis , ' linda thompson writes
linda thompson writes that she had an open door policy for bruce to see his children , and he was welcome to visit brandon and brody anytime
but , and she does n't detail why , the boys never spent the night at bruce 's house and occasionally visited
' one day , after having spent a little time at bruce 's house , both boys came into the kitchen and said to me , ' mommy , we saw daddy getting out of the shower naked , and daddy has boobs ! ' and so she tried to cover for bruce , their father
' soon enough , the exhausting coverup of his transition ended , and it was n't bruce 's gender dysphoria linda thompson was protecting them from
bruce stopped taking hormones , did n't go to denmark , and started dating again
according to bruce during his abc interview , he chickened out of going through with it and stopped taking the hormones
linda thompson then strongly hints that kris jenner knew more about bruce 's gender identity crisis than bruce let on to during the diane sawyer interview
support : on the diane sawyer episode , brody and brandon both sit proudly alongside their father , supporting him fully as he enters the next phase of life as ' she '
and their mother also wishes bruce well linda thompson 's second husband david foster showed his support for bruce after the interview
david foster was brody and brandon 's stepfather for 14 years - including the time bruce cut the boys off
' then he married kris jenner and stopped seeing his sons , the sons who 'd seen his breasts , for years
' after bruce and kris jenner married , there were periods of several years going by without bruce attempting to contact or visit his sons
' but , in hindsight , linda thompson believes , the revelation of what her sons ' father was struggling with , and running away from , in the years he vanished from their lives , helps explain a lot
on the diane sawyer episode , brody and brandon both sit proudly with their father , supporting him fully as he enters the next phase of life as ' she '
