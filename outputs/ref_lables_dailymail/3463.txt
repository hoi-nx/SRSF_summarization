there are up to one million free - roaming dogs on romania 's streets who are being hunted down by ' dog catchers ' and stuck in squalid state - run pounds where ' they are waiting to die '
the ' euthanasia ' of strays was legalised by the romania parliament in september 2013 to help reduce a massive overpopulation
but a group of former models called the k-9 angels have rescued hundreds of dogs from the streets where they would be savagely killed - and re-homed at least 700 in the uk
the k-9 angels claim government funds for programmes aimed at neutering the animals were never implemented and the animals were dealt with in the ' most cruel way '
pola , anneka and former playboy model victoria eisermann are devoted to saving the mistreated dogs - and finding them loving homes
' the founders of k-9 angels describe the pounds as ' filthy , dirty , short on food ' and in truth - just a place to dump these dogs so they die away from the public '
its spokesperson adam rahman told mailonline : ' dogs are brutally rounded up by dog catchers and taken to pounds where they are subjected to poor conditions and cruel treatment , and are essentially waiting to be killed

their petition to calling on the european union to investigate the ' disappearance ' of the public funds designated for a neutering programme has gained over 28,000 signatures
the results of the investigation were shocking as they found that not one of these public shelters in romania conformed to the law regulating the national programme on stray dogs .
