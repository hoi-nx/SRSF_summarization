so , from the start , sterling âs explanation for the end of his conversations with liverpool did not stand up
liverpool ? arsenal ? abroad ? yet postponing the process to the end of the season does nât solve that issue
if sterling wanted to stop thinking right now , he could sign his new deal or tell liverpool to come back in a year
sterling has turned down a new deal with liverpool and put off contract talks until the summer sterling ( right ) has confirmed that he rejected an offer of Â£ 100,000 - a - week to stay at liverpool the 20 - year - old gave an interview to the bbc on wednesday giving his reasons for his decision so all sterling did , the day his advisers ended negotiations until may at the earliest , was complicate his affairs
it is not as if he will be able to forget about the decision in the coming weeks , particularly as his stance appears to have damaged his relationship with liverpool âs supporters
without doubt , they were dissatisfied with his attitude even before this week âs ill - conceived bbc interview
as liverpool âs hopes of a champions league place next season became increasingly remote with the home defeat against manchester united , sterling bore the brunt of the dissent
liverpool and rodgers have done well by sterling
liverpool are entitled to think it is equally flattering for a club of its stature to offer a salary worth more than Â£ 5million annually
sterling ( left ) shakes hands with liverpool manager rodgers during training on thursday sterling has played in various positions this season under rodgers - including as a striker and at wing back among the reasons advanced for sterling âs coldness towards a long - term commitment at liverpool has been rodgers âs recent decision to play him at right wing back
is nât this the versatility that we envy in the best foreign teams ? is nât this an education ? why is it that england produces pigeon - holed full backs or midfielders , and not footballers ? should nât a player - certainly one who wishes to command in excess of Â£ 100,000 a week - be able to fill in anywhere ? indeed , should nât he welcome that endorsement from his manager ? arsenal progressed to the 2006 champions league final at a time when ashley cole was injured
in his place through the knockout stages , home and away against real madrid , juventus and villarreal , was the 22 - year - old french midfielder flamini
midfielder flamini ( right ) was used a full back in arsenal 's run to the 2006 champions league final flamini is nât a creative in sterling âs mould - but then right wing back is nât the same as left back , either
sterling is still operating as a winger when liverpool attack
maybe sterling should spend his time thinking less about his contract and more about the type of footballer he wishes to be ; maybe about the type of footballer who can demand more than Â£ 100,000 a week
sterling 's liverpool team - mate emre can ( centre ) has been used mainly in defence , despite being a midfielder
