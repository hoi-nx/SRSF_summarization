barraged with questions at his monday briefing about who was lying - the united states or iran - white house press secretary josh earnest suggested that the timing of sanctions relief remained a topic of discussion - a major revelation given the dispute 's potential for derailing a written agreement
' responding to the supreme leader of iran 's announcement yesterday that there would be no formal pact unless sanctions relief is ' instant , ' john mccain , above , said he had ' sympathy ' for iran ayatollah ayatollah , because john kerry ' must have known ' what the perimeters were for a long - term accord ' and yet chose to interpret it in another way ' john mccain ripped into former colleague john kerry on hewitt 's radio show for mischaracterizing preliminary talks with iran
' ' so in a way , i ca nât blame the ayatollah , because i do nât think they ever agreed to it
' gop senator gop on thursday said , ' it âs increasingly clear that iran , in fact , failed to reach agreement with the united states and its partners on a political framework that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement
' at best , iran agreed to disagree with the united states on key nuclear weapons - related issues and to continue talks , ' the illinois lawmaker said
' he also said he believes senate gop are ' extremely close ' to winning enough democrats ' support to push through a veto - proof bill giving congress the power to review the formal deal with iran that is scheduled to materialize by june 30
ayatollah further stated that iran would not allow an ' unconventional inspection or monitoring ' even with out that legislation , john mccain claimed that the senate has the constitutional authority to reject an accord because it is technically treaty
south carolina senator graham , a member of the senate who is exploring a presidential run , said in a statement friday afternoon that ' the ayatollah and president obama appear to be talking about two separate agreements
' unfortunately , i ca nât say i âm surprised , ' he added
' graham said the obama administration should tell iran ' in no uncertain terms â that should we come to an actual agreement between both parties , sanctions relief will not be immediate
' ' any realistic agreement must preclude sanctions relief from being granted until iran proves it has ended its military nuclear program
