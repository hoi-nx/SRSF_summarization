' the tory leader was pulled up on the error after the speech , which he read from an autocue , though the party has since admitted it was not included in his prepared text but was an off the cuff remark
it was omitted from the official transcript of his speech issued by the tory
he said : ' i 'm a villa fan ... i must have been overcome by something ... this morning
' but there we are , these things sometimes happen when you are on the stump
' the two teams do both play in a claret blue colours - albeit in stadiums 130 miles apart

labour 's former communications chief alastair campbell - whose own team burnley also play in claret and blue - said the mistake ' says a lot about his character which impacts upon policy
total million percent phoney , as ( villa manager ) tim sherwood might say
name escapes me ... they play in yellow ... watford ? ' but former conservative press officer collett , a fellow villa supporter , said he believed the mistake was down to an error in mr cameron 's speech
' pm is a passionate villa fan
' the first mentions in the national press of his liking for villa came after he was elected tory leader in 2005
asked to confirm which team he actually supports , he said : ' i 've been an villa fan all my life , i literally opened my mouth and i was going off - piste about the fact that in britain you can be a supporter of the west indies , a supporter of manchester united , and a supporter of team gb. ' i was then busking about other things you can support and was ... i do n't know what happened to me , it was just one of those things
' asked if he remembered watching villa beat bayern munich in the european cup final as a child , he said : ' i do , that 's why i became a villa fan
' that 's why i became a villa fan , because my uncle was involved in the club , and back in the early 80s , with all those successes , and andy gray and brian little , and that 's what got me going
he blamed it on a ' brain fade ' like that suffered by green party leader natalie bennett earlier in the election campaign reminded of his comment in 2001 in the house of commons that he was n't actually a football fan , mr cameron said : ' i mean , i 'm not a regular attender , i used to play football as a kid , my son plays football , and i try and sort of keep up with what 's happening in the premier league and see how villa are doing
