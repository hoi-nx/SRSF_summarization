the brothers of men convicted of sex offences are five times more likely than average to commit similar crimes , according to researchers
they also found the sons of fathers with a criminal record for sex offending were nearly four times more likely to be convicted of such crimes
the biggest study of its kind suggests sex offending could run in the family along the male genetic line
the brothers of men convicted of sex offences are five times more likely than average to commit similar crimes , a study found
johnny ( left ) is accused of abusing seven women , while jimmy savile ( right ) raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals during a 24 year reign of abuse sex offending could run in families along the male genetic line , experts claim
but the researchers stressed that this did not mean a man with a brother or father convicted of rape would inevitably follow in their footsteps
over the past few years a string of brothers have been convicted of child sex offences , including mohammed jumale and his brother omar jumale , who were part of a 13 - strong gang that raped girls as young as 13 - years old
lead scientist professor langstrom , from the karolinska institute in swedish , said : â it âs important to remember that it âs nothing mystic
another set of brothers , zeeshan ahmed and bilal ahmed , were also convicted the scientists studied data on all men convicted of sexual offences in swedish between 1973 and 2009
just 2.5 per cent of brothers of sex offenders were convicted of similar crimes , compared with 0.5 per cent of men in the general population , according to the study reported in the international journal of epidemiology
less than one per cent of convicted sex offenders are women so it was not â meaningful â to include them , said prof langstrom
behavioural factors found in sex crimes , such as impulsive behaviour , hypersexuality and sexual deviance , may be genetic - based drivers for the offences , said the researchers
