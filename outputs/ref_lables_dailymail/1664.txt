in the sparse and frozen wilds of alaska , it is not often that a tasty meal jumps almost straight into your mouth
but that was the case for one bear while hunting salmon in the brooks river , which runs through the katmai national park , in southern alaska
however , the dozy creature was unable to take advantage of his good fortune , letting the juicy fish slip away , even after it hit him on the nose
swing and a miss : however , nothing is a simple as it seems , and at the very last moment the bear makes a crucial error of judgement , and the sockeye salmon is allowed to continue its journey second time unlucky : photographer sohns explained that once the fish are in the air they can not change direction , which should make them easy to catch , but not for this bear , as another fish slips away once they reach the breeding grounds , usually a freshwater lake , they will mate , before perishing shortly afterwards
these images were captured by juergen and christine sohns , who travelled to alaska to photograph the salmon migration
