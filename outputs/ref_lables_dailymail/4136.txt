jebson , who was responsible for the ' babes in the woods ' murders in 1970 , died of kidney failure almost a fortnight ago
jebson 's final wish was for his death to be secret and victims ' families only found out after journalists told them 11 days after he died
i just do n't want him to be able to hurt anyone else 's children
i wake up crying sometimes i just ca n't understand how some people are so evil
' i keep imagining what jebson did to him '
four years after killing the two friends jebson strangled eight - year - old rosemary papper , shose sister samantha humbles , 45 , said : ' he deserves to rot in hell ' jebson , who was being held at hmp frankland , which also holds child killer ian huntley , died at the university hospital of north durham 11 days ago
a prison source told the sun : ' he was bitter and twisted and did not want people to have the satisfaction and relief of knowing he was dead
bereft : beryl hanlon , whose 12 - year - old son gary was murdered by jebson said : ' i 'm glad to hear he 's gone
i just do n't want him to be able to hurt anyone else 's children ' crimes : in 2000 confessed his part in the deaths of friends susan , 12 , and susan , 11 , who he murdered and dumped on the edge of epping forest jebson finally confessed to police because he felt he could die shortly ' and did not want to go into his grave knowing the murder of the two young friends was still unsolved
but he refused to accompany police to the area where he had sexually abused and killed his victims because he feared the ghosts of the children would haunt the area
serial killer : jebson , pictured , had also strangled eight year old rosemary papper jebson admitted he had been evil over the years and was a danger to children
the ministry of justice is said to have made attempts to contact the families of the children murdered by mr jebson to inform them of his death
' offenders do not decide whether victims ' families are informed about their death
jebson , who had previous convictions for sexually assaulting children , told police he picked them up on march 1 and drove them to a spot where he shared cannabis with them
jebson kept his evil secret for decades
jebson had picked up rosemary papper from school , bought her sweets and raped her before strangling her with a piece of twine in a field in hertfordshire
crime scene : the bodies of the two children were found here in this copse on the edge of epping forest but the crime remained unsolved for 30 years it was not until 1996 that jebson gave the first indication to a prison officer that he was responsible for the babes in the wood murders
it started a chain of events including the exhumation of susan 's grave in ponders end , north london , which ended decades of uncertainty for the children 's families
jebson originally implicated two other people in their deaths
but , over four years , police broke down his story and he admitted sole responsibility
in 2000 three decades of anguish for the mothers of susan , 11 , and susan , 12 , came to an emotional close as paedophile jebson , who was already in jail for another murder , finally admitted raping and strangling them
hunt : the murders of susan and gary became one of britain 's most high profile unsolved murders until jebson finally admitted he did it beryl hanlon and muriel blatchford , who are both widowed , broke down in tears as 61 - year - old jebson was led away from the dock at the old bailey in the final act of what became - known as the babes in the wood mystery
the children fell victim to the perverted jebson on that spring day 30 years ago after susan knocked at susan 's door at around 4pm on march 31 to ask if he wanted to go for a walk
nearly three months later , on june 17 , a man walking his dog discovered the children 's bodies in a copse in epping forest , essex , 30 minutes walk from their home
jebson 's confession finally vindicated the families ' belief that susan and gary were murdered
' he then beat and raped him , before strangling both children and keeping susan 's tights , bra and knickers as ' trophies '
