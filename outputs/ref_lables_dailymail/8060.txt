new lease of life : karen with her daughter jessica after undergoing the alternative procedure it is a painful and embarrassing condition that affects millions of british women
pelvic organ prolapse , or pop , occurs when tissue supporting the pelvic organs â including the womb â becomes weak , typically after childbirth
although up to half of women are thought to suffer to some degree , far fewer seek help , and many who do are offered just one solution : a hysterectomy
while surgical removal of the reproductive organs solves the immediate problem , it also ends fertility , and with three months of recovery needed , it is no quick fix
now , a leading gynaecologist has claimed thousands of patients may be undergoing the drastic operation needlessly
he is one of a growing number of surgeons who claim not enough women are offered the alternative : a half - hour keyhole procedure that uses an implanted mesh â sling â made from nylon to lift and hold the womb back in place , providing a permanent solution to a prolapse and preserving fertility
the procedure , called a sacrohysteropexy , is rare , with just 1,072 admissions for the surgery in the past three years
by contrast , there were 145,310 admissions to hospitals in england in the past three years for hysterectomies due to conditions such as fibroids , pelvic pain or cancer , according to the health and social care information centre
surgeon jonathan broome , who has performed more than 1,000 sacrohysteropexies in the past 15 years , has called for the option to be made more widely available on the nhs so women of child - bearing age are not forced to choose between quality of life or the chance to have children
â most women requiring surgery for a prolapse will be referred for a hysterectomy by their gp , â says mr jonathan broome , who performs the Â£ 4,000 procedure for both nhs and private patients at hospitals in lancashire and greater manchester
â that means some women are faced with the dilemma of living a normal life without a prolapse , or the possibility of having children
' far too many gps recommend hysterectomies as the solution to a prolapse , when a sacrohysteropexy is a much better alternative
it âs a shorter operation , with shorter recovery time because it is less invasive , and fertility is not put at risk
â pelvic organ prolapse , or pop , occurs when tissue supporting the pelvic organs â including the womb â becomes weak , typically after childbirth ( file image ) common causes of prolapse include childbirth , lower levels of oestrogen at menopause , being overweight and chronic illnesses such as lung diseases , which create pressure inside the abdomen from coughing
half of women over 50 will have symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse and more than one in ten will have had surgery for the problem by the age of 80
a sacrohysteropexy is keyhole surgery performed under general anaesthetic to put the womb back into its normal position
it can stay in place indefinitely and does not require a repeat operation
the procedure takes half an hour and involves an overnight stay in hospital
