sydney couple epiphany morgan and carl mason produced 365 documentaries in as many days , visiting 35 countries and 70 cities , as part of their project 365 docobites , an idea which even the couple originally doubted would actually work
when i first told one of my friends what we were thinking of doing , she asked whether i was sure it was a good idea , ' epiphany morgan told daily mail australia
they kept asking , ' are you sure you 're going to be able to do that ? ' , ' carl mason said
' honestly , i did n't even believe we were going until about month before we left when epiphany morgan told me that everything was in order for us to leave , ' he said
with a strict budget of $ 40 a day , the couple set off to their first destination - the us - and landed in new york to begin their very long journey across the globe
' i can remember the first day , we were in times square with all our camera gear and we did n't get up the courage to ask a single person to be involved , ' carl mason said
the couple began their filming journey in new york and visited 70 cities in their year of filming both epiphany and carl mason have a background in film : carl mason worked as a senior editor at an advertising agency and epiphany worked at a production company before going freelance the pair , from sydney , set themselves a goal of releasing one mini documentary each day for a year ' but we realised that we just have to get out there and do it , and then next day we went back out again and found a busker
' over the course of the year , epiphany and carl mason visited 70 cities in 35 countries to capture moments and people on camera - and on a strict production schedule and budget , found themselves stretched to the limits
' but even then $ 40 between the two of us was n't much
