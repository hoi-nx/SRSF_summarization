england may be well on course to sealing their spot at euro 2016 but it appears as if manager roy hodgson still does not know his best xi. sportsmail 's top team of reporters have submitted their starting line - ups for the finals in france , assuming everyone is fit of course
england manager roy hodgson pictured at the juventus stadium during tuesday 's friendly against italy matt lawton hart ; clyne , cahill , jagielka , baines ; henderson , wilshere ; danny welbeck , rooney , sterling ; kane not perfect by any means but i think it âs important to keep rooney in a more central position , in the no 10 role he is most comfortable in , behind the best striker at this moment in time
england captain rooney ( centre ) looks to get a shot in at the italian goal on tuesday ian ladyman hart ; clyne , cahill , jagielka , baines ; henderson , wilshere ; danny welbeck , rooney , sterling ; daniel sturridge england âs defensive options remain their big problem so this is a team set up to score goals and win games by playing on the front foot
daniel sturridge ( left ) charges forward with the ball during last september 's friendly against norway rob draper hart ; clyne , cahill , jones , kieran gibbs ; carrick ; henderson , wilshere ; sterling , rooney , danny welbeck no place for daniel sturridge at present and you might have to re-think if he 's clear of injuries - but for the moment rooney has to play up front
if england need a more attacking shape , rooney can drop in and daniel sturridge come on for wilshere or henderson , but i 'd be wary of starting that way , as england could n't defend properly with two midfielders in brazil
england 's henderson in action against italy at the juventus stadium on tuesday night matt barlow hart ; clyne , cahill , jones , baines ; henderson , carrick , milner ; sterling ; rooney , danny welbeck not far off the team roy hodgson picked against lithuania on friday

there 's certainly goals in this team , as well as pace
europe beware ! england left - back kieran gibbs ( right ) looks to run past italian alessandro florenzi joe bernstein hart ; walker , jones , stones , luke shaw ; carrick , henderson ; sterling , rooney , young ; daniel sturridge it 's ridiculous that carrick is only now getting the international recognition he deserves
he should have been a regular in the last two world cups and will only be 34 at euro 2016
with him and rooney in the middle and lots of legs and energy around them , england should be able to play the quick and accurate tempo displayed by liverpool in the last couple of years
personally , i think that 's the way to go rather than try and hit a big centre - forward like kane
england 's kane ( right ) leaves italy 's giorgio chiellini face down on the pitch during the friendly mike keegan hart ; clyne , cahill , jagielka , baines ; henderson , carrick , barkley ; sterling , rooney , danny welbeck danny welbeck just gets the nod over kane primarily for his pace and movement which is vital to england attacking at pace
