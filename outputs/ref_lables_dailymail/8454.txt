the president and former actor went off - script during a peace summit in geneva in the 1980s to ask the soviet union leader for his support in the event of an invasion from extra terrestrial life
reagan repeated the warning when he spoke to a group of students , and his subsequent speeches were examined by his advisers to remove any mention of aliens in them
reagan ( right ) met gorbachev ( left ) for the first time at a peace summit in geneva , switzerland in 1985 and asked for his support in the event of an alien invasion the warning was revealed in a book about ufos by dr clarke , which examines the extent to which us believed in stories about aliens
he suggests his words may show that reagan , who was inspired by science fiction movies , saw there could have been a threat from aliens
the president is believed to have become an avid science fiction fan while working in hollywood as a b movie actor and was said to be addicted to films like the day the earth stood still and close encounters
reagan even arranged a private screening of stephen spielberg 's close encounters of the third kind at the whitehouse in 1982 for top judges , astronauts and other vips
reagan asked gorbachev for support fighting a future alien invasion at a peace summit ' he surprised gorbachev by saying he was sure the two superpowers would co-operate if earth was threatened by alien invasion , ' dr clarke said
powell 's solution was to go through the president 's public speeches deleting ' interplanetary references ' right until reagan 's final months in office
' gorbachev , pictured in germany in november 2014 , was said to be shocked by reagan 's request dr clarke , who wrote how ufos conquered the world , said reagan appeared to believe in aliens dr clarke said the president may also have been convinced he was speaking for the us public because of a poll released , shortly after close encounters hit film screens
the former us president was said to be obsessed with science fiction films like close encounters ' but he was also obsessed with science fiction movies - in particular the day the earth stood still - and his comments to gorbachev at the 1985 summit in geneva imply that he might have believed the real threat came not from behind the iron curtain but from hostile extra-terrestrials
