despite being fierce rivals , apple and samsung have a somewhat symbiotic relationship when it comes to manufacturing their handsets
now it has been reported that the korean tech giant will be the main supplier of the a9 chips in apple 's upcoming iphone range
although this is n't the first time samsung has manufactured parts for iphones , it signals that the frosty partnership between the two may be thawing
samsung will reportedly be the main supplier of the a9 chips in apple 's upcoming iphone range
samsung has previously supplied apple with various iphone parts , but following legal disputes , apple shifted away from its rival and signed a monopoly deal with tsmc ( tsmc ) in 2013 apple relies heavily on other firms to produce the various components it uses in its iphones and ipads
it produced the flash and working memory in the iphone , for example , and was a substantial apple chip partner until 2013
however , following legal disputes , apple shifted away from samsung and signed a deal with tsmc ( tsmc ) to produce the a7 seen in the iphone 5s
it did n't cut samsung off completely , though , and around 40 per cent of chips in the iphone 6 are still made by the korean giant or partners
reports of the a9 deal first appeared last year when a ' source familiar with the deal ' told the korea times : ' apple has designated samsung as the primary supplier of its next chips powering ios devices from 2016
' from next year , this report continued samsung will supply 80 per cent of apple 's supply of application processors , with tsmc supplying the remaining 20 per cent
it was said to be this deal that appealed to apple because it will help samsung meet the demand for apple 's chips globally , and lets globalfoundries use samsung 's latest technology patents
as part of this deal , bloomberg said samsung will start making the a9 at its giheung plant in south korea , with additional orders going to globalfoundries
reports of the a9 deal first appeared last year when a ' source familiar with the deal ' told the korea times that apple had designated samsung as the primary supplier of its next ios chip in 2016
samsung will supply 80 % of apple 's supply of application processors , with tsmc supplying the remaining 20 % earlier today , samsung announced better - than - expected profits for the first quarter of 2015 thanks to a rising demand for memory chips
this follows news samsung is facing a ' bendgate ' controversy , after famously mocking apple when it emerged its iphone 6 plus could bend out of shape in people 's pockets
but , more importantly , the screen on the s6 edge shattered during this test , while apple 's did n't
the internals reveal samsung used more of its own chips to power the new galaxy s6 smartphone than it did for the predecessor s5 , according to an early teardown report , in a blow to u.s. chip supplier qualcomm
