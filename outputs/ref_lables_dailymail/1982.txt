england star watson believes the pain of bath 's champions cup exit can be a driving force in their push to make this season 's premiership play - offs
watson and company were left to reflect on what might have been at dublin 's aviva stadium as six madigan penalties gave three - time european champions leinster a tense 18 - 15 quarter - final success
bath dominated for large parts of the second period and claimed tries through fly - half george and captain hooper , but hopes of reaching a first top - flight european semi-final since 2006 floundered on their indiscipline
watson carries during an impressive bath performance , but the english side came up short attention will now quickly return to the premiership , with bath having four games left - against newcastle , london irish , harlequins and gloucester - in the quest for a top - four finish
' the overriding emotion is that we are absolutely disappointed , ' said bath full - back watson , whose counter-attacking brilliance was repeatedly showcased against an often stretched leinster defence
' to have battled out of the group as we did ( bath lost their first two games ) and then obviously to get into the quarter - final , to get so close and then fail at the end , it is obviously massively disappointing
' bath stayed true to the ball - in - hand attacking principles that have lit up much of this season 's premiership campaign , and at times , leinster struggled to cope
madigan was perfect from the tee to hand leinster the victory in a game where they were second best in madigan , though , they had a relentless marksman , whose 100 per cent goalkicking return ultimately sent leinster marching on and bath left to focus solely on domestic matters
' to put on an attacking performance and go through the phases like we did against a quality side like leinster is just going to add more confidence , ' watson added
' watson , meanwhile , paid tribute to his bath and england team - mate george , who scored a brilliant solo try and made a darting break that set up hooper for a second - half touchdown that meant the visitors were always in sight of their opponents on the scoreboard
it was a huge disappointment for bath , but watson hopes they can channel the pain to their league campaign ' i can not speak highly enough of him ( ford ) , to be honest , ' watson said
' bath head coach mike ford could not mask his disappointment with the result , believing his team paid the price for an opening 40 minutes when they struggled for fluency and kept giving madigan scoring chances
