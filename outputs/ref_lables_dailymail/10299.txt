patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million gp appointments last year , shocking new figures have revealed
a study reported in the bmj found that 90 per cent of patients were able to get an appointment in 2013/14
the 10 per cent who could not amounts to around 33.8 million unsuccessful attempts each year - or 81 per surgery each week
the shambolic situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of a&e visits , the researchers say
lack of access : patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million gp appointments last year the figures , from the gp patient survey , also show that patients who report worse access to conventional gp appointments are more likely to use out - of - hours services
and surgeries where patients were able to see a gp within two week days had lower rates of a&e department visits
the figures come just a day after it was revealed one in five visits to a&e are unnecessary
a fifth of patients turning up in a&e have self - treatable conditions including sore throats , athlete âs foot and head lice , a study has claimed
researchers have calculated that more than 4 million visits a year are unnecessary â costing the nhs Â£ 290 million
the analysis of data from 15 a&e units by consultancy firm ims health found that 19 per cent of patients had what is called a â self - treatable condition â
the data covered one in ten a&e units across england , so if the trends are mirrored across the country , then an estimated 4.1million of the 21.7million visits last year were for minor ailments
effect : the situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of a&e visits , the researchers say
the researchers add there is also no firm proof that more patients getting to see their doctor will lead to fewer a&e attendances
these are : * evaluating the extended opening hours pilot scheme carried out by the tories * making general practice consultation data routinely available * looking at employing practice staff besides gps * evaluating new types of appointment such as telephone consultations * considering alternatives to general practice such as pharmacist - led minor illness services
