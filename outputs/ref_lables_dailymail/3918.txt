crusaders in chains by robin esser journalists tend to be a fund of good stories and robin esser , who has worked in national newspapers for 60 years , is no exception
robin esser ( pictured ) has worked in newspapers for 60 years once , he answered the phone and an aristocratic voice said : â marlborough here
fearing a hoax , robin esser rang blenheim palace , home to the duke , where the butler said , haughtily , that the duke never spoke to the national press and was in his bath , so could nât be disturbed
robin esser pointed out that the duke would be cross â very cross â with the butler if he was not asked to confirm his call
robin esser rang woburn , where the duke of bedford confirmed the story
next , he sent a motorcyclist to blenheim to pick up a brochure and then ride over to woburn to get it signed and brought back to fleet street
he rang robin esser to say how much he enjoyed the tale
â very good story in your column this morning , mr robin esser , â he would say
robin esser worked in fleet street during the glory days , when reporters kept four pennies in their pockets for the telephone box , a knife to puncture the tyres of rival reporters â cars , and enjoyed liquid lunches on expenses
robin esser describes a lunch with an sunday express editor , during which they drank champagne , a goblet of dry sherry , a bottle of chablis , two bottles of claret , a couple of cognacs and , finally , several glasses of port
but more good stories were elicited over a boozy lunch than can ever come from a tuna sandwich at the desk
and they were also the days when robin esser , as editor of william hickey , could ring aristotle onassis on his yacht at monte carlo and be invited over to meet maria callas
robin esser suggested an interview in which oil billionaire getty made it plain that he was never going to remarry , with the headline â i âm married to an oil rag â , i.e. my oil business comes before women
marie complained about robin esser and said the story he âd written was nât true
the peak of robin esser âs 60 - year career came when he was editor of the sunday express , which then sold two million copies a week
robin esser is now an elder statesman of the national press and works for the daily mail , where he is a leader of the fight against attempts by the state to extend its control over the media and to put newspapers in chains
of course newspapers must continue to entertain , robin esser concludes , but they must also be a thorn in the sides of those in power , wrongdoers and those who abuse the young and old .
