truckers from bulgaria , poland and romania who already work in the britain are being offered Â£ 100 by employment agency mainline ( pictured ) to lure drivers from their home country to work in britain the company did try a recruitment drive to attract lorry drivers from cornwall to their base in swindon
the vacancy crisis will re-ignite claims that britain âs generous welfare system has created a generation unwilling to work , while acting as a magnet for foreigners
jameson , from mainline , said those who arrive from eastern europe are willing to work ' as many hours as they can ' - something which she said britain workers are less keen to do
mainline said it will offer to help workers from overseas find accommodation and settle into a new life in the britain
' we also offer it throughout the britain , and it used to be we 'd have drivers from scotland and cornwall and wales come to work in swindon
' in places like romania , bulgaria and poland , the standard of living is far lower and wages are lower , and they can come over here to work
' work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith previously claimed that the last labour government âs â open - door â policy led to a huge influx of low - skilled migrant workers while its welfare system disincentivised britain to work
in november last year , the britain âs biggest sandwich maker said it was recruiting hundreds of workers from eastern europe for the same reason
allyson russell , greencore âs human resources director , said the company had tried to recruit in the britain , but that it was â not always the kind of work â which people wanted to do
last year , the mail found britain companies had placed almost 8,000 job adverts trying to recruit romania nurses , taxi drivers and hotel staff .
