the lib dems leader , who hopes to hold the balance of power after may 7 , said the idea of more than two parties forming a government is not ' going to work '
mr clegg told voters to go to the ballot box on may 7 expecting a hung parliament , with no one party able to secure an overall majority of mps in the commons
however , he sought to make the case for only the lib dems working with labour or the conservatives , without having to rely on mps from other smaller parties
recent polls have put the tories and labour almost neck and neck , with seat projections suggesting a two - party coalition might struggle to secure a majority
it predicted the conservatives would end up on 297 seats , only slightly down on 2010 , labour 262 , the snp 35 , lib dems 30 , losing almost half of their mps , ukip four and the greens one
a second conservative - lib dems coalition would only be able to command a commons majority of four , making it difficult to form a stable government
experts have warned a badly hung parliament could send financial markets into a tailspin and the pound and shares crashing
after the 2010 election , labour pm brown tried to pull together a ' rainbow coalition ' of several smaller parties but it failed and the lib dems entered a power - sharing deal with the tories
but with opinion polls pointing overwhelmingly towards a hung parliament and significant losses for the lib dems , it may be the only way mr clegg can fulfil his goal of playing a role in the next government
the lib dems leader told his weekly radio phone - in on lbc radio 97.3 : ' he ( mr brown ) was sort of very adamant that he thought that one could create a sort of rainbow coalition of lots and lots of different , a sort of smorgasbord of , different parties
it predicted the conservatives would end up on 297 seats , only slightly down on 2010 , labour 262 , the snp 35 , lib dems 30 , losing almost half of their mps , ukip four and the greens one mr clegg said the presence of seven leaders in tonight 's election tv debate was an indication of the likelihood that no party would win an outright majority in 2015
but he insisted that having the lib dems around the cabinet table with either labour or the tories would keep the next government anchored in the centre ground and prevent ed miliband or david cameron ' lurching one way or another '
