australia coach lehmann has defended his players following criticism of their behaviour during sunday âs world cup final win over new zealand
wicketkeeper brad haddin came under fire for his send - off of kiwi opener martin guptill , and a photograph of brad haddin and all - rounder james faulkner mocking grant elliott after his dismissal cast a shadow over the australians âs fifth world cup triumph
brad haddin clapped in martin guptill 's face after the new zealand batsman was bowled during the final but lehmann insisted brad haddin was following team orders
and he was able to cite the icc âs failure to censure his team as evidence that they had nât gone over the top
â grant elliott ( left ) was also given a less - than - sporting send - off by brad haddin and james faulkner ( second right ) boorish behaviour on sunday cast a shadow over the australians âs fifth world cup triumph but sportsmail âs david lloyd , who is part of the icc âs umpire selection panel , has added his voice to the chorus of criticism aimed at the australians
kamal , a bangladeshi , had labelled the icc the â indian cricket council â after his side âs quarter - final loss to india was marred by questionable umpiring , and was barred from presenting the trophy at the mcg on sunday .
