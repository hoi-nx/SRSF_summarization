in 1982 , hollywood - born chanteuse charlene had a surprise worldwide hit with i 've never been to me
) one of the most irritating lyrics in the song - it has many - is when she sings about the ' isle of greece ' , as if she were discussing the isle of man or the isle of wight
do n't take this the wrong way , americans , but is there anybody in your country with a geography o - level to their name ? this may come as a surprise to our transatlantic cousins but greek has rather more islands in its portfolio than one - in fact there are more than 6,000 , most of them uninhabited
the view of the blue waters of lourdas , kefalonia , a stunning greek island untainted by the masses i often wonder why greek does n't sort out its economic problems by selling off some prime mediterranean real estate - how many uninhabited islands does one country really need ? out of the six biggest greek islands , even americans will recognise two : crete - the biggest - and rhodes ( fourth biggest )
i 'm guessing two will be unknown to us all : euboea ( second biggest ) and chios ( fifth ) ; and two will sound familiar lesbos ( third ) and kefalonia ( sixth )
you will probably know kefalonia because this was the setting for louis de berniã¨res 's novel captain corelli 's mandolin and , in direct contravention of usual hollywood policy , was where the movie was actually filmed
kefalonia , it has to be said , has been a little bit reluctant to play the captain corelli card too freely in the cause of attracting tourists
it took probably the two worst events in the island 's history - the brutal massacre of italian troops in 1943 and the awful earthquake of 1953 - and used them as grist to the story 's romantic mill. kefalonia is perhaps best known as the setting for louis de berniã¨res 's novel captain corelli 's mandolin the 2001 film adaptation starred nicholas cage and penelope cruz but focussed on negative events kefalonia , however , is simply stunning - an absolute gem
i had visited zante , the neighbouring island , and was n't impressed
it has some nice beaches but it has been tarnished by tourism of the cheap and nasty sort - lots of scuzzy booze clubs where young brits go to behave badly
kefalonia , on the other hand , has remained relatively pristine
this has probably much to do with the fact that its airport is of a size that would find it difficult to cope with the modest level of air traffic arriving on the isle of lewis
it 's a large island , about a quarter of the size of majorca , but with just a 20th of the number of tourists of the spain hotspot
kefalonia is by no means perfect : the roads are sub b - road standard and signposting is practically nonexistent or , for obvious but unhelpful reasons , in greek letters ( a big problem when your satnav starts shrugging its digital shoulders and goes into sulk mode )
in a rare case for hollywood the film was actually shot in kefalonia where the book 's events took place the sheer sublime beauty of kefalonia recalls elements of tuscany but it 's by no means perfect the instructions that told us how to get from the airport to our villa had lots of details like : ' turn right after the yellow sign near the olive oil shop halfway up the hill from the bakers
it was a relief , however , to find that tourism had made only limited progress , with just one or two modest - sized hotels in evidence
the one must - do outing in kefalonia is to fiskardo , a lovely harbour , and tassia , an excellent waterfront restaurant that seems to attract an a-list crowd
the lovely harbour of fiskardo is a must - visit place for anyone staying on kefalonia unique villas offers villas from â¬ 699 ( Â£ 520 ) per week
