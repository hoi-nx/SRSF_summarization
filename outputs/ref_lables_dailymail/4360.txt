the world 's last surviving male northern white rhino - stripped of his horn for his own safety - is now under 24 - hour armed guard in a desperate final bid to save the species
sudan is guarded day and night by a group of rangers who risk their lives on a daily basis as they try to keep the rhino from poachers lured by the rising price of ivory
but even without his horn , keepers in the kenya reserve of ol pojeta in fear for his safety
it left just five northern white rhinos in the world - and the three in kenya are in particular danger
hunted : rhinos like sudan have no predators in the wild because of their size - apart from humans new home : it had been hoped moving sudan to kenya with two females would encourage them to breed simor irungu , one of the rangers who guards sudan , says the team regularly risk their lives to keep him safe
' with the rising demand for rhino horn and ivory , we face many poaching attempts and while we manage to counter a large number of these , we often risk our lives in the line of duty
' it is a sad end for a species which used to roam across the heart of africa - from southern chad , across the drc and up into sudan
failure : but attempts at breeding have been unsuccessful - and sudan is now getting old high value : the price of ivory is now said to be between Â£ 40,000 and Â£ 47,000 a kilo but then poaching took its toll , and the entire park was emptied
the price for ivory has risen from between Â£ 170 to Â£ 541 per kilo in the 1990s , to today 's prices of Â£ 40,000 to Â£ 47,355 per kilo , according to a report by the international fund for animal welfare
' sad end : sudan is one of five northern white rhinos left , and a number of them are his descedents however , keeping them safe is a costly business : the team of 40 cost Â£ 75,000 for six months
it is usually paid for with money made from tourism , but recent instability in kenya , and fear of ebola - which is actually thousands of miles away - have kept people away
so the team at ol pejeta is hoping to raise the money through crowd funding
