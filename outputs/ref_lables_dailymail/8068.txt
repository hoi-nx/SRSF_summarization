los blancos must be careful with a talent like raphael varane something has to give at los blancos
carlo ancelotti 's favoured centre - back partnership is sergio ramos and pepe , but in raphael varane , who turns 22 later this month , they have a diamond
pepe 's injury trouble recently has meant raphael varane has started a few games , continuing the education that began under jose mourinho
raphael varane ( left ) impressed again for los blancos - and saved raphael varane will be thinking he is more than ready to be the starting centre - back for a champions league team and with good reason
his performance here was wise beyond his years and his lightning quick turn of pace can help mop up after any errors
one sprint back to deny mario mandzukic was like watching a gazelle catch up with a rhino without even breaking sweat
raphael varane saved his team at the death too , mopping up after iker casillas rushed out his goal and failed to reach the ball
oblak ( centre ) denies gareth bale early on in the contest and the keeper had an impressive game eventually an injury to moya left simeone with oblak in goal against bayer leverkusen , where he became a hero in the penalty shoot - out which secured the team passage to this round of the champions league , and madrid 's goalkeeper was brilliant again against los blancos
oblak 's save from gareth bale - spreading himself wide and blocking the welshman 's strike with his right arm - after barely more than three minutes had elapsed was hugely important
oblak makes a superb save to deny james rodriguez ( third left ) from opening the scoring for los blancos better was still to come , oblak making a superb save from a james rodriguez snap shot , which he did n't see until very late , the highlight of a first - half in which he made six stops
another fruitless evening for gareth bale nobody can say that gareth bale did n't work hard enough for los blancos here , but instead that he just was n't good enough
the world 's most expensive player endured another frustrating evening , which started in the worst way possible when he missed a one - on - one chance
played in down the right , gareth bale had the ball on his favoured left foot , but his finish was too imprecise and oblak made a brilliant save
gareth bale did n't get involved much in the first half , with the game passing him by as sometimes it tends to do
gareth bale ( left ) worked hard again for los blancos but failed to have the desired impact as madrid kept him quiet gareth bale ( right ) sees a shot saved by madrid keeper oblak as he endured another frustrating night he upped the effort in the second period but to little effect
working back in the right - back position he tried to skin guilherme siqueira , but the madrid man nudged him and gareth bale tumbled
it was that kind of night for los blancos , and yet another one for gareth bale
fernando torres was replaced by sergio aguero , who was replaced by radamel falcao , who was replaced by costa , who has now been replaced by mario mandzukic
mario mandzukic , like costa , also gets short shrift from the referee , with his reputation going before him
mario mandzukic was left bloodied after a stray elbow from sergio ramos but got little sympathy from the ref sergio ramos and mario mandzukic clash , leaving the altetico madrid striker needing treatment for a head injury a stray elbow from sergio ramos left mario mandzukic with blood sprayed across his face , but he knows what the deal is at madrid â the pleasure comes with the pain
