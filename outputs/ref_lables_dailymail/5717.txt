and going by the sobriquet â kid chocolate â , you might expect quillin to have an appetite to match his ring alias
instead , the man who will stand in the opposite corner to limerick âs lee next weekend comes across as anything but the egotist
quillin ( left ) may be nicknamed ' kid chocolate ' but he shows none of the expected arrogance at times , the 31 - year - old âs verbal patter buzzes with a modesty and philosophical slant which often betrays the expectations of a hard - hitting middleweight , carrying a 71 per - cent knockout rate in his undefeated record
only once during the course of an exclusive interview with sporstmail does quillin speak with a hint of bite to match the aggression that saw him put hassan nâdam nâjikam on the canvas six times en route to his 2012 world - title win
while lee is the defending champion next weekend , quillin , the challenger , is also the former title holder having never lost the belt in the ring
lee later stepped in to defeat the russian ( for a much lower purse ) , leaving quillin to face accusations of â ducking â his obligations as champion
only recently did quillin reveal that he took a sabbatical to deal with the conflicting emotions of welcoming his first child into the world , while seeing his uncle unsuccessfully battle cancer
nobody gets paid to care ! , â blasted quillin about the flak he faced for giving up his belt
the american has a 71 per cent knockout ratio , but he is keeping his feet on the ground ahead of the fight â i just worry about myself , keep good thoughts and a positive mind and keep a great mindset for myself and that i âm just focused
â quillin âs first son , joaquin , was born last august , at the same time his close uncle , eric munson , battled pancreatic cancer , losing his fight just two months ago
he has been out of the ring for 12 months since his last title defence
â now i âm back to where i need to be at , â answered quillin
â testament to that is when i step into the ring with lee on april 11
â now i âm just looking forward and lee is who âs in front of me right now
â moving on seems to be a regular feature of quillin âs life
next week âs fight with lee will take place in the challenger âs adopted home town , but to call quillin one of â brooklyn âs own â is to ignore his path
quillin , who will fight lee next week , says it will be a big test against the irish fighter he was christened with the alias owing to his physical resemblance to the legendary cuban featherweight champion of the same ring name , but quillin also has a blood connection to the caribbean island as his father was born there before defecting to the american
i got to learn about life and experience , something different other than what i âm used to , â says quillin on his pilgrimage to cuban
quillin has been away from the ring for a while , but is now ready to recapture his title against lee â i knew i had a big responsibility when it came to taking on the name
he has defeated some big names , including an old ronald â winky â wright , while his stoppage wins over tough contenders were impressive and his title win over nâdam ( lee âs opponent at the 2004 athens olympic games ) proved his world - class ability
