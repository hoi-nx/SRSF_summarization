it was a case of so near , yet so far for the queen today as she roared on her filly , ring of truth , at newbury today
unfortunately for queen , her horse was narrowly pipped to the post - prompting a brief look of horror and a rueful smile from her owner
oh no ! the queen allows herself a look of horror as ring of truth is narrowly pipped to the post one is not amused : the queen briefly looks glum before smiling at her second place finish better than nothing : the queen 's second place appeared to go down well and she got a third place later on queen , who has long been an avid racing fan , had a second runner later in the afternoon but was once again left to rue missed chances after her horse capel path came in third
despite failing to register a win , the 88 - year - old monarch was on cheerful form and chatted happily to jockey richard hughes in the parade ring ahead of the maiden stakes
top tips : the queen chatted to ring of truth 's jockey richard hughes ahead of the race looking around : queen , joined by racing manager john warren ( second right ) , toured the parade ring enjoying the day : afterwards , she made her way back to the royal box in the grandstand the queen certainly has plenty to smile about , with her fifth great - grandchild due next weekend and sex claims against her son prince andrew struck out by a us judge
since then , the royal stables have been home to a succession of steeds , among them betsy , a black farm - bred horse who was her mount of choice in the 50 's , and surprise , a grey gelding whom the queen famously galloped down the course at ascot in 1961
