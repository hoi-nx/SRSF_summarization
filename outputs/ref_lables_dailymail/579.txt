disaster : rescue workers and debris from the germanwings jet at the crash site near seyne-les-alpes , french call : klaus-dieter scheurle ( above ) , head of the deutsche flugsicherung authority , urged the aviation industry to develop the system which could help prevent a repeat of the germanwings crash last month mr scheurle said in frankfurt : â such an event might cause us to reconsider systems which would allow the control of aircraft to be taken over by personnel on the ground in emergency situations
â he added that it was important to â think past today 's technology â , explaining that such a system could be used in an emergency on the ground to take remote control of a plane and safely land it
mr scheurle said that it was not the â simplest solution â , adding that similar technology is already available for piloting drones - but it could take a decade to develop it for passenger jets
