but in one residential street , a local refuse collector has been exposed as a rogue litterer , dumping plastic bin bags in an alleyway
his antics were captured on cctv installed by frustrated residents in oldham , manchester , who had noticed the rubbish piling up
residents confused over who had been dumping bags full of rubbish in an alley next to their street were stunned when cctv revealed a binman rather than load the bags into his lorry , the bin man was filmed lifting them out of dustbins along park road in glodwick before tossing them down an alley
another cctv video shows council workers arriving in the same alleyway days later
they searched the contents of the bags before placing stickers on each of them warning residents they could face fines of up to Â£ 50,000 for not having disposed of rubbish properly
it was captured on video installed by resident liaqat who , along with others on the street , thought one of their neighbours had been dumping the bags there
' for at least a year now we have had an issue with rubbish bags being dumped in the alleyway , ' said mr liaqat
' there is always a pile of them there , cars drive over them because it is quite a busy passageway and the bags end up splitting and rubbish flies everywhere
' the footage showed the binman lifting the bags out o wheelie bins before throwing them to the side adnan islam 's father had been sent a letter by the council inviting him to a recorded interview over the issue before the cctv was obtained after watching the footage mr liaqat was shocked to discover it had been council workers that were fly - tipping all along
' some of the residents had been sent letters threatening legal action if the rubbish was not cleared up
oldham council had slapped stickers on the bin bags because they were not properly disposed of
