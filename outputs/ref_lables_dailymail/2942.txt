almost two weeks on from liverpool âs wretched afternoon against man united at anfield , it would appear that lessons have already been learned
asked about a setback that may yet cost rodgers and his players a place in next season âs champions league , the club âs midfielder allen was rueful
â they were ready to go and maybe we were nât , â allen told a young supporter at melwood this week
â allen battles it out with ander herrera during liverpool 's barclays premier league defeat to man united at anfield liverpool midfielder allen spoke to sportsmail 's ian ladyman at liverpool 's melwood training ground midfielder allen believes liverpool have performed well against the big teams during the last two seasons for allen , and indeed for liverpool , one suspects that their defeat by their greatest rival of all is already being viewed as merely another kink in the road
certainly there is nobody at anfield who will accept the opinion offered by sky sports â gary , the former man united defender , that liverpool froze
â no , i do nât think that âs the problem , â said allen
â i think over the last two seasons we have performed against the big teams
â over the past few months at liverpool there has certainly been more right than wrong
allen , one senses , has been integral to recent improvement
with captain gerrard no longer an automatic starter and the brazilian lucas leiva recently injured , the 25 - year - old midfielder has been given an extended opportunity to prove his worth
allen has been given an opportunity with captain gerrard no longer an automatic choice for liverpool while gerrard is no longer the first name on the teamsheet , lucas leiva ( left ) has also been sidelined having arrived with rodgers from swansea in 2012 , allen could not always be relied on
he admitted this week that at times the challenge seemed a little too big for him but he hopes that recent performances in big victories against manchester city , southampton and swansea will one day be seen as evidence of a genuine breakthrough
â i think so , i hope so , â allen told sportsmail
in my first season there were moments when i look back and am disappointed about how i did cope with that [ mental ] aspect of things
hopefully i can stay fit now and show people the best of me
â allen âs increased standing at liverpool saw him selected for a meet and greet with supporters this week
during a 20 - minute q&a with a group of supporters , allen talked openly about the sad feeling at the club when gerrard announced that he would not be staying and the devastation of last season âs title failure
allen admits , at times , the challenge of playing for liverpool felt a little too big but has impressed recently gerrard consoles luis suarez as liverpool 's title hopes were dented against crystal palace last season allen also spoke of the feeling at the club after captain gerrard announced he would be leaving the reds later on , however , his conversation with sportsmail was more personal and touched on his relationship with his older brother harry , a talented footballer who plays for the wales deaf side after losing his hearing to meningitis as a toddler
â when we were younger , he was a striker and he was a better player than me , â revealed allen
we loved playing against each other but there was a competitive edge to it
it âs one of those that we will never know the answer to â¦ â home these days for allen is the house he shares in chester with his wife lacey and son alfie
allen poses with a rooster bought for him by his wife for the liverpool midfielder 's 24th birthday allen 's wife , lacey-jo , shared the snap of allen and his birthday present on twitter last year allen poses with sean melia , a volunteer at the anfield sports community centre who was present at melwood as a â barclays premier league spirit of the game hero â â it was just a â what do you get the guy who has everything ? â kind of present , â laughed allen , fidgeting rather uncomfortably in his chair
â my wife is a big animal lover and it was , yeah , my surprise present
â allen was rather more comfortable when the conversation returned to football and , in particular , wales âs weekend win in israel that left chris coleman âs team at the top of their qualifying group for euro 2016.allen was in cardiff âs millennium stadium in 2004 when mark hughes âs team lost a play - off to russia
allen is keen to make history with wales and finish the work started by former manager , the late gary speed â his presence is still there for everyone , â allen said poignantly
â allen played in the 3 - 0 win over israel which took wales to their top of their euro 2016 qualifying group domestically , liverpool âs opportunity to make amends begins at the emirates tomorrow and continues in lancashire next wednesday with an fa cup quarter - final replay at blackburn
â whatever happened in one game has gone , â said allen
â allen was speaking at a barclays premier league event to inspire the next generation of fans to fall in love with the game
