bayern 's shock 3 - 1 defeat by porto may not have gone down well in munich but in manchester â the blue half at least â it will have been a different story
pep guardiola , whose side were outplayed in portugal on wednesday , remains city 's first choice to replace under - fire manuel pellegrini
he has a year remaining on his contract in german but a quarter - final champions league exit , which now seems like a real possibility , could help persuade his employers let him go this summer
pep guardiola saw his bayern side lose 3 - 1 against porto on wednesday night in portugal pep guardiola is seen as a natural fit given his close relationship with two of city 's executives pep guardiola , whose side were outplayed in portugal , remains city 's first choice to become manager manuel pellegrini has been under pressure lately as his side fell out of the race for the premier league title as a player ( defensive midfielder ) 1990 â 1992 : barcelona ( 59 apps , 5 goals ) 1990 â 2001 : barcelona ( 263 , 6 ) 2001 â 2002 : brescia ( 11 , 2 ) 2002 â 2003 : roma ( 4 , 0 ) 2003 brescia ( 13 , 1 ) 2003 â 2005 : al-ahli ( 18 , 2 ) 2005 â 2006 : dorados ( 10 , 1 ) for the national team 1991 spain u21 ( 2 caps , 0 goals ) 1991 â 1992 : spain u23 ( 12 , 2 ) 1992 â 2001 : spain ( 47 , 5 ) 1995 â 2005 : catalonia ( 7 , 0 ) teams managed 2007 â 2008 : barcelona 2008 â 2012 : barcelona 2013 â now : bayern that would work for city
however , city 's abu dhabi owners famously crave champions league progression and , based on recent evidence , there may be some doubt as to whether pep guardiola can deliver that
in 17 matches on the road in europe , pep guardiola 's teams have won just four times , drawing eight and losing five
pep guardiola has a year remaining on his contract but a quarter - final champions league exit could be a problem manuel pellegrini looks set to lose out on the premier league title and is fighting to qualify for the champions league as a player barcelona : segunda division b barcelona : la liga ( 6 ) , copa del rey ( 2 ) , supercopa de espana ( 4 ) , champions league , uefa cup winners ' cup , uefa super cup ( 2 ) spain : olympic gold medal as a manager barcelona : tercera division barcelona : la liga ( 3 ) , copa del rey ( 2 ) , supercopa de espana ( 3 ) , champions league ( 2 ) , uefa super cup ( 2 ) , fifa club world cup ( 2 ) bayern : bundesliga , german cup , uefa super cup , fifa club world cup at bayern , where he pitched up after a year 's sabbatical in 2013 , the european adventures have been no better
bayern may well turn it around next week and many would hail it as the latest of pep guardiola 's achievements - and there are many
