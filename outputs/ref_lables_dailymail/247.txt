the largest single high - definition map of mysterious dark matter has been produced
it is the first in a series of maps of the cosmos that will eventually allow a 3d view of dark matter across one eighth of the night sky
university of manchester researchers have revealed an hd dark matter map ( shown )
it shows clumps of mystery particles across 0.4 per cent of the sky
the goal is to eventually map 12.5 per cent over five years
red here shows more dark matter , and blue shows less
the moon is shown top left for scale a team from the university of manchester , led by dr bridle , has spent the past two years measuring the shapes of galaxies used to construct the map
called ' dark matter ' , this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe
the goal of the des is to map 12.5 per cent of the entire sky , creating a 3d map of dark matter - and dark energy
â it is amazing to see a map of the dark matter over such a large region of the sky , and the full des mass map will be more than 30 times bigger still , â dr bridle said in a separate statement
' this mosaic image shows the different telescope shots that were combined to make the dark matter map
those theories suggest that , since there is much more dark matter in the universe than visible matter , galaxies will form where there are large concentrations of dark matter ( and hence stronger gravity ) present
on the left , galaxies can be seen near dark matter clumps ( in red ) , and further away from sparse regions ( blue )
it will be completed by 2018 , mapping dark matter of an eighth of the sky in the process dark matter , the mysterious substance that makes up 85 per cent of all matter in the universe , is invisible to even the most sensitive astronomical instruments because it does not emit or block light
understanding how the clumpiness of dark matter changes with time will reveal the nature of the enigmatic dark energy , which is the ultimate goal of the survey
the dark matter map released makes use of early des observations and covers only about three percent of the area of sky des will document over its five - year mission .
