that 's exactly what woods was ready for
he smiled , slapped his playing partner rory mcilroy on the back
by the summer , though , who knows ? there have been enough sightings of the old woods at augusta this week not to give up on him yet
the problem with new woods , though , is that as desperate as he appears to march on , obstacles line his path , like tree roots
at the ninth , playing out of the augusta pines , woods found such a root at full pelt on his follow through

this was the masters that woods was advised to miss. there were some sage voices out there , saying his old friend would turn on him , that he might be embarrassed by his favourite homeland course
had he done so , had he started his recovery earlier , who knows where his game would have been by the time he reached augusta ? were it not for the phenomenon of jordan spieth 's first 54 holes , he would have been in contention here starting the final day
woods , like rory mcilroy , began six under par but with jordan spieth ten shots ahead , it was idealistic to even contemplate a charge
woods would have needed a score approaching the course record , and jordan spieth a collapse â and he is not well - placed for miracles yet
woods tees off on the tenth but in the end he did not manage to challenge runaway winner jordan spieth woods plays out of the bunker by the sixteenth green at augusta national it could be argued that the enthusiasm for woods 's performance this weekend shows how far he has fallen
after all , two of his four rounds â the first and last â were over par , and in the head to head on sunday rory mcilroy beat him by seven shots
then again rory mcilroy is the world no 1 , woods 110 places below and has barely played this year
' it wo n't be for a while , ' woods confirmed
he loves the old course almost as much as he loves augusta
it brings the best out of him â and woods 's best may still be good enough , somewhere , some day
by the time woods and rory mcilroy stood on the tee at 2.30pm local time , jordan spieth had spoiled it for just about everyone
maybe that was why sunday 's round fell flat â for woods , not rory mcilroy

once again , inconsistency cost him dear at augusta
he was three over par through the first 27 and with jordan spieth scoring so fiercely the masters was gone from there
it is woods 's record of 18 under par that jordan spieth has equalled
in the difficult circumstances that preceded this tournament , woods most certainly brought his a game , circa 2015 ; how was he to know he also required a time machine to make it 1997 again and stay in the mix ? what is plain , despite sunday 's disappointment , is that rumours of woods 's demise were exaggerated
' i think woods 's going to have the last laugh , ' mickelson said

there had been a practice round earlier in the week in which woods was rumoured to have outplayed jordan spieth down the back nine
there was no sign of that individual superiority over the ensuing four days â 19 shots between them and jordan spieth leading wire to wire â but this was never about woods winning at augusta
he will probably need to work sun up to sun down again , and to win a minor , before he can land a major , but would anyone bet against it given the sight of him walking augusta on sunday in the company of the world no 1 ? ready to play some golf ? one day woods may face down rory mcilroy and it will matter
