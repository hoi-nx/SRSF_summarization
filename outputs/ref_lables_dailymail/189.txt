but for people who fly frequently , cosmic radiation can increase this exposure significantly
now there is an app that records your personal radiation to reveal how much you are exposed to from from medical examinations , changes in your location , and flights
the trackyourdose app ( pictured ) was developed by germany - based firm esooka and uses a mathematical model developed by scientists and meteorologists
the Â£ 1.49 ( $ 1.99 ) ios app keeps a record of a user 's personal radiation including exposure from changes in a person 's location and flights the trackyourdose app was developed by germany - based esooka
it uses a mathematical model developed by scientists and meteorologists from the ptb ( ptb ) in germany and the university oulu , finland
to to do this , ptb 's scientists developed a carry - on ' flight case '
using the case , ptb 's scientists measured more than 2,500 points at flight altitudes between 5 miles ( 8km ) and 7.5 miles ( 12km ) worldwide between 1997 and 2006
6 î¼sv : typical radiation from a dentist 's x-ray 10 î¼sv : average daily natural radiation 40 î¼sv : radiation from flying from new york to los angeles 100 î¼sv : radiation from a 10 - hour flight across the north atlantic 2,100 î¼sv : annual radiation of a typical person in europe 3,000 î¼sv : radiation from a mammogram 3,600 î¼sv : average annual radiation of a us citizen 50,000 î¼sv : maximum allowable yearly occupational dose in the us 100,000 î¼sv : lowest yearly dose linked to increased risk of cancer 2,000,000 î¼sv : severe and potentially fatal it can measure all the relevant types of radiation , in particular neutron radiation produced in the atmosphere
using the trackyourdose app , users enter the details of the airports they are flying from and to and the date they are travelling
in addition to tracking cosmic radiation from air travel , the app accounts for gamma radiation and cosmic radiation on the ground and medical examinations with ionizing radiation such as x-rays or ct scans lead to radiation exposure
a ten - hour flight across the north atlantic , for instance , results in a radiation exposure of between 50 î¼sv to 100 î¼sv
in 2012 , the total annual radiation exposure of a typical person in europe , through naturally occurring radiation , came to about 2,100 î¼sv
a trackyourdose user enters their flights details and solar activity for the flight is inputted , using a neutron monitor from the university of oulu in finland a 10 - hour flight over the north atlantic , for instance , results in a radiation exposure of between 50 î¼sv to 100 î¼sv
and researchers believe the levels could be higher when pilots are flying over thick clouds and snow fields , which can reflect uv radiation a team from the university of california measured the amount of uv radiation in airplane cockpits during flights
while short - wave uv-b ultraviolet radiation can not easily penetrate glass and plastic windows , long - wave uv - a is much more likely to get through
particles from space interact with the atmosphere and earth 's magnetic field to generate cosmic radiation
exposure to this kind of radiation is more significant at higher latitudes and near the magnetic poles , and many planes take polar routes to cut journey times
