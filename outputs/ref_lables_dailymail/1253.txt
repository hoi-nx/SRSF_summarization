laura says she had no idea that fabio was planning to propose - especially not in the cinema
fabio has lived with laura , pictured together , in quedgeley , gloucester , since last year the pair are both big film fans so the cinema acted as the perfect location for the proposal ' the pictures kept playing and i began thinking to myself they looked familiar
