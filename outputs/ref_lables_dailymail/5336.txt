but here in uk prosecco has long been seen as the second choice to champagne
according to industry figures released this month , we âve developed such a taste for prosecco that last year uk sales overtook those of champagne for the first time â Â£ 181.8 million compared with Â£ 141.3 million
it âs been a long time coming
one uk wine importer , david gleave from liberty wines , tried to sell it in the late eighties : â i thought : â this is delicious â i âm sure people will buy it
five years on , that âs leapt to a massive 28 million â with most of the increase coming since 2012
the prosecco revolution was set against a backdrop of celebratory occasions â the jubilee , the olympic games and a royal wedding â where cheap bubbles were called for
suddenly , supermarkets began to see their sales soar and started clearing space on the shelves : it was time to take this loveable sparkling wine seriously
first , france âs most famous sparkling export â champagne , from a region in northern france which sells nine million bottles in uk each year
made from a blend of three classic â champagne â grapes â chardonnay , pinot noir and pinot meunier â it gets its bubbles from a second fermentation in the bottle
most is made in catalonia in the north - east using the macabeo , parellada , and xarello grapes ( although one of the classic champagne grapes , chardonnay , can also be used )
cava is nât usually aged for as long in the producers â cellars before being sold compared with champagne , making it cheaper ( 17 million bottles are sold in the uk each year )
while champagne is produced from grapes grown in the champagne region of northern france ( pictured ) , prosecco comes from a particular area of north - eastern italy , spanning the veneto and friuli regions as for the flavours , cava tends to be more fruity and ripe than the comparatively richer , more complex flavours of champagne
but the new kid on the block , prosecco , is very different to both of these , not least because it âs made in a different country
to be classified as prosecco , it must come from a particular area in north - eastern italy , spanning the veneto and friuli regions
in fact , compared with the more complex flavours of champagne and cava , prosecco is , quite literally , the softer option
it âs relatively light , at around 11 per cent alcohol ( champagne and cava are normally closer to 12 per cent ) , with frothy bubbles and simple fruit flavours , wrapped up with a touch of sweetness
unlike champagne and cava , which is already in a bottle for that second bubble - inducing fermentation , the tank method of producing prosecco bubbles keeps production costs down â especially compared with champagne
no long years of ageing in dark cellars required ; producers can make up a batch of prosecco in a matter of months rather than years
which is a good thing , because prosecco is best when it âs young and most is produced as non-vintage , meaning it wo nât have a stated year on the label
so , with everyone reaching for a glass or few of prosecco , are we going to run out of this no - fuss fruity fizz fit for any occasion ? while champagne is aged for atleast 18 months , more for ' vintage ' bottles , prosecco can be made in a matter of months rather than years that might have been the case had the area where prosecco comes from not undergone significant changes in 2009
european wine laws protect what can be labelled as prosecco under doc â meaning doc â regulations ( similar to the ones that decree champagne must come from a certain region of france )
but in 2009 the area allowed to produce wine under the prosecco doc name was expanded significantly and increased controls were introduced in an effort to ensure the quality of what was produced was nât compromised
at the same time , the original doc region â between the towns of conegliano and valdobbiadene , and around the town of ca â morlin prosecco superiore docg asolo â was upgraded to the smarter docg status ( doc )
if you see â prosecco superiore â or any of these town names on the label , you âre likely to get a better quality of wine â and pay a higher price ( currently , doc quality wines range from Â£ 6 to Â£ 10 , with docg quality wines from Â£ 7 to Â£ 15 )
soffio no. 3 Â£ 6.66 when you buy two , majestic apparently , this is holly willoughby âs favourite prosecco
asolo prosecco Â£ 12.95 , bbr.com my current favourite , this is a creamy , dreamy prosecco from the asolo prosecco docg
ca â morlin prosecco superiore docg asolo Â£ 13.70 , slurp this comes from the man who first brought prosecco to the uk in the eighties â not that he sold much back then
