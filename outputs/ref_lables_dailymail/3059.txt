an enormous diorama which shows the full extent of the waterloo has gone on display to mark the 200th anniversary of the conflict
the model contains more than 30,000 figures , and illustrates all the key moments of the battle which allowed the wellington to defeat napoleon 's forces
it was built in the 1970s , but fell into disrepair before being restored to its former glory just in time for the battle 's bicentenary , which falls on june 18 of this year
despite the enormous scale of the diorama , the number of troops featured is just a third of the true number who were killed or wound in the battle - and less than 10 per cent of the total number who took part
the diorama was not intended as a snapshot of the battle at any one point , but instead it depicts five different key stages in the progress of the conflict
crucial : one of the key moments depicted is the battle for hougoumont , a fortress which was successfully defended by wellington melee : the british forming a square in the face of attacks from napoleon 's troops charge : the scots greys making an intervention in the battle , whose 200th anniversary is this year indomitable : a farmer successfully defended his vegetable patch even as the battle raged all around him busted : two british soldiers are depicted trying to sneak off with their regiment 's entire ration of gin the first is the battle for hougoumont , a castle successfully defended by wellington , followed by the attempt by d'erlon corps to attack wellington 's centre , which was repelled by lieutenant general sir thomas picton
the final crucial moment depicted is the attack of the imperial guard , napoleon 's last desperate throw of the dice , which led to the guard being forced to retreat for the first time ever
both the wellington and napoleon can be found on the model astride their horses directing the battle
grim : major general william ponsonby being cut down by a group of french lancers during the battle onslaught : french troops trying to break through the gates of hougoumont , as the british guard the walls help : a wounded soldier being escorted off the battlefield by his wife , who was apparently acting as a camp nurse family : women and children in the back of a cart on the edges of the waterloo battlefield quagmire : men , carts and horses get stuck in a muddy pit and try to haul their equipment out lighter moments include a belgium farmer defending his prized vegetable patch while the battle rages around him , two english soldiers getting drunk on gin and an infantryman relieving himself against a tree
' the 200th anniversary of waterloo is a landmark commemoration of a decisive victory that brought peace to europe after years of conflict
' late arrival : marshal blã¼cher leading the prussian troops onto the battlefield , in a decisive intervention repair : the diorama was in a poor condition before being restored ahead of the anniversary spruced up : these images show how the figures were covered in dust before their recent restoration conservation : kelvin and mary thatcher used a vacuum cleaner to help remove the grime which had built up conservationists kelvin and mary thatcher spent five months cleaning the figures on the diorama , and glued back together scores of severed limbs , lost swords and displaced cannonballs
mr hayes added : ' the diorama was made in the 1970s by valhalla models and acquired by the museum in the 1980s
