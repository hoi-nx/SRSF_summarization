a texas state trooper who did what millions of hip - hop fans would love to do and posed for a picture with snoop was told he has '' deficiencies indicating need for counseling '
department of public safety trooper spears posed for the photograph with snoop at sxsw in austin after the rap icon delivered his keynote speech
spears , who is based out of the state 's gilmer office , posed for the photo at the rapper 's request
the official reprimand read : ' while working a secondary employment job , trooper spears took a photo with a public figure who has a well - known criminal background including numerous drug charges
since spears was only reprimanded with counseling , department of public safety does not view the penalty as a formal disciplinary action and the trooper can not appeal
' so it appears that department of public safety commanders are papering spears âs file with counseling incidents because they ca nât prove that he violated any law , order , or policy , and they know that he will beat them with the law and the facts if he is given an opportunity to appeal
