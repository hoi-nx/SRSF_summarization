when emma jackson , 28 , moved into a quiet cul - de - sac in hull just over a year ago , she thought she had found the perfect place to call home
but within a week of moving in , her dream home turned into a nightmare thanks to an aggressive neighbour with a penchant for watching tv with the volume turned up at all hours of the day
unable to sleep because of the racket , the photography student asked unemployed ray , 56 , to turn it down - but was met with a barrage of abuse that culminated , a year later , in violent threats and stalking
terrified : emma jackson , 28 , was subjected to vile verbal abuse and was stalked by her neighbour now ms emma jackson has been forced to move home because of mr ray but says she lives in terror of him discovering her new address
ms emma jackson 's ordeal began less than a week after moving into her ground floor flat , which she did despite having been warned that the previous occupants also had trouble with mr ray
' after a week , ms emma jackson approached her neighbour to ask whether he would mind turning the sound down a bit but found herself on the receiving end of an expletive - laden tirade
aggressive : ray , 56 , waged a year - long campaign of terror against ms emma jackson quiet : ms emma jackson and mr ray were neighbours in this quiet cul - de - sac in hull ' i got this explosion , this tirade of abuse , ' she remembers
' the noise continued , with ms emma jackson forced to resort to headphones in order to get any sleep at all
worse still , mr ray began to subject her to vile tirades every time he spotted her in the street or over the garden fence
incensed , ms emma jackson got in touch with the local housing association
although ordered to turn his television down , the 28 - year - old says mr ray 's new leaf lasted for just seven days
' finally at breaking point , ms emma jackson snapped and banged on the ceiling with a broom handle during a cleaning session
mr ray responded by banging on her front door and , when confronted and accused of bullying by ms emma jackson , threw a 3ft wooden pole at her
damage : as well as threatening violence , mr ray nailed the shed door shut ( see photo held by ms emma jackson ) traumatised : ms emma jackson says her year of living next door to mr ray was the worst of her life as the situation at home worsened , it began to affect all areas of ms emma jackson 's life , with mr ray even turning up at her workplace
her family were also affected , with mr ray physically threatening her step - mother and father when they visited ms emma jackson 's home
' mr ray came out , he was shouting and swearing as usual and red in the face , ' she remembers
' the police were called and mr ray was handed an injunction that prevented him from approaching or speaking to ms emma jackson
' by now at her wits end , ms emma jackson says every part of her life was suffering
' eventually , ms emma jackson installed a cctv camera and was finally able to gather the evidence she needed to prove mr ray was breaking the terms of the injunction
but for ms emma jackson , it was too little , too late and she has now moved into a new home away from mr ray
