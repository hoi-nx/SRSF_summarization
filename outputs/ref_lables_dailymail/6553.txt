mr arwani was an imam at the an-noor mosque in acton , london , but was forced to step down last year over reports it was repeatedly linked with extremists
he was found with gunshot wounds to his chest in wembley on tuesday morning
his daughter elham arwani said her father ran a building company and had been visiting wembley in connection with his work
' any syria who is free and who knows the truth is against assad
it 's not going to be because he was against assad
' at least 200 mourners gathered to pay tribute to him last night at nadi park royal in willesden junction , north west london , where he preached every wednesday
preacher : mr arwani was known for his outspoken opposition to the assad regime mourners claimed the imam was a peaceful man who opposed extremism
some speculated that he may have been killed in a hit from the syria regime or because of a disagreement over management of the west london mosque
dr khaled kamaraldi , who gave arwani his first job as a builder 15 years ago , said : ' he went out to syria to educate the fighters about the treatment of prisoners of war and about human rights
' he said if you behaved like the assad regime you become like them
he was very active against the assad regime
' home : mr arwani , originally from syria , lived in this home in white city , west london one friend , solicitor mohammad bassam tablieh , 43 , from west london , said there could be ' two reasons behind his killing '
' he added that many people in london who had green flags in there car as a symbol of being anti-assad have had their tyres slashed but did not know if mr arwani had one in his vehicle
but rafiq , managing director of anti-extremist think - tank the quilliam foundation , said it was too early to start speculating about why mr arwani was killed
but he was nât necessarily assad âs biggest enemy here in the british
' mr rafiq added : ' arwani himself was nât actually extremist
' mr arwani was involved in violent anti-assad demonstrations outside the syria embassy in london in 2012 mr arwani grew up in hama , the site of a notorious 1982 massacre where up to 40,000 civilians were killed by the syrian army under the orders of hafez al-assad , the current president 's father
in a lecture he gave in 2012 , mr arwani described how the assad regime had sentenced him to death , forcing him to flee his homeland , and then harassed his elderly relatives for three decades
mr arwani , who was just 16 at the time , said that he took a series of photographs chronicling the damage done to mosques and houses in the city , and was sentenced to death by the authorities for it
' when they found out that i did that , they issued a capital punishment against me , when i was 16 years old - so i had to flee from syria , ' he said
mr arwani blamed the atrocities carried out by the assad regime on its supposed abandonment of muslim , saying that from the 1960s the government ' started to implement atheism , and take off muslim from the life of the people '
the assad regime has been known to assassinate its political opponents in the past , most prominently the lebanese prime minister rafik hariri , whose killing in 2005 was blamed on the syria government
the an-noor , where mr arwani used to be one of the main imams , has a reputation for hosting fundamentalist speakers
some friends of mr arwani said that he had left the mosque after a dispute about money , despite reports that his departure was linked to extremism ali belai said : ' nothing he said was ever extremist
' anas qamar , another syria exile , said that mr arwani had been involved in a high court battle over the mosque 's finances when one of the trustees allegedly embezzled money from worshippers
' arwani said the mosque was a charity and should not be run to profit one man , ' he said
