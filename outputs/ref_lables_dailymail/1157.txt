i yield to no one in my love of the old days â warm beer , cricket on the village green , bobbies on bicycles two by two , all that â but it 's rare a chance arises to compare the rose - tinted past with the brave new world , as it did on saturday evening when sky 's high - octane premier league coverage went head - to - head with arsenal v biscuitmen in the fa cup semi-final on the bbc
as we know , the premier league has the money and prestige , but what the fa cup has is history , and boy does the bbc love a bit of history ? lest you were in any doubt , its coverage of the semi-final kicked off with footage of the late sir laurence olivier doing the st crispin 's day speech from the film of henry v ( ' we happy few , we band of brothers , ' and so on )
gary lineker , alan shearer , jason roberts and ian wright fronted the bbc 's coverage at wembley bbc presenter gary lineker prepares to present the match of the day 50th anniversary special broadcast reading defender nathaniel chaloboah ( left ) chases arsenal midfielder aaron ramsey ( right ) on saturday gunners forward alexis sanchez celebrates after scoring his side 's winning goal in the fa cup semi-final stand - in match of the day presenter gabby logan ( left ) with pundits phil neville and robbie savage ( right ) the excuse , i guess , was that biscuitmen 's nickname is the biscuitmen , but as the second - tier team are also known as the biscuitmen
not that sky 's presenters are less than competent â david jones did the job â but it 's never a good sign when you have to go to google to check which one it is
the price of live premier league football is now way beyond the reach of the bbc , which may be the clincher in lineker 's future
while the bbc 's match had the lion 's share of the goalmouth action , it was difficult to resist turning over to sky on occasion
