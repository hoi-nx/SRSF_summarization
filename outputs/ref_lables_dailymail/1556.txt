julie mckenzie thought scoliosis was the cause of her bad back julie mckenzie was assured by her gp that her nagging back pain was down to a mild curvature of the spine
she 'd gone to see him three months after suddenly developing back problems and had been referred for x-rays
these revealed that her spine was slightly curved , a condition known as scoliosis
but julie mckenzie , 53 , felt there was more to it - she 'd always been strong and active until the pain began in the spring of 2013
' if i made a sudden movement , i 'd experience a sharp , pinching pain in my lower spine that would take my breath away and force me to stop whatever i was doing
' a month after seeing her gp , and feeling increasingly desperate , julie mckenzie , an administrator , who is divorced with two grown - up children , and lives in bushey , herts , used her private medical cover to see a spinal surgeon , robert lee
the consultant ordered an mri scan , which showed that she did have some scoliosis and her discs had signs of wear and tear , suggesting arthritis
but crucially the radiographer spotted that julie mckenzie 's coccyx - the bone at the tail of the spine - was slightly enlarged
cases like julie mckenzie 's are why some experts feel that too often back pain is written off as something that is to be endured , rather than investigated
' eighty per cent of people will experience an episode of severe back pain in their lifetime - but only 8 per cent of these go on to suffer chronic pain , ' says peter hamlyn , a neurosurgeon at university college hospital london and the spine surgery london
' many of these chronic sufferers are simply dismissed as having ' non-specific low back pain '
' back pain is ' very often under - investigated ' , adds surgeon robert lee , of the spire hospital in bushey
' she sought a second opinion from a private surgeon , who sent her for an mri scan he adds : ' most back pain is the result of muscular strains , and is short - lived
' however , an mri should be offered when back pain goes on for eight weeks or more so that you know what you are dealing with and can treat this accordingly
these , too , can cause back pain
a very observant radiologist spotted a tumour , which was removed chordomas can occur anywhere along the spine , and the later symptoms such as back pain , numbness , aching and tingling can be mistaken for more minor strains or disc problems
although it was apparent from her mri that julie mckenzie had a tumour , it was impossible to tell if it was cancerous or benign
the only options were to remove the entire coccyx , or leave the tumour and scan every few months to see if it grew
julie mckenzie had her operation in october 2013
' i asked mr robert lee to tell me the results over the phone , ' julie mckenzie recalls
' ironically , after the operation , julie mckenzie still has back pain as a result of her arthritis
