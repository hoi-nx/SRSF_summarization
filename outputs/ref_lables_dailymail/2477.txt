the study 's lead researcher said the results are a ' surprise ' , but it 's no excuse to pile on the pounds for years we have been told that the first step to staying healthy is to keep to a healthy weight - that means making sure your bmi is within the normal range of 18 to 24
few people are advised to gain weight , unless their bmi is below 18 , but could that change ? a study published last week suggests that overweight people are less likely to develop dementia
the researchers , drawn mostly from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , analysed the medical records of nearly two million people for up to ten years and found that those who were overweight ( with a bmi of 25 to 29 ) had an 18 per cent lower risk of dementia compared to those with a healthy bmi
remarkably the obese ( with a bmi of 30 plus ) did even better ; they were 24 per cent less likely to develop dementia
being underweight increased the dementia risk by 39 per cent
three years ago , an even larger study , published in the journal of the american medical association , reported that overweight people tended to live longer than those of normal weight
it found that being overweight ( a bmi between 25 and 29 ) reduced the risk of premature death by six per cent compared with someone of a normal bmi
more surprising was that even if someone was at the lower end of obese ( bmi of 30 to 34.5 ) their risk of premature death did n't go up
being obese started to reduce lifespan only when your bmi went above 35 - here the risk of dying earlier climbed to 29 per cent greater than those with a normal bmi , according to the study , headed by dr flegal , of the u.s. government centres for disease control
so could being cuddly fat , rather than hugely overweight , protect you against dying early ? being overweight ( a bmi between 25 and 29 ) reduced the risk of premature death by six per cent professor haslam , a gp and chairman of the national obesity forum , says something called the obesity paradox is at work : ' obesity increases your chances of developing disorders such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes but once you 've fallen ill , being a bit overweight seems to have a protective effect
' he says that what counts as a normal or ' healthy ' bmi has been miscalculated : ' it would make sense if normal was what is now called overweight
equally , current bmi categories give the wrong picture for what might be called the ' fit fat ' ; people who may have a lot of fat but also eat well and exercise regularly
their bmi may classify them as obese , but other markers ( blood sugar , fat levels in their blood and blood pressure ) can all be in the super healthy range
apparently healthy - weight people with little muscle mass because they rarely exercise also make bmi an unreliable indicator of health because rather than storing their fat under the skin , they may carry it in their abdomen , wrapped around their organs and pumping out chemical messengers and hormones linked to diabetes , heart disease and cancer
' current bmi categories give the wrong picture for what might be called the ' fit fat ' all this suggests it is not a good idea to advise someone to lose weight just on their bmi
' why fatter people should be better protected from alzheimer 's is guesswork , but evidence suggests having more fat reserves when you fall ill is associated with better recovery
there is no doubt that being obese , and to a lesser extent overweight , is linked to a raised risk of cancers , diabetes , and other chronic disorders
