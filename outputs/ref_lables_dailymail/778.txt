book of the week naturalists in paradise : alfred russel wallace , bates and spruce in the amazon by hemming back in 1961 three young oxford graduates set off to explore the iriri river in a remote part of the amazon
bird of paradise : a musician wren more than 50 years on , that same fascination still shines out of every page of naturalists in paradise , the compelling story of an earlier trio of young british explorers
nonetheless , for naturalists as driven as alfred russel wallace , henry bates and richard spruce , a paradise is exactly what the amazon was
even after being attacked by a particularly nasty species of wasp , richard spruce wrote of his admiration for ' their beauty , ingenuity and heroic ferocity '
these days , the image of 19th - century british travellers is perhaps of public - school types airily bossing the natives about , possibly from a sedan chair
well , not in this case - because alfred russel wallace , henry bates and richard spruce were all classic examples of victorian self - improvement
at 15 , henry bates was working 13 hours a day , six days a week , as a hosiery apprentice
naturalist richard spruce the young alfred russel wallace loved nothing better than to curl up with the poetry of milton or dante - until he discovered the joys of plant classification
aged 17 , richard spruce carefully listed 403 species of plants near his yorkshire home , before surrendering to the seemingly irresistible appeal of mosses and liverworts
when alfred russel wallace and henry bates met in leicester in 1844 , apparently at the public library , they immediately realised they were kindred spirits
four years later , still in their early 20s and having found a london agent to sell any specimens they sent back , they sailed to brazil , which was already recognised as an ecological treasure - trove
( henry bates preferred to stay in one place for months at a time , while alfred russel wallace liked to go wherever his more impulsive nose led him
) a year later , richard spruce arrived to begin his own amazon adventures , bumping into the others only occasionally
sad to say , in the port of bã©lem where they landed , the biggest difference from english that alfred russel wallace and henry bates noticed was the comparative lack of drunkenness
in one village , henry bates was amazed to come across a man whose mud - hut contained a library of well - thumbed latin classics
in another , alfred russel wallace was both shocked and delighted by a cheerfully dissolute priest
after alfred russel wallace shot part of his own hand off , he confessed to feeling ' rather miserable '
' with bleeding feet and an empty stomach , i found the journey sufficiently toilsome , ' wrote richard spruce of one trip
henry bates alone managed to send 14,712 species , with the number of specimens naturally far higher
the biggest loss , in fact , came when the boat on which alfred russel wallace was travelling home in 1852 caught fire , destroying his notebooks and the live animals he 'd brought with him
yet within two years , alfred russel wallace was off again , this time for eight years of collecting in asia
meanwhile , back in amazonia , henry bates and richard spruce were still collecting away ... hemming tells the story of this extraordinary trio without hype , wisely content to let the facts and their own reflections speak largely for themselves
