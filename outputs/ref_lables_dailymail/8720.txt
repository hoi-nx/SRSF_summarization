from the moment he emerged as a raw youngster in the england team you could see that
england have always produced swing bowlers but not one with anderson âs skills
he knew what he was doing , too , as soon as he came into the england side ahead of the 2003 world cup
anderson edged closer to sir botham 's record for england 's leading wicket - taker in test look at him on tuesday
anderson celebrates the dismissal of devon smith on day two in antigua , his 381st test wicket the 32 - year - old is playing in his 100th test match for england this week in antigua yes , he can be a bit difficult
reaching 100 tests as a fast bowler and being on the brink of becoming england âs leading wicket - taker is more about character and the fight in anderson than about his skills
anderson has been the leader of england 's bowling attack for a while and will be vital in the ashes it is far from easy for a fast bowler to play 100 tests and in anderson âs case you can not say he has lost a yard of pace because of all that hard work he has put in
england must be careful with him now they are in a run of 17 tests in nine months
if anderson were to miss any ashes tests it would be a serious blow to their hopes of regaining the urn because stuart broad is not at his best and chris jordan and ben stokes are still making their way
but i âm not sure anderson , who will be 33 in july , should be playing one - day cricket , in which he has never been a world - beater
england need him in test cricket as long as possible
anderson was presented with a special silver cap by michael atherton ( right ) for reaching 100 tests a youthful anderson pictured on test debut against zimbabwe at lord 's in may 2003 he wants to carry on for as long as possible , that âs for sure , but he will have to set goals for himself , like coming back at australia after being on the end of the second 5 - 0 ashes defeat in his career
