like cheryl and ashley both zayn and perrie , 21 , have enjoyed a huge amount of fame
and like cheryl and ashley their romance has been dogged with cheating allegations , almost from the start
cheryl and ashley were happily married until she discovered that he had cheated on her on several occasions the x factor alumni twosome first got together in august 2011 but by august 2012 it was being reported that zayn had been filmed through the keyhole of a hotel room with another woman

for cheryl , who is now re-married , the cheating rumours eventually became too much and she ended her marriage to ashley in 2010
by february 2010 , just a month before cheryl announced their split , four more women had come forward to say the same
zayn and perrie got engaged in 2013 but he has since been accused of cheating on her on several occasions tracey says that zayn 's level of fame will be difficult for someone so young but perrie , who accepted zayn 's marriage proposal in august 2013 , is currently sticking by her man - who has yet to comment on the latest allegations
for the most part though , despite the on - going accusations of infidelity , zayn has remained relatively high in public favour - unlike ashley
will perrie and zayn 's relationship ended up like cheryl and ashley 's ? tracey continued : ' ashley is older and , as an adult , should have the maturity to go beyond instant gratification to be able to think through the consequences
' the other difference of course is that ashley was married to cheryl while zayn is dating
