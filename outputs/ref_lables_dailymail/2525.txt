gaddaf al-dam , a former minister and the muammar gaddafi 's cousin the most senior member of the muammar gaddafi clan has laid the blame of the migrant shipwreck that killed about 950 people on the western countries which helped overthrow colonel gaddafi
gaddaf al-dam , a former minister and muammar gaddafi 's cousin , said the ' overwhelming chaos ' in libya ' has become a shame that will haunt the countries that had participated in the destruction of the libya armed forces in 2011 '
but senior conservative minister hague has defended the government 's role in helping to overthrow the dictator , who was well - known for his barbaric treatment of the would - be migrants
and muammar gaddafi 's cousin , who was one of several high - profile regime figures who fled to egypt during the 2011 revolution , believes the only solution for stability in the mediterranean is to bring back those who surrounded the country 's despotic former ruler in government
mr gaddaf al-dam , whose supporters claim could be libya 's next president , said western countries have shed ' the tears of crocodiles over democracy and human rights '
how have super power countries , members of the security council , been incapable of realising that they are committing such a crime and not foreseeing the consequences ? ' what happened in libya , syria and iraq may extend everywhere ... and will burn all the fingers that have participated in it
mr gaddaf al-dam claimed a third of the population had been displaced , men and women had been imprisoned and are subjected to torture , and towns are cities are bombed
but mr hague said it would be wrong to think that whatever has happened in libya in the last few years is the cause of this '
' colonel muammar gaddafi 's 42 - year - rule , which ended in 2011 , was characterised by tyranny
he saw himself as the leader of the third world and used libya 's vast oil wealth to sponsor terror , shipping semtex to the ira and sending agents to bring down a pan am flight over lockerbie in scotland
the lockerbie bomber was allowed to return to libya from a uk prison and muammar gaddafi intelligence officers were even allowed to operate in uk
the so - called ' deal in the desert ' struck by tony blair in 2004 involved the dictator agreeing to crack down on human traffickers as well as renouncing libya 's possession of weapons of mass destruction and decommissioning the country 's chemical and nuclear weapons programs
the migrants would then typically be deported to libya 's southern border crossing with sudan - where they were abandoned in a harsh desert environment - or otherwise flown back to their country of origin without any checks on what they would be facing back home
as tony blair 's much touted ' deal in the desert ' turned sour , muammar gaddafi gave people smugglers in zuwara the green light to resume their trade and the migrant routes have flourished ever since
but mr gaddaf al-dam said the only way to bring stability back to the country is to bring back the gaddafis
the so - called ' deal in the desert ' struck by tony blair in 2004 involved the dictator agreeing to crack down on human traffickers ' libya now is ruled by extreme criminal gangsters â¦ in alliance with all the world 's devils : from drug dealers , human traffickers , exploiters of religion , arms traders , and international mafias
refugee route : tens of thousands of migrants are fleeing libya as extremists take advantage of the political chaos engulfing the country new ground : isis has conquered regions of iraq , syria and recently libya ( pictured ) while building a terrifying support structure in turkey , yemen , saudi arabia , egypt 's sinai province , afghanistan , tunisia and algeria mr gaddaf al-dam added : ' the coming period requires a strong government that has experience in controlling this chaos : a government supported by the libya army and police in order for libya to reach the shores of safety
' he claims the muammar gaddafi supporters number two million and are not a party but said it is made up of several major tribes with the support of the libya army and police
' mr gaddaf al-dam called for a conference that includes all parties , including isis and the gaddafis
' earlier this year , mr gaddaf al-dam professed that ' not less than half a million ' migrants will set sail from libya to europe shores this year
