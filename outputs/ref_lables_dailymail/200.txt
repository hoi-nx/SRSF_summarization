jeremy peace , the west brom chairman , will only sell the club to a buyer who will invest money on and off the pitch
peace is open to selling west brom for Â£ 150million as long as a suitable custodian can be found by july , and pulis would want immediate talks with any new chairman over his position
pulis is adamant that chairman jeremy peace will sell the club to someone who wants to invest heavily peace has fielded enquiries from consortia in america , china and australia with some parties already having a tour of the club 's training ground facilities
â but i think that jeremy peace is a massive west brom supporter , he âs been here a long time and he âs done a lot of very , very good things for this football club , so i do nât think he wants to see his legacy blown away
