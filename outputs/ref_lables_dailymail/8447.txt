luxury : audley square house is set to be a complex of houses , luxury flats and penthouses in mayfair , central london contrast : most of the plot is currently taken up by an ugly parking garage which is set to be knocked down by owner john caudwell but it could face trouble getting planning permission - as vip neighbours may object to the building works needed to build four levels of basements as well as nine storeys above the ground
