the main gas chambers were located at birkenau
' the capacity of the gas chambers and the capacity of the crematoria were quite limited
' they all walked - some in one direction some , in another direction ... to where the crematoria and gas chambers were

eva kor , the first co-plaintiff to address the court , described her experience wednesday and asked oskar groening whether he knew mengele or details about files he kept in hopes of learning more about what diseases she and her sister , who both survived the camp , were injected with
oskar groening showed no reaction to eva kor 's statement and his attorney , hans holtermann , said his client would try to answer what questions he could , but he did n't believe that oskar groening knew mengele
though he was investigated twice before and no charges were brought , oskar groening was indicted under a new line of german legal reasoning that anyone who helped a death camp function can be accused of being an accessory to murder without evidence of participation in a specific crime
