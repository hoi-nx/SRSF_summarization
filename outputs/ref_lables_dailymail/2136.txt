jose mourinho was haveing none of it of course , rightly so , insisting they need eight points
â if the celebration is because the players gave everything to win that game and they feel the result of the work they did this week , then i also understand that
â yet though chelsea were on the back foot for much of the game , though united did play well , the champions elect were worth their win not least in the fact that they were more or less in control of their destiny and they had the outstanding player on the pitch in eden hazard
when he nut - megged david de gea for the opening goal , it was as though the race to be player of the season â they are both shortlisted for the award - had become a personal feud

when you have seen the statistics , it 's unbelievable that the result is 1 - 0
in spite of the difference and despite chelsea 's defensive organisation , we have created more chances
that 's an unbelievable performance â but , read the score
â jose mourinho had the perfect riposte to that
jose mourinho would not have wanted the challenge cahill made in the final moments of added time , in which andre herrera trailed his leg into the clumsy tackle and fell
ander herrera received a yellow card for diving â and jose mourinho made much play of how his players might have been accused had they done the same â but another referee might easily have given a penalty
united midfielder ander herrera knocks the ball past chelsea defender cahill inside the home side 's box ander herrera sticks out his right leg to make contact with cahill before falling to the ground and appealing for a penalty in the 95th minute cahill and ander herrera go head - to - head after the united man was penalised for diving late on at stamford bridge chelsea boss jose mourinho gestures on the stamford bridge touchline as he watches his side take on united united striker radamel falcao ( left ) controls the ball as chelsea 's makeshift midfielder kurt zouma keeps a close eye on him referee mike dean is surrounded by united players as the visitors complain about a decision going against them hazard almost made it 2 - 0 with an acrobatic , close - range shot but his effort hit the bar after surging run forward from didier drogba former united boss sir alex ferguson watches his old club lose 1 - 0 to chelsea from the stands at stamford bridge likewise when luke shaw , a constant worry to branislav ivanonic , played in radamel falcao and he smashed the ball against the post on 76 minutes , that would not have been in the jose mourinho game plan
that said , though united dominated midfield with ander herrera and wayne rooney , chelsea had the better chances
having conceded much of the possession , john terry muscled radamel falcao off the ball â a foul according to louis van gaal â and found oscar on 37 minutes , whose impudent back heel saw hazard set off like with an intent that would not be denied
ander herrera then blotted his copy book , with a wayward pass on 53 minutes , seized on by didier drogba , sprinting goal - wards
