the director of public prosecutions who let off janner over alleged child sex abuse started her career at a legal chambers when the disgraced labour party peer was a top qc there
alison saunders , 54 , sparked outrage last week when she decided the 86 - year - old should not face a string of charges of paedophilia against nine children because he has dementia
it has been revealed that the country 's top prosecutor alison saunders ( right ) who ruled that janner ( right ) would not face trial over alleged child sex abuse trained at the same legal firm where he was a qc last night , the sun revealed that mrs alison saunders trained in the same in legal chambers where janner had practised
the bar council , the training body for barristers , confirmed janner worked at the legal firm from the mid- 1950s up until 1986
but a spokesperson for the cps insisted the pair had never met , despite a three - year overlap of their time at the firm
after a short time as deputy legal adviser to the attorney general from 2003 , she returned to the cps two years later to set up its organised crime division
now , the country 's top prosecutor is facing calls to quit from campaigners and alleged abuse victims
' the cps concluded there was enough evidence to charge janner with 22 offences from 1969 and 1998
while admitting that dementia is not ' a bar ' to prosecution , mrs alison saunders has defended her decision not to bring charges against janner , adding she was surprised at the political backlash she has faced
â but her links to the shamed peer come as it emerged the judge tasked with reviewing the mistakes that prevented janner from being brought to trial in the past was a close friend of the barrister hired to defend janner against claims of abuse
janner turned to the late qc - who also represented paedophile jimmy savile - when he was first investigated in 1991
but mrs alison saunders has insisted that sir richard 's friendship with mr carman would have no influence on the review .
