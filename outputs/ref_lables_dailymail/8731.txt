when retired hairdresser theodosia aresti , 71 , moved into a new - build flat in london five years ago , the frail pensioner thought she had found her dream home
but after a blocked pipe unleashed a ' tsunami of sewage ' from the nine - storey building 's 239 other flats into her apartment , her hopes of a contented retirement were ruined - and she says she now hopes to move
mrs theodosia aresti 's nightmare began when she noticed a foul smell coming from her bathroom and discovered an unidentifiable brown substance bubbling up through the plughole in her bath
' with raw sewage pouring into her flat , mrs theodosia aresti phoned her daughter kiki and grandson nicos and begged them to come to her aid
she also got in touch with the company in charge of maintaining the nine - story block of flats to tell them that waste was pouring into her flat
' i phoned the maintenance people and i said , it looks like sewage stuff coming out the bath
disgusting : the flood started with her bath , which started filling up with ' brown lumps ' overflowing : mrs theodosia aresti 's toilet began overflowing with sewage ' like a volcano ' according to grandson nicos revolting : the toilet and bath both began overflowing with sewage , flooding mrs theodosia aresti 's flat in the process ' when the man arrived , it was too late
despite the best efforts of the plumber , who spent four hours trying to stem the tide of sewage , the excrement was strewn all over the flat and had soaked into carpets
worst of all was the mess in her bedroom which , according to daughter kiki , both smelled ' foul ' and ' was unhealthy ' thanks to the sodden carpet
maintenance workers , however , were unable to visit for four days - leaving a distressed mrs theodosia aresti to sleep in a room filled with sewage for three nights
devastated : the disgusting episode has left mrs theodosia aresti desperate to find a new home furious : mrs theodosia aresti 's daughter kiki and grandson nicos were took part in the clean - up operation damage : mrs theodosia aresti 's bedroom carpet was soaked in sewage and had to be replaced afterwards ' the bedroom it was soaked , ' she says
' eventually , workmen came in to remove the carpet but when they lifted it up , the movement caused her wardrobe to collapse - soaking everything in it in sewage
