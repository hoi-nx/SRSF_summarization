rbs has racked up Â£ 50billion in losses since it was bailed out by taxpayers and warned last night that it faces another â tough year â
the state - backed giant reached the milestone yesterday as it lurched to a Â£ 446million loss for the first three months of the year
down : rbs reposted a Â£ 446million loss in the first three months of the year in addition to fines in the us , the latest bill includes provision for compensating customers mis - sold payment protection insurance and fee - paying packaged accounts in the uk
a return to profit for both rbs and state - backed lloyds would have boosted his claims to have fixed the banks bailed out by taxpayers under the labour government in 2008
lloyds has returned to profit and is gradually being sold off to the private sector , but the losses at rbs suggest taxpayers are a long way from recouping some of the Â£ 46billion bailout that saved the bank from collapse during the financial crisis
mr fred the shred was knighted for â services to banking â in 2004 but was stripped of his title in 2012 chief executive ross mcewan said : â this is going to be another tough year
â it âs clear that the banks were badly regulated and took extremely risky decisions that left taxpayers with extraordinary burdens , so it remains crucial that rbs gets back in the black as soon as is practically possible
