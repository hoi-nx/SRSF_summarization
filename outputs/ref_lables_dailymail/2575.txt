a radical muslim preacher has been refused a passport after the home office accused him of planning to join islamic state
brooks , an associate of islamist firebrand anjem choudary , was told it was not in the public interest for him to have a passport because he is seen as a terror risk
a home office letter says that brooks , also known as brooks , is an extremist linked to members of the banned group al muhajiroun
brooks is a known associate of islamist firebrand preacher anjem choudary ( pictured ) the letter adds : ' it is also assessed that you intend to travel overseas to syria where you would use this opportunity to engage in terrorism - related activity , likely fighting alongside the terrorist organisation known as the islamic state
' brooks , 39 , was released from prison last month after serving part of his 11 - month term for breaching bail on a terrorist offence
the notorious rabble rouser received an invitation by letter from the debating society , which stated it would be a ' great privilege ' to have anjem choudary appear as the star guest
