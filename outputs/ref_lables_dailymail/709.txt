' my , my ! at napoleon did surrender , â sang sweden âs fab four in their famous eurovision song contest winner
now this may come as a surprise , but you would be well advised not to rely on abba to help with your history homework
if benny and bjorn actually laboured under this surrendering misapprehension when they wrote their song ( songwriters are not hot on facts â happy to say anything as long as it rhymes ) , they would have discovered the truth when they subsequently paid a visit to the wellington museum in waterloo , just south of brussels in belgian
view of hougoumont from the lion 's mound or lion 's mound on the battlefield of waterloo , belgian judging by the photo of abba âs visit , prominently on view in the museum , the group seems to have been treated to a rapturous limousine procession through the town
my , my : the people of waterloo must have been delighted
napoleon certainly did nât surrender at waterloo
when napoleon saw that things were going badly , he hot - footed it to paris , where he later abdicated
â waterloo â quickly entered the english language as a synonym for â a decisive defeat â
but while the british know what happened when napoleon met his waterloo , the french - speaking world is less convinced
battle of waterloo reenactors stand in historic costume , with rifles and flags belgian is divided into two halves : flemish - speaking and french - speaking
it is unfortunate for anniversary - celebrating purposes that waterloo lies in the french half where the locals are preparing to mark the bicentenary of the waterloo â with napoleon as the unchallenged star of the show
local anglo - belgian entrepreneur martin has invested a substantial financial stake in plans for marking the anniversary by turning a templar hospice on the edge of the battlefield into a magnificent restaurant - cum - brewery ( where he brews waterloo beer , of course ) and a museum looking at the surgical side of the battle ( not for the squeamish )
it would be fair to say that mr martin is not best pleased by the outbreak of napoleon - worship
he points to the poster advertising the re-enactment event which will be taking place this summer over four days from june 18 to 21 ; the photograph shows a giant , heroic napoleon towering over the smaller , less impressive figures of wellington and prussian leader blucher
â the french - speaking world refuses to believe napoleon lost the battle
a painting of the waterloo ; 2015 marks the 200th anniversary of the battle as far as they âre concerned , he scored some sort of moral victory
poet byron , something of a bonaparte fan , suddenly found he had time to visit the battlefield when his lavish coach , modelled on napoleon âs battle carriage , broke down on his journey from the channel to the south
' my , my ! at napoleon did surrender ! ' abba pictured in the town of waterloo , belgian in 1974 in a top gear moment , byron treated himself to a charge across the battleground on a large cossack horse he had hired , making himself perhaps the first battlefield tourist
soon waterloo was established as one of the great continental sights
it was british tourists visiting waterloo who discovered the neglected city of bruges â largely derelict after its access to the sea silted up â and helped to finance its restoration
there was an unmistakable sense that waterloo had been a defining moment in history : europe had been reshaped and , the odd franco - german conflict apart , peace reigned for a century
the pleasure of the area around waterloo is that in many ways it has barely changed
an injection of Â£ 1 million has ensured hougoumont will open to the public for the first time for the celebrations in june , with guests able to stay in a self - catering cottage within the farm â and as far as i could tell from my visit last month , hougoumont is a napoleon - free zone
may marks the 75th anniversary of operation dynamo , the evacuation of allied troops from dunkirk dunkirk while june marks the anniversary of a glorious victory , may sees the 75th anniversary of what has sometimes been referred to as a glorious failure : operation dynamo â the evacuation of allied troops from the beaches near dunkirk from may 26 to june 4 , 1940
