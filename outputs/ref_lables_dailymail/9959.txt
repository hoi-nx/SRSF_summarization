a new county cricket season is almost upon us with the first round of county championship fixtures this summer beginning on sunday up and down the country
yorkshire will be looking to defend their division one title while kevin pietersen will hope his runs help surrey to promotion from the second tier
here is former surrey and england batsman mark butcher 's guide to the county championship
division one durham verdict : i do nât think they have the strength to carry the title off

overseas : jeetan patel ( nz ) , brendon mccullum ( nz , t20 ) england fast bowler chris woakes dressed in warwickshire 's yellow limited - overs strip worcestershire verdict : it often confounds me how a team that looks so workmanlike on paper can keep appearing in division one ahead of more fancied sides , but coach steve rhodes gets them playing disciplined cricket , and daryl mitchell âs a terrific leader
key man : if the pitches are dry in the second half of the season , saeed ajmal could keep them up by himself
overseas : sachithra senanayake ( sl ) , saeed ajmal ( pak ) , colin munro ( nz , t20 ) pak spinner saeed ajmal could prove to be a big weapon during the 2015 county season yorkshire verdict : their biggest challenge in defending their title will be how to cope with losing so many players to england

overseas : tbc kent star sam billings in training with the england lions in cape town in january lancashire verdict : they had a massively disappointing 2014 , going straight back down after winning division two
but , along with surrey , they âll fancy their chances of promotion
