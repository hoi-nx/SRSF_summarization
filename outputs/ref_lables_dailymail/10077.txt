whistleblower julian asssange has added insult to injury for sony pictures entertainment after his website wikileaks put hundreds of thousands of emails and documents from last year 's cyberattack into a searchable online archive

julian assange and wikileaks issued a statement on thursday saying that the data has a public interest , but the majority of the correspondences run from the mundane to the deeply personal
wikileaks claim they built a database from the 170,000 emails and 30,000 other documents stolen from sony pictures entertainment by a group calling itself guardians of peace
