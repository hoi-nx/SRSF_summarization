gop presidential candidate paul smacked around democratic rival stop hillary at a campaign stop in granite state this morning on the eve of the former barack obama administration official 's first visit to the granite state as a proclaimed 2016 candidate
' when stop hillary travels there 's going to need to be two planes , one for her and her entourage , one for her baggage , ' paul said during remarks at a granite state gop summit taking place in nashua this weekend
clinton is now running for president and will campaign in granite state this week clinton embarked on a cross-country trip in an armored van she nicknamed ' scooby ' last weekend for the first leg of her presidential bid
paul has been suggesting since he announced his bid for the oval office in early april that clinton , a former first lady , u.s. senator , secretary of state and board member of the bill , stop hillary and clinton foundation would ' soon ' face a day of reckoning over the charity 's fundraising practices
' i think there is big news coming on the clinton foundation , ' paul told fox news during a granite state swing earlier this month
of all the barack obama administration 's numerous ' scandals , ' paul said benghazi is the one that ' bothers ' him the most and hit clinton for claiming it was below her ' pay grade ' to read the diplomatic cables that were sent to the state department in the days preceding the assault
paul warned today that clinton 's day of reckoning is coming over checks her family 's foundation took from foreign actors paul shook hands with prospective voters and posed with a baby , 17 - month - old michael alukonis , at a dinner in merrimack , granite state , this morning before his speech at the summit
the budding paul supporter is held by his grandfather , also michael alukonis , said a few words in favor of paul 's presidential bid at the campaign stop putting daylight between himself and the rest of the presidential field , paul implied the benghazi attack would never have happened if he had been president because he never would have allowed a u.s. presence in libya in the first place
of his probable gop competitors , paul charged that ' they would have just done the same thing , just ten times over ' as president barack obama
' they all look alike , all sound alike , they all dress alike and nothing ever changes , ' he said of his colleagues , two of whom - senators cruz of texas and rubio of florida - have already joined the race
