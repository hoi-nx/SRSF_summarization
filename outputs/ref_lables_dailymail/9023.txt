the uk 's top prosecutor today told critics deriding her decision not to prosecute lord janner over alleged child sex offences to challenge her in court
alison saunders , the dpp , said she was ' not afraid ' of a legal challenge because she is convinced the labour peer is not fit to plead because of his dementia
and in her first interview since she announced lord janner would not face trial she refused to quit because ' making the right decision is not a resigning issue '
fighting back : alison saunders , the director of public prosecutions , said she was ' not afraid ' of a legal challenge over her decision not to charge lord janner and said she would not quit victims and leading politicians have accused her of ' damaging public confidence ' in the justice system with her ruling â even though there was a enough evidence to go ahead with a prosecution
mrs alison saunders admitted herself that three investigations into claims made by 25 alleged victims over 25 years were botched - but decided it was now too late to charge him
' i 'm confident that if they want to do that my decision will stand up
i thought long and hard before making it and i 'm confident i got it right
sometimes that means it wo n't be popular but if i 'm fulfilling my duties as dpp that 's the right thing to do
' police began investigating lord janner , pictured , after allegations of historic child - sex abuse were made but now he is too ill to be put on trial last night it emerged mrs alison saunders overruled the advice of two of the country 's most senior barristers to allow lord janner to avoid a trial
but mrs alison saunders decided it was not in the public interest to put lord janner in the dock due to his alzheimer 's disease
the move puts his luxury apartment potentially out of reach of child abuse victims suing the labour peer for compensation
a week later , the cps announced lord janner would not be tried over child sex allegations because he was suffering so much from alzheimer 's that he could not even understand any charges against him , let alone answer them
he added that the matter should be brought before a court because mrs alison saunders and the cps had made ' heinous errors by failing to bring a prosecution earlier when there was evidence there to do so '
' lord carlile , a lib dem peer and legal expert , said although there was strong evidence lord janner had dementia , the decision not to proceed with legal action should be reconsidered
the group , led by labour 's simon danczuk , wrote to the times : ' as long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served , the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash
' a cps spokesman confirmed mrs laws advised mrs alison saunders to prosecute and that mrs montgomery was consulted on an ' ancillary matter '
