the research has been hailed a ' tour de force ' , raising hopes the body 's immune system could be trained to attack melanoma , pancreatic , breast and lung cancer
the team at stanford university believe the laboratory - engineered antibodies could eradicate not only primary tumours , but also distant metastases that have spread through the body
' you actually see tumour eradication
' a new study has suggested an antibody injection could ' wipe out cancer ' by rooting out and eradicating both primary tumours and distant metastases , where the cancer has spread to other parts of the body their findings have been hailed a ' tour de force ' , raising hopes the body 's immune system could be trained to attack melanoma , pancreatic , lung and breast cancer , pictured his team concluded their approach differed to other potential treatments that only apply to specific cancers , in that it could target a wide range of solid tumours
the process relies on the same mechanism as that which causes animals ' bodies to reject organ transplants , researchers said
in both cases , antibodies - molecules that detect foreign substances in the body - trigger the immune system
they bind themselves to proteins from the foreign tissue - in this case the tumour - and through the use of signalling cells , alert t - cells , that act like the immune 's system 's swat team
once primed to recognise the cancerous tissue , the t - cells would multiply and not only attack the tumour , but hunt down any metastatic cells travelling through the body
the team concluded their approach differed to other potential treatments that only apply to specific cancers , in that it could target a wide range of solid tumours , including melanoma , pictured dr carmi , the lead author , discovered both antibodies and the signalling , dendritic cells are both crucial for tumour elimination
by adding chemicals that encouraged the growth of the signalling , dendritic cells , to the antibodies , the researchers were able to eliminate six different types of cancer - two melanomas , lymphoma , breast , lung and pancreatic cancer
the process relies on the same mechanism as that which causes animals ' bodies to reject organ transplants , researchers said.in both cases , antibodies - molecules that detect foreign substances in the body ( computer generated image , pictured ) - trigger the immune system with the cells from the two mesothelioma cancer patients , the antibodies induced t - cell proliferation in vitro under the same experimental conditions
medical oncologist assistant professor holbrook kohrt at stanford university , who was not involved with the study , called the paper ' a nice tour de force ' and believes the novel therapeutic strategy could utilise the patient 's own immune system to defend against certain cancers
