ramsey , the only black manager in the premier league , is a classic example
ramsey is a fine coach who has been overlooked for countless jobs
ramsey ( right ) and kevin hitchcock watch qpr hammer west brom to keep their survival hopes alive ramsey takes nots during his side 's biggest win of the season which gave their survival chances a boost he took the qpr position after harry redknapp , a talented , experienced manager with a good track record of rescuing clubs in trouble , saw the writing on the wall and got out
ramsey was asked to board the sinking ship and , guess what , it has not been an easy job to refloat it
before the victory at west brom , qpr were sliding deeper into trouble and there were already those seeking to blame it on ramsey
the fact ramsey has been labouring to turn things around at qpr does not mean he is not a good manager
