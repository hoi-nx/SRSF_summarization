a fashion photographer suffering from cystic fibrosis is revolutionizing the way people look at the life - threatening disorder by snapping the portraits of 56 adult women living with the genetic disease to bring hope to children and teens diagnosed with the condition , which has no known cure
ian pettigrew , 46 , from ontario , canada , was working on his book of portraits , just breathe : adults with cf , when he realized that he had far more female subjects than male
