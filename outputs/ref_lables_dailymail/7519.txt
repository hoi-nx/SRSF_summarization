avalanches and death - defying runs were too tame for one daredevil who decided to take extreme skiing to a whole new level by hitting the slopes on an active volcano
oscar hã¼binette shredded through the snow on the tolbachik volcano on the kamchatka peninsula in russia while his friend fredrik schenholm photographed his exploits
the adventure photographer looked on in amazement as oscar flew down the icy slopes , while lava from the 12,000 foot tall volcano bubbled furiously behind him
' amazing photographs show oscar silhouetted in front of the still erupting tolbachik volcano on the kamchatka peninsula in russia ' seeing the contrast of the black and red lava to the white snow was like gold to my eyes , and to my camera
' fredrik schenholm said after lying dormant since 1976 the volcano suddenly erupted in november 2012
tolbachik is one of 160 volcanoes on the island , 29 of which are still active fredrik schenholm added : ' the volcano was very active until the summer of last year
he said : ' it was a bit unreal seeing oscar skiing near the lava
' so to finally get the view of oscar skiing in front of the eruption was a big deal for me - it really was beautiful
after lying dormant since 1976 the volcano suddenly erupted in november 2012 , spewing lava down the mountainside the air temperature surrounding the volcano was around -25c while the lava temperature would have been more than 1,000c ' the first thing i did when i got the shot was to scream to oscar ' we got it ! '
' fredrik schenholm said he was fully aware of the dangers of taking such dramatic shots , especially when lava was still flowing from the volcano
' seeing the contrast of the black and red lava to the white snow was like gold to my eyes , and to my camera , ' fredrik schenholm said he said : ' oscar was very brave for doing this - it goes without saying that being on active volcanoes is incredibly dangerous
