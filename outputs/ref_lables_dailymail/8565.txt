decided ? supreme court ginsburg has spoken - and acted - in a way which suggests her strong supporting for legalizing same sex marriage ginsburg has already made up her mind about gay marriage , a report has claimed , ahead of a landmark supreme court hearing which could legalize the practice nationwide
the famously liberal justice , who is 82 , will be part of a decision which begins hearing arguments tomorrow on whether states are allowed to ban same - sex unions and refuse to recognize those made in other states
the new report , yahoo! politics , cited interviews in which ginsburg has referred to the americans public becoming more accepting of gay rights in general - and has even officiated at same - sex ceremonies
' she will get the chance to make her views known in the upcoming case of hodges , for which arguments will be heard from tuesday and a decision is expected this summer
protests : pictured are gay rights protesters camped out in front of the supreme court this weekend
obergefell v. hodges will be heard from tomorrow votes : ginsburg is one of four liberal - voting supreme court justices , though anthony kennedy ( front row , second from right ) has often sided with them on gay rights issues
and if it determines that recognizing gay marriage is still up to individual states , the court could also decide that states are obliged to recognize gay marriage performed elsewhere in the americans after a 2012 ruling , the federal government is already required to recognize gay marriage in states where they are allowed
the liberal wing 's four justices are expected to vote in favor of gay marriage , and could be joined by the more conservative anthony kennedy , who has often sided with liberals on issues of personal freedom , which would provide the five votes necessary for a majority
he is taking on richard hodges , right , who leads ohio 's department of health couple : obergefell , left , married his husband arthur in maryland shortly before his death - but has not been allowed to name himself as arthur 's spouse on his death certificate both the national organization for marriage and the american family association , which oppose gay marriage , have demanded that ginsburg remove herself from the case because she officiated over the ceremony
however , according to legal scholars , neither has done anything wrong because the earlier court decision had already vindicated same - sex marriages in states which had legalized them
anthony kennedy is likely , the report said , to eventually write the supreme court decision in obergefell v. hodges , which would follow several other written opinions expanding gay rights .
