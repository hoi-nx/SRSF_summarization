anaesthetic gases used to send patients to sleep during surgery are accumulating in the earth 's atmosphere where they are contributing to climate change
scientists say they have detected the gases used in anaesthetic as far a field as antarctic and concentrations have been rising globally in the past decade
the gases - desflurane , isoflurane and sevoflurane - are potent greenhouse gases that have 2,500 times the impact on global warming compared to carbon dioxide
anaesthetic is used to send patients to sleep during surgery ( above ) but it may also be warming the planet atmospheric scientists who have been monitoring the gases say that while the concentrations in the atmosphere are low , they are having an increasing effect on the climate
dr martin vollmer , who led the study at the swiss federal laboratories for material science and technology in dubendorf , switzerland , said the anaesthetic gases were capable of storing far more energy from the sun than carbon dioxide
over the 900 years preceding the 20th century , 40 - year warming trends rarely showed an average rate much higher than 0.1 Â° c per decade , the study found
he said : ' on a kilogram - per - kilogram basis , it 's so much more poten ' modern halogenated inhalation anesthetics undergo little metabolisation during clinical application and evaporate almost completely to the atmosphere
by comparison , carbon dioxide gas currently makes up 400 parts per million in the atmosphere
however , one kilogram ( 2.2lbs ) of desflurane produces the same greenhouse effect as 2,500 kg ( 5,512lbs ) of carbon dioxide
the researchers estimate that anaesthetic gas emissions currently combine to produce the equivalent effect in the atmosphere of 3.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide
scientists say that hospitals should consider alternative anaesthetics when performing operations like above ' it generates eight percent of us greenhouse gases according to one study
' many anesthetists deliver sevoflurane or isoflurane in a two - three liters per minute flow but deliver desflurane in a lower flow - 0.5 to one liter per minute
