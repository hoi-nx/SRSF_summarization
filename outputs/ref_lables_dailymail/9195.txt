cnn 's dr gupta has abandoned his journalistic duties to scrub up and perform brain surgery on a teenager in an overstretched hospital in nepalese
the neurosurgeon , who is in kathmandu to cover the aftermath of saturday 's deadly earthquake , performed a craniotomy on the 15 - year - old girl , sandhya , after a wall of her family 's home fell on her as she collected water outside
sandhya , who lives in a more remote area of the country , only reached kathmandu 's bir hospital two days after the 7.8 - magnitude quake and by that point , blood had collected in the top of her brain , cnn reported
more than 6,000 people were injured ' i was asked to do this by the doctors there at the hospital , ' dr gupta said during a telephone interview with the network
after the surgery , an eight - year - old girl arrived at the hospital needing a similar operation
more than 4,300 people are believed to have been killed in the earthquake , but nepalese officials have speculated that as many as 10,000 could have died
