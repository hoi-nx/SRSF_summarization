more than 70 years ago these five men each played their own vital role in the normandy campaign that began with the d - day landings
two were just teenagers , another was a young sapper , one a rookie tank driver and the last was a veteran of jungle warfare
all ordinary young men doing their bit to help liberate france
until now their exploits have escaped the attention of historians , but yesterday these veterans of world war two stood proudly side by side after being awarded france âs highest decoration , the legion of honour
courageous veterans are given france 's highest honour for their vital role on d-day in a ceremony at yorkshire air museum , left to right : collinson , briscoe , wright , gill , denwood and catherine rush who was accepting the honour on behalf of her late husband rush conducting the ceremony at the yorkshire air museum at elvington , near york , the france ambassador sylvie bermann told the frail veterans : â i am here in recognition of your heroic accomplishments in the liberation of france and to honour your bravery and dedication
â aged between 90 and 99 , they are among the first of 2,800 living veterans who will receive the legion of honour in the months to come
the decision was announced by france president francois hollande following last summer âs 70th anniversary celebrations and the ambassador said : â france will keep its promise
â although the memories are now fading , this group of humble soldiers - along with the widow of a veteran who died recently - could nât hide their pride as they received what will probably be the last medal of their extraordinary lives
gill ( right ) , a veteran of the burmese campaign who landed on a beach in normandy , pictured during the liberation of france gerry briscoe was a butcher when he joined up at 18 , a year later he was putting his life on the line by storming a normandy beach
it was his first ever action and a terrifying experience for a hardened veteran let alone a youngster
a sapper with the royal engineers , he owes his life to a stroke of luck
â on d - day i should have been the last one in the boat to be the first one out because i was carrying a charge to blow up a pill box , â he recalled
â i miscounted so i finished up the first one in the boat and so the last one out
the lad that got out the boat first drowned straight away because the boat went over him
there for the grace of god , i was saved
battle was raging when mr briscoe reached shore and discovered the pill box had already been blown up by a shell , but there were chaotic scenes all around
â the germany were still firing at us and there were shells firing all over the place and the rockets from the big main ships were going over to the germany
â he said : â you are frightened to death really , i remember it well
â the teenager helped build a bridge in the days that followed and continued working on bridges and roads to help allied troops as they headed for germany
he was among the first troops into brussels and recalled the local citizens coming out with bowls of warm water , because the soldiers were covered in dirt , and meat sandwiches
after the war he returned to working as a butcher
he married wife jean , now 86 , and the couple had two children
