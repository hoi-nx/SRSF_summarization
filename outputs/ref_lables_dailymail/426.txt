a missouri mother believes her three - year - old daughter with special needs was discriminated against after finding out the child was forced to take off her thick glasses for a school portrait
lubiewski was born with hallerman-streiff , a rare genetic syndrome that resulted in congenital cataracts
when lubiewski received her daughter abby 's photographs , she immediately saw that her child 's smile was strained
' lubiewski said that when abby saw her school photo she asked , ' what happened to my glasses ? ' but the mother was even more concerned knowing that official school portraits are released to the public if a child goes missing
' when lubiewski found out other children at abby 's school were allowed to wear their glasses for the photographs , she felt her daughter had been discriminated against
abby was born with hallerman-streiff , a rare genetic syndrome that resulted in congenital cataracts
' her picture does n't look like her without glasses ' lubiewski contacted lifetouch school photography on facebook and told them ' how disrespectful ' the family thought it was for the company to treat abby ' differently than other children in the school '
' lubiewski said other photographers in the past have been able to work around the glare abby 's thick specs can sometimes cause for the camera
' abby will get another chance to have her school picture free of charge on monday after lifetouch school photography offered to re-take it
lifetouch school photography has apologized to the family and will re-take abby 's school picture for free
