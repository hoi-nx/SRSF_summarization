you wo nât find it written down anywhere in black and white yet it remains one of the unseen by - laws of the game : until such time as an almighty mess is sitting squarely on fifa âs front step , the governing body chooses to keep the door bolted firmly shut
celtic striker leigh griffiths has a goal - bound shot blocked by the outstretched arm of josh meekings such was the hullabaloo over the incident involving the portuguese star that fifa did , in fact , begrudgingly make some noises about trialling goal - line systems but it was no more than platitudes to appease the masses
despite initially shrugging off calls for the adoption of goal - line technology to be approved , fifa relented two years later with the system fully operational last year in brazil
the lesson for scottish football fans still bemused by events at hampden park on sunday when the officials failed to spot a potentially game - changing handball ? perhaps only when such an outrage occurs in the world cup in russia in three years â time will common sense prevail
for those who believe the sfa are intransigent to football embracing the kind of video technology that would have seen josh meekings red carded and celtic awarded a penalty in the scottish cup semi-final , here âs some news â¦ in february , the international football board â the sfa , fa , irish fa , welsh and fifa â gathered in belfast supposedly to discuss the possibility of approving trials
leigh griffiths heads the ball , which is deflected clearly off the hand of inverness ' josh meekings ( left ) on sunday â we ca nât live in the past , â he stated
â despite cases also being forwarded by the sfa and irish fa to at least take the matter further , fifa , aided by a sceptical welsh representative , simply kicked the matter into the long grass
â it âs a question of making the biggest decision ever in the way football is played , â said fifa âs secretary general jerome valcke by way of an explanation for its rejection afterwards
injustices like those that almost certainly cost celtic a place in the scottish cup final on sunday are hardly a rarity in the global game
celtic captain scott brown ( left ) has words with referee mclean during the scottish cup semi-final yet , until such time as one directly affects the outcome of a world cup match involving one of the game âs heavyweights , they seem set to remain an ugly , unsatisfying feature of the landscape
to the great embarrassment of michel platini , the stationing of additional officials behind both goals has proved to be an extraordinary waste of time
seemingly less reluctant to get involved than traditional linesman , â additional assistant referees â - to give them their sunday names - have seemed utterly superfluous since they were first trialled in the 2009 - 10 europa league
on sunday , muir , the official behind the goal , should have had a clear view of josh meekings â handball
it took the high - profile blunder that denied lampard in 2010 to shift fifa on goal - line tecnhology â i knew it was a penalty , â said celtic striker leigh griffiths
i asked the ref why he did nât give the penalty and he said the assistant behind the goal said it hit him ( josh meekings ) on the face
perhaps more than ever , the sfa now has good reason to press fifa to at least road - test video technology
no - one claims the system is perfect â decisions can often take longer to reach than they should - but few would dispute that it has nât enhanced the game because the right outcome is eventually arrived at
lampard 's disallowed goal forced fifa to rethink , and scottish fans must hope for a similar incident used only in first - class and international televised games , the tmo can only rule on exactly what the referee asks him
while the video review is normally conclusive , the snag â which is clearly a red flag for fifa â is the time delay
â it âs almost make it up as you go along , â leigh griffiths said
