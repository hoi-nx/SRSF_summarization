a dog who was living in a shelter for the past five years has finally gone home to a loving family in new york after his photo was shared on social media
chester , a 6 - year - old pit bull mix , had been housed at the nfawl on long island
the picture was shared more than 6,000 times and inquires about adopting chester poured in from all over the world
i posted the original photo on the nfawl 's facebook page and by later that day there were over 6000 shares , ' nfawl manager stroup said
' tugging at heartstrings : staring with his sad puppy dog eyes into the camera , chester sat with a paw draped over a sign which read : ' why does n't anybody want me ? saying goodbye : saturday morning , volunteers came to the shelter to say good - bye to chester , a longtime favorite among those who 'd come regularly to walk him and give him belly rubs and kisses within a couple of days of the posting , chester was adopted by a family with two sons from new york
' a woman named dor called me inquiring about him ; a friend of hers from michigan had shared chester 's picture on her page , ' ms stroup said
' dor and i talked about chester for a bit ; she wanted to talk it over with her family
yesterday morning , volunteers came to the shelter to say good - bye to chester
' we think he was waiting for us , ' mrs dor said part of the family : adi dor sets up a cage for chester to sleep in at his new home settling in : chester had found his perfect match in the dor family and was soon taken for a new life at their lake ronkonkoma home the dors arrived and chester seemed to like the family instantly , covering their faces with licks and kisses
ms stroup said it was all down to the power of facebook and the pleading message that hung around chester 's neck
