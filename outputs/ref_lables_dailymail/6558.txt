if virgil van dijk is absent from the shortlists for this season âs player of the year awards , celtic will surely fire off a stiff missive seeking clarification on the reasons

it could even happen at pittodrie on may 10 , where virgil van dijk scored the most significant of his impressive 10 - goal haul back in november
he was at it again last night , thrashing home his second 20 - yard free - kick in as many games
â virgil van dijk has shown that ability also last season with his free - kicks
â last sunday , van virgil van dijk âs early strike against inverness was overtaken by events
here , his thrashing effort past dundee keeper scott bain earned celtic the two - goal lead which ultimately repelled a late rally from the hosts
jim mcalister âs goal in the 87th minute was too little , too late

the loss of the advantage was self - inflicted , yet to howls of derision from the home support , murray pulled the play back for a celtic free - kick
armstrong thumped a long ball towards the back post , virgil van dijk headed it firmly across the area and mackay-steven gathered on the edge of the box , rasping the ball into the top corner
dundee âs sense of injustice was merely compounded by a penalty claim before half - time when denayer bumped into stewart
armstrong ( right ) is challenged and sent hurtling to the ground by dundee 's ferry at den 's park mackay-steven fires celtic into the lead with a cool finish following a snaking run through the dundee box against a parkhead side missing adam matthews and stefan johansen , the dark blues struggled to make inroads until the late mcalister strike
the disputed free - kick changed things
with the lead they had cherished , celtic seized the game by the scruff of the neck
there could be no real complaints over the free - kick which reaped their second in 63 minutes
like ryan esson for inverness , the dundee keeper had little or no chance of stopping the virgil van dijk free - kick which killed the game
late on , substitute luka tankulic miscued from close range after virgil van dijk made a hash of a downward defensive header , but mcalister finished in composed fashion with three minutes to play after paul mcginn âs progress down the right flank ended in a low cross
