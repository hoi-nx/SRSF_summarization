peter recently admitted to telling deila that it was a matter of getting over the â le guen hump â but celtic âs chief executive might well have cited a couple of names that had met their grim fates closer to home
one thing is for sure : deila did not need to be an ardent student of the history of scotland football to appreciate the gravitas of the situation he had become immersed in earlier this season
by late autumn , his side had twice exited europe while hamilton accies had left celtic park triumphant
a search party was hardly required to identify his doubters
celtic manager deila admitted that the first six months in charge were mentally tough publicly , deila plastered on the brave face and talked of looking behind the results for progress
privately , the misgivings about his long - term suitability for the post were beginning to gnaw at him
â we played dundee away ( 1 - 1 ) and we could nât play worse than we did , â deila recalled
â it was unbelievably bad
you know what the players want but you just have nât got the message across
â people are insecure and that âs a hard time for the coach and the players
â even for a manager who had been steeped in the nuances of scotland football , such a period would have been troubling enough
deila , a norwegian who had cut his teeth at tiny stromsgodset , began to look like a man caught in entirely the wrong movie
â one thing is the language , the culture is another and then you have to know new opponents , your own team , understand what celtic is all about and scotland football
â the norwegian was unsure whether he was cut out to be the boss of the bhoys upon his unveiling last summer , deila was asked if he felt ready to manage a club like celtic
i âd had a full season with my old club and five days later i was ready for celtic
it âs so important to understand if you go back to the big managers they had before , neil ( lennon ) and ( gordon ) strachan and martin ( oâneill ) , they also struggled in the beginning
collectively , they acted as deila âs support network
â i had unbelievably good back up from peter , john collins , john kennedy and stevie woods as well , â deila explained
but results have picked up and they lead the premiership ( kris commons pictured scoring at st mirren ) â i âm a very open person , i say it as it is and i do that with them as well
a blip against st johnstone aside , celtic have been imperious since the turn of the year â now i feel more comfortable with the vocabulary , i feel i can express myself better
but i âm looking forward to speaking like every scot ! â ahead of wednesday 's game with partick thistle , deila , his players and the supporters are very much now on the same page
a blip against st johnstone aside , celtic have been imperious since the turn of the year
from privately wondering if he âd bitten off more than he could chew by coming to celtic , deila is now ravenous for more success
â i want to win more trophies
