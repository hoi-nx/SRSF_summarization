a sales manager who claimed he was left too disabled to work after a ' minor ' road accident ten years ago has been accused of attempting a Â£ 600,000 fraud - after being pictured out in a coffee shop with his celebrity friend clifford
the married engineer suffered whiplash , which developed into chronic pain syndrome and a resulting deep depression , which together have ended his working life , his lawyers claim

morgan claims that a car accident in 2005 has left him in too much pain to leave his home regularly william featherby qc , for direct line group , said mr morgan had been put under surveillance and shown to be far from the disabled wreck he claims to be
he could be seen out walking , joking with a builder , striking up conversation with a stranger , crouching to fix the light on his car and as part of a gathering of friends â including disgraced pr guru clifford â in a coffee shop
' mr morgan is pictured outside central london county court where the fraud case hearing continues questioned on the difference in his demeanour on the day in the coffee shop and in court , mr morgan said one had been a ' good ' day and the other ' bad '
' his barrister simon browne qc said the surveillance footage shown in court actually backed mr morgan 's case
' it reinforces mr morgan 's post-accident limitations , as his daily life has been reduced to a 1,350 foot radius around his home , ' he said
' the footage proves that he no longer participates in the maintenance and diy activities that were once such a large part of his life
the accident , and its after - effects , put an end to all that , mr browne told the judge
he said direct line group accepted the accident was genuine and that mr morgan initially required attention for his injuries
mr morgan strongly refutes direct line group 's accusations
