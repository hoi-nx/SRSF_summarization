it is easy to be envious of celebrities who upload luxurious photos on instagram from their private planes or vip lounges
but a life spent criss - crossing the globe is n't always as exciting and glamorous as we may think
proving that stars are n't immune to the everyday problems the average traveller faces , professional golfer russell henley received a lot of sympathy when united - the official carrier of the pga - apparently ' lost ' his clubs
he is not the only one to have had a less - than - ideal experience , with kim , rooney and maisie williams joining the ranks of irritated travellers
pro-golfer russell henley flew to georgia last sunday - sadly his golf clubs did not russell henley tweeted his frustration to united , who misplaced his golf clubs when he was en route to the master 's tournament this week russell henley starring in the master 's golf tournament in georgia this week is one of the highlights of a pro-golfer 's professional years
but , ever the professional , the sportsman did n't have a meltdown on twitter , he simply used his social media site to point out that he had a ' tourney ' to play in this week
naomi campbell at the airport from a flight from london
the model flew into a rage when her suitcases were not loaded onto her plane and demanded the captain find them and personally show them to her naomi campbell the jetsetting model is infamous for her temper and it seems she was not impressed when informed she was among passengers whose bags had failed to be loaded on a ba flight from london to los angeles in april 2008
the captain made the decision to personally speak to her to apologise for the error , but the model flew into a rage at the mishap , which happened shortly after the disastrous opening of ba 's terminal 5 at heathrow airport - when problems with baggage systems meant many passengers were forced to fly without their luggage
uxbridge magistrates ' court heard how the model shouted at the captain saying : ' i ca n't believe you have lost my f * * * * * * bag
the star was fined Â£ 2,300 , ordered to pay Â£ 200 in compensation to the police officers she attacked , Â£ 150 to the ba captain and complete 200 hours of community service
as she was under the age of 18 , the actress and business class traveller was forced to spend her time at the airport away from the comforts of the lounge , which includes meals , drinks and even exclusive spa treatments
although she was adamant she did not want special treatment and it was more the principle that she was old enough to travel , but not old enough to sit in the lounge , the airline did not budge on the rules
. @ british_airways fully understand that , my question is why ? why can we travel alone but not use the lounge ? it makes no sense
pro-golfer mcilroy also had his clubs lost by united when he flew into the dublin ahead of the irish open a similar twitter complaint query from the golfer saw his clubs swiftly returned to him for the competition mcilroy russell henley was not the only golfer to have lost his prized possession
mcilroy , who won both the pga and the open championships last year , similarly had his golf clubs lost by united as he flew into dublin ahead of the irish open last year
once again , the sporting world proved just how polite its stars could be
no special treatment for the rooneys : last year coleen rooney and her family received their bags two days late , with items missing , after their flight to las vegas from heathrow airport coleen rooney expressed her horror over twitter that many items were missing from her cases coleen rooney coleen rooney accused ba staff of ' ransacking ' her designer luggage as she flew with the airline to sin city in june last year for a family holiday
she tweeted : ' bags , shoes , bikinis , clothes , toiletries , underwear , pj 's , make up , toiletries taken
heathrow airport declined to comment on mrs rooney 's situation but ba said they had contacted mrs rooney to begin an investigation into the incident
mrs rooney faced a string of sarcastic comments from some of her followers who commented that she could probably afford to replace the items
it 's not all about money it 's about people going through my personal stuff and taking stuff that i need for my holiday '
she later tweeted : ' thank you so much delta 4 this wonderful black eye fix your f * * * * * * seats getting smashed in the face w / a tv is so fun ' ' regardless to how s * * * @ delta is the stewardess really looked after me ! she was amazing ! ' kim had her luggage opened and items taken on her flight to cannes with ba the star , who now has 30 million followers on twitter said some of the missing items were irreplaceable kim it seems even the kardashians suffer from airport woes as they jet - set around the world
' very disappointed in ba for opening my luggage & taking some special items of mine ! some things are sentimental &not replaceable
