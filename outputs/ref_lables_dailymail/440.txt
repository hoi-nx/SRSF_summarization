under pressure : tony cocker , the chief executive of e.on , which has been forced to pay Â£ 7.75million to citizens advice after the regulator found the energy giant had overcharged customers after price rises power giant e.on has been ordered to pay a Â£ 7.75million penalty after it ripped off customers who were switching to rivals
e.on effectively overcharged thousands who decided to move to other suppliers after it announced price rises in january 2013 and again in early 2014
however , industry regulator ofgem found that e.on broke the rules by hitting tens of thousands of departing customers with a higher tariff in the days before their account was switched
however , it failed to notify ofgem that it also affected people with meters until late in the investigation
it has refunded Â£ 8 to Â£ 12 to 40,000 customers who paid by cash or cheque and is now trying to find another 7,000 meter customers to pay them an average of Â£ 3.42
while the sums involved are relatively low , ofgem imposed a high penalty because e.on did the same thing in january 2012
' absolutely unacceptable ' : ofgem said the penalty reflected e.on 's ' repeated failings ' on billing rules after the company incorrectly imposed exit fees and overcharged customers ofgem âs enforcement chief , sarah harrison , said : â our rules give customers a chance to avoid exit fees and higher costs when suppliers put up prices
the payments are as follows : november 2012 : e.on agrees to pay out Â£ 1.7million to customers and charities after customers were incorrectly charged exit fees or overcharged following price rises
may 2014 : e.on agrees to pay Â£ 12million to vulnerable customers for mis - selling
april 2015 : the company agrees to pay Â£ 7.75million to citizens advice to help vulnerable customers in addition to Â£ 400,000 already paid to those affected , after it was found to have overcharged in the wake of price rises
â it is important that e.on has repaid potentially affected customers and co-operated with the investigation
however it âs absolutely unacceptable that it failed to provide these vital customer protections yet again and this persistent failure is the reason for the high penalty
