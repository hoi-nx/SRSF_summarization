a florida postal carrier steered his small gyrocopter through protected washington airspace for 30 miles to the capitol , tracked by the nation 's top security agencies , which feared harming tourists on the national mall if they tried to shoot him down , senior lawmakers said wednesday
hughes , 61 , is ' lucky to be alive ' and ' should have been blown out of the air , ' rep. chaffetz , r-utah , chairman of the committee on oversight and government reform , told reporters just days after the incident that exposed a gap in the government 's efforts to ensure the security of the white house , capitol and other critical buildings in washington
a ' judgment call ' was made not to shoot hughes down , chaffetz said
rep. elijah cummings , d-md. , said officials were concerned about injuring people on the ground if an attempt was made to shoot down hughes
chaffetz said a combination of ' lack of communication and some human error ' by capitol police and other officials allowed hughes to steer his tiny aircraft within a few hundred feet of the capitol before landing on the west lawn
chaffetz said he was deeply concerned at ' a lack of coordination and communication ' among law enforcement agencies charged with what he called ' a no - fail mission ' to protect the capitol and other important sites in washington , including the white house
elijah cummings and chaffetz said they were outraged that members of congress were not alerted to the potential security threat even as parts of the capitol complex were placed under lockdown
rep. elijah cummings , d-md. , said officials were concerned about injuring people on the ground if an attempt was made to shoot down hughes security : homeland security secretary johnson said last week that hughes ' literally flew under the radar ' to the capitol lawn , but added that it 's too soon to say whether security changes are needed issues : hughes was charged with two federal crimes , violating restricted airspace and operating an unregistered aircraft
lawmakers were told during the briefing that ' incursions ' into the restricted air space around washington occur nearly every day and are usually ' dealt with in a smooth and professional manner , ' chaffetz said , in stark contrast to the gyrocopter incident
