the importance of saturday 's match against arsenal for liverpool âs champion âs league ambitions can not be overstated
juan mata 's acrobatic volley two weeks ago left liverpool five points adrift of manchester united in fourth brendan rodgers ' side need to beat arsenal on saturday to keep up their chances of a top - four finish liverpool have been in good form since they last played arsenal , but are not in the champions league spots a defeat could leave liverpool eight points adrift of the top four with just seven games to play , a massive mountain to climb
in six games against the premier league âs other top - five sides , liverpool have won just one and picked up four points compared with manchester united who have won three of five games against their toughest competition
in arsenal they face a side who have cemented their champions league spot with four top - flight wins in as many games in march
with more money on offer than ever before , liverpool know they need to be at europe 's top table raheem sterling and phlippe coutinho train ahead of the vital trip to arsenal on saturday it is not just the pride of fans at stake in this game but also the financial security of the club
for a team like liverpool , who enjoy a big worldwide profile , particularly in asia , money like that could solidify their position among the european elite for the next decade
securing european football will also be vital to ensure they attract world - class players and keep the ones they already have at the club
even with champions league qualification liverpool were unable to hold on to luis suarez last summer raheem sterling 's contract situation demonstrates how important it is for brendan rodgers ' side to qualify the contract wrangling with raheem sterling in recent weeks will undoubtedly have been a distraction to the player himself and the focus of manager brendan rodgers but they will have to put that to one side if they are to overcome arsenal
on the sterling subject , it would be much easier to resolve his future and persuade him to remain in merseyside come the end of the season if liverpool have the certainty of champions league football to offer as an enticement
