professor sykes of the university of oxford claims a towering woman named zana who lived in 19th century russia - and appeared to be ' half human , half ape ' - could have been the fabled yeti
witnesses described the six - foot , six - inches tall woman discovered in the caucasus mountains between georgia and russia as having ' all the characteristics of a wild animal ' - and covered in thick auburn hair
professor sykes claims zana was kept in a ' ditch surrounded by sharpened spikes ' and sold from owner to owner until she came to serve nobleman edgi genaba as a servant
famously known as the ape woman , zana had at least four children by local men and some of her descendants still live in the region , the times reported
sykes made an astonishing discovery when he carried out saliva tests on six of her living relatives and the tooth of her deceased son khwit
the dna analysis revealed that they all contained the right amount of africa dna for zana the ape woman to be ' 100 per cent africa ' but remarkably she did not resemble any known group
discovery : professor sykes of the university of oxford analysed the dna of her living relatives in the caucuses region and found west - africa genes myth ? the first accounts of the yeti emerged before the 19th century from buddhists who believed that the creature inhabited the himalayas her resemblance was that of a wild beast - ' the most frightening feature of which was her expression which was pure animal , ' one russia zoologist wrote in 1996
the man who organised various eyewitness accounts of zana wrote : ' her athletic power was enormous
evidence : in his book ' nature of the best ' , sykes argues that zana could be the yeti she would outrun a horse and swim across the moskva river even when it rose in violent high tide
' some have argued that she was a runaway ottoman slave but professor sykes says her ' unparalleled dna ' refutes that theory
zana was eventually ' tamed ' by the nobleman who bought her as a servant and kept her on his estate in tkhina in the republic of abkhazia
despite the lack of hard proof from the analysis of the alleged ' yeti hairs ' , he says he has developed a strong sense that ' something is out there ' after speaking to dozens of witnesses
in 1832 , an explorer who had his account of trekking in nepal published in the journal of the asiatic society of bengal spoke of seeing tall , bipedal creature covered with long dark hair , which seemed to flee in fear
but researchers have shown that the two hair samples analysed actually originated from a modern polar bear , and a type of rare bear native to the high mountain ranges .
