but ukip has insisted st george would have been welcomed to britain because of his skills as a dragon slayer
but at the policy launch , economic spokesman patrick o'flynn faced questions on whether st george would have been welcomed by a 3rd - century ukip
in its election manifesto the party has said it would have a five year moratorium on unskilled migrants moving to the country
mr patrick o'flynn said : ' well , i guess dragon - slaying is a skill but whether it is one that 's in short supply for the needs of the britain economy , we will leave to our migration commission
' whenever the issue of st george 's day comes up - and i can predict this on twitter today - there will be many left - centre people who will tweet the fact that st george was from what 's today known as turkey as if that is the start , finish of conversation and that makes st george 's day irrelevant or illegitimate or ridiculous
' the party said it wanted to encourage more people to fly the st george 's flag and end a ' cultural self - loathing ' about being proud to be england
peter whittle , the party 's culture and communities spokesman said : ' for too long we have lived with a political and cultural establishment which has shown a sort of disdain for england which has doubted britain has a whole and has discouraged pride in it
