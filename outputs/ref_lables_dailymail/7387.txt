travel to the tropics today and you âll experience balmy annual mean temperatures of 30 Â° c ( 85 â° f )
but travel there 2.4 billion years ago , and it âs likely you would have been subjected to arctic - like temperatures of -40 Â° c ( -40 â° f )
this so - called â snowball earth â theory suggests that our planet was once entirely frozen over - and it could have implications for finding life on other frozen worlds like europa and enceladus
a university of cologne scientist led research proposing a new theory
it suggests temperatures at snowball earth 's equator were -40 Â° c ( -40 â° f ) 2.4 billion years ago ( artist 's illustration shown )
the reasons why the whole planet was frozen are not understood
but it could have implications for finding life on frozen moons like europa the research , led by dr daniel herwartz from the university of cologne , was published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences
a frozen world , similar to snowball earth , that is circling just one of a pair of stars could improve the chances of finding alien life
the planet , located 3,000 light years away , is twice as massive as snowball earth and almost exactly the same distance from its parent star as the snowball earth is from the sun. named ogle-2013-blg-0341lbb , the planet âs host star shines 400 times less brightly than the sun. it has been described as the real - life version of ice planet hoth featured in star wars sequel the empire strikes back
and based on this latest ' snowball earth ' , it could suggest there are many more planets that resemble ours 2.4 billion years ago
â this theory can also help explain a period in snowball earth âs history known as the great oxygen transition , 2.2 billion years ago
speaking to mailonline , dr herwatz said before 2.4 billion years ago , the climate of our snowball earth was â normal â - similar to the climate we have today
â the research , led by dr daniel herwartz from the university of cologne , was published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences
in snowball earth 's past the continents were much closer together , and by 1.1 billion years ago they had formed a supercontinent known as rodinia ( left )
dr herwatz noted that 2.4 million years ago , the sun was not as strong as it is today , allowing the process to take place
but a second snowball - like even 600 to 700 million years ago , which was nât quite as severe , occurred when the sun was almost as strong as it is today
