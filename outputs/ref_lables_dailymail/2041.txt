audi has created a so - called ' green ' diesel fuel made using a combination of water and carbon dioxide
the car manufacturer described its breakthrough as the ' fuel of the future ' and claims it could provide a carbon neutral way of powering vehicles
experts used renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as ' blue crude ' , which was then refined into diesel
experts used renewable energy to convert the carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as ' blue crude ' , which was then refined into diesel tests have shown it can be mixed with diesel from fossil fuels , or used as a fuel in its own right
audi has already begun using the new e-diesel to power the official car of german minister of education and research dr wanka
reiner mangold , head of sustainable product development at audi , said : ' in developing audi e-diesel we are promoting another fuel based on carbon dioxide that will allow long â distance mobility with virtually no impact on the climate
audi claims the whole process can be powered using renewable energy and can be achieved with an efficiency of around 70 %
the blue crude can then be refined in a similar way to standard crude oil to produce e-diesel
' using carbon dioxide as a raw material represents an opportunity not just for the automotive industry in german , but also to transfer the principle to other sectors and countries
audi claims the whole process can be powered using renewable energy and can be achieved with an efficiency of around 70 per cent
the blue crude can then be refined in a similar way to standard crude oil to produce e-diesel
hydrogen is pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures and causes them to react to produce liquid hydrocarbons , known as ' blue crude '
hydrocarbons form the base of fossil fuels audi added that the synthetic fuel does not contain sulphur or hydrocarbon rings â known as aromatic hydrocarbons â which are found in crude oil and can create additional pollution
he said : ' the engine runs quieter and fewer pollutants are being created
audi said it also extracts carbon dioxide from the ambient air using ' direct air capturing '
by capturing emissions from power plants and removing it from the air , audi says its new fuel can be used without adding to the burden of gas in the atmosphere
