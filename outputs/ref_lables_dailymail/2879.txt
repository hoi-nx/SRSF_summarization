the february afternoon we arrived in adelaide , the mercury was whizzing up to a sizzling 46c and the south australia city was the hottest place on the planet
but adelaide that week was also hot for other reasons

a trip here is enough to convince anyone that adelaide is the true food capital of south australia
adelaide is a much softer city than sydney
a wisteria arch in the adelaide botanic gardens , south australia , one of the city 's beautiful gardens a trip to adelaide 's central market is enough to convince us that adelaide is the true food capital of south australia adelaide is a softer city than sydney
it has charm , colonial history , sophistication and space to breathe most beaches are half an hour away , but being creatures of habit , we always head for the hills and the foodie haven of hahndorf
i 've had a thing about cycling the clare valley riesling trail for some time
indeed , part of the reason for coming to sunny south australia was to tick it off my bucket list
so early one morning we drove 90 minutes north of adelaide , picked up our bikes from riesling trail bike hire and cycled along a 15 - mile - long disused railway , snaking past vineyards and cellar doors
the historic town of hahndorf , settled by germans near adelaide , is a true blue foodie haven the bright green of the vineyards of mclaren vale , a popular wine regions close to adelaide north of clare is where the outback truly begins
it took three hours to drive to the majestic range , the largest in south australia
a view across arkaba station to wilpena pound in the flinders ranges , where the outback truly starts luxury accommodation at arkaba station , a 60,000 - acre sheep ranch and the perfect base to go exploring sian lloyd found the scale of the machinery mind - blowing in kalgoorlie 's gold mine ' super pit ' and so to my husband 's bucket list
having travelled on the glorious ghan from darwin to adelaide last year , and enjoyed every magical minute , he was determined to travel on its sister train , the indian pacific , from adelaide to perth
frankly , i ca n't think of any better way of seeing south australia
two nights of cruising overland in air - conditioned splendour - it worked for me ! as did the stop - offs , first at the outback ghost town of cook and finally at floodlit kalgoorlie , the biggest open - cast gold mine in the country
we arrived at the indian pacific terminal in perth as fresh as daisies , and drove the three hours to margaret river without stopping
the unique mining town of kalgoorlie is home to south australia 's biggest over-cast gold mine sister train of the north to south ghan , the indian pacific takes passengers from adelaide to perth from the first step we took on the cape to cape explorer walk with our guide we knew we 'd found exactly what we wanted
behind the beautiful margaret river coastline , there are mysterious forests and caves
and then there are vineyards ... in less than 50 years , margaret river has become one of the world 's greatest wine regions , gaining accolades galore for its cabernet sauvignons and chardonnays
the stunning coastline of the margaret river , which is also one of the world 's great wine regions a special lunch was enjoyed with the owners of leeuwin estate in the revered margaret river region and how about sipping world famous cullen red wine at the cellar door in the evening sunshine ? this is the stuff memories are made of
we fell in love with margaret river
