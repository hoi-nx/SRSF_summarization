a family doctor cut a hole in a lynx shampoo bottle so he could film men using the showers in the gym
dr al-atraqchi , 42 , faces being struck off the medical register making him unable to continue working at the custom house in newham , east london as well as other surgeries in london after he was found with the footage
the urology specialist cut peepholes in lynx bottles and emptied and dried them so he could hide his iphone inside to film through the hole
he then slid the device under the partition of shower cubicles so he could secretly film men next door to him
dr al-atraqchi could be struck off after he admitted secretly filming men in the gym showers by cutting a hole in lynx shampoo bottles and concealing his iphone inside before he put bottles into cubicles but al-atraqchi was caught out twice - once when a man noticed a glint of a camera through a bottle , and again when a fitness instructor became suspicious when he heard plastic being rustled and saw a lynx bottle appear in his shower cubicle
the doctor said he had set up the intricate device to ' let off steam ' because of the pressure at work , and claimed he also felt isolated and confused about his sexuality
al-atraqchi pleaded guilty to four counts of voyeurism and was fined Â£ 500 , and ordered to pay costs of Â£ 85 and a victim surcharge of Â£ 25 when he appeared at highbury corner magistrates ' court
he now faces a hearing to determine whether he will be struck off the medical register after a medical practitioners tribunal service hearing in manchester found him guilty of misconduct and told his ability to practise medicine had been impaired
al-atraqchi cut a peep hole in lynx bottles ( left ) and dried them out to hide an iphone inside the bottle the urology specialist worked at custom house surgery in north london , as well as other local practices on the second occasion a member of gym staff was showering when he noticed ' odd sounds ' coming from an adjacent cubicle
the staff member then wrenched opened al-atraqchi 's cubicle as the doctor was standing , naked and clutching various shower gel bottles
describing the first time he was unmasked at the gym dr al-atraqchi told the hearing : ' it was there but i do n't recall any recording
al-atraqchi said he secretly filmed the men to ' let off steam ' because his job was very stressful ' i wish i could apologise
' he said : ' you had a shampoo bottle and the fact there were two shampoo bottles found in your possession in march 2014 by the assistant manager means you must have used the shampoo or otherwise got rid of it out of the bottle , emptied it , and dried it out
would it be reasonable to assume there has been some planning and preparation in the construction of this albeit rudimentary apparatus ? ' al-atraqchi 's lawyer claimed the doctor had suffered ' shame and humiliation ' as a result of being caught and he posed a low risk to patient safety
