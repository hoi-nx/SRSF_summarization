known locally as millionaires â row , the western esplanade cul - de - sac of 11 white art deco houses with private beaches at the end of hove promenade is a real - life version of the tv comedy stella street
the sitcom featured impressionists playing celebrities such as michael caine and keith richards living as neighbours
but put the rubbish out here in hove and you could be saying good morning to oscar and grammy award - winning singer singer adele , little britain comedian and novelist walliams , dj norman cook and his strictly come dancing wife zoe ball , and former eastenders and heartbeat star nick berry
the homes were built between 1909 and 1910 by developer michael paget baxter when overcrowding on british beaches in their heyday meant that a home with a private beach was the last word in luxury
with celebrities occupying six of the properties â norman cook and his wife have three , two for them and one for relatives â that leaves just five other houses
and in a rare event , one of those has just come on the market , for a guide price of Â£ 4 million
decking stretches on to the beach , and there is a hot tub
the whole of the back of the house is glass on the ground and first floors meet the locals : singer adele has a house in the exclusive cul - de - sac alongside comedian walliams â bringing the sea into the house was the aim , â says malcolm , a retired harley street doctor
â malcolm , in his 60s and the father of four grown - up children , bought the four - bedroom house in 2010 after moving from london , where he had seen singer adele perform at the roundhouse in what he describes as his favourite gig of all time
â she has this lovely little dog and , in the summer , when all the doors are open , the dog wanders into my house and singer adele comes round to find it
price Â£ 4 million hove , east sussex bedrooms 4 unique features beach for a back garden ; cinema room ; huge dressing room ; high - tech controls for hi - fi , curtains , lighting ; celebrities on every side he also welcomed walliams and his wife , model lara stone , by taking round a bunch of flowers
norman cook popped round one day when he heard that malcolm was selling his vinyl record collection
so who does he think will buy the house ? has norman cook already been round with an offer to add to his portfolio ? â no he has nât , â says malcolm
â selling agent jason brand says : â this is the best beach residence to come on the market for years and one of the very few homes in brighton , indeed the british , to have direct private beach access
