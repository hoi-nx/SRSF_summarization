the barnet manager talks about how important it is for the troops to follow order during this crucial stage of the season
after training , to help me get rid of them , i decided to give some out to our players
i kept repeating it , each time : take one and pass it on , take one and pass it on
martin allen believes it is important for troops to follow order during this crucial stage of the season
this was an opportunity to point out how important it is to follow the coach âs direction
when it comes to this crucial stage in the season , you need all your troops ready to follow orders
it âs a zayn if they âre not pulling in one direction at whatever level it âs always important to have all your players going in one direction
people like john terry , who not only does his job but also makes sure each and every person in that chelsea squad follows mourinho âs guidance out on the pitch
it is one direction , or no direction
captain john terry works hard to ensure everybody at chelsea is heading in the same direction on the periphery having good players in your first team is obviously vitally important
but the players out of the team , on the periphery , can lose you matches
negative body language , people unable to cope with not playing , disruptive comments , and a dismissive look about everything you say and do can infect the whole squad
the man - management of these players on the edge of the first team is crucial and the skills needed they do not teach you on the uefa pro licence or courses put on by the fa
i âve spent the last three - and - a - half years working with a guy called rob northfield , who runs inspire based up in harrogate , on man - management skills for my players , my staff and of course myself
mourinho is a coach who is so good at dealing with players who are on the bench and not always in the side
players on the periphery can make the difference between winning and losing
allen âs analysis â¦ one person i keep hearing about â¦ gary rowett gary rowett is winning so many games and doing so well at birmingham
he has steered them in the right direction after their poor start to the season in the championship
for me , he âs heading for the top
allen believes birmingham manager gary rowett is going to go all the way to the top one thing i âd change about â¦ perceptions in football at barnet last summer , i found myself with no staff and a need to recruit new people
on top of that he got a degree in computer networking and played more than 300 league games , winning a promotion , the fa trophy and been in numerous playoff finals
we have a 23 - year - old female physiotherapist , jade cook , who had only worked with our youth team before but she has stepped up to work with the first team for the first time
she is calm , quiet , well - organised , disciplined , structured and i am very happy all the players are being so well looked after
i âm very proud of all of them in their first year working for me and no doubt all four will go on to work at the top level in the premier league
without them we would not have been top of the conference for so long
the panel of pundits , all those years ago , said we âve got to change
we âre not playing the type of football other countries play ; our children do nât get coached to be good technical players like other nations
