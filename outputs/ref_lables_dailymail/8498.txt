voters are still ' in the dark ' about the scale and depth of spending cuts being planned by all the main parties with just two weeks until polling day , economic experts warned today
the tories were accused of giving ' no detail ' about their deficit reduction plan , which relies on Â£ 30billion of cuts , while labour has left the door open to borrowing an extra Â£ 26billion - a - year
it accused conservatives chancellor osborne and his labour opponent ed balls of failing to spell out exactly where the axe will fall
' but they are predicated on substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases
' while labour has been considerably less clear about its overall fiscal ambition , its stated position appears to be consistent with little in the way of further spending cuts after this year
' chancellor osborne and his labour opponent ed balls are accused of not spelling out how they will tackle the deficit osborne received a pre-election boost today as official figures showed he beat his target for reducing annual public sector borrowing for the latest financial year by nearly Â£ 3 billion
borrowing - excluding the effect of bank bailouts - was Â£ 87.3 billion for the year to the end of march , down from Â£ 98.5 billion in 2013/14 , according to the ons ( ons )
it said the party would require large spending cuts or tax increases to achieve this
' turning to labour , the institute for fiscal studies said the opposition had been ' considerably more vague ' about how much it wants to borrow
senior research economist rowena crawford said : ' labour 's proposed measures might be broadly enough to meet their target for only borrowing to invest
' but this would leave borrowing at Â£ 26billion a year in today 's terms
' if labour wanted to reduce borrowing to a lower level than this they would have to spell out more detail of how they would get there
' the institute for fiscal studies said the lib dems had been more transparent about overall fiscal plans to 2017 - 18 , revealing that they are aiming for a tightening more than labour but less than the conservatives
the snp 's figures imply the same reduction in borrowing as labour , the institute for fiscal studies said , although the reduction would be slower
the independent analysis came as the main parties clashed over the economy , with labour accusing the tories of planning the biggest spending cuts in any of the world 's advanced economies and the conservatives renewing warnings that britain 's economy would suffer from an ' snp / miliband nightmare '
labour 's shadow chancellor ed balls said : ' the institute for fiscal studies has confirmed that the tories are committed to the most extreme spending plans of any political party , with bigger cuts than any other advanced economy in the next three years
' but mr osborne today warned that every family in the country will be left Â£ 350 worse off if the snp is left calling the shots in a labour government
mr osborne seized on the demand for more spending and more borrowing and warned that treasury analysis suggests it would add Â£ 6billion to britain 's interest bill , worth Â£ 350 per family
