together they wrote a string of chart - topping hits for some of the world 's biggest stars and created the memorable theme tune of australia television soap neighbours
hatch and trent , who were married for more than three decades , were dubbed ' mr and mrs music ' after composing for artists including frank sinatra , dean martin , scott walker , shirley bassey and petula clark
so when trent died last month aged 74 after a long battle with cancer , hatch was expected to be at her funeral to say a final goodbye
but the mail on sunday can reveal that hatch was banned from the funeral by trent 's second husband , gregory , who today accuses the composer of breaking his wife 's heart
after years of pressure , says gregory , hatch agreed to acknowledge trent 's part and her name now appears against some of the songs on the hatch website
gregory told the mail on sunday : ' yes , i banned hatch from attending trent 's cremation
' the 71 - year - old former policeman , who married trent in 2005 , said : ' it might seem petty and churlish of me because , whatever anybody says , hatch and trent are welded at the hip for all the wonderful work they did together
' instead , he passed the message to trent 's son from her first marriage , darren , who hatch had adopted when they married
" ' suffice it to say that trent would not want hatch anywhere near her final moments on this earth
hatch , 75 , clearly got the message , writing on his facebook page on the day of the funeral : ' today was final departure day for her soul but i was banned by her husband gregory from attending the crematorium
it 's a far cry from 1965 when hatch and trent met and fell in love
but if hatch , the son of a pianist , who grew up in pinner , north west london , and trent , the daughter of a miner from newcastle - under - lyme , made a fortune , they seemed to have trouble holding on to it
their marriage ended abruptly and abrasively back in britain at trent 's 55th birthday party in 1995 , when hatch confessed that for years he had been in love with one of his wife 's friends
