the tsa will ' enhance ' officer training for hair pat - downs after complaints that american - american women were being racially targeted for unnecessary screenings ( file photo ) according to an aclu statement , tsa agents grabbed singleton 's hair , which was styled in tightly - wound ' sisterlocks , ' and proceeded to ' squeeze it from top to bottom ' at los angeles international airport
new training will commence at los angeles international airport , one of the airports named in the complaint filed by the aclu ' the humiliating experience on countless black women who are routinely targeted for hair pat - downs because their hair is " different " is not only wrong , but also a great misuse of tsa agents ' time and resources , ' novella coleman , singleton 's aclu attorney , said in a statement
in a letter sent to coleman , the tsa said the re-training will stress ' race neutrality ' , and that a special emphasis will be placed on the ' hair patdowns of american female travelers '
tsa said the administration will also track of pat - down complaints filed by american - american women throughout the country to ' assess whether a discriminatory impact may be occurring at a specific ' airport , according to the letter posted by buzzfeed
solange knowles claimed in 2012 she was racially profiled while going through security at miami airport , dubbing it ' discrim-fro - nation ' because she wears her hair in the afro style but aclu said it was these kinds of ' subjective rules ' that made the agency more susceptible to ' unconsciously interpret the circumstances in a way that is consistent with racial stereotypes '
