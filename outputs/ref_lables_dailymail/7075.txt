belly flop to belly up ? it âs fair to say bruce has had better weeks than this one , which featured the publication of some poolside diving snaps and culminated in a defeat that suggests hull city might yet bomb out of the premier league

click here for more match zone true , they could have benefited more from refereeing decisions â gomis was offside in the build up to his brilliant first goal and meyler âs second - half red card could have gone either way â but that should not exonerate a side that is supposed to be fighting for it life and yet looked so meek for half of this match
they managed no shots on goal in the time it took swansea city to go 2 - 0 ahead through ki sung-yueng and gomis âs bicycle kick
as fate would have it , meyler was sent off for fouling kyle naughton two minutes after paul mcshane had given hull city a lifeline
gomis finished them in stoppage time
he said : â we were disappointed to lose the game and we knew we were nowhere near good enough in the first - half in particular
gomis â first goal is a fantastic piece of skill but he is five yards offside
gomis grabbed his second of the match after racing on to jonjo shelvey 's pass and chipping mcgregor in injury time the 29 - year - old celebrates in front of the swansea city fans on his hands and knees after making sure of the three points paul mcshane pulled a goal back for hull city five minutes into the second half when he pounced in the six - yard box the hull city defender slotted past fabianski from just four yard out after latching onto a free kick totally unmarked â we had got back into the game at 2 - 1 but unfortunately meyler has picked up a red card
â the consequence of the challenge , beyond damage to hull city âs survival prospects , is that kyle naughton went to hospital for an x-ray on his ankle
â for monk , it was the only complaint from a match that swansea city probably could have won in third gear
that âs no exaggeration in the context of how poor hull city were in the opening 45 minutes
ki sung-yueng âs opener after 18 minutes was actually the first chance of the game
meyler was sent off for the visitors just three minutes after paul mcshane pulled a goal back for a lunge on kyle naughton hull city midfielder meyler and his team - mates look on in disbelief as andre mariner reaches for the red card swansea city right back kyle naughton limps from the field and has to be replaced by angel rangel following meyler 's tackle ki sung-yueng buried the finish without taking a touch and now has scored four goals in eight games
it took 24 minutes for hull city to have their first chance â abel hernandez hit a bouncing ball from 30 yards and it trickled all the way to fabianski
gomis nailed the second with a goal that was hardly at home in such a subdued game
it enabled hull city to pull one back after 49 minutes
alex bruce found space from six yards to flick a header at goal and paul mcshane poked a finish past fabianski
for two minutes hull city looked a genuine threat
ki sung-yueng opened the scoring for the home side inside 20 minutes after pouncing following an mcgregor save ki sung-yueng leads the celebrations after giving garry monk 's side an early advantage at the liberty stadium on saturday hull city , to their credit , did not give up
with none of hull city âs outfield players in their own half , the frenchman had time to think before a nice chip over mcgregor
