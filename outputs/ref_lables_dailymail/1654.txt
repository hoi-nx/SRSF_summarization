when melbourne mother - of - two , kady , took her seven - week - old baby aside to breastfeed at a popular sydney hotel , the last thing she expected was to be told to put her breast away
when she moved to a quiet corner of the hotel âs lounge area with baby isla , she says she was confronted by hotel management and told she could nât breastfeed because the area was for â over 18s only
â â a young manager came over , pointed to a sign above me and said : " ca n't you see it says over 18s only ? " â kady told daily mail australia
" â he said we could n't be there and told me to use the disabled toilet if i wanted to breastfeed in the hotel
' i was n't worried about breastfeeding in the main bar - and i would have done - it 's just that i physically could n't manage it on the stools in there and i could n't find anywhere else to sit , ' kady says
' my husband euan went to speak with management to ask what we were supposed to do , and it was then that we were told to use " the baby room " - a disabled toilet with a change table
' kady was asked to move from the lounge area of the hotel because it was an area restricted to over 18s justin tynan , general manager and licencee of the wharf , says the particular area of the bar where kady was breastfeeding is the only area that is restricted to adults , apart from the gaming room
he says his hotel welcomes women who want to breastfeed elsewhere in the venue and that the incident sounds like it was a miscommunication
â it âs ludicrous to suggest that we would nât allow breastfeeding in the hotel , â mr justin tynan told daily mail australia , adding that his own wife regularly breastfeeds their four - month - old baby , max , at the venue â and elsewhere in public , often
â ajita , wife of justin tynan , with their baby max. mr tynan , general manager of the wharf , says ajita often breastfeeds their son at the venue and it 's ' ludicrous ' to suggest the hotel would n't allow women to do the same in australia , women have a right to breastfeed in public
under the federal sex discrimination act 1984 it 's illegal to discriminate against a person or deny services , directly or indirectly , on the grounds of breastfeeding
â but being directed to a public toilet is really inappropriate
â mothers breastfeeding in public are helping the next generation of australia to learn that breastfeeding is normal , â she says
her comments echo those of australia supermodel miranda kerr recently on the ' breastfeeding in public ' issue
â we âre a kid - friendly bar ' : the general manager of the popular manly wharf hotel , pictured , says the venue welcomes women who want to breastfeed elsewhere in the hotel leonard from the aba says stories like kady âs of women being asked to â move on â are uncommon
â the aba ( aba ) supports recommendations of the world health organisation to breastfeed for the first two years of a child âs life , with exclusive breastfeeding until a baby is six - months - old
new mothers can find breastfeeding - friendly venues through the aba 's breastfeeding welcome here directory.the association also runs a free 24 - hour breastfeeding helpline for mothers .
