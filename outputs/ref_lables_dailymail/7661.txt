the research focused on pomc neurons , which are a structure called the hypothalamus , that send and receive signals to regulate appetite

when pomc neurons are absent , or not working properly , animals and humans grow dangerously obese
the new findings show in animals that the same thing happens when certain genetic triggers inside the pomc cells are n't working
all three regulate how often and when the pomc cells use the gene to create the signal molecules that then go out to the body
located deep inside the brain , in a structure called the hypothalamus , the cluster of pomc neurons act as a control center for feelings of fullness or hunger
when pomc neurons are absent , or not working correctly , animals and humans grow dangerously obese
the latest research show in animals that the same thing happens when certain genetic triggers inside the pomc cells are n't working
when the researchers blocked cells of the hypothalamus from making islet 1 halfway through pregnancy , the fetal mice failed to develop any pomc cells
