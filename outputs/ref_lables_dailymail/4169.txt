eye of the beholder by snyder the behaviour of dutchman natural scientist van leeuwenhoek was nothing if not eccentric
in 1677 , at the age of 41 , he embarked on an extraordinarily gruesome experiment , using his body as a guinea pig
van leeuwenhoek ( pictured in a portrait ) used his body as a guinea pig in an experiment he took three lice , nestled them among the hairs of his calf , rolled up a tight stocking so that the insects were bound to his leg and then left the stocking on and did not bathe for six days
â he rubbed down his legs with ice , then took up his pen to calculate the louse âs reproduction rate
while leeuwenhoeck was thus engaged , another great dutchman , vermeer , was intent on his own more genteel studies in his house on the opposite side of delft âs market square
draped in a black cloth , vermeer spent hours peering into the box - like interior of a camera obscura , an ancestor of the photographic camera
this was a light - tight wooden chamber with a hole or lens on one side , which could be used to project an image of a scene on to a glass plate or wall
the experiments of these two men are the subject of laura j. snyder âs new biography
she asks an intriguing question : could vermeer and van leeuwenhoek , who were born in the same week , lived and worked their entire lives in an area not much larger than a football pitch , and who had friends in common , have exchanged ideas and inspired each other âs work ? this is much more than a joint biography
van leeuwenhoek âs mastery of lens - grinding saw him build a microscope capable of magnification up to 480 times
van leeuwenhoek âs collection included the eye of a whale , pickled in brandy
snyder moves effortlessly not just between vermeer âs studio and van leeuwenhoek âs laboratory , but all over europe , from the universities of italy , to the halls of the royal society in london , then the world âs pre-eminent scientific institution
van leeuwenhoek politely wrote to the president of the royal society : â what i investigate is only what , without sinfully defiling myself , remains as a residue of conjugal coitus
yet i was left more eager to peer down the lens at one of van leeuwenhoek âs slides , than to stand before even the most pellucid of vermeer âs exquisite paintings .
