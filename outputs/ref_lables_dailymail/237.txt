if strauss becomes england âs new supremo , the comeback hopes of kp , which gained momentum with the sacking of downton , would come to an abrupt halt
strauss said on saturday that he can see no way back for the man he fell out with so badly over the messages kp sent to south african opponents apparently criticising him as captain three years ago
kp begins his county comeback with surrey against oxford university in the parks on sunday having been encouraged to return to the domestic game by ecb chairman - elect graves and emboldened by the demise of downton , the man who sacked him last year
strauss ( right ) says the kp affair is a ' distraction ' for english cricket strauss and kp pictured during happier times during the 2011 series with india yet his hopes of an england return would seem over if strauss succeeds in becoming the new england director of cricket after throwing his hat into the ring on friday
â it âs very important for english cricket to move on from the kp situation , â said strauss , who infamously called kp â a complete c * * * â on air last season when he thought his microphone had been switched off
â strauss âs views are as much from a cricketing point of view as a personal one , even though his feelings towards kp clearly have not changed
â if you look at it from pure cricketing logic , after the ashes is over , it âs quite hard to see a situation where kp would come back into the side , â strauss told wisden editor and sportsmail cricket writer lawrence booth on the lord âs podcast
kp has rejoined surrey for the county season in an attempt to regain his england place kp 's chances of a recall have been boosted by the likely appointment of michael vaughan in the new ecb director of cricket role created following the sacking of downton as managing director â i think if you were to bring kp back it would be a short - term measure to help you win the ashes but i ca nât see that happening personally because there are too many bridges to build in too short a period of time
â michael vaughan remains favourite to pip strauss for a role that would have powers not enjoyed by anyone in english cricket since ray illingworth in the nineties
kp and michael vaughan pictured together on england duty at lord 's in 2008 strauss , who played in 82 tests with kp , believes his recall would only be a short - term measure now the new regime at the ecb have moved the goalposts and the man graves and harrison want is clearly michael vaughan , if they can persuade him to give up his extensive lucrative media work and other cricketing interests
michael vaughan will need to build some bridges himself with a number of england players if he takes over but clearly graves is not concerned by what has happened in the past and feels his fellow yorkshireman is perfect for the role
â even though it was a diplomatic answer it was perhaps revealing that anderson then named hussain and strauss as the best captains he has worked under , a view that was consistent with his autobiography where he offered little praise to the 2005 ashes - winning captain michael vaughan
