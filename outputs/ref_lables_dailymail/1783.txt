a new ebola jab is being given to people living in the west africa countries most badly hit by the virus after human trials in unaffected countries proved successful
scientists hope that immunisation is possible with just one injection after ' highly promising results ' in the first 138 healthy adults who were vaccinated with various doses
the vaccine , developed in canada , is based on an animal virus called vesicular stomatitis virus ( vsv ) that is combined with a portion of the protein covering of the ebola virus

dr ramharter , of the medical research unit at albert schweitzer hospital , lambarene , gabon , said the ebola antigen is inserted into the vaccine as a trojan horse to get the body to develop an immune response against the virus
while vsv only causes mild symptoms in humans , the protein acts as an ebola antigen and triggers the formation of antibodies against the disease in the immune system
' dr ramharter said these antibodies hide , almost like a ' trojan horse ' , in the body in order to successfully fight the ebola virus if the individual becomes infected
scientists hope that immunisation is possible with just one injection after ' highly promising results ' he added : ' just one vaccine has conferred one hundred per cent protection against ebola in the initial trials on primates
