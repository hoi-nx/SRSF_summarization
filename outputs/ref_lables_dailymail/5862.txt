they are caught between their bodies and their church - but have managed to walk a line between the two
these three mormon , all from utah , have realized that they are transgender - a designation not officially recognized by the church of latter day saints
indeed , church doctrine states that anybody who takes their transgender identity to the extent of gender reassignment surgery can not be baptized - and could face discipline from church elders if they are already a member of the religion
however , in the case of annabel jensen , moore and woodhouse , they have found a way to exist within the mormon universe - often with the help of local mormon leaders
moore used to be grace and annabel jensen was once christopher changed : woodhouse , above , changed gender much later in life
moore , 22 , is a math student at the university of utah , and first came to terms with being transgender in junior high
until then , he had been known as grace , but made the decision to throw out his girls ' clothes , swap his name to moore and start living as a male
' accepted : jensen told how she was welcomed when telling a mormon bishop of her transgender identity ' living that lie was killing me
' annabel jensen , who was born christopher , got as far as being ordained as a mormon elder and was lined up to go on a two - year mission before she confronted her identity as a woman
woodhouse remains devout but is not allowed to attend the relief society - an all - female organization within the church
difficult : woodhouse has not been allowed to participate in some female mormon activities , but says that she believes her gender identity is compatible with mormon teachings however , she believes that church doctrine on gender being eternal and unchangeable is compatible with her situation
' even the most senior members of the church are starting to take notice of the mormon transgender population
