a radical change in the law to protect a generation of children from the tide of internet sleaze will be introduced if the conservatives win the election
culture and media secretary sajid javid is setting out plans to shield youngsters from easy access to hardcore online pornography amid fears that it is corroding childhood
he promised legislation to force distributors to put effective age verification technology in place that would apply to those based in the britain as well as abroad
mr sajid javid 's pledge is a victory for the daily mail 's long - running block online porn campaign
but mr sajid javid said a more radical crackdown was necessary to prevent children freely accessing pornography
' even the most attentive and engaged parents can not know for sure which websites our children are visiting and what images they 're seeing , ' the minister told the daily mail
' yet each and every day children right across our country are being exposed to such images â it 's happening online
' mr sajid javid , who is increasingly tipped as a potential future conservatives leader , cited evidence that viewing hardcore porn can lead to children ' pressuring each other to try out things they 've seen , and sharing inappropriate sexual pictures and videos '
' such protections are taken for granted , and , as the daily mail has argued for years , it 's time our approach to the online world caught up
' mr sajid javid said if the tories win next month ' we will legislate to put online hardcore pornography behind effective age verification controls '
' if websites showing adult content do n't have proper age controls in place â ones that will stop children looking at this kind of material â they should and will be blocked altogether , ' he added
an independent regulator will oversee the new system and determine how age verification controls will work
mr sajid javid 's pledge is a victory for the daily mail 's block online porn campaign the regulator will also be given the power to require britain service providers to block specific websites identified as distributing hardcore pornography without effective age verification controls in place
mr sajid javid added : ' it is right that we have the same rules applying online as we do offline
if we fail to take action , there is every chance the sort of things children see on these websites will be considered ' normal ' by the next generation
peter wanless , of the nspcc , said : ' we do n't want children to learn about sex and relationships through the warped lens of adult pornography
' it 's time to protect children online by sajid javid , culture & media secretary , writing exclusively for mailonline imagine a 12 - year - old - boy being allowed to walk into a sex shop and leave with a dvd showing graphic , violent sexual intercourse and the subjugation of women
i âm a father of four young children and i know all too well that the online world can be a worrying place for mums and dads
culture and media secretary sajid javid is setting out plans to shield youngsters from easy access to hardcore online pornography in 2015 anyone , regardless of their age , is only ever two clicks away from the kind of material that would be kept well away from young eyes in the high street
and allowing young people to access pornography carries alarming consequences both for individuals and for society
it can lead to children pressuring each other to try out things they âve seen online , and sharing inappropriate sexual pictures and videos
such protections are taken for granted , and , as the daily mail has argued for years , it âs time our approach to the online world caught up
so today we are announcing that , if the conservatives win the next general election , we will legislate to put online hard - core pornography behind effective age verification controls
but if websites showing adult content do nât have proper age controls in place â ones that will stop children looking at this kind of material â they should and will be blocked altogether
it will determine , in conjunction with websites , how age verification controls will work and how websites that do not put them in place will be blocked
one thing is absolutely clear : the conservatives âs commitment to child safety online
