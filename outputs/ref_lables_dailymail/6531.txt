comedian jenny travelled with her other half on a painting in venus break with flavours there comes a time in a woman âs life when beach holidays just do nât cut it any longer , when lying on golden sands serves only to remind you how much weight you forgot to lose again this year and how ill - fitting your swimming costume is
an excursion to venice one day provided inspiration for the budding artists i âm in the latter camp â and i âve got the paintings to prove it
bingo ! last autumn i found myself spending a week in treviso , just outside venice , with a nine - strong crew of wannabe artists and keen cooks
with the exception of the painting tutor , scotsman hugh , and my other half geof , we were middle - aged women to the core
fabulous , hilarious , slightly eccentric middle - aged , middle - class women with plenty of pashminas and photos of dogs on our iphones ! jenny stayed at the villa bianchi , a comfortable farmhouse surrounded by maize fields and within easy striking distance by car of both treviso and venice for seven days , we painters were patiently guided by hugh through the basics of sketching , paint technique , colour and form , while the cooks stayed in the kitchen making our meals
the cooks wanted to chop vegetables into smithereens , while we artists wanted to sit in a medieval market town with a paintbrush in one hand and a glass of prosecco in the other
two days into the break , our holiday operator flavours herded us all into minibuses and took us to venice
like schoolchildren with credit cards , we roamed the most beautiful city in the world and came home , inspired by its mind - boggling loveliness , with lots of photos to copy into our art books back at our base , villa bianchi
staying in treviso , just outside venice , jenny stayed in a nine - strong crew of wannabe artists and keen cooks although it was in the middle of nowhere , the farmhouse was comfortable , surrounded by maize fields and within easy striking distance by car of both treviso and venice
being the only couple , geof and i had a separate annexe to ourselves
in terms of relaxation , the holiday ticked all the right boxes â geof and i had a completely stress - free break , and other people did the cooking
how marvellous is that ? there was no need to feel anxious about restaurant bills as the food and drink were entirely inclusive , even when went out on day trips to venice and treviso
as for our artistic endeavours , geof cheated , having been at art school in the 1960s
heavenly backdrop : church of santa maria della salute at dusk , venice , just one of the venetian sights that provided inspiration in the historic city he quickly became the teacher âs pet , which was slightly infuriating ( although secretly i was rather proud of him )
now , i âm not saying that any of mine are going on the wall , but a couple of geof âs might make it into frames
