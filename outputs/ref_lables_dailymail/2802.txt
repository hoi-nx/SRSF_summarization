a married couple who thought they would never be able to have children are celebrating after welcoming triplets - born three years apart thanks to ivf
denise and glen higgs , from braunton , devon , had all but lost hope that they would ever be able to conceive after glen was made infertile due to cancer treatment
but using his frozen sperm , doctors successfully created eight embryos through ivf fertility treatment and the couple had a daughter mazy , born three years ago

former raf fireman glen said : ' medical staff have told us our three children are triplets as they are all from the batch of embryos that were created at the same time
' glen , 35 , had always wanted to have children and decided to store sperm shortly before his testicular cancer treatment at the age of 20 made him infertile
he met dee and , after living together for five years , tied the knot in 2011 before embarking on a course of ivf treatment
