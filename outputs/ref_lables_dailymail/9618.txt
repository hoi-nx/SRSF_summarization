this will prove yet another bitter pill for saracens to swallow
clermont warm up in front of their supporters at stade geoffroy-guichard in saint-etienne clermont centre wesley fofana attempts an offload following a crunching hit from marcelo bosch saracens flanker maro itojie secures a loose ball on the deck during a tight first half of action there should be no shame in this defeat
whereas northampton capitulated embarrassingly against the same opponents a fortnight ago , saracens stood tall on saturday
saracens â long - suffering chairman nigel wray , who has pumped tens of millions of pounds into this club over the past two decades , took the opportunity on saturday morning to repeat his conviction that english clubs will never be able to compete with french teams if the domestic salary cap is not raised
but it can only be a matter of time before saracens deliver
saracens pressurised clermont with the same fierce defence that knocked them so spectacularly off their stride in last year âs semi-final at twickenham
â as evidence of their dominance , clermont will point to wesley fofana âs superbly taken second - half try and a 19th - minute incident which saw naipolini nalaga denied what should have been a penalty try
saracens full back alex goode tries to sidestep clermont scrum half ludovic radosavljevic but , had jacques burger been able to cling on to a knock - on from nalaga with less than 10 minutes on the clock after richard wigglesworth âs superb chase and tackle of alex goode âs clearance , saracens could so easily have won this game
richard wigglesworth feeds the ball into a saracens scrum as referee george clancy watches on â it âs easy to focus on the negatives when we have just lost a game like that
but on reflection , saracens will be buoyed by this performance
they have both returned to their best following a slow start to the season , while saracens scrum is also in fine shape
saracens fly half charlie hodgson clears his lines under pressure from the clermont defence charlie hodgson missed two critical long - range penalties on saturday but the veteran fly half has been magnificent this season and the second - half appearance of owen farrell from the bench saw the england no 10 make his first appearance since rupturing knee ligaments in january
but in the cold light of day , saracens will realise many of their boys became men on saturday
