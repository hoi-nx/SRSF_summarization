frozen salt and vinegar crisp , anyone ? we all know freezing is a great way of preserving foods
from cakes to curries , freezing brings out more of their flavour and boosts the texture
here , tessa cunningham puts a host of our favourite foods to the frozen test
freeze your cake for 24 hours straight from the oven and the sponge will be bouncier than ever after being frozen for 24 hours , the sponge will be even bouncier because this process boosts the moisture , so you get an even creamier and softer centre
once frozen solid , wrap it in clingfilm , and it can be kept frozen for up to three months
herbs and spices keeping fresh herbs in the freezer will intensify their flavour because they take on moisture during the freezing process
tough herbs such as rosemary and thyme preserve the best , but ginger , lemongrass , garlic and chilli will last up to six months when frozen
by keeping fresh herbs in the freezer you will intensify their flavour because they take on moisture during the freezing process just pop stems in a plastic container and freeze
you can sprinkle frozen chilli , garlic and ginger into stews , fishcakes or curries
frozen herbs are also brilliant in pies , pasta and pestos
by extracting air , freezing makes the crisps crunchier and they can even be eaten straight from frozen
now , you have a solution â freezing will preserve the flavour and texture instantly
due to the high oil content of nuts , they go rancid very quickly but freezing them will preserve the flavour and texture right away to freeze peanuts , walnuts , pecans , macadamias , cashews , hazelnuts and almonds ( shelled or unshelled ) , wrap them in clingfilm , then place them in a resealable bag
that âs because the freezing process loosens the skins
while you probably wo nât want to use frozen tomatoes in salads , as it makes the flesh slightly squishy , it does intensify the flavour
alternatively , before freezing , roast your tomatoes at a gentle temperature with garlic , fresh herbs and a drizzle of olive oil for up to four hours
freezing a curry is a great way to make the most of leftovers especially because as the curry cools the flavours and aromas combine to create even better seasoning and hey presto ! , they taste even yummier
