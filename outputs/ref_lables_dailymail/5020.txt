but i am here because kathryn beale is a national expert in the art of the strange foodstuff , and one very disconcerting product in particular
the 41 - year - old mother - of - two is part of a rapidly growing cottage industry that prepares fresh placenta for new mothers
along with some 60 other specialists in this country , she whizzes it into smoothies , or grinds it into pills for women convinced of its health benefits
mothers have reported powerful healing properties , saying that eating their own placenta ( the blood - filled organ that supports the foetus in the womb ) has helped to increase their milk supply , reduce post-natal bleeding , stabilise blood pressure , and , crucially , provide them with more energy to care for their babies
kathryn beale has had no reported cases of food poisoning among her clients
nor , for that matter , has any other practitioner in the 70 - strong ipen ( ipen ) , of which kathryn beale is a member
yet kathryn beale is in despair , having found herself at the centre of a storm which could not only destroy her own business , but help put an end to placenta - eating across the country

kathryn beale says of the council âs inspection : â it was clear they did nât know how a maternity ward works
â kathryn beale provides her clients â mostly well - educated , professional women â with a large zip - lock bag into which the placenta is placed
the bagged organ is then put into a large leak - proof plastic box , which goes into a cool bag packed with ice packs ready for kathryn beale to collect
