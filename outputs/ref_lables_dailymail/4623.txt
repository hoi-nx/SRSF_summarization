wenger is so respected and so clearly a deeply intelligent man that every now and then you find yourself nodding sagely at something he has said which , upon closer examination , turns out to sound right but to have decidedly unsubstantial foundations
usually it is related to how arsenal âs defensive record is statistically actually very good ( it is ) in the aftermath of the latest debacle
but last week it was on the issue of quotas , or more specifically fa chairman greg dyke âs idea of increasing the number of homegrown players in a premier league squad of 25 from eight to 12
â i believe that we are in the world of competition , â said wenger in one of his regular interviews to bein sports
arsenal manager wenger shows his frustrations during a premier league match in march 2011 fa chairman greg dyke pictured attending the friendly between england and italy in turin on tuesday â so we can say one or two things â we protect the mediocre or we produce the best players
a cursory glance at wenger âs transfer record shows in his bid to save the premier league from english mediocrity he has signed tomas danilevicius , igor stepanovs , kaba diawara , sebastian squillaci , andre santos , amoury bischoff , park chu-young , marouane chamakh , pascal cygan , philippe senderos , denilson , manuel almunia and johan djourou
and of course , over 18 years any manager , even a great one as wenger is , can make some dud buys
there is nothing in greg dyke âs proposals to stop mesut ozil , alexis sanchez and santi cazorla playing for arsenal

that âs a debate worth having but the main thrust of greg dyke âs proposals is simply to encourage the clubs to rely less on the marketplace and grow their own players
for wenger âs argument sounds great in theory but the reality is that there is a class of players at the tip of the footballers â pyramid which stand out and which any team would want â the thierry henrys , patrick vierias of this world
you would only have to be a little more sure you could find space for them as one of your 13 â that âs 13 ! â foreign players in your squad of 25
but there is another tier of players below that â let âs says the mathieu flamini and mikel arteta level ( who would also still be available under they greg dyke proposals as eu players )

the arsenal manager , since his arrival , has never shown an awful amount of interest in arsenal âs youth set - up
the fact that kieran gibbs and jack wilshere are regular starters and were players developed at arsenal 's academy during wenger âs 18 years is exceptional for his period as manager
arsenal 's kieran gibbs ( left ) breaks past qpr 's darnell furlong at loftus road last month arsenal 's jack wilshere ( front ) charges forward with the ball during a friendly against brentford on tuesday sadly greg dyke probably killed his idea by announcing it in public before asking the clubs
most are already on board in theory with the narrative that homegrown players are worthwhile
but if harry kane is nât a good enough incentive for the premier league clubs to work harder to promote players , perhaps their recent travails in the champions league and europa league might convince them
and if wenger wants to examine something truly mediocre he might wish to cast his eye over the premier league âs record in europe over the past three seasons
in fact , if he paid a little more attention to building a core of homegrown players then perhaps , like ajax , ac milan , manchester united , barcelona and bayern munich , arsenal might have won the champions league by now .
