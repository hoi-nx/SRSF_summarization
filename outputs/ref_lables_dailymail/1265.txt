dodd tweeted a picture of bodi and abubakar bhula worshipping on their knees in a stairwell of liverpool fc âs anfield ground
he added the caption : â muslims praying at half - time at the match yesterday # disgrace
â fury : dodd took this photograph of bodi and abubakar bhula praying at anfield last month mr dodd âs post , made after liverpool fc took on blackburn rovers in the fa cup last month , was met with widespread condemnation on social media , with users branding him a â bigot â and â disgrace to humanity â
last night , liverpool fc promised to take â appropriate action â against the supporter
it is not known if mr dodd is a season ticket holder , but he could have this revoked or be banned from future matches
yesterday mr bodi , 46 , a solicitor from preston , told the daily mail that it was not the first time he had prayed at a match
backlash : dodd tried to defend himself by saying that he was a long - standing fan of liverpool fc â it only takes a few minutes and this time it was during half - time that we needed to pray , â the lawyer said
that day , the time came for prayer and the window would have closed before the game finished so we did it at half - time
he told mailonline : ' we are aware of incidents where practising muslims have been abused since they have decided to quietly pray in public areas during half - time breaks
' most people are absolutely fine with it and the stewards at anfield are wonderful , but it only takes one or two people to react in the wrong way and you could have a nasty situation
liverpool fc âs fa cup quarter - final against blackburn rovers kicked off at 4pm , meaning mr bodi and mr abubakar bhula had to say their afternoon prayers at half - time , as the window of opportunity closed before the end of the game
mr bodi , whose eight - year - old son ayman can also be seen in mr dodd âs photo , added : â my little boy said at the time â someone is taking a picture of us â and i thought maybe it was someone who had nât seen prayers before
â mr abubakar bhula , 37 , who is also a solicitor , said he would happily meet with mr dodd to explain the importance of prayers in islam
â in a statement , liverpool fc said discrimination would not be tolerated at the club and it would â take appropriate action against the individual involved â
