curiosity has discovered strange , multi-coloured veins on mars that could give astronomers new insights into the red planet 's watery past
the mineral veins were found at a site called ' garden city ' on the slopes of mount sharp and stick up from the rock by up to 6cm ( 2.5 inches )
scientists believe the bizarre network of ridges formed in mars ' wet past billions of years ago above the now eroded , much softer bedrock
this march 18 , view from the mast camera on the curiosity rover shows a network of two - tone mineral veins
scientists believe the bizarre formed in mars ' wet past billions of years ago above the now eroded bedrock the ridges contain both bright and dark material
this view from the mars hand lens imager on the arm of curiosity is a close - up of a two - tone mineral vein at a site called ' garden city ' on lower mount sharp
the findings suggest there was ample time and water for life on mars to thrive , but over the last 3.7 billion years the red planet has lost 87 per cent of its water - leaving it barren and dry
garden city is about 39 feet ( 12 meters ) higher than the bottom edge of the ' pahrump hills ' outcrop of the bedrock forming the basal layer of mount sharp , at the center of mars ' gale crater
it seems that the two - toned minerals were created from two distinctive wet periods on the planet
curiosity is now exploring different layers of mount sharp in the hope of finding more clues to the red planet 's history .
