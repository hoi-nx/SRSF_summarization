california gov. brown ordered state officials to impose mandatory water restrictions for the first time in history on wednesday , as the state continues to grapple with a serious drought
brown said wednesday that he had signed an executive order requiring the state water resources control board to implement measures in cities and towns to cut water usage by 25 percent compared with 2013 levels
brown 's order will require campuses , golf courses , cemeteries and other large landscapes to significantly cut water use ; direct local governments to replace 50 million square feet of lawns throughout the state with drought - tolerant landscaping ; and create a temporary rebate program for consumers who replace old water - sucking appliances with more efficient ones
' the order calls on local water agencies to implement tiered water pricing that charges higher rates as more water is used and requires agricultural users to report more water use information to state regulators
brown 's office said that would boost the state 's ability to enforce laws against illegal water diversions and water waste
