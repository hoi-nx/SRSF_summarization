tim cook may have described the apple as â the most personal device we 've ever created â but reports claim the gadget does n't tolerate some individual âs tattoos
dark , vibrant ink seems to cause the watch âs heart rate monitor to lose connection and give inaccurate readings
some dark , vibrant ink seems to cause the watch âs heart sensor to lose connection and give inaccurate readings the issue first came to light on reddit and twitter where a number of users reported similar issues , such as having to repeatedly enter a password to unlock the phone
tests suggest that tattoos in dark and solid colours interfere with the device the most
this is because the heart sensor reads a pulse by measuring light absorption though the skin - a process called photoplethysmography
' this technology , while difficult to pronounce , is based on a very simple fact : blood is red because it reflects red light and absorbs green light , apple wrote on its support page
' when your heart beats , the blood flow in your wrist - and the green light absorption - is greater
' by flashing its led lights hundreds of times per second , apple can calculate the number of times the heart beats each minute - your heart rate
it appears the pigmented ink of some tattoos affects the watch 's sensor âs ability to read an individual âs heart rate , which in turn leads the watch to think it has stopped making contact with the skin
apple has yet to comment on the problem , despite there being speculation that the apparent fault could also stop some people using apple pay

' the user has told apple about the problem who tried to solve the problem , but are also reporting it to their engineers
the average heart rate is 72 bpm
the team was unable to reproduce problems reported on twitter of light , but patterned tattoos creating errors , leading them to conclude that the design and type of tattoo makes a difference in how well the watch works
apple has yet to comment on ' tattoo-gate ' but admits on its support page that ' many factors ' can affect the performance of the apple heart rate monitor
' if you âre exercising in the cold , for example , the skin perfusion in your wrist may be too low for the heart rate sensor to get a reading
the test was carried out by cardiff - based iphone repairs specialist iphonefixed.co.uk , which used a sapphire screen from a 38mm apple watch for its experiment
