a five - year - old iranian girl who has spent more than a year in australia 's offshore nauru detention centre has been prescribed anti-depressants , has self - harmed by swallowing shampoo and nails and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder , her lawyer says
she is now living in fear of being returned from a holding centre in darwin to troubled nauru for years while her family 's asylum claim is processed , lawyer john lawrence said
' a five - year - old iranian girl is living in fear of being returned to nauru detention centre ' the medical reports tell me there have been reported incidences of her self - harming ... swallowing shampoo and swallowing nails
mr john lawrence told daily mail australia he met with the girl in detention in darwin on sunday and said it is the most heartbreaking case he has ever worked on
' ' i guess like all children she is strong , resilient and lovely , however when you ask her to write her name and she writes her detention number not her name and you ask her to draw her picture and she draws a stick person with a stitched up mouth , you realise how wrong it is for a five - year - old old to be in jail and of course her medical results completely confirm that , ' he said
the girl wrote her boat number when asked to write her name , and when asked to draw a picture of life on nauru drew an image of a person with their lips sewn shut mr john lawrence said doctors and psychologists have recommended that she be released and that she should n't be returned to nauru because of her post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorder
' the government have got a child who has been damaged in their detention facility and they know she 's been damaged in their facility , she 's psychologically seriously damaged and should n't be returned to nauru
mr john lawrence will lodge an injunction in the federal court against the department in an attempt to block the family 's return to nauru
