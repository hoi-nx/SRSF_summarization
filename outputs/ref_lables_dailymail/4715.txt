in england alone , there are more than 670,000 unpaid carers helping someone with dementia
here 's how to make life easier what to expect the early stages of the disease bring changes that may be so subtle that some friends and acquaintances are unaware that there is anything wrong - and this stage can continue for many years
but as the disease progresses and more damage is done to the brain , symptoms become more pronounced : difficulties with communication become more intense and issues such as getting dressed or managing day - to - day affairs become more problematic
establish routines in the early stages of dementia , it 's the short - term memory that 's most affected , making it harder for patients to keep track of the day , or even what time of day it is
i 've found that sticking to a routine helps keep someone with dementia better orientated , and gets their body clock into a rhythm
in the early stages , aim to establish fixed times of day for the following - it may help to write this on a board that 's kept next to a calendar ( cross it off to show what day it is ) and a clock , so that they know what to expect when
often people with dementia may display more symptoms and anxiety as the light starts to fade when behaviour changes the middle stage of dementia inevitably heralds changes in behaviour
this can be one of the toughest things to cope with , for at times it may seem as if the person you know and love has gone
as the dementia progresses , the loss of nerve cells in the brain allows old reflexes that were replaced in adulthood by more complex brain pathways to resurface
what to do : the best way to deal with it is by diluting contact - try introducing other regular carers as soon as the person being cared for starts to display any clingy behaviour
wandering around 60 per cent of those with dementia wander - pacing around the house or outside of the home - and the problem is they can get lost , as the damage to the hippocampus part of the brain means they lose their sense of orientation
what to do : if they tell you they 're going out do n't argue but speak calmly and tell them they do n't need to as they are ' staying here ' tonight
people with dementia may find these disorientating and when they get home this disorientation can continue and induce wandering so they may feel the urge to leave the house
ensure they do n't have too much fluid before bed and install night - lights to help prevent falls
painting the walls and doors a matching colour makes it less likely that the person with dementia will find their way out
what to do : try to identify what 's causing it - have there been more people round than normal , or have they had too much caffeine ? many of the triggers may be unavoidable , but it can help to keep their surroundings as comfortable and relaxing as possible
but never talk down to them or use childish language as this could make them angry
speak to the person with dementia reassuringly , in a calm manner
keep the person busy at sundown and in the early evening sundowning often people with dementia have good and bad days but also good and bad times during a given day - and often they may display more symptoms and anxiety as the light starts to fade , becoming confused , agitated , restless or showing repetitive behaviours
it 's not clear why this happens - it 's possible it 's to do with a disruption to brain chemicals affecting the body clock
two - thirds of those with alzheimer 's disease experience sundowning
look them in the eye when you talk with dementia , the parts of the brain that normally deal with understanding , thought processing and language deteriorate
the following strategies can help tackle these issues : better to say : ' you seem to have put the crockery in the washing machine
