the london borough of barking and dagenham wants dog owners to pick up their pets ' droppings and use bins provided a london council is to introduce csi - style dna testing for dogs so it can track and fine owners who do n't clean up after their animals
the london borough of barking and dagenham wants dog owners to submit a dna sample from the inside of the animal 's cheek so it is registered on a database
the council would then use stored information to match the animal responsible with any errant mess found on the streets - and issue the owner an Â£ 80 fine
and while it will mean an expense for the council , they believe it will represent value for money for residents as similar schemes in the us have reduced dog fouling by up to 90 per cent
the london borough of barking and dagenham , civic centre pictured , will become the first in the uk to introduce the plans which will allow them to match dog mess to owners and issue fines they 're currently in discussion with stakeholders including the kennel club , keep britain tidy and streetkleen , the company which will run the dna testing , on how owners can be encouraged to submit the samples
' in the us , we have experienced reductions in dog fouling by as much as 90 per cent after introducing the programme
