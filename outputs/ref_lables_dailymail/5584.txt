kseniya , who is due in august , wants to name her unborn child michael , after her late father
because they have been unable to settle their disagreement privately , the couple has turned to the general public to help them make a decision ; nicholas , 37 , has launched an online petition asking for help to sway his wife
baby name showdown : nicholas and kseniya ca n't agree over whether to name their child spyridon or michael , which nicholas says his wife will shorten to mischa ' the argument is serious â it âs not a joke , ' kseniya , 33 , told the new york post
' according to the petition , kseniya finds the name spyridon ' archaic , base , bereft of elegance and unsuitable for a child living in 21st century u.s. '
in fact , if the couple has a girl , nicholas is willing to let kseniya choose the name ; he also says that if they name their first born son spyridon , his wife can choose the name of their second son
mystery child : the couple does n't yet know the sex of their baby ; if it 's a girl , nicolas will surrender all naming rights to kseniya while they wait to find out , nicholas is hoping to get 100,000 signatures supporting his choice â the magic number that his wife agreed would be enough for him to get his way
