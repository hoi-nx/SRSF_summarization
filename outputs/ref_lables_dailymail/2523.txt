mccoy stood with the trainer , jonjo , in the parade ring
mccoy did not need to be reminded for whom it tolled
he walked alongside box office , the final ride of his astonishing career , and then clambered into the saddle
the tears streamed down his face but he pulled down his goggles so that nobody would see
mccoy was presented the champion jockey trophy by ian wright is an arsenal fanatic the 40 - year - old received a guard of honour before receiving the champion jockey trophy he knew this would be a strange day
he was aware it was being styled as a joyous celebration of the career of the greatest jump jockey there has ever been
but mccoy knew , too , that , for him , the day of his retirement would be a day filled with sadness and dread
earlier in the afternoon , he had ridden mr mole into third place in the bet365 ap mccoy celebration chase
so one last time , he rode a mount around the surrey track , racing the rest of the field and one of the red - and - blue trains that hurry along behind the tree line on the far side of the course , towards waterloo
the last race of mccoy âs career , the bet365 handicap hurdle , was won by richard johnson , 15 times a runner - up to mccoy in the jockeys â championship
mccoy , 40 , finished third
he pushed box office all the way to the line and took the congratulations of his fellow jockeys as they and their horses milled around him
mccoy and box office trotted back in front of the stands packed with 18,000 cheering fans
the champion jockey was joined by his wife channelle , daughter eve and son archie on his last day of racing in the winner âs enclosure , he dismounted amid scarcely controlled chaos
a television reporter put his microphone under mccoy âs nose and paid fulsome tribute to him , telling him he wanted to thank him not just for today but the last 20 years
everyone wanted mccoy to be happy , to depart gladly from his glory game , but everywhere he went , he looked as if he were being led to the gallows
the irish jockey ( left ) was unable to leave on a winning note as he raced on the aptly named box office it was like that when the rest of the jockeys who have trailed in his wake for so long formed an honour guard as he walked into the parade ring to be presented with the champion jockey trophy for the 20th consecutive time , by ian wright , one of mccoy âs arsenal heroes
some of the jockeys were in tears
mccoy was having none of it
it is difficult to set the parameters for greatness , particularly when trying to measure a jockey against heroes of other sports
but whatever criteria you use , it is hard to outstrip mccoy for the relentlessness of his domination
mccoy stayed at the top for 1,040 consecutive weeks
time and again in interviews on saturday , he said the thing uppermost in his mind
â sandown was packed with punters and the media who were eager to give him a memorable send off mccoy , who was named the bbc sports personality of the year in 2010 after he finally won the grand national , was given plenty of opportunities to talk about the benefits a life without racing might bring
â all records are broken , â mccoy said
â apart from my wife and kids , â mccoy added , hurriedly
â crowds wee packed into sandown to wish mccoy well in his final two rides a few years ago , mccoy talked about the realities that his wife had had to live with as the partner of a man so utterly dedicated to a dangerous sport
he recalled the moment they had been for a fertility check and were told that mccoy âs habit of taking hot baths every day to sweat weight off had made his sperm count abnormally low
â chanelle was busy putting things into perspective , â mccoy remembered
on saturday , as mccoy carried the champion jockey trophy around the parade ring at sandown , eve ran after him in her little white dress , outside the cluster of photographers who tracked his every move
