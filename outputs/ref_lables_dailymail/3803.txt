coe schools should stop selecting pupils on faith because it discriminates against the poor , a group of vicars has claimed
they say the system is open to abuse and many oversubscribed schools reject non-churchgoing families even though they may live nearby
many christian schools give priority to families who regularly attend services , a practice which they say preserves their faith ethos
many christian schools give priority to families who regularly attend services , a practice which they say preserves their faith ethos - but a group of vicars say it can lead to discrimination against the poor but the clergymen said affluent parents were more likely to cheat the system by going to church just to get their children into a coe school , which are often high - performing
referring to a 2013 survey by the sutton trust , they said 6 per cent of parents with a child at a state - funded school admitted to attending church services in order to get their child into a coe school
they said the level of false coe attendance rose to 10 per cent among affluent parents in the socio-economic group a. the letter said : â on a superficial level this is in the coe âs interest , as attendance figures in many parishes are inflated and the standard of our schools boosted by the admittance of children from more affluent families
â coe schools should look outwards , as an expression of the warmth and generosity of its mission to the whole community
â simon calvert , of the christian institute , added : â there âs a push to try to secularise coe schools and it âs a shame that a group of liberal anglicans are playing into that
