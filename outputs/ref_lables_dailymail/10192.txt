french trainer head has favourably compared his 2,000 guineas hope ride like the wind to last year 's fifth - placed runner charm spirit , who landed three group one races in 2014
ride like the wind was one of 34 colts which remain in the first classic of the season run on saturday , may 2
ride like the wind won just one of his four starts last season but he has run twice this term , posting a career best on his most recent start when landing the group three by a head
head said : â ride like the wind will run in the 2,000 guineas
they are similar horses in that they tend to be a bit keen and if ride like the wind settles better than charm spirit did last year i think that he has a good chance
head says ride like the wind is ' on the same sort of level ' as charm spirit was at this time last year â that is why i have given him two runs already this season , to get the freshness out of him before the 2,000 guineas
at this stage , a supplementary entry in the 2,000 guineas at newmarket is under serious consideration and we are 90 % certain to take that route , subject to the horse continuing to please me
