while some other mothers nudged one another in disbelief as kate and prince george cooed over the new - born animals , staff at snettisham , norfolk , are so familiar with the duchess of cambridge she knows many on first - name terms
helped by his mother , her prominent bump hidden beneath what appeared to be william âs green barbour coat , prince george tenderly gave a bottle of milk to one of the farm âs new - born piglets
if it seems to be a picture of a typical middle - class day out , that is no accident as this is exactly the informal , away - from - the - cameras upbringing william and kate want for their children
that is why they are turning their new country bolt hole , anmer hall , on the north norfolk coast , into a secluded fortress home , far from prying eyes â and far removed from traditional royal protocol
anmer is set to become their principal residence over the next few years as william focuses on family and his new flying career
for him , a life of peace and quiet is far preferable to his own pressure - cooker upbringing under the global spotlight
royal aides have confirmed that the cambridges will head to anmer after the birth ( they will spend the first night at kensington palace ) â as will kate âs mother , carole , to help with childcare and housekeeping
kate will be taking a longer maternity leave this time round and mail on sunday can reveal that the pilot prince plans to scale back his black - tie charity commitments so that he can enjoy more time at home
already the couple have immersed themselves in a notably more domestic â not to say middle class â life style than many royals , with under - the - radar shopping trips to nearby market towns and evening dinners in country pubs
the duke âs security detail , stationed a respectful 50 yards away , left kate and prince george to enjoy their morning in peace
it was a sunny monday earlier this month , just days after the couple finally moved into anmer hall
and kate and prince george were enjoying one of their last days out together before the arrival of the new royal baby
â according to a close friend of kate âs : â she ca nât wait to escape the hustle and bustle of the city
kate and young prince george have enjoyed meeting the new - born animals at snettisham park farm prince george and his mother are also regular visitors to the children âs play area at a nearby village as a result , prince george is rarely photographed in public and has not made an official appearance in this country since leaving st mary âs hospital 21 months ago
it is part of william âs strategy to shelter his family and he has a team of qualified aides and lawyers to advise him on privacy laws
of course , william and kate are also keen to enjoy the fruits of their two - year Â£ 1.5 million remodelling of their new home , with its ten bedrooms , swimming pool , tennis court and extensive grounds
their official residence will remain kensington palace , but anmer hall will be their de facto family home for at least the next two years as william embarks on a new career with the east anglian air ambulance service
as part of the costly renovations â which also included installing a new roof , a state - of - the - art kitchen and a conservatory â william had the driveway to the property , which used to belong to his close friends the van cutsem family , rerouted so that anyone accessing the property is shielded by trees
at anmer hall , prince george can enjoy playing in the garden and william can cycle freely around the country lanes
moving to anmer has afforded the couple the peace and freedom william especially has always craved
remember , too , that some of william âs happiest childhood memories are of when his mother ripped up the stuffy royal protocols and introduced her two young sons to â normal â life by taking them to theme parks , go - kart tracks and public beaches â trips echoed by kate and prince george âs visit to the petting zoo
william âs friend , etonian archie soames is often at the family seat , west barsham hall in fakenham , less than an hour from anmer hall , and the couple socialise with baron howard of rising âs children annabel , charlie and tom who william plays football with
william , seated at the head of the table next to his heavily pregnant wife , organised the supper to celebrate them finally moving to anmer
â william and kate have friends in norfolk , and they enjoyed a private dinner in a dining room , â reports a source
william will be based at cambridge airport as part of his duties with the east anglian air ambulance service the cambridges have already enjoyed dinner with friends at one of their locals , the crown inn at east rudham the mail on sunday has been told that william has implemented a number of changes to his diary and will be cutting back on black - tie charity events in particular
princes william and harry were filmed as toddlers playing the piano in the kensington palace nursery with their parents , but william and kate have refused to allow the cameras into their home
diana strove to create as ordinary a life as possible for her boys and william wants the same for his own children
both he and kate realise such a dream is far more realistic far from the madding crowds at anmer hall .
