two men who became locked inside an airtight bank vault for six hours had to be dramatically rescued by firefighters using heavy drills
jacob church , 21 , and joe tobin , 29 , were at an art exhibition at a former bank building when the vault door shut behind them , leaving them trapped in total darkness
the pair - who had only met earlier that night - were fed water through a tube to prevent them becoming dehydrated while police kept in contact with them to check their oxygen levels were not getting dangerously low
after their six - hour ordeal , eventually fire crews with specialist drills were able to cut through the thick concrete walls

it was hosting the opening of the look no hands exhibition described by its curators as ' an eyeball massacre and a massage of visionary art. ' one of the exhibition rooms was the 6m x 6m old bank vault with its thick metal door held ajar
the 21 - year - old - who admits he was a ' little drunk ' - went into the vault with fellow art enthusiast mr joe tobin at 1am
' rescue mission : fire crews had to save the pair and this meant the exhibition was shut on saturday light : the emergency crews managed to drill through the wall and pass the pair glow sticks and ear plugs although the two art enthusiasts could hear noise outside , they were unaware what was going on , but were told the fire service had been called
at that point , two fire engines and a specialist urban search and rescue team arrived and use drilling equipment to penetrate the thick concrete walls
the emergency crews drilled a small hole through the vault door to speak to the pair and passed them glow sticks for light and ear plugs
strangers : jacob church ( left ) and joe tobin ( right ) were locked in the vault in total darkness for six hours mr jacob church , a former lab technician at specsavers , added : ' we got a phone call about every half an hour from a police woman who kept asking us if our oxygen levels were ok
' it was worrying but i told them if it does run out what can they do for us anyway ? ' the fire crews drilled around 15 inch - wide holes into the thick wall , which was reinforced with metal bars
exhibition curator tye , 31 , said they always kept the vault door open for ' health and safety reasons '
she said there was no chance of a repeat incident because the vault door was now permanently locked
two male persons were rescued from an internal bank vault
' there was a limited air supply in the nature of it being a bank vault and our urban search and rescue team were called in with specialist equipment
