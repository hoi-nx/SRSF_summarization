john allan claimed the tory leader 's decision to promise an in - out referendum before knowing what powers can be clawed back from brussels means the cart is very firmly before the horse '
he suggested large firms like the supermarket giant could move their head offices from london to other sites in europe ' relatively painlessly ' , should britain exit the eu
the tory election manifesto includes the promise of an in - out referendum by 2017 , but only after reform of britain 's membership
it states : ' it will be a fundamental principle of a future conservative tory government that membership of the eu depends on the consent of the britain people â and in recent years that consent has worn wafer - thin
' that âs why , after the election , we will negotiate a new settlement for britain in europe , and then ask the britain people whether they want to stay in the eu on this reformed basis or leave
this issue of the eu referendum and the uncertainty that it creates and the possibility that it could lead to britain leaving the eu is a particularly heavy kind of pebble to put in the scales , ' he told the paper
cameron , pictured today , has promised to renegotiate britain 's membership of the eu before holding an in - out referendum by 2017 mr john allan , who described his political leaning as being ' pretty close to the centre ' , was not among the more than 100 senior business leaders who signed an open letter last month praising the tory government and warning that labour could ' put the recovery at risk '
