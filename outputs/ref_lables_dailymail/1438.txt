miliband today rushed to scottish to try to shore up his hope of becoming prime minister as a damning poll showed almost half of scottish are ready to back the snp
but mr miliband has been rocked by a survey showing that in scottish , 49 per cent of people plan to vote for the snp , with just 25 per cent backing labour , robbing him of any possibility of an overall majority
