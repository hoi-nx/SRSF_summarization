james weld stumped up Â£ 15,000 to bring an end to a three year stand - off with natural england over who was responsible for the coastal path down to the beach at durdle door on dorset 's jurassic coast
the previous steps that lead down to the popular tourist attraction were washed away in storms in 2012
james weld has stumped up Â£ 15,000 to end a three - year stand - off with natural england over access to durdle door beach since then visitors have faced a perilous scramble down a crumbling cliff to reach the shore , even resorting to sliding down on their backsides
but in 2009 , natural england was handed responsibility for the country 's coastal paths under the coastal access act
however , mr james weld says that natural england ' shirked ' its duty to reinstate the steps under the law for three years by claiming they did not form part of the coastal path
the steps to access the iconic rock archway on the dorset jurassic coast had been washed away during storms in 2012 natural england said they were happy the steps had been reopened but declined to comment on mr james weld 's claims
the estate took the decision to rebuild the 88 steps themselves after becoming ' utterly fed - up with the bureaucracy ' , mr james weld said
in 2009 the coastal access act came along and we had lots of meetings with natural england about managing ' honeypot ' sites like lulworth
the washed - away steps meant visitors were left to scramble up and down the dangerous crumbling cliffs to try and access the beach the government body had been granted responsibility for the country 's coastal paths under the coastal access act 2009 ' you can understand the idiocy of this plan
our view was that if the coast path was now a public right of way under the coastal access act and controlled by natural england then natural england should pay for it
' we got to a stand - off with natural england - we wanted them to accept their responsibility while they were saying ' it 's nothing to do with us '
' the cost was about Â£ 15,000 - not a huge amount of money for a huge government body like natural england but a lot for us
mr james weld says natural england ' shirked ' its duty for three years by claiming they did not form part of the coastal path , leaving him to pay the Â£ 15,000 to rebuild the steps which have now been reopened ( pictured ) ' we have a very good relationship with natural england in all other areas but with coastal access they have ignored all the advice right from the beginning about managing honeypot sites
' the Â£ 15,000 will add to the Â£ 40,000 the lulworth estate currently spends each year maintaining paths on its land
a spokesman for natural england said : ' it 's good news that the durdle door beach steps have been reopened and that local visitors can have safe access to the beach to enjoy this wonderful stretch of the english coast
the weld estate owns around five miles of the jurassic coast , a unesco world heritage site , which includes durdle door and lulworth cove natural england said it was glad durdle door 's beach steps have been reopened but would not comment on the landowner 's claims it has remained in the weld family ever since
in 2013 natural natural england said claims made by lulworth estate owner james weld that the 2009 coastal access act handed them responsibility for the steps to durdle door were untrue
