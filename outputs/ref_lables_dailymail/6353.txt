auschwitz survivors and the relatives of those murdered there filed into court today for the trial of 93 - year - old groening - who may well have met their loved ones shortly before they were gassed
groening , known as ' the bookkeeper ' for his role in the camp in nazi - occupied poland , was tasked with meeting the trains bringing victims there and robbing those aboard of their possessions
between may 16 and july 11 , 1944 he was on duty when 450,000 jews were transported there , with 300,000 being gassed just after arrival
now those who lost loved ones have travelled thousands of miles to bear witness as co-plaintiffs against groening in what may prove to be the last nazi trial of its kind in germany
it was n't just big fish , it was people like groening
but they will not be able to deny the words of a single ss man who admits he was there
' groening , a sergeant in the dreaded ss , was in auschwitz as a guard for two and - a - half years , but prosecutors are charging him with complicity in the murders of 300,000 people who arrived on 137 trains during the 48 day period of that summer in 1944 because of his intact service records
auschwitz ( pictured ) survivors and the relatives of those murdered there filed into court today for the trial of 93 - year - old groening hedy bohm ( left ) and eva pusztai-fahidi ( right ) , survivors of the auschwitz concentration camp , take part in a news conference ahead of groening 's trial groening never denied being at auschwitz and has been haunted by it ever since
he once admitted : ' i never really left auschwitz - and it never left me
' but he denies a single instance of killing or cruelty - even though he witnessed plenty
such a defence worked in germany before 2011 and the trial of sobibor death camp guard demjanjuk , but no longer
demjanjuk was tried and convicted for being part of the machinery of mass murder at the camp where 250,000 jews were liquidated without a single shred of evidence linking him to a crime
there was no - one left alive to testify at his trial in munich for his role in the extermination of 28,000 dutch jews
no - one could say whether he slaughtered with his bare hands , but he was convicted , for the first time in history , simply because he was there - and that is why groening now has his appointment with justice
groening , who lives near the lueneburg heath - ironically the place where his boss , ss chief heinrich himmler , was buried in an unmarked grave after committing suicide when he fell into britain hands at the end of the war - lived a comfortable life after the war
he married , had two children and worked as a wages accountant in a glass factory after being released from a pow camp in britain
groening was in auschwitz as a guard for two and - a - half years , but prosecutors are charging him with complicity in the murders of 300,000 people over a two - month period in 1944 he spoke at trials after the war of the operations of the gas chambers and crematoria but denied any involvement
groening has said he volunteered for the ss in 1941 at age 20 , drawn by wartime fervour and ' the elegance of the uniform '
but he testified to his nightmares in interviews before he was charged
' it was in 1942 that my ss chiefs in berlin ordered me there
many jews knew they were going to die
' one time a drunken ss man discovered a crying baby on the platform
on one night in january 1943 i saw for the first time how the jews were actually gassed
loved ones ( pictured being interviewed before the trial ) have travelled thousands of miles to bear witness as co-plaintiffs against groening between may 16 and july 11 , 1944 he was on duty when 450,000 jews were transported there , with 300,000 being gassed just after arrival
pictured , auschwitz survivors ' there were more than 100 prisoners and soon there were panic - filled cries as they were herded into the chamber and the door was shut
' kurt schrimm , who heads germany 's sole nazi hunting agency , prepared the case against groening
three more are pending against former auschwitz personnel but age and infirmity seem likely to derail those proceedings before they begin
judith kalman , 61 , also from toronto , has travelled to represent her sister evike , who was six when she was gassed upon arrival at auschwitz during one of those days that groening was on duty
what could have become of this talented , gifted child ? ' i do n't feel resentement or hatred when i think of groening
