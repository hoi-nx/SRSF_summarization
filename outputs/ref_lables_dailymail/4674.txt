toure ( left ) was one of four players in the manchester derby who chose to wear gloves at old trafford after another below - par game toure was described by neville as a ' weed ' in city 's garden glove - wearing sergio aguero opened the scoring on derby day it was a far from blossoming performance for the visitors as well , and like autumn leaves city fell embarrassingly to their local rivals
