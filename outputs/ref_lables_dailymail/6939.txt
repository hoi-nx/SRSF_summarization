pregnant women who suffer extreme morning sickness are at greater risk of their children having language and speech delays , and attention disorders , warn researchers
a new study shows the condition suffered by the duchess of cambridge during both her pregnancies triples the risk of developmental problems compared with women who have normal nausea and vomiting
about 10,000 women a year in the uk are affected by the debilitating hyperemesis gravidarum ( hg ) - a severe form of morning sickness which causes constant vomiting , crippling weakness and dehydration
fejzo , an associate researcher in the david geffen school of medicine at ucla , said the link appeared to be due to lack of nutrition in early pregnancy â especially in the first five weeks â rather than medication
she said : â these findings show that it is vital to take hg seriously so these pregnant women can get nutritional support right away
â an encouraging finding is that we did not find any association with medications to treat this disorder and neurodevelopmental delays , so i speculate that the neurodevelopmental outcomes are more likely caused by nutrient deficiency early in pregnancy rather than medication
the condition hyperemesis gravidarum ( hg ) â which the duchess of cambridge has suffered during both her pregnancies â affects about one in 100 expectant mothers a year
the women in the study experienced nausea and vomiting so severe that they lost at least five pounds and became so dehydrated they needed intravenous fluids
earlier research by dr fejzo âs team found hg was associated with a 3.6-fold increased risk of behavioural or emotional disorders in adults
