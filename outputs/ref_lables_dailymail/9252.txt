red ed lurched further to the left yesterday with a land grab to extend state control over the property market
property analysts said the move would take uk back to the ' dark days of the seventies '
sites still left idle could be compulsorily purchased for use by another developer
' pointing the way : mr red ed wants to bring in ' use it or lose it ' powers for councils andrew percy , tory candidate for brigg and goole , said : ' it is the sort of policy you might expect from soviet russia
' we should encourage developers to use this land , but threatening to steal people 's land is using a stick rather than a carrot
' mr red ed 's plan to link rents to inflation under new , three - year contracts came under fire too
' labour 's plans would take use back to the dark days of the seventies and the eighties which caused a shortage of decent homes to rent , ' he added
' in it together : mr red ed said the pledge to cut stamp duty to zero over the next three years would benefit nine out of ten people buying their first home richard lambert , of the national landlords association , said labour 's package would make owners less likely to risk their money in providing homes while banks would be deterred from advancing loans
in his policy package , mr red ed also said he wanted to ' restore the dream of home ownership ' by giving first - time buyers a stamp duty holiday on homes up to Â£ 300,000 in value
mr red ed 's housing announcements are an attempt to regain the initiative after the tories unveiled a popular policy two weeks ago to extend the right to buy to all tenants of housing associations
chancellor george osborne dismissed mr red ed 's stamp duty pledge as a ' complete gimmick '
naomi heaton , of london central portfolio , an asset management company , said mr red ed 's housing policy was ' a load of old cobblers '
' mr red ed dismissed the backlash , saying : ' our proposals will be better for home owners in uk and for companies building homes in uk
' mr red ed added : ' we wo n't let those large developers just hoard land â waiting for it to go up in value when it could be used to build homes
