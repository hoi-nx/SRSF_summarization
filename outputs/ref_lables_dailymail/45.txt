the study has also raised the prospect of bringing the giant mammal back to life using cloning techniques with modern elephants
researchers studied the structure of dna from mammoths preserved in the arctic to reproduce exact copies of 14 of the extinct animal âs genes
they have published full dna sequences of one mammoth found in oimyakon , northeast siberia â thought to be around 45,000 years old â and another from one of the last surviving mammoths found on wrangel island , north of russia in the arctic ocean
they found that the mammoths on wrangel island had been isolated for at least 5,000 years , eking out a meager existence there before dying out 4,500 years ago
analysis showed that the parents of the mammoth found on wrangel island had been distant relatives , suggesting the population had been inbreeding
â this is likely due to the small number of mammoths that managed to survive on wrangel island during the last 5,000 years of the species â existence
â the researchers , whose work is published in the journal cell biology , found that the mammoth genome only appeared to align with african elephant dna by between 64 per cent and 76 per cent
researchers extracted dna from the remains of two woolly mammoths who died 36,000 years apart scientists have been able to extract dna from mammoth hair ( above ) and tusks found across siberia mammoths are thought to have evolved around 400,000 years ago in eastern asian and is a close relative to the asian elephant
the researchers analysis revealed that mammoths appear to have suffered significant setbacks around 250,000 to 300,000 years ago where their population was decimated
however , they then recovered before they experienced a further hit to their populations around 116,000 to 130,000 years ago
the researchers believe the mammoths in oimyakon and wrangel island separated around 50,000 years
the researchers studied mammoth remains found at oimyakon in siberia and wrangel island ( shown above ) this mammoth tusk on wrangel island in russia belonged to one of the last mammoths before they died out the new results suggest the animals were already in decline by the time humans began moving into europe 45,000 years ago
