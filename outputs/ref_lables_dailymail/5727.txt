a wisconsin judge denied a request friday to move a 12 - year - old girl , accused of stabbing a classmate to please the horror character slender man , to a psychiatric treatment center
geyser , along with her friend anissa weier , 13 , are being tried as adults for attempted first - degree intentional homicide in the attack on leutner , who survived 19 stab wounds in waukesha in may 2014
geyser 's attorney , cotton , applied to have her $ 500,000 bail reduced so that she could get out of jail and seek treatment for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
however the waukesha circuit judge said geyser was a flight risk , and even though she is young , she was capable of plotting a sophisticated plan to murder someone
her lawyer 's motion to have the bail reduced so that she could move to a mental hospital was denied friday charged : geyser is seen here in a wisconsin court room in june 2014 as she was arraigned for the attempted murder of leutner
geyser 's attorney 's now say she is schizophrenic cotton said his client has no way to get anywhere and that any allegations of violence have been limited to the stabbing and are connected to her mental illness
' she 's not any sort of flight risk
' the judge did , however , say that geyser 's long term placement in an appropriate facility should be considered , but no hearing or action was set for that
eerie this is one of geyser 's sketches
the frightening picture is of a girl , who appears to be cat - like and armed with a scythe , standing over a dead girl while saying ' i love killing people ' satanic symbols : geyser 's dolls , displayed in court in waukesha in february , were marked with cuts and had slender man and satanic symbols on them strange embrace : the slender man character is known for stalking and abducting children and became popular after fans of the creation did their own drawings of him state of mind : this sketch will be used by the defense to claim that their client was and is mentally unfit and should stand trial as an adult for murder wisconsin law requires anyone accused of certain serious crimes to be charged as adults if they are 10 or older
according to a criminal complaint , the girls plotted for months before they lured leutner , their former friend , into some woods after a sleepover in may 2014 and attacked her
they told investigators they hoped it would please slender man , a fictional online ghoul they had read about in horror stories
but if tried in juvenile court , they would not be held past age 25 victim : peyton leutner was able to drag herself out from the woods where she was stabbed 19 times and has since recovered
emergency responders said it was a miracle she survived decision : circuit judge michael bohren ruled friday that geyser is a flight risk and should remain in jail along with the sketches , the court was also presented with the mutilated body of one of geyser 's barbie dolls , which had its hair and limbs cut and what appeared to be satanic markings drawn onto the torso
the two girls ' attorneys have never denied they attacked and stabbed leutner , but claim they were so disturbed they truly believed the slender man - a popular online urban myth - would kill their own families in three seconds if they did not do his bidding
psychologist deborah collins testified that she has interviewed the geyser several times and concluded she honestly believes slender man exists
mentally ill : a court - appointed psychologist testified in august that geyser , who told police she stabbed the victim more than a dozen times , heard voices and believed she could communicate with slender man and other fictional characters , especially ones from harry potter in december , anissa weier was cleared for trial
they are accused of luring her to a park in the milwaukee suburb of waukesha on may 31 and stabbing her 19 times
