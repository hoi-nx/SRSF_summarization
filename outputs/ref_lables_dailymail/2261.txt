a cat has laid a claim to having the loudest purr in the world because she makes noises as loud as a tube train
12 - year - old bluey has a growl which is louder than most cats can miaow , and has reached a maximum of 93 decibels - more than the official world record holder
measurement : the loud cat has been clocked at more than 90 decibels using a sound meter app homeless : bluey is looking for a new owner and is currently living at a centre in cambridge her purr , which is almost four time louder than the average cat , has been keeping other animals awake at night
' the noisy cat is well above the official world record holder smokey , who was recorded at 67.7 decibels in march 2011 , but her purr has not yet been officially certified
contender : bluey must now register with guinness if she is to win the official world record a spokesman for guinness world records said : ' we 're intrigued by bluey 's talent and we would welcome an application from his owners so we can look into their claim
' however , bluey 's new owner may have to take precautions , as scientists say noise levels over 90 decibels can cause hearing loss over a prolonged period .
