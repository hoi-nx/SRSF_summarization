but just as tea originates in india or china , fish and chips is partly portuguese and partly belgian
one hundred and fifty years ago , in 1860 , on the streets of the east end of london , 13 - year - old jewish boy called joseph had the bright idea of combining fried fish with chips
to increase the family income they had begun frying chips in a downstairs room of their house
it was joseph 's idea to combine the chips - at that point a novelty in london - with fish from a nearby fried fish shop
fried fish already had a long history in london
in a letter written at the end of the 18th century , future americans president thomas jefferson described eating ' fried fish in the jewish fashion ' on a visit to the capital
battered fried fish had first arrived in london 200 years earlier with jewish refugees from portuguese and spain
they brought with them a way of cooking fish that would eventually become as british as sherlock holmes
in 1846 , a jewish cookbook published in london included a recipe for fried fish
the seal of respectability came when victorian cook eliza acton , the forerunner of mrs beeton , suggested eating fried fish with vinegar to sweeten the taste
no one knows exactly how and where chips first originated

and so was born the tea bag
after complaints that the mesh on the silk was too fine , mr sullivan developed sachets made of gauze - a method which was instrumental in today 's tea bag design
but it was not until 1953 , when british tea producer tetley spotted the commercial potential of the bag , that it began to take off here
