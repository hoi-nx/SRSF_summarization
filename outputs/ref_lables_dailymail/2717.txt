the mystery of what appears to be a screw fixed inside a rock has perplexed scientists an object that appears to be a screw fixed inside a rock has captured the world 's attention since it was found in the 1990s , but the debate rages on about what it really is
russia researchers believe the unusual object is 300 million years old , leading some people to claim that it may be proof of a highly advanced lost human civilisation , or even the work of aliens
however , experts suggest that there may be a more earthly answer â that the â screw â is in fact a fossilised sea creature
the researchers stumbled across the â screw â after searching the kaluga region after an asteroid strike occurred there , ancient code reported
the â screw â measures an inch ( 2cm ) long and was collected by a ufo and paranormal research team called the kosmopoisk group
they claim that the stone is between 300 and 320 million years old and after x-raying it , believe there is another hidden â screw â inside the stone
fossils of jurassic crinoids collected in israel are pictured the leading hypothesis from experts who have seen photos of the stone is that the â screw ' is actually the remains of an ancient sea creature called a crinoid
some 600 species of crinoid are now extinct but the creatures live on in different forms in modern seas
russia researchers have dated the unusual ' screw ' to 300 million years old , leading some people to claim that it may be proof of a highly advanced lost human civilisation , or even the work of aliens ( stock image ) researchers stumbled across the â screw â after searching the kaluga region after an asteroid strike occurred there
the â screw â measures an inch ( 2cm ) long and was collected by a ufo and paranormal research team called the kosmopoisk group there are hundreds of species of extinct crinoid , although the marine animal continues to live in seas today
the first crinoid are thought to have appeared in the ordovician period , between 488 million years ago and ending 444 million years ago and underwent a selective mass extinction at the end of the permian period , where they evolved more flexible arms
more far - fetched theories include that the ' screw ' is the remains of an ancient form of technology that proves aliens lived on earth millions of years ago , or that our ancestors were far more advanced than we think
â the leading hypothesis is that the â screw ; is actually the remains of an ancient sea creature called a crinoid
it had a thick stem that attached it to the sea bed , which looks a bit like a screw when it 's fossilised ( pictured ) some 600 species of crinoid are now extinct but the creatures live on in new forms in our seas today
the alien that terrified people in the 1979 sci - fi film , alien ( pictured ) was inspired by a crinoid he was inspired by a 300 - million - year - old crinoid fossil , which was stolen in 2012
' it really is a remarkable fossil and shows two separate species of a spineless animal that lived at the bottom of the sea around 300 million years ago
