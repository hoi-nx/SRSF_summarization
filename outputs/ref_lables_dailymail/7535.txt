as renting in the capital soared to an average of more than Â£ 1,100 per month , the second year history and politics student who attends a london university told how she took up sex work â even visiting some clients at their workplace
speaking through the english collective of prostitutes ' , the woman â who asked to remain anonymous â spoke after a research project revealed more than a fifth of students have thought about being involved in the sex industry
a university student has revealed how she turned to sex work after her student loan failed to cover her rent ( picture posed by model ) the survey conducted by the university of swansea further revealed that nearly five per cent of them had actually worked in the sex industry
' the student loan did n't cover even my housing , let alone living expenses , food , books and travel costs
' i 'd just moved to london from the north of england
the student says that traditional means of earning failed to cover the cost of living in london ' i did n't know anyone in london so when i moved here it was starting from scratch
' despite sex work not being an ideal situation the student says that it had been beneficial towards her studies
' the woman heard about sex work from other students who had also been looking for a way to earn extra money
' in my first year at university i started hearing about students turning to sex work , ' she said
although her new means of earning have enabled her to continue studying in london the woman says she does not particularly enjoy her work
' sex work is far batter paid and suits my time more than any other work i know of
' sometimes they get none at all so it is very hard to budget and pay bills
' mostly students doing sex work do n't talk about it
' the student 's story may seem like a rare case but she says that it is become more regular practice in universities : ' since i started escorting i 've heard that a former roommate exchanged sex with her landlord to cover the rent
' sex work among students is much more common than people think , and it is likely to increase as long as fees , rent and the cost of living is so high
