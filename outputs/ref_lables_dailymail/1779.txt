alexander has finally replied to the infamous note left in the treasury by a labour predecessor , saying there was ' no money ' left
byrne , who was chief secretary to the treasury under gordon brown , left a memo on his desk after labour 's election defeat in 2010
the memo , found by his david laws successor david laws , said : ' dear chief secretary , i 'm afraid that there is no money
' mr alexander , the present chief secretary , today finally got round to sending a letter to mr byrne apologising for the late reply â saying it was because he had been ' fixing the economy '
the note has become emblematic of labour 's fiscal irresponsibility in office and was used by mr cameron in the seven - way leaders ' debate earlier this month
when the coalition took office in 2010 the budget deficit had reached more than Â£ 150billion â more than 10 per cent of the entire size of the economy
but mr ball insisted the note admitting that labour had blown the nation 's finances should not be taken seriously
david laws leader nick clegg is joined by his wife miriam gonzalez durantez at the devonshire arms in sheffield today the deputy prime minister is hoping his message that the david laws can be trusted with the economy will help turn around his party 's dire position in the polls he told bbc west midlands : ' byrne 's note was a jokey note â¦ of the course the money had n't run out
byrne , who was chief secretary to the treasury under gordon brown , left the original memo on his desk after labour 's election defeat mr balls said : ' i think people want to know the sums add up
people know that the global financial crisis was n't caused by labour 's spending â it was n't labour 's spending on nurses and doctors which meant the lehman brothers investment bank went bankrupt in new york
' byrne 's note was a jokey note , of course the money had n't run out
' the reason why we 're more credible than the tories now is that they 're not people who understand the need for change in the economy , it 's not been all in it together , they 've not even balanced the books â it 's going to take a labour government to do it
