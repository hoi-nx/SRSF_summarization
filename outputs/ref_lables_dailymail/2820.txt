the country âs biggest food bank organisation yesterday claimed the number of people claiming free meal packages from its branches passed a million last year
the figures from the trussell trust were seized on by labour and the trade union congress as â shocking â evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay , the so - called bedroom tax , and stopped benefits
the row comes amid growing controversy over the spread of food banks â said by supporters to show that hunger is commonplace and need overwhelming , and by critics to show that when free food is handed out , people will always come forward to take it
yesterday âs report from the trussell trust put the number of people who were given three days â worth of food at one of its 445 branches in the past financial year at 1,084,604
â the latest figures show a slowdown in the numbers visiting food banks , with a rise of under 100,000 in numbers recorded since 2013 - 14 , when there were 913,138 food bank visits
duncan smith , pictured , dismissed the suggestion claims suggesting that the trussell trust 's figures are ' unverified ' this figure was almost three times the 2012 - 13 level of 346,992
in 2009 - 10 the trussell trust recorded 40,898 food bank visits
the claims have been disputed because the trussell trust counts numbers of food bank visits in which people are given three - day food packages , and not numbers of individuals
this means an unknown number make repeat visits , and some analysts say the real total of people who went to food banks may be closer to half a million
research carried out by the trussell trust , oxfam , the church of england and other charities last year also found that low pay is only a minor reason for people going to get aide from food banks
labour âs work and pensions spokesman rachel reeves said : â the shocking rise in the number of people relying on trussell trust food banks since 2010 shows the tory plan is failing
â oxfam poverty chief rachael orr said : â it is extremely worrying to see yet another rise in the number of people being forced to visit food banks in the britain
â the ofb , which is independent of the trussell trust network , urged caution in the interpretation of food bank figures
