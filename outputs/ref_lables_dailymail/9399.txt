malcolm brabant spent two years in and out of mental institutions after a yellow fever vaccine when award - winning bbc foreign correspondent malcolm brabant walked into a clinic one afternoon to have a yellow fever vaccine , he was warned the possible side - effects could be dizzy spells and a headache
yet within 24 hours of having the jab , in april 2011 , malcolm brabant had been reduced to a sweating , shivering wreck , gripped by a fever so strong it took two weeks and a spell in hospital before his temperature was brought down
a shooting star , glimpsed from the balcony of his home , convinced malcolm brabant - who had no previous history of mental illness - that he was a modern - day messiah
' i went completely bonkers , ' he says today
' malcolm brabant , 59 , who had the jab in preparation for an assignment in the ivory coast , believed his kindle could fly , that dead friends were contacting him and that he could stop traffic just by thinking about it
he spent the next two years in and out of mental institutions , unable to work - and even attempted suicide
fortunately , he has since made a full recovery
but malcolm brabant believes the yellow fever vaccine - available in high street vaccination clinics , gp surgeries and even boots - could have dangerous side - effects that affect more people than previously thought
yellow fever is a serious viral infection spread by mosquito bites
but malcolm brabant and others who say they have been adversely affected by the jab want the manufacturer to investigate
malcolm brabant , who for many years was the bbc 's man in greece , had the jab in a clinic in athens , where his family was living
next morning , his new wife trine , found him downstairs , shivering and sweating , his face beetroot red
' when his fever showed no signs of relenting after five days , trine took malcolm brabant to hospital
the doctors , who also discovered through blood tests that malcolm brabant had suffered recent liver damage , told him they believed he 'd had an adverse reaction to the vaccine
he believes the yellow fever vaccine could have dangerous side - effects they managed to lower his temperature
formerly agnostic , malcolm brabant became convinced he was jesus , and two weeks after being admitted to hospital he was moved to a mental hospital and given anti-psychotic medication
' after three weeks , malcolm brabant was discharged in may 2011 , and seemed to be recovering , so went back to work
malcolm brabant developed full - blown psychosis , and over the following months moved between psychiatric hospitals in different countries - in the uk , greece , and eventually with money running out , in trine 's native copenhagen
happily , malcolm brabant was well enough to be discharged from hospital in july 2012 and has since made a full recovery
the nhs says that up to three in ten people who are immunised with the yellow fever vaccine suffer a mild headache , muscle aches , mild fever or soreness at the injection site - and that these symptoms occur because your immune system is trying to fight the small dose of yellow fever you have been injected with
it 's thought that far fewer people , four in a million , suffer more serious psychotic or neurological reactions , mainly unconnected to the symptoms of yellow fever itself
' graham always mentioned to specialists that his symptoms seemed to have begun after he had the yellow fever jab and , consequently , he has been advised by medical professionals it 's likely that a vaccine caused the problem
as long ago as 2005 , dr thomas monath , a former harvard public health professor and world expert on yellow fever , confirmed that the vaccine can cause ' really severe and significant adverse events '
he told good health : ' while we should not overlook the 60 years of wide use of yellow fever vaccine , with a remarkable record of safety and effective prevention of this terrible disease , rare and unusual adverse events temporally associated with vaccination may occur
a spokesman told good health that the company takes reports of adverse events ' very seriously ' and ensures they are investigated promptly , but ' after carefully examining all the medical information that has been disclosed to us up to april 2013 , we have been unable to establish any evidence for a causal relationship between the administration of the yellow fever vaccine stamaril and mr malcolm brabant 's reported medical condition
' malcolm brabant , who has written a book , malcolm is a little unwell , wo n't be satisfied until the experiences of people like him are acknowledged in official literature about the vaccine and he has been offered compensation
' the vaccine almost destroyed me , ' malcolm brabant says
