as this image gets larger , what do you see ? most people will pick out a phantom - like picture of einstein
at normal viewing distance , healthy eyes should be able to pick up the fine lines on einstein 's face , causing the brain to disregard marilyn monroe 's image altogether
features with a high spatial frequency ( einstein ) are only visible when you 're viewing them close up , and those with low spatial frequencies ( marilyn monroe ) are only visible from further away
combining pictures of the two produces a single image which changes when the viewer moves closer or farther away from the screen
in a recent video , asapscience highlighted the process behind the trick , which can also be seen in a still image by anyone if they move closer and then farther away from the screen
â depending on how well you âre able to focus or pick up contrast your eye will only pick out details , â the video explains
â but as the distance increases , or if your vision is poor and creates a more blurred image in the first place , your ability to pick up details fades away
when you look at the image above , whose face do you see ? at normal screen viewing distance you should see the face of einstein
squint your eyes or take a few steps back from the image and marilyn monroe should come into view ' marilyn einstein ' was created by superimposing a blurry picture of marilyn monroe over a picture of einstein drawn in fine lines
features with a high spatial frequency are only visible when viewing them close up , and those with low spatial frequencies are only visible at a distance
if you squint , blink or defocus , the angry man turns calm , and the calm woman turns angry , and male at normal viewing distance , you may see a dolphin
at a distance , all that will be seen are two normal portraits hybrid images can create textures with viewing distance
