' conservative chief whip gove admitted the tories could cut child benefit or stop millions of families receiving it mr gove said the tories would not cut benefits for the disabled or pensioners â but refused to rule out cuts to child benefit
' mr gove was asked specifically : ' there will be no more changes to child benefit
' rachel reeves , labour 's shadow work and pensions secretary , said : ' gove 's repeated refusal to rule out child benefit cuts will only add to fears that the tories have a secret plan to cut support to children
' the revelation comes after george osborne last month refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the conservatives win a second term
asked on the bbc 's newsnight if he could confirm there will be ' no more changes to child benefit ' , mr gove said : ' no i ca n't say that ' mr gove 's remarks came after george osborne last month refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the conservatives win a second term more than a million households lost out when the coalition announced that families with one parent earning Â£ 50,000 would pay tax on child benefit
mr george osborne was asked at a briefing in central london on the economy this morning whether he could ' rule out depriving more people of child benefit , like you 've already done in this parliament ? ' but the chancellor appeared to leave the door open to further cuts when asked if he would be ' depriving more families ' of the payments which are worth more than Â£ 1,000 per year
mr george osborne did not directly answer about reducing the threshold , only saying that child benefit would not be replaced by the new benefits system universal credit , which is being rolled out nationally
the respected think tank the institute for fiscal studies have suggested that increasing universal credit for some families and using it instead of child benefit could save Â£ 4.8billion a year
if we wanted to put child benefit into universal credit we would have done it when we set up universal credit
