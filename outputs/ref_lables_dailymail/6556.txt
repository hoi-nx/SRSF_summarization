as the anniversary of their daughter 's suicide approaches , michael and jane cleland have spoken of their battle to have the two teenage boys , who they say bullied their daughter to death , held accountable for their actions under cyber bullying laws
jessica cleland , from wallan , victorian , was 19 when she took her own life on easter saturday last year , after receiving facebook messages from two teenage boys she considered friends saying that they hated her , and that she was a ' f * * * ing sook '
her parents said that jessica cleland 's social media accounts were flooded with horrible sentiments the night before she died , and are now desperate to see a change within victorian âs government and the state 's police so that those found guilty of cyber bullying face serious consequences
the parents of jessica cleland ( pictured ) are campaigning for anti-bullying laws to be taken more seriously ' what we would like to see happen is that if someone is cyber bullying somebody and they cause something like this , then they should be held Â­ accountable for it , ' said jessica cleland 's father michael
jessica cleland ( pictured right , with her sister amy , left ) committed suicide after she was bullied over facebook following the release of the coroners report , the cleland 's are now campaigning to see cyber bullying taken more seriously in victorian and around australia
victorian already has anti-bullying legislation known as brodie 's law , which was introduced in 2011 after the death of brodie panlock , who committed suicide after being subject to relentless bullying in her workplace
the crime is punishable by ten years in jail , and applies to cyber bullying as well as physical , verbal and psychological bullying
' it seems there is a law in victorian that criminalises cyber bullying , but it does n't get enforced because of the police paperwork ... cyber bullying is a silent killer of too many of our young ones , ' she wrote
