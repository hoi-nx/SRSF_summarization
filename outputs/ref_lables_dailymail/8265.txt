miliband âs son has inadvertently waded into the row about the labour âs kitchen as he declared it â the best â in his house
the unwitting admission from five - year - old daniel , to be broadcast tonight , came as mr miliband yet again wheeled out his children for the cameras
and it led to accusations that mr miliband lives an â upstairs , downstairs â lifestyle last night as he was forced to admit that he needs two kitchens because the family nanny lives in the basement of his north london â mansion â
â daniel , miliband 's eldest son , tells the camera the spartan kitchen â that last month sparked such controversy for mr miliband â is the â best â in the Â£ 2.7million home in a personal interview with itv âs tonight programme , mr miliband also brushes aside controversy about embarrassing pictures last year of him struggling to eat a bacon sandwich
â mr miliband âs kitchen hit the headlines last month when he was filmed in it by the bbc
in the personal interview , mr miliband also brushes aside controversy about embarrassing pictures last year of him struggling to eat a bacon sandwich ( pictured ) critics questioned whether the small , utilitarian room could really be the main kitchen in a large north london home that will qualify as a â mansion â for the purposes of labour âs proposed mansion tax
times columnist and miliband family friend jenni russell then intervened to say that the home âs real kitchen is â lovely â
mr miliband âs decision to again make prominent use of his sons daniel and samuel , four , to bolster his image is also likely to raise eyebrows
