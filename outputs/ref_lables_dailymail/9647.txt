steve peters , the sports psychiatrist called on by a number of top stars , will play a key role in keeping troubled england batsman jonathan trott focused in the caribbean
jonathan trott has made a nightmare return to the test side 18 months since situational anxieties saw him quit the ashes tour â falling cheaply in both innings in the first test in antigua and finding his â on the move â batting technique under strong scrutiny
it is understood that jonathan trott is having regular skype sessions with steve peters from the team hotel , and he credits the psychiatrist with helping him overcome his mental health issues to win his test place back
jonathan trott has endured a nightmare return to test with some poor performances in the first test but the double failure will be a big challenge for jonathan trott , with steve peters âs assistance , to continue â to keep a proper prospective on life and cricket â which he said he was doing before the test , rather than having â unrealistic expectations about his batting , â which he had in australia
steve peters , whose other clients include the england football team , liverpool , british cycling and snooker âs ronnie oâsullivan , will no doubt be telling jonathan trott to manage his inner chimp â the part of the brain that runs on emotions and gut instincts in contrast to the rational , evidence - based part
