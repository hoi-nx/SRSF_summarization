but a team of experts at brandeis university in massachusetts have a few words of wisdom , urging students to put down the coffee and sleep
they believe the memory neurons that are responsible for converting short - term memories into long - term ones , work most effectively when a person is asleep
scientists have long known that sleep , memory and learning are deeply connected
and studies have shown that sleep is critical in converting short - term memories , into long - term memory , a process known as memory consolidation
a team of scientists at brandeis university in massachusetts believe all - nighters to cram before an exam wo n't work because the process converting short - term memory to long - term memory is best carried out when a person is asleep but just how that process works has remained a mystery
in other words , is memory consolidated during sleep because the brain is quiet , allowing memory neurons to go to work , or are memory neurons actually putting us to sleep ? graduate students , haynes and christmann , at the university 's griffith lab , believe the answer is the latter
they focused their research on dorsal paired medial neurons , well - known memory consolidators in fruit flies
these memory consolidators cause the flies to fall asleep , as they begin to convert short - term memory to long - term memory
