the tories will tomorrow inflame the row over a potential labour - snp power - sharing deal by unveiling the party âs first â manifesto for england â
the prime minister and the outgoing leader of the commons william hague will launch the english document , which follows traditional scottish , welsh and northern irish manifestos
its centrepiece will be a pledge to introduce a system of â english votes for english laws â â giving english mps an effective veto over legislation applying only to their constituents
inflammatory : prime minister david cameron ( left ) will be joined by hague ( right ) as they launch the english manifesto - with the latter expected to warn england risks being ' held to ransom ' by snp mr hague is expected to warn that england risks being â held to ransom â by scottish nationalists unless labour agrees to implement such a reform
the manifesto is also expected to commit the tories to dozens of new road schemes in england and an extension of the cancer drugs fund , which pays for expensive cancer treatments on the english nhs
the document will be seen as an attempt by the tories to tap into growing english nationalism
why should nât there be one for england ? â the â english votes â plan would seek to resolve a longstanding constitutional question which will become more urgent than ever once the scottish parliament is handed yet more powers
mr hague wants to strip scottish mps of the power to impose tax changes , education and health reforms on england , given holyrood will soon control all these issues in scottish
the reform would make it impossible for any future labour government to press ahead with its plans to raise the top rate of tax to 50p in england without winning the support of a majority of english mps
tensions : the manifesto is expected to inflame tensions between the tories and nationalist parties like nicola sturgeon 's snp and plaid cymru , led by leanne wood it could also make it difficult for a scottish mp to again hold the office of chancellor or prime minister , given they would be unable to vote on some of their own government âs legislation
