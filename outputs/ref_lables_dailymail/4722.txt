brontosaurus has made a thundering comeback after being sent into exile by the scientific community
pictured is a brontosaurus as researchers see it today -- with a diplodocus - like head the researchers looked at 477 anatomical features across 81 individual dinosaurs found in museums throughout europe and us
this meant they could analyse each individual animal , despite its species , and allowed them to look at differences within each species , as well as between different species
but fossils that were originally labelled brontosaurus appeared different from two brontosaurus species
most of the differences were in tiny anatomical features , but one distinctive trait was that brontosaurus has a wider neck than brontosaurus
instead of belonging to the genus , or species ' family ' brontosaurus , they said it should in fact have been classified as ' brontosaurus '
now new research has shown that it is , after all , sufficiently different from brontosaurus to deserve its own genus name
scientists from the uk and portugal submitted the evidence for resurrecting brontosaurus in a study almost 300 pages long published in the open access journal peerj
' the differences we found between brontosaurus and brontosaurus were at least as numerous as the ones between other closely related genera , and much more than what you normally find between species , ' said dr roger benson , one of the authors from oxford university
the researchers used statistical techniques to calculate the differences between species and genera of ' diplodocid ' dinosaurs - a group that included some of the longest animals that ever walked on the earth
this meant they could analyse each individual animal , despite its species , and allowed them to look at differences within each species , as well as between different species
the main shape of the tree supported what other paleontologists had previously proposed , but fossils that were originally labelled brontosaurus appeared different from two brontosaurus species

' in 1877 , marsh âs crew uncovered the bones of a species he dubbed brontosaurus
two years later , he found another giant dinosaur and named it brontosaurus ( pictured ) tschopp ( left ) and mateus examine a galeamopus skull , a genus of diplodocid dinosaurs , as part of the study the complex history of the the brontosaurus has its roots in the â bone wars â of nineteenth - century
in 1877 , marsh âs crew uncovered the bones of a species he dubbed brontosaurus
shortly after marsh 's death , scientists from the field museum of chicago found another skeleton similar both to brontosaurus and brontosaurus
in fact they were so similar that experts decided it would be correct to treat them as two species from the same genus : brontosaurus
but the researchers argue the to resurrect brontosaurus was not a matter of personal preference ' we tried to be as objective as possible whenever making a decision which would differentiate between species and genus , ' said professor tschopp
