the celtic manager stressed he still had a positive view of officiating in this country despite the meekings handball debacle that helped kill his treble dream last weekend
but deila has called for similar transparency as in his norway homeland , arguing that referees facing the media would help quell long - running furores and improve relationships
celtic manager deila speaks to the officials after his side 's scottish cup semi-final loss to inverness celtic wrote to the sfa in the aftermath of last weekend 's defeat to inverness , seeking ' to understand ' how steven mclean and his assistants failed to act on the meekings incident
' if it 's good , it 's good
if it 's bad , it 's bad , but i have to stand up to it
' i ca n't understand what the problem is with the referees doing it as well
' what could you say after that ? ' it 's not important for me to speak with the referee
inverness defender meekings will be allowed to appear in scottish cup final after his ban was dismissed ' we will do the same , but just to be open and honest gets you much more respect
' if they shut themselves away , you do n't get answers and that 's why we are writing a letter to them just asking what happened
what 's the problem ? more and more in norway , the referees go to speak to the media after the match
' speaking in december , deila said that scottish referees had been ' fantastic ' since he came to celtic and that he had encountered more problems in europe matches
meekings was not sent off and no penalty was given as inverness went on to beat celtic 3 - 2 after extra-time ' i have n't changed my mind , ' he insisted
' it 's just afterwards there are a lot of things
so many meetings , appeals , i ca n't understand that system
