ipswich manager mccarthy was feeling less vibrant than his team 's bright orange strip after they blew a chance to climb into the play - off places
the ipswich , who have now lost four of their last five away games , were caught cold by goals in the opening 30 minutes by huddersfield strike pair wells and james vaughan
mccarthy responded by making two changes at half - time and was rewarded when luke varney reduced arrears earlier in the second period

wells capitalised on loose play from zeki fryers and curled a left - footer into the corner for his 13th goal of the season
luke varney ( centre left ) heads home early in the second half but it was n't enough for mccarthy 's men after ipswich 's 23 - goal top scorer daryl murphy had seen an effort cleared off the line , the home side extended their lead after half - an - hour when james vaughan rose well to head in jacob butterfield 's cross at the far post
luke varney headed a goal back after 48 minutes but huddersfield deservedly held out to leave manager chris powell declaring : ' we deserved it
