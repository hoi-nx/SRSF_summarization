vergara allegedly insisted her 44 - year - old assistant be the surrogate for her and then fiancÃ© loeb
the revelation comes just after reports that the former couple are embroiled in a legal fight over her frozen eggs , which they planned to have children with before their bitter split
according to a thursday report by page six , loeb claimed that vergara demanded her friend and employee serve as the surrogate over his ' objections as well as the recommendations of the parties â doctor '
' on wednesday it was reported loeb has filed a lawsuit in california in a bid to prevent the modern family actress from destroying two cryopreserved female embryos created through ivf , according to intouch
legal fight : a magazine claims loeb has filed a lawsuit against his ex-fiancee sofia in a bid to prevent her from destroying two cryopreserved female embryos created through ivf , pictured here in 2011 vergara âs representatives declined to comment on the allegations when contacted by dailymail.com on wednesday
court documents , filed under pseudonyms jane and john , detail how the couple fertilized embryos using her eggs and his sperm six months before their split in november 2013
elsewhere in the lawsuit , it is claimed 42 - year - old actress vergara - who got engaged to true blood hunk joe manganiello on christmas day after six months of dating - was ' physically and mentally abusive ' to loeb
wrangle : the lawsuit has been filed under the pseudonyms john and jane doe no directive : ultimately , the outcome will be at the discretion of a judge , but it would be unlikely that loeb would be able to use the embryos without sofia 's consent , according to a legal expert who spoke to intouch the documents state : ' she punched him in the face on two occasions , kicked him , and threw her phone at his head
' in april 2013 , vergara - who has a 23 - year - old son manolo from her first marriage - spoke publicly about having frozen her eggs and her desire to have more children
complicated matter : in this page of the document it states sofia and loeb were planning on using a gestational surrogate in 2012 to start a family and that sofia had insisted on using a 44 - year - old friend and emloyee arduous process : after the first two embryos failed to implant in the first surrogate the couple looked for another suitable candidate getting ugly : page five of the document further details sofia and loeb 's disagreements over the usage and disposal of the embryos and also alleges sofia was physically , emotionally and mentally abusive to him intouch has previously claimed that now vergara and 38 - year - old joe manganiello have found a surrogate and plan to have children of their own
moving on : the modern family actress is now engaged to joe manganiello and there are rumours the couple are planning to have children of their own via a surrogate other documentation obtained by intouch which forms part of the lawsuit shows that jane doe ( vergara ) asked that the embryos be destroyed in the event of her death , while loeb refused to agree to this condition
