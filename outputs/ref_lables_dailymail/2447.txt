the diversity of life on earth is increasing despite dire warnings that the planet is facing a mass extinction , a leading writer has claimed
instead he argues it is highly unlikely that the planet is facing a sixth mass extinction as many threatened species are recovering
this chart shows the increase in marine biodiversity from the fossil record and the five mass extinction events his views are likely to be controversial with conservationists who have been warning that human activities risk killing off a large proportion of species on earth in an event to rival the extinction of the dinosaurs
mr stewart brand , who campaigns for long term solutions to the world 's problems rather than short term policy decisions , said that the rate of discovery of new species was currently outstripping the loss of species to extinction
' mr stewart brand points to recent research by the ecologist mark costello at the university of auckland who found that the number of new species being recorded was now at around 18,000 a year
the black rhino , pictured , was considered to be one of the most endangered species in the world and intensive efforts have been made to help conserve the species and its numbers are slowly beginning to rise again major efforts to remove rats from codfish island in new zealand has allowed the kakapo ( above ) to recover mr stewart brand also points to the efforts that have taken place on many islands around the world - where species are most vulnerable to extinction
mr stewart brand , who is also a campaigner to reintroduce extinct species such as woolly mammoths and passenger pigeons , believes biotechnology could also help to bring other species back from the brink by allowing their genetic diversity to be improved
he said that even with climate change , it is unlikely that all of the 23,214 species currently deemed as threatened with extinction would die out
ordovician - silurian mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago this was the third largest extinction in earth 's history , and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years
late devonian mass extinction - 375 - 359 million years ago three quarters of all species on earth died out in the late devonian mass extinction , though it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years
permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago the permian mass extinction has been nicknamed the great dying , since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out
mr stewart brand said he did not believe climate change is likely to have much impact on the loss of wildlife as many species will evolve and adapt to cope
he said : ' my own prediction is that climate change will be deemed intolerable for humans long before it speeds up extinction rates , and even if radical steps have to be taken to head it off , they will be taken
