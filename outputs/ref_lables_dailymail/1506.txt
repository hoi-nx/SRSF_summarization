a hoard of silver coins worth Â£ 34million that was sunk by the nazis on board a steamship has been salvaged by a british - led team at a record depth of 5,150m ( 17,000ft )
the ss city of cairo was travelling from bombay to england in 1942 when it was torpedoed by a u-boat 480 miles south of st helena , taking 100 tons of rupees with it to the bottom of the ocean
it was long assumed that the vessel 's cargo , belonging to the uk treasury , would be lost forever such was the complexity of the task facing salvage experts
treasure trove : some of the 100 tons of rupees found buried in the ocean floor at a record depth of 17,000ft after the cargo ship they were being transported on was sunk by a nazi submarine during world war two record find : some coins are raised to the surface during a pioneering recovery project by a british - led team hidden : the ss city of cairo was finally discovered ( above ) ' broken in two and buried deep in the seafloor silt ' underwater company deep ocean search used powerful sonar to locate the vessel on the sea floor that was until a team led by british expert john kingsford used pioneering techniques to track down the ship with powerful sonar and robotics
