builders in turkish have accidentally found one of the largest and most complex underground cities in the otherworldly region of cappadocia
the latest find is thought to be the biggest underground city in cappadocia , consisting of 3.5 miles ( 7km ) of tunnels , secret churches , tombs and safe havens
three entrances to the impressive complex can be seen , leading to vast , winding tunnels the subterranean city dates back around 5,000 years and was discovered when builders saw signs of a massive network of tunnels while moving mounds of earth
the find is similar to the discovery of another underground city , derinkuyu , which was made in 1963 when a man took down the wall in his basement
a view of the underground city newly discovered in turkish 's central anatolian province of nevåehir , which is famous for fairy chimney rock formations
the city was built from volcanic ash rock the latest find is thought to be the biggest underground city in cappadocia , consisting of 3.5 miles ( 7km ) of tunnels , secret churches , tombs and safe havens
the latest find is similar to the discovery of another underground city , derinkuyu , which was made in 1963 when a man took down the wall in his basement
derinkuyu was once home to 20,000 residents living together underground , in a city eleven levels deep with 600 entrances

like derinkuyu , the latest underground city was built to protect residents from invaders , but remains largely unexplored
geophysicists from nevåehir university recently conducted a systematic study of a 1.5 mile ( 4 km ) area using geophysical resistivity and seismic tomography
the studies suggest the underground corridors may go as deep as 371ft ( 113 metres ) , but the exact size remains unknown
