researchers have found that female chimps are more likely to use the tools to help them hunt for food while males tend to prefer capturing prey with their hands
this female chimp has stripped a stick of leaves and uses it to flush out a bush baby from a hollow tree trunk while the findings may provoke some to reassess their view of the opposite sex , the research may also provide tantalising hints at how humans first learned to use weapons to hunt
it suggests that early female humans were perhaps the first to begin fashioning simple tools to help them catch prey
writing in the journal royal society open science , dr pruetz , a primatologist at iowa state university said : ' savannah - dwelling chimpanzees at fongoli , sã©nã©gal , are the only non-human population known to systematically hunt vertebrate prey with tools
' acquiring vertebrate prey via tool use at fongoli supports the hypothesis that early hominins intensified their tool technology to overcome environmental pressures and that even the earliest hominins were probably sophisticated enough to fashion tools for hunting
' the behaviour of these chimpanzees demonstrates that hunting is less adult male - biased among our closest living relatives than previously believed when tools are used
' if tool use enabled early hominins to reduce the need for physical characteristics ( i.e. greater size , strength ) to achieve hunting efficiency , such sexual dimorphism ultimately becomes less important regarding prey acquisition
' scientists first reported chimps using spear - like sticks to hunt prey at fongoli in sã©nã©gal in 2007 , and it was later filmed by the bbc in their hugely successful natural history series life story
tools tended to be used when the chimps were hunting bush babies , called galago
when dr pruetz and her colleagues analysed the hunts they had recorded , however , they found that more of them tended to be carried out by female chimps
the chimps at fongoli in sã©nã©gal ( shown above ) are the only animals to regularly hunt for prey with tools
scientists first reported chimps using spear - like sticks to hunt prey at fongoli in sã©nã©gal in 2007 , and it was later filmed by the bbc in their hugely successful natural history series life story researchers observed more female chimps using broken sticks like above to help them capture prey
however , the male chimpanzees tended to capture larger prey and used their hands however , the male chimpanzees tended to capture larger prey and used their hands
they found that even in hunts involving tools , male chimps would often capture prey driven into their hands by those wielding tools
again these activities tend to be dominated by females , but dr pruetz said it could not be easily compared to the hunting behaviour seen at fongoli
' instead she believes there is something very specific about the open savannah environment compared to forests that has driven the chimps living at fongoli to use tools in this way
writing in the journal , the researchers said : ' the savannah environment might be viewed as the catalyst for tool - assisted hunting by savannah chimpanzees in sã©nã©gal in that apes here exploit prey that is largely ignored by forest - dwelling chimpanzees
' galago hunting at fongoli represents a high - energy , low - risk resource that members of various age â sex classes can take advantage of , similar to what is observed among tool - equipped human hunters
