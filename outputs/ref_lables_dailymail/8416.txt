aubrey de grey says ageing is a ' disease that can and should be cured ' with his rasputin beard and lines etched deep into his forehead , aubrey de grey looks like a man a lot older than his 51 years
a penchant for beer , fried food and an aversion to exercise could fool you into believing the lanky ex-public schoolboy cares little about ageing
but you would be wrong
for de grey , a charismatic harrow school and cambridge - educated biomedical theorist , firmly believes there is no reason , with the right ' therapies ' , why any of us should n't reach 500 , 1,000 or even 5,000 years of age
it sounds bonkers but de grey 's theories have gained him some high - profile supporters in silicon valley , the super-rich tech enclave in northern calfornia that is home to more middle - aged billionaires than anywhere else on the planet
paypal boss peter thiel ( worth Â£ 1.5 billion ) donated Â£ 2.4 million to de grey 's anti-ageing institute engineered negligible senescence ( engineered negligible senescence )
senescence is scientific jargon for ageing
while many academics mock him , in age - obsessed california de grey now regularly breaks bread and funds his research with donations from some of the sharpest minds in the world , including google co-founders larry page and sergey brin ( who has talked of ' curing death ' ) and larry ellison , of oracle , who are all showing an interest in gerontology , or the study of ageing
google 's bill maris , who heads the computer giant 's investment arm , said : ' we have tools in the life sciences to achieve anything you have the audacity to envision
' one source at a leading software company told the mail on sunday : ' de grey has tapped a rich vein in silicon valley
he 's become something of a controversial cheerleader for a generation of tech billionaires who have made their fortunes and now , of course , want to live for ever
' de grey was raised in chelsea by his artist mother cordelia , who left him Â£ 11 million when she died in 2011 â Â£ 9 million of which he has invested in his company
he never knew his father and became fascinated by seeking a cure for ageing while still at harrow school
' de grey 's radical thesis is that ageing can be halted and even reversed by treating the human body like a vintage car â ' replace the parts , clean it up , keep it running smoothly way past its expected expiration date '
he believes the first person who will live to be 1,000 has already been born , and cites research that has dramatically extended the lives of mice , worms and fruit flies as proof science is ' catching up ' with his theories that therapies which will genetically alter , replace and repair the cells in our bodies will be the key to eternal life
it sounds fanciful but as he talks , it is clear that de grey is empowered by the support of the silicon valley billionaires
that 's 30 world trade centers every day
' cars can kill people without it being the driver 's fault , ' he says
' critics argue that if he is right and we all live longer , the world 's resources will be stretched by overpopulation , but he hits back by saying : ' society will adapt
