sturgeon tonight backed the immediate transfer of all tax powers to holyrood in a move that threatens a multi-billion pound cut to scots 's budget
the first minister was forced to admit her mps would vote for fiscal autonomy as early as next year , despite the catastrophic collapse in north sea oil revenues
such a move would leave a massive Â£ 7.6billion black hole in scots 's finances , triggering either higher taxes , deeper spending cuts or unsustainable borrowing levels
sturgeon said she would back calls for all tax powers to be devolved to scots ' as soon as possible ' , but labour leader jim murphy ( right ) warned this would leave a catastrophic hole in the country 's budget miss sturgeon struggled once again in a tv election clash screened by the bbc , just a day after she faced an audience backlash by refusing to rule out a snap second referendum on independence
she walked into a trap set by labour leader jim murphy , who pointed out that one of the snp 's biggest supporters , billionaire jim mccoll , admitted scots is not ready for fiscal autonomy
' as scots 's voice in the house of commons , if the snp is there in numbers we will be arguing for as many powers to come to scots as quickly as possible , ' she said
' i would like it as quickly as the other parties agree to give it
' asked by jim murphy ' would your mps vote for it next year ? ' , the first minister replied : ' i would vote for it , would you support it ? ' to applause , the labour leader swiftly responded : ' no i would n't
miss sturgeon ( centre ) struggled slightly during a debate tonight in aberdeen ( pictured ) just a day after she was booed for refusing to rule out another referendum after the election gaining full fiscal autonomy from the rest of the britain will likely leave scots with a Â£ 7.6billion shortfall in cash , according to independent experts , after the value of north sea oil plunged earlier this year ' after the difficult time that aberdeen and the north east of scots been through , the idea that we voluntarily give up the pooling and sharing of resources , the ability to transfer money across these islands - i do n't think it makes sense
miss sturgeon , mr jim murphy , tories leader davidson and libdems leader rennie â who all took part in an stv debate the previous night â were joined by ukip 's only elected politician in scots , mep david coburn , and scots green co-convener harvie
it would see the devolution of every tax â including north sea oil revenues â and leave only defence and foreign affairs reserved to westminster , ending the generous barnett formula that funds scots
scots libdems leader rennie ( left ) warned miss sturgeon against another referendum , while scots green party leader harvie ( right ) called for an end to north sea drilling last month , the highly - respected ifs ( ifs ) predicted that a ' fiscally autonomous ' scots would have a massive Â£ 7.6billion black hole in its finances
that is the difference between the estimated budget deficit for the entire britain in 2015 - 16 of 4 per cent of gross domestic product ( gdp ) and scots 's budget deficit of 8.6 per cent
speaking after the debate , tories leader davidson said miss sturgeon 's election campaign is ' beginning to unravel '
in the earlier stv debate on tuesday , miss sturgeon said next month 's general election is not a 're - run ' of the referendum , but pointedly said ' that 's another matter ' when asked about her holyrood manifesto for 2016
davidson ( left ) , leader of the scots conservatives , said miss sturgeon 's election campaign was unravelling
ukip mep david coburn was branded a ' disgrace ' by sturgeon during the show , the snp leader insisted : ' i do accept the result of the referendum
' pressed on whether the tories would block another referendum , miss davidson said : ' i do not see an area where if the circumstances arose again that we would
' mr rennie said : ' just imagine if we had a different vote last september
' ukip âs scots leader david coburn was last night branded a â disgrace â by sturgeon for comparing one of her ministers to convicted terrorist abu hamza
in a fierce exchange , labour leader jim murphy told him : ' do nât demonise immigrants
key clash : a row with sturgeon over a second independence referendum , in which she warned that breaking the snp âs â once - in - a - generation â promise would be a â betrayal â
worst bit : admitted snp mps would vote for full tax powers as soon as next year â coinciding with a dramatic slump in north sea oil revenues
8/10 rennie best bit : huge applause when he used self - deprecating humour to warn sturgeon against â breaking a promise â that last year âs referendum was a â once - in - a - generation â vote
worst bit : squirmed over the libdems â broken promise not to increase tuition fees south of the border
worst bit : telling an audience in britain âs oil capital the country must â minimise extraction â of north sea reserves , jeopardising thousands of local jobs
