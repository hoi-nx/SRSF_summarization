teachers complained they are now expected to be ' frontline stormtroppers ' in the fight against islamist extremism in school , a conference has heard
the national union of teachers ( national union of teachers ) suggested that government strategies designed to tackle extremism and terrorism have instead ' shut down debate ' in schools
teachers said they now feel nervous discussing controversial issues over fears they will be pressured to report youngsters who share their opinions
they also claimed young people feel unable to express there views on certain subjects , such as the charlie hebdo killings , for fear of being branded an extremist
the strategy suggests school staff can help to identify and refer youngsters whose behaviour suggests that they are being drawn into extremism or terrorism
kenny , of the union 's executive , described prevent as a ' blunt instrument that will do damage and inhibit debate in schools ' , adding that ofsted should be allowed ' nowhere near these issues '
in the wake of attacks on the charlie hebdo journalists there were , in some schools , muslim pupils who did not feel they could say they were offended by the newspapers cartoons mr kenny said : ' we live in a damaged and volatile world , and like us , young people are trying to make sense of it , like us , they 're trying to come to conclusions about cause , effect and solutions , and like us they want a space to discuss it
the conference heard that prevent was shutting down debate in schools ' prevent is shutting down debate and we must oppose it and we must say schools are places where children and teachers should be allowed to discuss these issues
' he added : ' our guidance makes it clear that no teacher or school leader should feel unable to talk about difficult or sensitive issues - indeed teaching about fundamental british values actively encourages such discussions - but no - one should be using a school to promote views , opinions or beliefs that discriminate against other people on the basis of their background
