cabinet secretary sir jeremy heywood has ordered an official probe into claims that a civil servant leaked an official account of a private meeting between nicola sturgeon and the french ambassador
the snp leader has denied telling french ambassador bermann that she would prefer david cameron to remain in number 10 while suggesting that ed miliband was not prime minister material
ms nicola sturgeon told supporters at a rally in glasgow today that she had written to sir jeremy heywood to demand an official investigation
she then called on mr ed miliband to publicly commit to working with the snp to ' lock out ' mr david cameron from downing street in the event of a hung parliament
according to the memo : ' discussion appears to have focused mainly on the political situation , with the fm stating that she would n't want a formal coalition with labour ; that the snp would almost certainly have a large number of seats ... that she 'd rather see david cameron remain as pm
' the note went on to say that ms nicola sturgeon had said she did not think labour leader ed miliband was ' prime minister material '
' david cameron , pictured today , said any deal between labour and the snp would be a ' chaos alliance ' a spokesman for the ms bermann said : ' while the ambassador and first minister , some time ago , discussed the political situation , ms nicola sturgeon did not touch on her personal political preferences with regards to the future prime minister
nicola sturgeon would rather see david cameron win the election because she does not see ed miliband as â prime minister material â , it was reported last night
the document , which was leaked to the daily telegraph , undermines the snp leader âs claim that she wants to build a progressive alliance with labour to keep the conservatives out of office
the snp âs opponents say the party would favour another tory - led westminster government , against which it could campaign in an attempt to stoke up anti-english sentiment and make an â out â vote more likely in another referendum
written by a senior civil servant , the memo from february 26 states : â the first minister confessed that she âd rather see david cameron remain as pm ( and did nât see ed miliband as pm material )
' i am therefore writing to the head of the britain civil service , sir jeremy heywood , requesting an urgent inquiry into the circumstances of such a false account being leaked for transparently political motives
' the snp leader added : ' anyone who knows anything about me knows i do n't want to see a tory government
we 've made if very clear that we will lock david cameron out of downing street - the only person who 's not made that clear is ed miliband
' conservative culture secretary sajid javid told sky news : ' who knows what the reality is there ? i think the one thing that we do know is that the snp seem to be doing very well in scotland at the moment ... and it strongly suggests that the only way ed miliband could every come into office is in coalition with the snp and that would mean chaos for britain
' and a tory spokesman said : ' ed miliband still wo n't rule out a deal with the snp because he knows he ca n't get into number 10 without them - he 's in the pocket of alex salmond and nicola sturgeon has him on a leash
' cabinet secretary sir jeremy heywood , pictured , has announced a full investigation into the growing scandal ed miliband , pictured , said he will not enter into any coalition with the snp as he wants a majority mr ed miliband described the leaked memo as a ' damning revelation ' claiming the snp were saying one thing in private and something completely different in public
' he claimed ms nicola sturgeon 's disputed opinion of the labour leader ' told us something that i said about four years ago - that ed miliband is not up to the job of being prime minister
