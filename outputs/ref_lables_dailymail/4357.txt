uefa has opened a real can of worms by ordering the final 18 seconds of the european women 's under 19 championship qualifier between england and norway to be replayed following a refereeing error
however , fifa did something similar during a 2006 world cup qualifier
back in 2005 uzbekistan were playing bahrain in the asian zone fourth - round play - off first leg when japanese referee toshimitsu yoshida incorrectly awarded an indirect free - kick to bahrain after the uzbeks had encroached at their penalty kick when 1 - 0 up
this happened in the 38th minute and fifa ordered that the entire match be replayed which did not please either team
england are awarded a penalty during their european u19 women 's championships qualifier in belfast referee marija kurtes points to the spot as england are awarded a penalty in the 96th minute williamson steps up to take a penalty in the closing stages of the match against norway williamson runs forward to strike the ball but team - mate rosella ayane ( circled ) has entered the box williamson turns and celebrates as she slots the ball into the goalkeeper 's bottom - right corner bahrain players and staff celebrate after beating uzbekistan in a 2006 world cup qualifier on away goals have uefa just triggered a landmark moment for football ? final 18 seconds of england match to be replayed after ref disallowed penalty for encroachment ... and gave indirect free - kick instead
had the penalty been missed she would have been correct to award an indirect free kick but as it had been scored she should have ordered a retake
england players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against norway but referee marija kurtes awards an indirect free - kick and the celebrations are cut short williamson has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake but williamson then realises the referee 's decision and two norwegian players are seen celebrating german referee marija kurtes incorrectly awarded an indirect free kick after disallowing a penalty marija kurtes has been sent home from the european women 's u19 qualifiers after her mistake now , uefa has upheld england âs appeal and ordered that in an evolution of the fifa decision in 2005 , the game should be replayed from the moment the technical error occurred
it will happen â and uefa must just hope it does nât affect one of their premiere tournaments
