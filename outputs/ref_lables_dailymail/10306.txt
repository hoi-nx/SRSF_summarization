a roman catholic school attended by clegg âs eldest son and two of blair âs has been cleared of discriminating against the poor
the office of the schools adjudicator criticised the oratory school in london for engaging in â social selection â , saying it had broken the rules in 105 different ways
the state - funded school in fulham , london , was ordered to revise its admissions policy last year after the watchdog decided it was biased against working - class and non-catholic children
the oratory school in london was cleared of discriminating against the poor and non-catholic children the watchdog accused the school of cherry - picking privileged white children using its strict faith - based entry requirements
but yesterday , this was overturned by a high court judge who said this decision was â flawed â and â unreasonable â
mr justice cobb said : â the adjudicator âs conclusion that the governing body of the school had operated an admissions system which was socially selective , discriminatory , and unfairly disadvantageous to children from less well - off families was flawed and was reached by a process which was procedurally unfair to the school
in its ruling , the watchdog said the school must not grant places â on the basis of any practical or financial support parents may give to the school â - nor should children be favoured on the basis of their hobbies and activities
a high court judge branded the decision by the watchdog ' flawed ' it is one of the most popular in the country and is always oversubscribed
in a reserved judgment after a hearing last month mr justice cobb ordered the adjudicator to think again after remitting the case to be heard by a fresh adjudicator
he said : â i am satisfied that the adjudicator reaches this conclusion by a mix of flawed reasoning and unfair process
