the first robot to be sent into the radioactive reactor of fukushima nuclear power plant has stalled just three hours into its mission
these incredible pictures offer the first glimpse into the melted reactors at the japanese plant after the 2011 nuclear disaster
more than 300,000 people had to be evacuated after three of fukushima 's six reactors blew up following the huge tsunami which devastated the country over three years ago
but decommissioning work at the plant suffered a setback after the adaptable ' transformer ' robot stalled before it could complete its operation and had to be abandoned
the tepco , which operates the wrecked fukushima nuclear plant , admitted the robot had only completed two - thirds of friday 's planned mission inside the unit 1 containment vessel before it failed
it leaves the door open to a new generation of remote - controlled robot missions which may finally reveal the residue of the melted fuel for the first time since the 2011 disaster
a second robot mission scheduled for monday was postponed as engineers investigated the cause of the malfunction the tepco , which operates the wrecked fukushima nuclear plant , admitted the robot had only completed two - thirds of friday 's planned mission inside the unit 1 containment vessel before it failed tepco spokesman kobayashi said the robot sufficiently collected temperature , radiation levels and images from parts of the platform just below the reactor core 's bottom by the time it got stuck and became unrecoverable
three of the six reactors blew up when a tsunami measuring 9 on the richter scale hit the region
the plant has six reactors , three of which were offline when disaster struck on march 11 , 2011
more than 300,000 people had to be evacuated after three of fukushima 's six reactors blew up following the huge tsunami which devastated the country over three years ago nearly 16,000 people lost their lives in the natural disaster and subsequent devastation a magnitude - 9.0 earthquake triggered a huge tsunami which swept into the plant and knocked out its backup power and cooling systems , leading to meltdowns at the three active reactors
decommissioning and dismantling all six reactors is a delicate , time - consuming process that includes removing the melted fuel from a highly radioactive environment , as well as all the extra fuel rods , which sit in cooling pools at the top of the reactor buildings
workers , who wear protective suits when dismantling the plant , must determine the exact condition of the melted fuel debris and develop remote - controlled and radiation - resistant robotics to deal with it
contamination levels are low , which means people can , for a limited time , view the destruction site decommissioning and dismantling all six reactors is a delicate , time - consuming process that includes removing the melted fuel from a highly radioactive environment , as well as all the extra fuel rods , which sit in cooling pools at the top of the reactor buildings
