a shocking video has been released showing four tourists they catching a bronzer shark in new zealand , dragging the thrashing creature in to shore and then pose for photos with the creature
andreas rasmussen , christian boyum johansen and johan berg are filmed by emil fogh , standing just centimetres away from the shark they 've captured in an activity that is terrifying but completely legal in new zealand , to the point it has become a competitive sport
one of the man stands at the water 's edge with a fishing line in his hands and the waves lapping at his feet when suddenly he launches forward , dragged by the great weight of the creature who has attached itself to his fishing line
the first fisherman is dragged deep into the water from the water 's edge within seconds when the mighty shark takes hold of the end of his line once captured , one person brazenly opens the sharks mouth whilst the other removes the hook the fisherman and his friends whoop with excitement , certain they have achieved their goal : to catch a shark
the fisherman 's friend grabs hold of his shoulders and together they pull against the shark on the end of the line , determined to bring it into shore
as the fisherman is dragged after the shark , his friend grabs hold of his shoulder and they forcefully pull the shark closer in to shore the video then cuts to a few moments later , as the shark , now inexplicably still and unresponsive , is pulled in to the sand by its tail
as it is legal to fish for sharks in new zealand , it has become a sport known as ' big game fishing ' in which ' shark anglers ' catch and release the creatures
one of the men stands just a metre away from the thrashing shark to pull it onto the sand however , it crucial that the ' sport ' is only attempted by those that know the techniques which are safe for both the participant and the shark â to ensure everyone involved remains alive
for many new zealand it has become a business to allow people , particularly tourists , to take part in the land - based shark fishing catch and release experience
companies promise that participants can expect to ' catch fish such as large tiger sharks and hammerheads ' in places such as new zealand 's tauranaga harbour
' ' the ' catch and release ' philosophy is in keeping with new zealand 's dedication to conservation and sustainable fishing , ' according to the new zealand tourism guide website
' for the sea creature to survive , it is crucial that people engaging in big - game fishing handle their catch minimally
in october 2014 new zealand finally banned the practice of shark finning , a move that was seen as finally diminishing a primitive practice and ' bringing the country in line with other developed nations '
new zealand 's conservation minister nick smith said the move reinforced the country 's reputation for sustainability and environmental protection
