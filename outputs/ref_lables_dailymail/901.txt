everything they say about the maldivian is true
the sea is breathtakingly cerulean blue , the sand as soft as flour
the air is so clear it feels like there might be a fourth dimension
the view from the sea plane is like a turquoise lava lamp as lagoons meet the ocean with swirls and circles of staggering beauty
and then , just as we start our descent to the little resort of niyama , in the dhaalu atoll , a 40 - minute seaplane flight from the capital malã© , two yellow turtles swim sturdily towards a reef
sand as soft as flour and cerulean sea : penny is hard pushed to find fault with her week in the maldivian at the jetty , smiling staff give us cool towels and whisk us to our new home for a week - a superlative beachfront studio where a huge , modern sitting room looks out on to an infinity pool , a strip of brilliant white sand and that ridiculously blue sea
look the other way and stepping stones lead through green foliage to a table and chairs while to one side is an outside shower surrounded by banana plants
frankly , the place is bigger than my flat
it 's hardly surprising the maldivian have been on the top ten of honeymoon destinations for years
you could easily spend much of your time getting all hot , bothered and arduous in the splendour of your well - appointed villa
but there is much more to do than gaze at sumptuousness
obviously , with miles of sea to play in , you can swim , snorkel , canoe , scuba dive and sail
there is also a high - tech games room where you can learn or practice golf , shooting , tennis or whatever
essentially , though , you 're here to relax
the days unwind quietly for penny , with snorkelling , visits to the spa and walks around the island we take a boat about a third of a mile offshore to the sensational music venue subsix , which is six metres ( 20ft ) under the sea
" ' edge 's executive chef ( an aussie named geoff clark ) serves up exquisite food
even the fruit bats are happy ( right ) actually , i 'm not going to mention the food any more
suffice to say that not only will you not starve or suffer from lack of variety , you will eat some of the most gorgeous food you 've ever tasted
we go snorkelling with judith hannak , the resident marine biologist
