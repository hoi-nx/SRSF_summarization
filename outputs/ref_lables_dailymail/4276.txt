somehow , to the backdrop of supporter unrest , protests and a worst - ever start to a premier league season , alan pardew managed to excavate five straight victories from a newcastle united side which ranks as their most uninspiring of recent years
remove those five wins and newcastle united would have just 20 points â the autumn run , then , has saved them from the fall
alan pardew 's five - game winning run was crucial to newcastle united 's season , who would only be on 20 points newcastle united 's fans protested for the board to sack alan pardew as manager and were delighted when he resigned when alan pardew quit for crystal palace at the end of december , newcastle united were ninth
alan pardew won 26 of those
nonetheless , alan pardew cut a resigned and wounded figure following a 1 - 0 defeat at stoke which left newcastle united joint bottom with burnley
since his departure the players have look uninterested and unhappy playing for the club and john carver from the negativity , however , was born a perverse positivity , driven by alan pardew â s determination to repair a reputation so badly stained that his next posting would surely have been outside of the premier league
crucially , he kept his players on side â no mean feat given their current levels of disinterest â and so emerged a siege mentality which , on reflection , was to yield a season - saving 15 points
the 53 - year - old appeared to have hit rock bottom against stoke but picked up the players for the winning run replacement john carver â like alan pardew , the sole public face of the crisis club â is discovering just how poisonous that atmosphere has become
john carver is proving he 's not cut out for top - level management , with two wins in the last 14 games this sad situation , however , is the cause of a hierarchy which has stripped the club of ambition and meaning
