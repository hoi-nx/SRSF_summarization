so who will be voted player of the year ? eden hazard is the hot favourite but whoever wins will have plenty of tactical voting to thank
i âm sure eden hazard and the other leading contenders â in my mind david de gea and harry kane â will benefit from their team - mates being careful with who they vote for
there âs no way john terry can seriously believe philippe coutinho has been better than de gea and harry kane this season ! there is more to it than meets the eye
john terry , i am almost certain , will have gone around chelsea âs dressing room when the ballot papers came in and told the squad â given that you can not choose one of your team - mates â under no circumstances should they vote for de gea or harry kane , who are eden hazard âs biggest challengers
chelsea winger eden hazard is among the front runners to win the player of the year award this season the belgium international has been in superb form for jose mourinho 's side as they look set to win the title hazard will have to beat off competition from manchester united goalkeeper david de gea harry kane is another of the favourites to pick up the individual gong after his heroics for tottenham how do i know ? i did exactly the same thing in 2006 when steven gerrard won ! i was liverpool âs player of the year representative back then and i made it clear that , for stevie to win , nobody should vote for thierry henry or frank lampard ! you might think that âs unfair but it is the same in every dressing room
the voting is , of course , already done but eden hazard and de gea come up against each other on saturday and will both be eager to show that they should be regarded as the season âs standout performer
he will probably be the club âs player of the year again and that is as big an achievement as being up for the player of the year award
jamie carragher says chelsea captain john terry will have told his squad not to vote for harry kane or de gea to give eden hazard a better chance of winning the award chelsea captain john terry revealed his vote for player of the year was philippe coutinho jamie carragher believes de gea is one of the main reasons manchester united are enjoying such a successful run de gea endured a difficult start to his manchester united career as he struggled with physicality of the premier league eden hazard - chelsea diego costa - chelsea harry kane - tottenham alexis sanchez - arsenal david de gea - manchester united philippe coutinho - liverpool daniel agger scored a header to put us 1 - 0 up but his task was made easier because we crowded de gea out and he simply did nât have the power or the confidence to barge his way through a crowd of bodies
but as good as he has been , i feel de gea will miss out on becoming the first goalkeeper to win player of the year since pat jennings in 1976
people may say â what about suarez , gareth bale and robin van persie ? â â the last three men to lift the player of the year crown â but the consistency and quality of their performances meant they were impossible to ignore
eden hazard 's chelsea team - mate diego costa has also been nominated for the award after netting 19 league goals arsenal 's alexis sanchez makes the six - man shortlist after an impressive debut season in english john terry voted for liverpool 's philippe coutinho , who completes the six - man shortlist the young player of the year nominations are : eden hazard - chelsea harry kane - tottenham philippe coutinho - liverpool raheem sterling - liverpool david de gea - manchester united thibaut courtois - chelsea i mentioned john terry will have been influential in the chelsea dressing room when it came to voting
but on a serious note about him , i am very surprised that he is not on the shortlist
i would go as far to say that if chelsea should have two contenders , it should be eden hazard and their captain , both of whom have started all 31 league matches â not diego costa
you could say something similar about harry kane
he was at his peak when voting started and i âd be surprised if he does nât win the young player award
john terry has been as influential as ever for chelsea this season and deserved a nomination ahead of diego costa , according to jamie carragher suarez won the award in 2014 and eden hazard picked up the young player of the year award one thing i can not help feeling , however , is that the nominations show that this campaign has been anything but a classic
how can the same four players be up for both the player of the year and young player award ? hazard wo nât win the award by default but he certainly has nât got a highlights reel to match suarez , van persie or gareth bale
it is interesting to see how eden hazard measures up with gareth bale , who is getting criticism in spain for not making a big enough impact at real madrid , yet after 27 games in la liga he has scored 13 goals and made seven assists
eden hazard , by contrast , has 12 goals in the premier league â three of which have been penalties â and has eight assists
real madrid forward gareth bale has 13 goals and seven assists compared to eden hazard 's 12 goals and eight assists , but is receiving criticism in spain our league needs top - class defenders the game of the week in the champions league came when real madrid âs finest sides went to war at the vicente calderon
there will be a clamour this summer for our top sides to buy more and more exciting , attacking players but the displays of atletico pair miranda and godin and real madrid âs sergio ramos and varane showed the kind of additions we should be making
former liverpool man jamie carragher says spain international sergio ramos is a top - class defender jamie carragher says nothing would excite him more than the arrival of varane or godin to english in the last 16 , meanwhile , the numbers were just as damning
the champions league is the best competition with the best players , so scoring goals should nât be easy
