mr ed balls told wolverhampton 's express and star newspaper : ' on the snp point , there is absolutely no possibility of any vote being put to parliament or any budget measure in a labour budget which would in any way disadvantage the west midlands or any other part of england , because that 's what the snp demand
a tns survey shows the snp has almost doubled its lead over labour in a month , with 52 per cent now backing ms nicola sturgeon with only 24 per cent of scotland planning to vote for mr ed miliband
