police believe they are on the verge of solving a brutal cold case murder that occurred 35 years ago
ronda was just 14 - years - old in 1980 when she and a friend took a ride home from a stranger after finishing the day at atkins high school in rural hall , north carolina - a town so quaint and wholesome that it was the model for the fictional mayberry in ' the andy griffith show
' her friend got dropped off first , but ronda never made it back home
the man who gave her a ride home that day was never found
' within a day or so after receiving her call there were developments that i can not discuss here today , but this task force is actively pursuing good leads , ' surry county sheriff graham atkinson said in a press conference on monday
' this is because they were young when this murder occurred and they feared getting into trouble with their parents or the law ; they are no longer close with those who , in confidence , has discussed the homicide with them , ' explained sheriff graham atkinson
' more importantly , police can now test some of the dna evidence from the scene , something they could not do back in 1980 due to a lack of technology
ronda had been violently assaulted and stabbed to death when her body was found the man was in his early twenties back in 1980 , drove a blue pickup truck ( similar to the one above ) with a white shell over the bed and went by jimmy , though he told the girls his friends called him butch what 's more , sheriff graham atkinson does not think law enforcement has to search far to find the man
