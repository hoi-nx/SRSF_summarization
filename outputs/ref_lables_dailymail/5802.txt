while young children must be shown the highway code to cross roads safely , it seems chimpanzees have taught themselves
researchers studying chimps in uganda say the apes are having to adapt to cope with increasingly busy roads cutting across their territory
they found at a busy asphalted road through the sebitoli area of kibale national park in uganda , the chimps have learned to look both ways before crossing
chimpanzees crossing a busy road in kibale national park in uganda ( above ) have learned to look for traffic scientists discovered the chimps will also often run across roads , while dominant males will wait to ensure younger chimps cross safely
dr sabrina krief and her team found that separate groups of chimpanzees at budongo forest reserve and kibale national park ate plants while chewing meat
' more than 90 per cent of the individuals looked right and left before and while crossing
whole parties crossed more rapidly when chimpanzees were more numerous in the crossing groups
they watched 122 chimps cross the road over the course of two and half years
they found most of the chimps looked for traffic before crossing and as they crossed
around 20 per cent of the chimps that crossed would turn to check on other members of the group to ensure they were crossing safely
they also tended to form small groups of between two to three chimpanzees that crossed at a time
miss cibot , who worked on the study with dr sabrina krief , a lecturer at the national museum of natural history in paris and the great ape conservation project in uganda , said bridges or underpasses could be provided to help keep chimps safe
