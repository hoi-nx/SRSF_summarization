westerners fighting for isis are taking part in a sickening circle of violent one - upmanship in order to prove themselves to commanders who consider european militants little more than cannon fodder
militants : ranked well below battle - hardened foreign jihadis from warzones such as chechens and east africa , westerners believe ultra-violence is the only way for them to rise up the ranks in syria and iraqi western fighters waging jihad in syria and iraqi often appear disillusioned by the mundane jobs they are given upon arrival
by far the most common job for western jihadis , however , is guarding prisoners
while some complain that this involves little more than standing bored in a doorway or handing over meals , others have used their unlimited access to these defenceless so - called ' enemies of the state ' to build a reputation for the kind of shocking cruelty and sadism isis commanders appreciate
one former prisoner has now revealed that many of the thousands of european who have flocked to join isis over the past year have been shocked to find themselves marginalised within an organisation where iraqi and saudi nationals rule
' there is a hierarchy in isis and the foreign fighters and the syria are at the bottom of it , ' he added , revealing that fighters from tunisia consider themselves the group 's military wing , while saudi are largely dominate religious affairs

while many of the european extremists joining isis tell their commanders they will be willing killers , very few of them have ever even held a gun by the time they arrive in syria or iraqi
