labour leader miliband read from motivational notes during the leaders â televised debate he was widely criticised for his robotic performance in last week âs debate as he failed to land a convincing blow on david cameron
now it has emerged miliband was reading from motivational notes during the leaders â clash â including one reminding him to be a â happy warrior â
his cribsheet prompts him to turn a â negative â into a â positive â and reveals he had planned a number of the put - downs he used on david cameron â such as , on the deficit : â does that sound familiar ? well , it should , because he said it five years ago
â the labour leader urges himself to â stay calm , never agitated â and â relish the chance to show who i am â
his scrawled notes , found in his dressing room after the itv debate , give an insight into his mindset before he took to the rostrum with the six other party leaders
mr miliband reminds himself to talk to the camera , â use the people at home â and get across his â decency , passion , leadership â
the labour leader reveals his planned ripostes to two possible tory attacks , accusing him of forgetting the deficit and of telling journalists he wanted to â weaponise â the issue of the nhs
â tory mp charlie elphicke said such â marketing speak â was â cringe - worthy â , adding : â miliband is looking increasingly bizarre
marketing speak like â happy warriors â is very much the tactic of motivational gurus â¦ i think most people will think it âs cringe - worthy
â happy warrior â was coined by william wordsworth to describe admiral lord nelson
mr miliband staked the success of his campaign on having a head to head debate with david cameron , and is understood to have been rehearsing for months
happy warrior depicts its subject as a swashbuckling hero who suffers great setbacks and pain , yet proves impossible to defeat
in 2012 , barack obama described his running mate joe biden as â america âs happy warrior â , in a speech written by axelrod
indeed , he must have been behind miliband âs decision to puff up his chest and tell jeremy paxman last month : â am i tough enough ? hell yes , i âm tough enough ! â as to what sort of a guy miliband intends to â relish â showing us he is , his notes contain three words : â decency , passion , leadership â
labour leader miliband leaves mediacityuk in salford following the televised leaders ' election debate â calm , never agitated â axelrod famously labelled barack obama â no drama barack obama â , kitting out staff in t - shirts with the logo â stop the drama , vote barack obama â
miliband has made self - deprecating jokes â such as one about how he struggled to eat a bacon sandwich â to turn a negative into a positive
interestingly , the word â decency â cropped up in sherlock actor martin freeman âs filmed endorsement of labour
the note suggests labour believe â decency â , â principle â and â values â are alien concepts to david cameron
