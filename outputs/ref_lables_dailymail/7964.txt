an apartment house where only high - paying tenants can use the gym may be illegally discriminating , city human rights officials warned this week
it 's the latest salvo in an ongoing struggle between property developers to build or maintain rent - stabilized apartments alongside luxury units that go for thousands of dollars more a month
other building have installed so - called ' poor doors ' for use by rent - stabilized tenants while full - rent residents get to use the front door
the human rights commission said in a notice filed thursday that there 's enough evidence of age discrimination to merit a hearing on the stonehenge village complex 's fitness room
the rent - regulated tenants excluded from the gym are largely over 65 , while market - rate tenants are n't , according to a complaint last year from tenants ' association president green dorsey
she said friday she was hopeful the landlord would now let rent - stabilized tenants pay a reasonable fee to use the gym and have it continue to be free for their higher - rent neighbors
market - rate apartments go for $ 3,500 a month for one - bedroom units , which advertise granite counter tops , stainless steel appliances and close proximity to whole foods
' any impact on rent - regulated tenants arises out of their length of tenancy in the building , ' not their age , ' and involves that person 's choice to remain in a rent - regulated unit at lower rent , ' the landlord 's lawyer , goldberg , wrote in a filing last year
the building advertises one - bedroom apartments for $ 3,500 a month that feature granite counter tops and stainless steel appliances while city law prohibits discrimination based on age , it 's silent on the subject of rent - regulation status
stonehenge village is among several new york city buildings that have spurred an outcry over separate entrances for lower - paying residents - dubbed ' poor doors ' - or playrooms , roof decks and other amenities reserved for market - rate renters
