researchers plan to drill 5,000 feet below the surface of the chicxulub in mexico to try and answer the question of how the dinosaurs died out
the core they hope to retrieve will allow them to look back in time 10 million to 15 million years into the past
it could help uncover exactly what happened to create the crater - and if it killed off the dinosaurs
uk researchers studied the asteroid impact 66 million years ago ( illustration shown )
a heat pulse lasted less than a minute , too short to set plants alight the impact site is believed to be the 125 mile ( 200km ) wide chicxulub buried underneath the yucatã¡n peninsula in mexico
when the six - mile - wide ( 10km ) asteroid hit what is now mexico approximately 66 million years ago , dinosaurs were experiencing environmental upheaval , which left them vulnerable
a team of researchers has found that heat near the impact site would not have been sufficient to ignite plants
' the chicxulub impact crater has been a remarkable scientific opportunity for the 20 years since it 's been discovered , ' gulick , of the university of texas at austin institute for geophysics , told live science
an international team of scientists met last week in mã©rida , mexico , located within the 125 - mile - wide ( 200 kilometers ) chicxulub crater , to discuss their plans for the drilling project , slated to start in spring 2016
they believe that when a big rock smashes into earth at high enough velocities , the collision causes the crust temporarily to act like a liquid , first forming a so - called transient crater ( like the indentation that forms on a lake surface after a rock is thrown in ) , and the center rebounds , or splashes , upward and then outward
a team of researchers has found that heat near the impact site would not have been sufficient to ignite plants
the team of researchers from the university of exeter , university of edinburgh and imperial college london recreated the immense energy that would have been released from the asteroid impact 66 million years ago
but the theory that a global firestorm accompanied the asteroid impact is not correct , according to the scientists they found that the intense but short - lived heat near the impact site could not have ignited live plants , challenging the idea that the impact led to global firestorms
these firestorms have previously been considered a major contender in the puzzle to find out what caused the mass extinction of life on earth 66 million years ago

for years scientists have debated whether an asteroid , climate change or a combination of catastrophes were responsible for the demise of dinosaurs
but when the six - mile - wide ( 10km ) asteroid hit what is now mexico approximately 66 million years ago , dinosaurs were experiencing environmental upheaval , which left them vulnerable
if the asteroid impact had come a few million years earlier , when the range of species was bigger and food chains more robust , they may have survived , according to the study
