the time is around 9pm on a thursday and 7,000 people are chanting â yes ! yes ! yes ! â in a pitch - black car park in london âs docklands
it âs been raining and the ground is damp , but we are all in our bare feet , which are going numb on the cold , hard concrete
marianne attended robbins â unleash the power within seminarwhich claims to â discover how to identify what it is you really want ' the mood is tribal
â and we âve spent the past half - an - hour being told what we need to do to avoid hospitalisation
we have spent the past two hours preparing for this moment â being whipped into something called â peak state â , a place where you are so mentally strong that you can do anything
the idea is that , once you overcome the fear of walking on coals of between 1,200 and 2,000 fahrenheit , you can â conquer the other fires of your life with ease â
â am i really doing this ? â is all i can think
for the past year , i âve been on a self - improvement mission
fed up with a life spent worrying , single and broke , i âve set myself a bizarre challenge to live by the rules of a different self - help guru each month
marianne ( pictured ) has set herself a bizarre challenge to live by the rules of a different self - help guru each month and this month she chose that of robbins and , when it comes to the self - improvement world , robbins is the king
everyone from world leaders â nelson mandela , bill clinton , mikhail gorbachev â to athletes such as serena williams and actors including hugh jackman seek his counsel
his is a classic rags - to - riches story
determined to transcend his poor childhood , he became obsessed with self - improvement
robbins ( pictured in the 1990s ) charges $ 1 million to coach private clients and is the ' king ' of the self - improvement world according to his website , robbins â unleash the power within seminar would help me â discover how to identify what it is you really want , break through any barriers that might be holding you back , increase your energy and mental clarity , and infuse passion into your life â
â when you walk over those coals , something changes , â she says , her eyes wide
â she has all the fervour of a fanatic
â he went last year and got a lot out of it , â they say
â and â high â is the perfect word for the atmosphere
after half - an - hour , tony walks on stage and the screaming goes off the scale
and just to add to the effect , his chiselled face is blown up to god - like proportions on massive screens behind him
he says we are all defined by our limiting beliefs and that if we get rid of these then â the impossible just gets done â
he is the king of the catchphrase : â it âs impossible to love yourself when you âre not being yourself â ; â change your story , change your life
â these nuggets come out of his mouth from 1pm to 9pm
even world leaders like nelson mandela ( left ) and bill clinton ( right ) have sought the advice and counsel of robbins i turn to the norwegian man next to me and say : â i think i âm in love
â he smiles and says : â me , too
â we are all under his spell and will do anything he says , including hugging and high - fiving strangers , and punching our fists in the air while yelling : â yes , yes , yes ! â it âs just so un-english
as the day goes on , we examine our â limiting beliefs â
each time we do we are told to â make a move â , so every time we make that move in the future , these memories will come back
robbins is said to have also helped well - known face including princess diana ( left ) and former prime minister , margaret thatcher ( right ) a part of me wants to run away , but a bigger part of me knows that i can do this
then i âm standing in front of the coals and two men are instructing me to shout : â yes ! â i do
they say â make your move ! â and i pump my fist in the air
i have half - a - second of panic when i realise what i âm doing â but , by then , my feet are on the cold square of grass put at the end of the fire and my feet are being hosed down by helpers
