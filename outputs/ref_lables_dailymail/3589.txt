an uber customer was hit with a huge $ 16,000 bill for her 7 - mile nightmare journey across new york
jaime hessel said her driver had been on his phone , cut across lanes , and even driven down a bus lane during the 35 minute ' trip from hell ' from her east williamsburg apartment to midtown east
so she was stunned to receive a message from the cab - hailing app telling her she owed them thousands of dollars for the trip across boroughs , reported the gothamist
ms hessel claims that the car dangerously cut across lanes of traffic on several occasions and was even driven down a bus lane until she demanded to be let out early
shock : ms hessel was horrified when uber billed her for $ 16,000 - with a $ 4,000 refund
her total statement was $ 12,251.49 uber says the eye - popping figure was a clerical error and that the customer was never actually charged the outrageous sum but the nightmare trip was far from over
within a few days , the uber resp had written back to inform ms hessel the company agreed the journey was ' inefficient ' and she would get a refund of $ 15
' the panicked ms hessel quickly got in touch with the company again to inform them of their error and said she felt lucky that her credit card had expired between the journey and the bill so the transport app would have been unable to charge her
uber has since wiped the bill and offered to pay her the original $ 15 refund but ms hessel said she now feels she ca n't trust them with her new card details
they say it was a clerical error and that she was never actually charged the $ 16,000
