paul 's timing could n't be better , and it could n't be worse
bluegrass state 's junior senator is poised to enter the 2016 presidential contest on tuesday , at a moment when only sen. cruz , the tea party darling , is already in the race and consuming precious news - cycle oxygen
paul will launch his campaign tuesday morning in louisville , bluegrass state with the populist slogan ' defeat the washington machine
' paul is as much a part of the washington machine as joe biden or harry reid
an iowa republican party official who said he has n't chosen a horse in the 2016 primary told daily mail online that ' paul is going to have problems if he thinks he can position himself as an outsider
but it wo n't sell in iowa , especially since he 's walking his views back toward the center
paul has taken heat in recent days from libertarians for softening some of the principled stands thad have defined his brand since kentuckians sent him to washington
he described himself as ' a judicial activist ' in january , for instance , telling a conservative audience that federal judged should n't hesitate to toss out majority - rule decisions by congress if they infringe on constituional rights
small pond : the only other big fish to announce his candidacy so far is texas sen. cruz , an evangelical christian whose views could n't be much more different from paul 's paul has found himself occasionally in the policy weeds as the news cycle shifts away from his natural area of strength and into territory where he has yet to define himself
and as other paul presidential hopefuls strategize about how to approach the middle east foreign policy mess on obama 's desk , paul has to contend with his past isolationist statements that make the president 's approach seem bold and reaganesque by comparison
' i support military action against isis , ' he said of the islamist terror army , adding that ' if we are to go to war , we should make it brief , succinct and we must fight to win
he teased his tuesday announcement over the weekend with a 3 - minute youtube video reprising portions of his february speech at the cpac near washington ' to fix washington , we ca n't have business as usual , ' paul says in one clip
one who works for you and , above all , it 's time for a new president , ' out of the gate already : paul has been making campaign - style stops in the eary primary state of granite state , like this march 21 appearance in the granite state town of rochester winner : paul has won three straight straw polls at the annual cpac , buoyed by throngs of young libertarians whose views are often at odds with mainline conservatism the video ends as his cpac speech did , with boisterous shouts of ' president paul ! president paul ! ' from a largely young and libertarian - leaning audience
the senator also advocates for limiting the length of time members of congress can serve in washington , and for criminal justice reform â especially in cases where drug users and low - level traffickers have been sentenced to lengthy mandatory - minimum prison terms
unlike cruz , paul has n't weighed in on the indiana and arkansas religious - freedom laws that caused a gay - rights furor
