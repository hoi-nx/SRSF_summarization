however , a recent excavation of a cave in the foothills of the pyrenees mountains in spain is suggesting our ancient cousins , the neanderthal , were more in tune with nature
archaeologists have discovered evidence that neanderthal regularly inhabited the cave of llenes , near senterada in catalonia , around 200,000 years ago but were not alone
the fossilised remains of badgers were found in old dens within the cave alongside neanderthal camps the remains of other canivores including cave bears , hyenas , leopards , wolves and badgers have been found in the cave and were apparently also living there
while some of the bones may have been brought there by the neanderthal themselves , it seems they were also sharing the cave with these other predators
neanderthals , shown in the artist 's impression above , may have lived alongside predators in a cave in spain researchers found several cave bear fossils , similar to the one above , along with scratches on the walls and signs of hibernation nests that suggest they were living in the cave alongside neanderthal 200,000 years ago it is hoped the discoveries will help scientists learn more about neanderthal behaviour and their relationship with the animals they co-existed with
â the researchers discovered large numbers of stone tools made by neanderthal and evidence of camps that were made close to the entrance of the cave
they also found the fossilised bones of bonal tahr â a species of wild sheep that became extinct in western europe 100,000 years ago â which appear to have been hunted by the neanderthal
a 60,000 - year - old multi-purpose bone tool unearthed in france also suggests neanderthal understood how to use bones to make useful devices a recent discovery by researchers at the musã©um national d'histories naturelle in paris suggests that neanderthal may have built homes using the materials they found around them
they discovered a 26 feet wide building created 44,000 years ago from mammoth bones
