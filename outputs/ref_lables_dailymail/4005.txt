after helping sale sharks to a 23 - 6 victory against gloucester last saturday , cipriani has taken advantage of a rare free weekend from rugby by jetting off to dubai for a short break
steve diamond 's side will face london irish , harlequins , newcastle and exeter in the coming weeks as they look to secure a top - six finish and qualification for next season 's champions cup - and a short break looks to be the perfect preparation for cipriani who has been integral to sale 's improved form this season
cipriani fires over a conversion during sale 's 23 - 6 victory against gloucester last saturday cipriani tackles gloucester centre billy twelvetrees during the clash at the aj bell stadium ' we 've not got a squad that can compete with the top four , but at home we 're a good side and it 's difficult ( to come here ) as we 've proven against gloucester , northampton and saracens
cipriani has been in superb form for sale this season and was rewarded with a call - up to stuart lancaster 's squad for the 2015 rbs 6 nations campaign
