that 's why it 's such a shame that what is likely to be ferdinand 's farewell year in the english game has fizzled out
ferdinand pictured in training at rangers last week
the 36 - year - old defender started regularly in the first part of the season but has been unable to hold down his spot in the side ferdinand started the first seven matches of rangers 's premier league campaign before being dropped ferdinand has enjoyed a fantastic career , winning six premier league titles , but a fairytale finish is unlikely ferdinand and ryan giggs lift the champions league for manchester united in moscow back in 2008 ferdinand also won 81 caps for england during his glittering career he would love to be out there , hunting down and hassling opponents , robbing attackers of the ball , winning the aerial duels , playing his part in rangers ' survival mission
once again , the 36 - year - old was forced to watch on from the sidelines as rangers claimed a potentially crucial point away to aston villa on tuesday night
by contrast , ferdinand had started rangers 's first seven games of the campaign , lasting the full 90 minutes in all of them
having called time on his manchester united career after 12 trophy - laden seasons , ferdinand moved to loftus road in what harry redknapp described as a ' remarkable coup for the club
' harry redknapp described ferdinand 's signing last summer as a ' remarkable coup ' for the club but after initial promise , ferdinand has largely spent the season on the bench premier league ( 6 ) : 2002 - 03 , 2006 - 07 , 2007 - 08 , 2008 - 09 , 2010 - 11 , 2012 - 13 fa cup ( 1 ) : 2003 - 04 football league cup ( 2 ) : 2005 - 06 , 2008 - 09 fa community shield ( 5 ) : 2003 , 2007 , 2008 , 2011 , 2013 champions league ( 1 ) : 2007 - 08 fifa club world cup ( 1 ) : 2008 even in his mid-thirties , harry redknapp believed ferdinand would bring ' quality , class , experience and know - how ' as rangers returned to the top flight
he envisaged ferdinand in a sweeper role , the central pivot of a three - man defence in an in - vogue 3 - 5 - 2 system
ferdinand has shown glimpses of his imperious best for rangers this season but ferdinand 's farewell season in english football has not lived up to his expectations chris ramsey has played ferdinand on three occasions since taking over from harry redknapp rangers find themselves two points from safety after their 3 - 3 draw at aston villa on tuesday as you would expect , ferdinand has conducted himself like a model professional on the training ground , maintaining his fitness in case he was called upon
and there have been such occasions , notably the 2 - 0 win at sunderland in february - chris ramsey 's second game in charge after replacing harry redknapp , that ended rangers 's 11 - game losing run on the road
ferdinand may yet be called upon again in the run - in , with rangers sitting two points shy of safety , but the season so far will have fallen short of his hopes and expectations
that fairytale finale , with ferdinand leading an heroic resistance to keep rangers in the premier league , seems unlikely
