glowing tributes were paid yesterday to cricketing legend benaud , after his death at 84 from skin cancer
at lord 's , mcc flags were lowered , and the australian government offered a state funeral for the man who never lost a test cricketer series as his country âs captain , then became a commentator
david cameron said he had â grown up listening to benaud âs wonderful cricket commentary â , while his australian counterpart tony abbott called it â a sad day for australia â
retiring as a player in 1964 , benaud âs masterful analysis was universally revered
here , we reproduce a tribute paid by the mail âs brilliant sports columnist ian wooldridge â which he wrote in 2005 after coverage of live international cricket in england switched from terrestrial to satellite tv , depriving cricket fans of benaud âs voice
benaud in the commentary box at the oval for the final test of the 2005 ashes
thereafter international cricket fans in england lost his genius when live game switched from terrestrial to satellite tv so it is farewell , then , to the master of measured words
benaud will not be returning to england next summer to sustain his pre-eminence as cricket âs finest commentator
that is not merely my judgment
he led his country as captain in 28 of his 63 tests and never lost a series he is meticulous in all things
it is this unrelenting self - discipline , instilled by a schoolmaster and great club cricketer father and a lovely mother â there is a gorgeous picture of her celebrating her 100th birthday with benaud and his test cricketer brother john in the book â that launched him into his dual career life
the first , of course , was in cricket , where to haul oneself from school , to club , to state , the australian team and then its captaincy was a classic climb
benaud led his country in 28 of his 63 tests and never lost a series
in fact , he became the first , in an era when far fewer tests were played , to scale the double of 200 wickets and 2,000 runs
but what next ? all of seven years before he retired from cricket , benaud wondered if there could be a distant future in the communication industry
at the end of australia âs 1956 tour to england , all their players were given three weeks off to enjoy such fleshpots of relaxation as they could discover in the british isles
oâsullevan , voice rising to overdrive at the climax of a horse race , was circumspect about collateral chatter , just as longhurst and â oh i say â maskell knew the value of golden silence
never insult the viewers by telling them what they have seen perfectly clearly themselves
â benaud rings the bell on the pavilion balcony on the second day of the second test between england and australia at lord 's during the 2009 ashes these days if only
has he ever made a bloomer ? of course , like all of us , he has
very few have served the slogging apprenticeship that makes a master cricket commentator .
