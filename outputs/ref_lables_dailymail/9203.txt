a mutilated fox : hardly the most glamorous prop ashley james has ever posed with , but in this case , that is precisely the point
the former made in chelsea star has joined forces with animal rights crusaders peta on a hard - hitting anti-fur campaign directed at harvey nichols after the national department store abandoned its ten - year anti-fur policy
' harvey nichols : here 's the rest of your fur coat , ' the slogan reads , alongside an image of the 26 - year - old animal lover , who is brandishing what appears to be a skinned fox - a fake one we 've been assured
' harvey nichols , which has 12 locations around the world and previously stood against the fur industry , backtracked last year when it quietly re-introduced it
anti-fur : ' i love animals , ' miss ashley james , pictured , tells mailonline
' having educated myself about the fur industry , it breaks my heart to think people allow such cruelty to continue by buying fur products ' boycotter : miss ashley james , pictured in liberty london this week , leads a mostly vegan lifestyle and shops at fur - free stores including liberty london , selfridges , house of fraser , topshop and oasis ' if they know about the industry and still choose to wear fur , then that 's fine - although i ca n't personally understand how they could do that
' however , in a recent exposÃ© fronted by paloma faith , peta went undercover on ' origin assured ' fur farms , a label which is meant to give fur - stocking stores assurances about the animal welfare and conditions in which animals are bred and slaughtered
' party line : in a statement , harvey nichols said , ' we only source products from reputable brands , which includes seeking the assurance that the fur they use in products has been sourced responsibly ' put a name to the face : priced between Â£ 300 and Â£ 1,500 , harvey nichols ' current designer range includes fur from coyotes ( left ) , raccoons ( center ) and foxes ( right ) when mailonline asked reps at harvey nichols to clarify their position on exactly what made them change their minds on their anti-fur policy , communication ceased and they declined to make any further comment
peta 's foundation director mimi bekhechi points out : ' all fur is the product of a bloody , violent industry
' cruelty - free : miss ashley james is a particular fan of designer stella mcartney , who has been a lifelong vegetarian and refuses to even use leather in her collections
