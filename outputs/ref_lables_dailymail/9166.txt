' sailing peacefully across the river , the men men fish without the aid of a rod with this unusual method , first practiced in 960 ad a man releases a cormorant bird , which then dives into the water and retrieves a carp , returning it to the fisherman 's reed raft the fishermen quite literally just take the carp right out of the bird 's mouth after the hungry animals return with their haul these breathtaking early morning images were captured by 45 - year - old viktoriaa rogotneva from st petersburg , russia ' the cormorants then return to the surface of the water , and the fishermen take the fish right out the bird 's beak , ' rogotneva added
the elderly fishermen of guiliin spend between two and three hours on the lake each every morning , and while cormorant fishing only produces about 4kg of carp per day , the men are determined to keep this special practice alive
the images were all shot on the river li in guilin , china , which is in the southern part of the country heading out in the dawn 's light , each man is equipped only with a reed raft , a few trained cormorants and a small kerosene light source the elderly fishermen spend anywhere between two to three hours per day on the lake , despite the low yields from cormorant fishing on average , the men will only produce about 4kg of carp per day , but are still determined to keep this beautiful practice alive = this fishermen bring up the birds from when they are tiny chicks , so the cormorant is more of a pet than a hunter this way of fishing is ' absolutely ecologically safe , ' says rogotneva , who insists that the fishermen catch only as much as they need rogotneva said : ' these fishermen bring up their birds from when they are very small chicks , so you can almost call the cormorant a pet , like you would a dog
