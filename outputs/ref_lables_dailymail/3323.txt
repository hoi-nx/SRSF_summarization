she is now undergoing chemotherapy every three weeks as specialists try to keep the disease at bay
mrs emma hannigan , an author from bray , near dublin , said despite it failing to prevent cancer , she does not regret having preventative surgery

my mother , cathy and ruth were all diagnosed with the faulty gene
