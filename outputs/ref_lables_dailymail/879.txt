deep in injury time , with blackburn âs fa cup journey about to end , simon eastwood appeared for a corner and found the ball at his feet as it dropped from a jumble of players 12 yards out
simon eastwood , oddly , had time and , even more strangely given the melee in the area , he had space , too
as it happened , his right - foot shot on the turn was struck well enough but it was straight at liverpool goalkeeper mignolet , who managed to parry the ball and then grab it as it threatened to spin over the line
we do not blame simon eastwood , of course
but he will wake this morning knowing that a peculiar and romantic part in fa cup folklore could have been his
liverpool celebrated a place in the fa cup semi-finals after beating blackburn , setting up a wembley encounter with aston villa philippe coutinho scored the decisive goal for liverpool with 20 minutes to play in their quarter - final replay at ewood park henderson , toure and allen celebrate after liverpool secured their place in the fa cup semi-finals liverpool manager rodgers celebrates with henderson after his team ousted the championship outfit blackburn players look dejected while liverpool celebrate their progression after a hard - fought quarter - final replay blackburn goalkeeper simon eastwood almost scored a dramatic late equaliser when he went up for a stoppage - time corner blackburn defender kilgallon sinks to the floor at the final whistle after blackburn 's elimination blackburn : simon eastwood , henley , alex baptiste , kilgallon , olsson , evans , williamson , conway ( rudy gestede 65 ) , cairney , ben marshall , jordan rhodes
liverpool : mignolet , johnson , dejan lovren , mamadou sakho ( toure 28 ) , alberto moreno , henderson , lucas , allen , raheem sterling , daniel sturridge ( lambert 85 ) , philippe coutinho
they were losing 1 - 0 at the time and a goal so late on would only have taken them in to extra-time
nevertheless , liverpool will go on to a semi-final date with aston villa knowing that they were almost part of one of the great cup stories â and not in a good way
to have pushed liverpool like that over two games and still have a chance like that means there âs nothing but praise for my players
â over the course of the piece , liverpool deserved their win
without their two best defenders â the suspended pair emre can and martin skrtel â liverpool reverted to a back four and then lost mamadou sakho to injury

liverpool had enjoyed huge swathes of possession but had most of their approach play floundered against blackburn âs defensive barricades manned by the exceptional kilgallon and alex baptiste
liverpool goalkeeper mignolet makes a save onto the post to deny ben marshall giving blackburn the lead blackburn 's cairney is clipped by liverpool defender alberto moreno after evading the spaniard 's challenge now , with the last quarter of the game upon them , blackburn were scenting blood only for philippe coutinho to draw their sting with one of the few moments of stardust quality liverpool managed all night
seeing a 70th minute corner come back to him from a defender , philippe coutinho had the awareness to lay the ball off to henderson and then make a move towards the return
it was this that created the space and the rest â the control and shot across goal in to the corner â was down purely to confidence , touch and purpose
these three qualities had been missing from much of liverpool âs play
