instead of employing european students on working holidays to act as au pairs industry experts want to attract more workers from asia where wages are low
the introduction of asia nannies to australia would go some way to help address the childcare shortage it 's been argued compared with childcare rates of $ 100 a day or more , overseas nannies and au pairs can provide a cheaper and more flexible option for families with more than one child
labor opposition leader shorten says foreign nannies are not the solution for increasing problems with the childcare system â why not provide a Â­ serious opportunity for women for a safe environment where they can learn english and send money home ? â around 10,000 au pairs travel to australia each year

mr shorten says that 's not the way to solve the big challenges in childcare
