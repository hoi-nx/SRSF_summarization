tom lineham scored a treble in a losing cause at castleford last month but his efforts on friday night settled a drab contest at the kc stadium
tom lineham scored two interception tries in an eye - catching hat - trick as hull beat widnes 22 - 8 jamie shaul went over late on to make sure of the two competition points for hull , with tries from kevin brown and patrick ah van unable to prevent widnes from falling to a fifth away defeat out of five
there was no doubt when tom lineham slid over in the corner at the other end after jamie shaul had spun out of a tackle and found his winger with a nice cut - out pass
widnes worked their way downfield and were back level when kevin brown , whose high kick in the build - up appeared to have gone forward off patrick ah van , forced the ball down from dummy half
tom lineham almost turned provider on the hour mark but his wild pass could not be taken in by jamie shaul
widnes , who saw gil dudson held up over the line earlier in the half , gave themselves some hope when patrick ah van finished spectacularly in the corner , but it proved no more than a consolation .
