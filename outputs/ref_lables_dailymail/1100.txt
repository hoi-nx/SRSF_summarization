a ' superhero ' scientist has ventured into one of the most radioactive places in the world - scaling missile defence system towers , getting bitten by ' radioactive ' ants and eating contaminated apples that have grown on trees close to chernobyl 's epicentre
anonymous scientist bionerd has attracted thousands of subscribers to her youtube channel for her visits into the chernobyl exclusion zone , the site of a devastating nuclear explosion 29 years ago on april 26 , 1986 , as she measures the high levels of radiation still lingering in the air
despite this , the daredevil researcher claims she has exposed herself to more radiation swimming in the sea and visiting hospital - and says the most scared she 's felt during her six visits was getting dangerously close to a rabid fox and walking by abandoned , dilapidated buildings
bionerd says visiting the abandoned site is like stepping back in time damage : the broken pressure gauges from the nuclear power station 's control room after the nuclear reactor exploded 29 years ago relaxed : bionerd at the foot of the russian woodpecker radar system - known as the russian woodpecker - in the heart of the chernobyl exclusion zone ' time stopped the moment the reactor blew , and i do n't just mean the readings on the clocks ... and if you embrace it , you can understand the zone 's true meaning
as well as conducting scientific experiments measuring the amount of radiation with her bright yellow geiger counter , bionerd 's videos also show the eeriness of the once thriving and busy area , now abandoned and inhospitable
yet despite the obvious dangers , bionerd says she has exposed herself to more radiation when going for a medical procedure in hospital - and is more likely to get skin cancer by swimming in the sea without wearing sunscreen
' if anything , the medical procedures have exposed me to far greater amounts of radiation than chernobyl ever will , so if i was to have a ' radiation induced cancer ' , i probably got it at the emergency room
1986 , a sudden power surge at the nuclear power plant in chernobyl , near the city of pripyat , led to a huge explosion of the reactor which cast highly radioactive particles into the air
it is one of the most radioactively contaminated areas in the world - but there are still 197 ' samosley ' , or ' illegal residents ' of the area who refused to move out
tourism to the zone is growing , thanks in part to the popularity of video games including call of duty : modern warfare and s.t.a.l.k.e.r. source : wikipedia relaxed : bionerd with her geiger counters measuring radiation in chernobyl
she has visited the site six times to film her experiments radiation : bionerd 's array of geiger counters , which measure the amount of ionizing radiation in the air including alpha particles , beta particles and gamma rays death trap : more dangerous than the radiation , bionerd says , are the derelict buildings on the brink of structural collapse predator : the chernobyl exclusion zone has become popular with wildlife , including this rabies - ridden fox ' it was very stupid of me to go swimming in the sea multiple times without re-applying sun protection , and i hope i wo n't have to pay for this ignorance one day
' i was also carefully looking out for animals , especially as rabies is a big issue in any rural area in the ukraine - and thus , also in the chernobyl exclusion zone , which is a wildlife habitat more than anything else
' her encounter with a rabid fox is one of the few times on bionerd 's youtube videos that you hear genuine panic in her voice , as the wild creature comes dangerously close to her car
reflecting on the impact that nuclear disasters such as chernobyl has had on the surrounding environment , bionerd said she does n't see it as an ' ideal ' energy source
the site has barely been touched since the explosion defiant : bionerd and her colleagues in nuclear reactors five and six over the potential reactor core - right in the heart of chernobyl ( see arrow )

' and while bionerd 's videos are rightly receiving praise from around the world due to their scientific content , many have flocked to praise bionerd 's punk style and good looks
