the likelihood of another coalition lasting five years has been dismissed as miniscule by a leading academic
a second election swiftly after polling day is ' extremely likely ' , professor paul whiteley of the essex university said
britain is likely to face a second election shortly after may 7 because of a knife - edge outcome , political experts have warned ' i do n't see another coalition government lasting five years , ' he said at a briefing by polling experts on the latest election forecasts
mr paul whiteley predicted a repeat of the disastrous left - wing lib - lib pact of the 1970s
' the disastrous pact led to the rise of margaret thatcher and the tories held on to power for another 18 years
experts said the likeliest outcome at the general election would be the conservatives winning the most votes , but a left - wing alliance forming to keep them out of power
there was ' only a 42 per cent chance of a conservative - led government , even though there is a two - thirds chance of the tories being the largest party , on votes or seats
' he added : ' the single most likely outcome is â¦ a seriously hung parliament with the conservatives as clearly the largest party but a majority on the left , including the snp and lib dems
