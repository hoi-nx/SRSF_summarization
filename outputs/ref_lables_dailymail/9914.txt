the news came as an us pollster â who predicted the results of the 2008 us presidential election almost exactly â concluded that both main parties will struggle to cobble together any kind of workable majority
nate silver , who correctly predicted the winner in 49 of 50 us states in 2008 , believes that neither labour or the tories will be unable to get enough support together for a majority government meanwhile a new populus poll found labour unchanged on 34 per cent , while the tories were down one , on 32 per cent
pollster nate silver , who correctly called the winner in 49 of 50 us states in 2008 , yesterday predicted a hung parliament after may 7 with the tories winning 283 seats and labour 274
this means that both david cameron and ed miliband could find it almost impossible to secure enough support from other parties for a working majority â let alone rule on their own
paddy power said mr ed miliband is now more likely than mr david cameron to be prime minister after the election mr nate silver said labour , who have ruled out a formal coalition with the snp , would also be short of a majority even with the help of the scottish nationalists , whom he expects to gain 42 seats mr nate silver said that even if the tories join forces with the lib dems â who he believes will win 27 seats â they would still be 13 short of the 323 mps needed for a majority
