experts ca n't get close enough to determine how deep the mysterious hole is the temperature has been measured at 792c - but that was from two metres away locals told chinese media that they had noticed the ground in the area had been warm underfoot for some time
the hill is not in a volcanic area , and experts from xinjiang meitian geological bureau think the hole is caused by the layer of spontaneously combusted coal underneath the ground , which leads the surface layer to collapse
branches and grass that are held near the hole immediately catch fire from the intense heat experts think a coal seam may have spontaneously combusted below ground chen , a supervisor from xinjiang meitian fire engineering bureau , said there used to be more than a dozen of small coal mines in the area in the 1970s
â primitive mining and extinguishing techniques caused coal to burn deep under the ground , â said mr chen in the same interview
