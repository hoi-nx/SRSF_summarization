a property developer in a wealthy connecticut suburb believes his family are the victims of small - town vengeance which saw his son demoted in the local little league to punish him for threatening the town 's overwhelmingly white ethnic makeup
stefanoni , a 50 - year - old from darien , a town of 21,000 with a median household income of $ 200,000 , says his nine - year old was kicked off his team and put in a lower - ranking one just after he proposed developments involving affordable housing
according to a lawsuit filed by stefanoni , locals are so worried at the prospect of the town 's black population - currently 70 people , or 0.33 per cent - getting any bigger that they hit back through the medium of baseball
small - town fury : stefanoni , 50 , says his nine - year - old son was moved into a lower little league team because his affordable housing homes threatened the ethnic makeup of the extremely white town as well as his son being booted to a lesser team in the league , stefanoni was also banned from coaching
the town and the little league both deny that the goings - on of the little league and stefanoni 's housing plans are linked
u.s. census information says that darien is 94 per cent white , with 620 hispanic residents and fewer than 100 blacks
the town has previously been investigated by the justice department over a policy which gave affordable housing priority to people who already lived and worked in darien
the demotion came just days after stefanoni filed an affordable housing application for property right next to the home of a former league official
according to court documents , league officials say they made a mistake placing the stefanoni 's son on a higher - level team , after the housing application was filed , and corrected the error by moving him to another team
the u.s. justice department in 2010 began investigating whether the town was violating the fair housing act with a zoning policy approved in 2009 that gave top priority for new affordable housing to darien residents and other people with ties to the town , including town employees
connecticut governor dannel malloy has called affordable housing one of the state 's most pressing needs and has committed hundreds of millions of dollars for more affordable housing
in 2010 , darien won a four - year exemption to a state law making it easier for developers to build in towns with less than 10 percent affordable housing and town officials expect to win another after resolving a dispute with the state
darien first selectman jayme stevenson said the town has made significant efforts to increase affordable housing and its housing practices are n't discriminatory
' rob williamson , owner of uncle 's deli in downtown darien , said he does n't believe the town is being discriminatory in rejecting affordable housing applications
