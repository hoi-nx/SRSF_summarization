snp leader sturgeon today hit back at claims from tory former prime minister sir john that she poses a ' real and present danger ' to the uk
in a speech today , sir john claimed the snp would use any power they wield in westminster after the election to foster division and further their dream of the break up of the 300 - year - old union
and he mocked ms sturgeon over her demand to play a role in propping up a labour government , when she is ' not even bothering ' to stand as an mp herself
he warned of ' mayhem ' if the snp holds the balance of power , with a weak labour government open to a ' daily dose of blackmail ' to secure the support of the nationalists in commons votes
the snp would use its role in westminster to bolster support ahead of next year 's scottish parliament elections , when it will put independence back on the agenda , sir john said
the tories hope to capitalise on a damning poll which shows more than half of uk voters want ms sturgeon and her party to play no part in the next government
addressing the scottish trades union congress in ayr , she said that snp mps at westminster could ' vigorously and loudly ' support a future labour government in some areas
the snp leader added : ' john 's comments are silly , over the top and frankly they do n't show him in a particularly good light
' i want the snp to go to westminster to make scotland 's voice heard and also to be a voice for better politics , for the kind of politics that stands in opposition to tory policies of austerity and undermining public services and pushing more people into poverty
' the former prime minister sought to contrast the ' social division ' he said was sown up labour 's politics with the economic competence and ' strongly beating heart ' he said typifies the tories sturgeon is threatening to break up the uk without even ' bothering ' to stand for election to westminster , sir john said today
in a personal attack on the snp leader , sir john cast doubt on the legitimacy of a party which only stands in one part of the country setting the direction of the national government
' what i 'm saying is i do n't think the snp party , whose leader is not even bothering to run for the westminster election , are behaving in a way that is in the interest of the uk , by seeking policies that will break scotland away from the uk
the snp is determined to prise apart the uk
polls continue to show up to half of scotland are planning to back the snp , robbing labour of dozens of seats and depriving mr ed miliband of hopes of a majority
but they have left open the possibility of the snp supporting a labour government on a vote - by - vote basis , raising the prospect of mr ed miliband being forced to bow to their demands to get any legislation through
sir john warned that this will leave the country open to a ' daily dose of blackmail ' as the snp makes fresh demands in return for supporting labour in commons votes
' if labour were to accept an offer of support from the snp , it could put the country on course to a government held to ransom on a vote - by - vote basis , ' sir john said
labour leader ed miliband accused the conservatives and david cameron of ' talking up ' the snp in the hope that the nationalists will win seats from labour north of the border and allow him to ' crawl back ' into 10 downing street
a poll showed just 22 per cent of voters across the uk back the idea of ms sturgeon playing a role in the uk government , with 54 per cent opposed the snp has already suggested that it will be ' entitled to vote against any bit of legislation ' and ' any bit of spending ' it does not agree with
it means that for labour to pass new laws or agree to spending in england , wales or northern ireland they would have to strike a deal with the snp
much of the snp manifesto appeared designed to demonstrate common ground with labour , promising to scrap the bedroom tax , reverse nhs reforms , increase the minimum wage and tackle energy bills
in a series of co-ordinated tory attacks , david cameron warned a labour - snp deal would be a ' match made in hell ' for the uk economy
lord forsyth - who served as scotland secretary in sir john 's government - warned that building up the snp to undermine support for labour in england could ultimately damage the union
however , just 22 per cent of voters across the uk back the idea of ms sturgeon playing a role in the uk government , with 54 per cent opposed
pollsters comres said older uk adults were the most likely to be opposed to snp influence
