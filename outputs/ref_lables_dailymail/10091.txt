at first glance , the rest of our solar system seems to be a pretty barren place - pockmarked worlds with dry surfaces are abundant , and only one - earth - has visible water
nine other worlds in total are now suspected to have some form of subsurface ocean containing far more water than is on earth - and some may even contain life , according to nasa
nasa has released an infographic explaining which worlds in the solar system are thought to have oceans under their surface , such as ceres , seen here
the distance from the sun is given in au , which stands for au - and one au is the distance from earth to the sun the agency released an infographic detailing the various worlds of our solar system suspected to have subsurface oceans
â nasa science activities have provided a wave of amazing findings related to water in recent years that inspire us to continue investigating our origins and the fascinating possibilities for other worlds , and life , in the universe , â she said
â in our lifetime , we may very well finally answer whether we are alone in the solar system and beyond
â there at least 200 billion earth - like planets in our galaxy - and now nasa officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them
â as nasa missions explore our solar system and search for new worlds , they are finding water in surprising places , â the agency said in a statement
in our solar system the gas giant planets - jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune - are thought to contains lots of water in their atmospheres
but it is the solid moons and dwarf planets that are of more interest
for example , scientists using nasa âs hubble space telescope recently provided powerful evidence that jupiter âs moon ganymede has a saltwater , sub-surface ocean , likely sandwiched between two layers of ice
ganymede , meanwhile , has layers of water and ice below its surface scientists using nasa âs hubble space telescope recently provided powerful evidence that jupiter âs moon ganymede has a saltwater , sub-surface ocean , likely sandwiched between two layers of ice
saturn âs moons europa and enceladus are also thought to have an ocean of liquid water beneath their surface , in contact with mineral - rich rock , and may have the three ingredients needed for life as we know it
the dwarf planet ceres , between earth and jupiter , may also have some water - ice on its surface - and water underground
almost of this water has gone today , leaving the world barren and dry towards the outer reaches of the solar system , even neptune 's moon triton and the dwarf planet pluto may have some sort of ocean hiding under their surfaces other moons including callisto , titan , mimas and triton are also thought to have underground oceans , while pluto at the edge of the solar system may , too , be equally wet
and if these worlds are proven to have water , it stands to reason that others outside the solar system may also have oceans , either underground or on their surface
â it 's easy to forget that the story of earth 's water , from gentle rains to raging rivers , is intimately connected to the larger story of our solar system and beyond , â nasa said in a statement
â but our water came from somewhere - every world in our solar system got its water from the same shared source
