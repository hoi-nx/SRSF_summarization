wylie brys and his dad , dallas zookeper tim brys , were digging for fossils near a grocery store when wylie brys found the dinosaur bones a five - year - old boy in dallas has had the once - in - a - lifetime opportunity of discovering 100million - year - old dinosaur bones while searching for fossils with his dad
wylie brys was digging with his dad , tim brys , back in september at a construction site near a mansfield , texas , grocery store when he made the ancient discovery
' he walked up ahead of me and found a piece of bone , ' dallas zookeeper wylie brys said
and now , scientists from southern methodist university have helped a dallas zookeeper and his 5 - year - old son excavate the fossil
tim brys and his son wylie brys worked at the excavation site tuesday to dig up what paleontology professor winkler believes could be a nodosaur , a pony - sized dinosaur that dwelled on land
though wylie brys and wylie discovered the fossil last september , it took over seven months to obtain necessary permits to dig up the bones
at the time , the zookeeper , who often leisurely digs for fossils with his son , was not sure what wylie brys , then four years old , had found

it 's believed that the bones wylie brys found belong to a nodosaur , a a pony - sized herbivore with scaly , plated skin the two kept digging because they knew there was a chance of finding jurassic period marine life remnants in the area
