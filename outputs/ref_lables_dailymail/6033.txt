a study of wildlife sites across four english counties has found that most are home to fewer species of bee today than they were in the past
it found that the expansion of farmland has actually been more damaging to britain âs bee population than the concreting over of the countryside for housing
a reading university researcher has said that bees prefer cities to fields ( honey bees in paris shown )
the expansion of farmland has actually been damaging to bee population , according to the researcher
wildlife sites in four english counties saw bee species decrease for instance , heaths and meadows near milton keynes now boast more species of bee than sites in more rural areas
reading university researcher dr deepa senapathi believes intensive agriculture is to blame
â urban areas may benefit bees more than farmland by providing a wide variety of flowering plants , providing a cosmopolitan menu for insects from spring through to autumn
while the gardens , parks and churchyards of towns and cities provide bees with a variety of plants to forage on and an extended flowering season , popular crops such as oilseed rape only bloom for a few weeks ( stock image of honey bee shown )
