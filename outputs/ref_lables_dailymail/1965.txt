hull kr have plugged the gap created by the loss of front row pair michael weyman and ryan bailey with the capture of experienced australian forward dane tilse from canberra raiders
the 6ft 7in , 17st - plus tilse has signed a two - and - a - half - year contract with the robins and will join them as soon as he receives the necessary paperwork after the canberra raiders agreed to release him
dane tilse , 30 , who has made 200 appearances down under , will link up with his old canberra team - mate terry campese , the new hull kr captain who on tuesday signed a two - year contract extension , and is a like - for - like replacement for michael weyman , who announced his retirement due to injury last month
australian forward dane tilse will move from canberra raiders to hull kr on a two - and - a - half - year deal the canberra raiders have agreed to release the 6ft 7in forward and only paperwork delays his start for the robins rovers , who have appointed former england captain jamie peacock as their football manager for 2016 , were further depleted in the front row when they agreed to release ex-leeds prop ryan bailey for personal reasons
dane tilse comes in after the sudden retirement of michael weyman and ryan bailey 's departure hull kr head coach chris chester , who had been linked with a move for tilse 's canberra team - mate david shillington , said : ' it 's no secret that we 've been short on numbers in the front row after the departures of mick and ryan bailey and we wanted to strengthen in that area
' dane tilse , a former junior kangaroo who was an ever - present for canberra in both 2013 and 2014 , said he spoke to former hull kr hooker josh hodgson , who joined the canberra raiders at the end of last season , before finalising the move
dane tilse will link up with his former canberra raiders team - mate terry campese , the new hull kr captain ' it 's a different style of game in super league , it 's not so much about the wrestle and defence like the nrl , so i 'm looking forward to a fresh start
