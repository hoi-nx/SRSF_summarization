whether he 's your coach , manager or interim , benitez wins trophies
his napoli side 's 4 - 1 demolition of wolfsburg in the europa league quarter final last night gave that ominous feeling that silverware is once again within his grasp
he may be demanding , occasionally abrasive and often expensive but ultimately benitez gets results
since 2002 , benitez has won 12 trophies with valencia , liverpool , inter milan , chelsea and napoli
napoli manager benitez saw his side beat wolfsburg 4 - 1 in the europa league gonzalo higuain and benitez celebrate after beating wolfsburg in germany the 55 - year - old is out of contract this summer and it makes him a man in demand
manchester city , paris st germain and real madrid are all considering changes as are west ham and newcastle
manchester city , should they dispense with manuel pellegrini , ultimately want pep guardiola ; his contract at bayern makes that difficult though and patrick vieira 's inexperience leaves them with a dilemma
yet , barcelona , liverpool and manchester united may not have danced through manchester city 's midfield so easily in recent weeks had he been in charge
benitez has won the europa league / europa league twice with valencia and chelsea preparation is everything to him , almost laborious
when chelsea beat benfica in the europa league final of 2013 , juan mata revealed how benitez had told them to target the back post where benfica goalkeeper artur was vulnerable
giving players a cuddle has never been benitez 's forte , nor saying that he loves them but he does give them a platform to improve
benitez famously guided liverpool to the champions league in 2005 benitez won the fa cup with liverpool in 2006 on penalties against west ham javier mascherano was told exactly where and how he would play as he and xabi alonso brought the best out of steven gerrard , juan mata excelled at chelsea , david luiz grew and jose callejon has transformed from an Â£ 8m real madrid squad player to one now valued at Â£ 20m by napoli
benitez loves a project and would relish being an underdog biting at the coat tails of the premier league 's elite
it may sound familiar to liverpool fans but he still looks like delivering napoli 's first european semi final for 25 years and champions league qualification remains in sight
benitez got the best out of juan mata during his time at chelsea jose callejon has been transformed from a squad player at real madrid to a star at napoli under benitez life has not been easy at napoli but for now he will endeavour to finish on a high
' we put in great games against roma and lazio , yet played worse against fiorentina and won 3 - 0 , ' said benitez
' sam allardyce 's future at west ham is uncertain as is manuel pellegrini 's at manchester city and benitez could be considered by both clubs should they be in the need for a new manager asked about his future he emphasised the need for change should he stay in italy
