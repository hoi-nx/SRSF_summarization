after a heavy night of drinking , your immune system is bound to be weaker
this is because your body is under oxidative stress - a process that can also happen after smoking , breathing in pollution and even sunbathing
now , for the first time , researchers have shown that higher doses of vitamin e , found in foods such as kale and almonds , can mitigate the stress on immune cells
now , for the first time , researchers have shown that higher doses of vitamin e found in foods such as kale ( left ) and almonds , can mitigate the stress on immune cells whenever a virus or other pathogen enters our bodies , a certain class of immune cells - the t cells0 jump into action , spreading rapidly
but this immune response does not work if significant oxidative stress is damaging the t cells and depriving the body of the tools it needs to repair them , according to a new study
oxidative damage has been implicated in the cause of many diseases , such as cancer and alzheimer 's and has an impact on the body 's aging process
source : netdoctor when testing mice whose immune cells lacked the repair enzyme , researchers led by kopf , a professor at eth zurich , were able to save the immune cells by mixing a high dose of vitamin e into the animals ' food
at 500 milligrams per kilogram of mouse feed , this quantity of vitamin e was ten times higher than was present in their normal food
with little scientific evidence as yet making a strong case for vitamin supplements , he felt their study was all the more interesting because it proved the effectiveness of vitamin e ' our work shows that even a genetic defect in a major part of a cell 's antioxidative machinery can be compensated for by delivering a high dose of vitamin e. that is new and surprising
but he added a supplement of vitamin e or other liposoluble antioxidants could well make sense in the event of oxidative stress , which can arise in everyday situations such as an infection or exposure to sunlight .
