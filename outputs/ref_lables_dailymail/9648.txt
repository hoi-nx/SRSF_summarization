an afghanistan interpreter who risked his life on the front line with uk troops was shot with his two - year - old son by taliban hitmen after he says he was â abandoned â by the british government
the 26 - year - old , who was known as â chris â by uk soldiers , was hit in the leg when gunmen opened fire near his home in khost , eastern afghanistan
his son muhammad also sustained injuries in the attack , which chris says was the latest in a series of attempts to kill or kidnap him because of his time spent helping the british government â which now wo nât let him come to the uk
shot : ' chris ' the interpreter ( left ) and his son muhammad ( right ) was badly injured by taliban gunmen near their home in khost , eastern afghanistan
he said it is one of several attempts made to kill or kidnap him during more than three years with uk forces , chris worked with elite units including the sas , marines and parachute regiment
the father - of - two , who spent two months in hospital after the shooting , said he has taken evidence of threats to uk authorities on ten occasions â but has repeatedly been dismissed and told merely to take more security precautions
he said : â i worked outside military bases with uk forces where i took huge personal risk on a daily basis â i served with distinction , placing myself in mortal danger to save my uk colleagues
â my family and i have experienced a serious threat to life as a consequence of working for the uk , resulting â most recently â in me being shot on december 26 when the taliban came to my village looking for me
â chris â who worked for uk forces between october 2008 and april 2011 â claims that uk commanders are aware that he was forced to stop working for the soldiers because of threats to his family made by the taliban
chris says they are at risk but that his concerns have been dismissed by the uk government danger : despite attacks such as this , the majority of frontline interpreters who want to build new lives in the uk do not qualify for the immigration scheme but like the majority of frontline translators who want to build new lives in the uk , chris does not qualify for an immigration scheme because of his dates of service
so far just one of more than 300 afghanistan interpreters who say they have been threatened by the taliban because of their work with uk soldiers has been given a uk visa
last night , as it emerged that a taliban thug suspected of murder in afghanistan has won the right to stay in uk on human rights grounds , rafi â who is leading the fight to help other interpreters stay in the uk â said : â human rights ? do only criminals and those who have killed uk soldiers and translators have human rights ? doors are opened to them but closed to us
just one of more than 300 afghanistan interpreters who say they have been threatened by taliban because of their work has been given a uk visa lawyers will point out that the shooting is just one of scores of occasions when interpreters have been targeted â it is disgusting the way we are being treated
we are not even being treated like human beings , my colleagues have to live in the shadows with their families looking over their shoulders constantly in fear of death whereas the taliban are being allowed to stay with all the benefits from the uk taxpayer
â rafi , who fears giving his full name , was blown up by the taliban in a blast that killed a uk officer
a judicial review brought by rafi and one other afghanistan interpreter is to challenge whether the government complied with its statutory obligations towards hundreds of translators â and the attack on chris and his son earlier this year will be highlighted
six were murdered by the taliban while on leave and five are said to have been hunted down since uk forces left
they claim the threat of violent reprisals from the taliban has grown since uk forces withdrew from afghanistan and that many are in hiding unable to work and having to move regularly to escape assassination units
