deputy pm clegg said control of the department for education would be a key demand of any new power - sharing deal the lib dems could seize control of the nation 's schools in a coalition deal to erase michael gove 's ' zany ' ideas from the classroom , clegg signalled today
mr clegg said he wanted to avoid a repeat of battling against the ' ideological gimmicks ' of mr michael gove , who was the first tory education secretary when the coalition was formed in 2010
mr clegg repeatedly clashed with mr michael gove over his education reforms , including tory plans to scrap gcses and a lib dems scheme to provide free school meals to under - 7s
mr michael gove was demoted from running the ministry in last year 's cabinet reshuffle to become tory chief whip
in the 2010 - 15 coalition , the lib dems ran three departments : business , energy and climate change and the scotland office
however , senior lib dems dems believe the party should have demanded one of the key departments running public services , like health or education
asked if it was the kind of cabinet post he wanted , he said : ' i would , particularly having wasted a lot of time dealing with a lot of zany , ideological gimmicks from michael gove and his team
' it would be a good thing if the lib dems were able to run education policy on our own terms , not least because we are the only party which is prepared to give the schools , colleges and nurseries the means that they need to absorb 400,000 new youngsters in our education system over the next five years
mr clegg said he wanted to ' get politics out of the classroom '
other measures include curbing some of the reforms put in place by mr michael gove , with the lib dems insisting that all teachers in state - funded schools - including academies and free schools - have qualified status or are working towards it
michael gove was demoted from running the department for education in last year 's cabinet reshuffle to become tory chief whip the lib dems have also committed to increase funding for the education budget for two to 19 - year - olds by 2020 , ensuring that the amount of cash per pupil would be protected in real terms
a friend of mr michael gove said : ' by zany and ideological , does clegg mean teaching children to spell properly and do their times tables ? ' or making exams harder ? or training teachers in schools rather than left - wing colleges dominated by the unions ? either he 's lost the plot or he 's lying again , as he did on tuition fees
