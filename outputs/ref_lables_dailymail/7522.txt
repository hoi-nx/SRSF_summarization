there is an old wives ' tale that says the best way to tackle red wine stains on carpets and clothes is to cover them in white wine
in a video , a scientist has revealed how gin and vodka dilute red wine stains , why vinegar is so good at removing mineral deposits on glass , and how spit tackles stubborn food stains in your kitchen
when higher concentrations of clear alcohol , such as gin , vodka or white rum , are poured onto the stain , the colours dissolve into the liquid rather than drying into the carpet
these can then be soaked up using a paper towel the video was created by the washington - based american chemical society ( american chemical society ) as part of its reactions series
it covers three household cleaning ' hacks ' for windows , carpets and counter tops
the first reveals an alternative to window cleaner is to add two cups of water and a quarter cup of 70 per cent rubbing alcohol to an empty spray bottle
as the video explained : ' vinegar is a fantastic cleaner and the secret to its cleaning capacity is acetic acid
' gin : pour gin , or another high - proof clear liquor , onto a red wine stain and soak it up with a cloth
spit : your own spit can be used to lift food stains from counter tops or hard surfaces
brazil nuts : also effective on wood surfaces
because of this acidity , vinegar â eats away â at mineral deposits on windows including moisture and dust , while the rubbing alcohol absorbs greasy dirt like fingerprints
onto red wine stains in fabrics , the video said the key is to ' act fast and grab a bottle of the nearest high proof clear liquor '
this can be vodka , gin or white rum , but the important part is that whichever drink is chosen it must be higher proof than the wine that has been spilled
red wine is red because of pigments known as anthocyanins , which are alcohol soluble
as more alcohol is poured onto to the stain , the red colour dilutes completely and can be soaked up
american chemical society advise pouring plain water onto the carpet once the alcohol has been soaked up to remove the smell
elsewhere , if there is a hard food stain on a countertop or hard floor , american chemical society suggest using spit to remove it
' you may have noticed when you eat certain starchy foods like potatoes or crackers that they have a slightly sweet taste when you chew them , ' said american chemical society
' that âs the amylase in action and the same principle can be used to break down food spills

' acetic acid sits at a 2.4 on the ph scale making it very acidic ' ( pictured ) because of this acidity , vinegar â eats away â at mineral deposits on windows including moisture and dust , while rubbing alcohol ( pictured ) absorbs greasy dirt like fingerprints , said the chemist even the weakest levels of acid can dissolve and loosen the hydrated iron oxides found in rust
these foods can also replace the rust with a thin film of smooth hard oxide on the surface of the iron , to help it resist further hydrated oxidation
to remove hard food stains on a countertop or hard floor , american chemical society suggests using spit to remove it
' you may have noticed when you eat certain starchy foods like potatoes that they have a slightly sweet taste when you chew them , ' said american chemical society
