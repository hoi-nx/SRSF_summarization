on may 23 , 2010 , bride - to - be rachelle was pushed into a pool
as paramedics rushed around her , friends wept , and her fiancÃ© frantically phoned from three hours away , rachelle had one question : could she still have kids ? ' it was the first thing i thought of , ' rachelle told dailymail.com
but ever since i fell in love with chris i wanted to have babies with him
when i fell in the pool and they were saying things like " paralyzed " , i did n't know if i 'd be able to carry a child
rachelle and chris chapman will welcome their baby girl into the world on april 18 , thanks to an old friend who asked them to let her be their surrogate
so laurel , whose husband and son are pictured ( left ) , offered to carry the child for them the baby will be born near laurel 's home in asheville , north carolina , four hours from the chapmans rachelle had n't seen laurel for nine years but laurel , touched by her story , reached out on facebook chris and rachelle confessed they are nervous but excited to welcome the girl , whose name they wo n't reveal ' we are both so excited , ' rachelle said
' though quadriplegic , rachelle , 29 , is able to conceive and carry a child
unable to stop taking the medication , which could be damaging to a fetus , she and chris , 32 , started exploring other options
she wrote a blog post on her website about contemplating surrogacy - and a friend from college , laurel humes , got in touch
i met laurel at college through chris but she was a bit older than me and graduated that year
' rachelle and chris flew from their home in raleigh , north carolina , to surrogacy together in california to be assessed and start the process
half a decade 's difference : rachelle and chris pictured ( left ) before she fell into a pool on during her bachelorette party
now , rachelle and laurel ( right ) have reached a situation neither anticipated they have built a crib which rachelle can wheel under , and turned chris 's man cave into a nursery this is the ultrasound picture of the baby
chris , rachelle and laurel all went to the ultrasound together despite the narrow odds , they conceived after the first try
' unfortunately we have n't had that much time with laurel and the baby , ' rachelle explains
' chris said he never contemplated that their wedding would n't go ahead after rachelle fell the pair have been dedicated to publicizing their situation to increase awareness about quadriplegia but everything is in order
they have built a wheelchair - friendly crib that lets rachelle wheel herself under it
aside from some pictures on the wall , the nursery - formerly chris 's ' man cave ' - is looking baby - ready
' laurel 's due date is april 18 , the day after chris , a teacher , finishes school
