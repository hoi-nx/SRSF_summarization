masters champion spieth is back to work this week at the rbc heritage classic after two days celebrating his victory at augusta national and being showered with attention
spieth arrived at sea pines resort late tuesday night after a media whirlwind in new york since tying tiger woods ' masters record of 18 - under 270 to capture the green jacket
the 21 - year - old said it was a dizzying stretch with 26 appearances and interviews in 25 hours
spieth does n't believe the success will change him
in fact , he said he upheld his commitment to the rbc heritage classic in part to chase down rory mcilroy for world no. 1
' i would n't come to a tournament just to come to a tournament , especially with that goal still in mind , ' said spieth , who moved to no. 2 in the world rankings with the masters ' win
spieth returns to golf just days after winning the masters and will play in the rbc heritage classic spieth has had two victories and two runner - up finishes in his past four events
' i 'm sure spieth 's wiped , ' said streelman , the par - 3 contest winner at augusta national last week who finished tied for 12th behind spieth
' spieth has had success here the previous two years , finishing ninth in 2013 and 12th last year
the rbc heritage classic gave him an invite two years ago when spieth was a rising , yet largely unknown 19 - year - old trying to make his way on tour
the top - 10 finish , spieth said , helped his confidence and status on the pga tour
' the 21 - year - old was in formidable form at augusta national and equaled tiger woods ' tournament birdie record most masters champions - and many of the game 's best players - take the next week off after a pressure - packed week at augusta national
spieth celebrates after putting the winning hole and winning the masters at such a young age there have only been two masters winners the past 15 years to follow up their victories by playing harbour town
