lauren crawley was given a new platinum implant facial palsy , or weakness of the facial muscles , can stop the patient 's eyelids closing properly
lauren crawley , 54 , a housewife from kings langley , hertfordshire , was given a new platinum implant that makes it easier to blink again , as she tells thea jourdan
the patient a few years ago i started losing my sense of balance and developed tinnitus - my gp referred me for scans which showed i had a large but benign brain tumour behind my left ear
surgery was the only option
thankfully the operation , in july 2012 , was a success
but my facial nerve , which was wrapped around the tumour , was damaged
i 'd been warned that facial palsy could be a side - effect , but it was still a shock seeing my face in the mirror - the left side was droopy
i 'd lost the hearing in my left ear as well as my sense of taste , and my mouth became dry
eating and speaking were difficult - and , worst of all , my left eye was permanently open and i could n't even blink with it
i tried lots of things to improve the muscle tone , including facial massages , taught by a physiotherapist
after a year , it was clear the nerve would never work again so i was referred to raman malhotra , a plastic surgeon at the facial palsy clinic at the queen victoria hospital
he explained he could put a special platinum chain into my eyelid which would weigh it down and help it close by itself - i 'd be able to open the eye easily because the muscle controlling this was n't affected
apparently , surgeons used to use gold , but platinum is better because it does n't irritate the eye 's inside lining
it is also more dense than gold , so you need only a thin chain , which meant people would barely see the implant through my eyelid
surgery for a benign brain tumour behind her left ear damaged a facial nerve wrapped around it my eye was wide open as they injected anaesthetic into my eyelid and the skin around my eye , then made lots of tiny stitches into my eyelid to hold the chain in place
i ca n't feel the implant , no one can see it , and i can blink normally
the procedure has made me look more normal - people do n't stare as much
around 100,000 people in britain have facial palsy
it can be caused by a stroke , if the stroke affects the area of the brain that sends signals to the facial nerve
it can also be a result of traumatic injury , damage after surgery , or simply because of a virus damaging the facial nerve - this happens in bell 's palsy , which affects more than 28,000 people a year
facial palsy affects not just appearance , but lots of functions , too
the facial nerve - which rises from the bottom of the brain on both sides , then sends branches across the face - controls the tongue 's taste buds , for instance , and the salivary glands , so patients may suffer from dry mouth
most also have difficulty blinking , because the nerve controls the muscle that makes the eye blink shut
while many patients will recover , with symptoms easing within eight weeks , lauren crawley 's facial nerve was too damaged to regain function
the left side of her face was droopy - until now i helped design a special system of individual links of platinum which we can join together with nylon to create a chain of the desired length and weight
for lauren crawley , i used three links weighing 0.4g each
first , we anaesthetised the skin around lauren crawley 's eye
when lauren crawley wanted to blink , her brain switched off the levator muscle , which keeps the eyelid wide open
the corresponding muscle , the orbicularis occuli muscle , which should pull the eyelid down , does not work in lauren crawley 's case because it is controlled by the facial nerve
although it was n't a perfect solution - at first , lauren crawley 's eye closed more slowly than a fully functioning eyelid - at least she could blink again
i hope the implant will last lauren crawley a lifetime and that platinum implants will become the treatment of choice
