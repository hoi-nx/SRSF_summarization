city bounced back from their recent 4 - 2 derby defeat by easing to victory against west ham
an own goal by james collins and sergio aguero 's 20th premier league strike of the season was enough to give city the three points
city ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) joe hart 6 - the england goalkeeper could nât have wished for a quieter 28th birthday , and was rarely called into action by a toothless west ham
city right back pablo zabaleta keeps enner valencia at bay by putting in a crunching challenge martin demichelis 6 â careless slip let in carlton cole in the first half but otherwise looked relatively comfortable alongside a new defensive partner in eliaquim mangala
eliaquim mangala 7 - dominant display from city âs Â£ 32million defender who was able to enjoy a trouble - free return to the line - up , and snuffed out the few threats offered by the west ham
city midfielder lampard was given a rare chance to impress by starting against west ham fernando 6.5 â did nât have too much on his plate but was alert to track kouyate âs burst from midfield in the first half and produced a fantastic interception tackle
jesus navas played a major role in city 's two goals at the etihad stadium yaya toure 7 â a more lively display than of late from the much - maligned ivorian who passed the ball well and his interception started the move for city âs second goal
sergio aguero 7.5 â the argentine âs third goal in two games took his total to 26 for the season , and the top of the premier league scoring charts with 20
sergio aguero celebrates with city team - mates jesus navas and yaya toure after putting his side 2 - 0 up city ace sergio aguero wheels away in celebration after scoring his 20th premier league goal subs : caballero , sagna , boyata , fernandinho ( for lampard 88 ) , nasri ( for silva , 6 ) , dzeko ( for sergio aguero 90 +1 ) , pozo
scorers : james collins og 18 , sergio aguero 36 booked : jesus navas , silva west ham ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) adrian 6 â had little chance with either of city âs goals , particularly james collins âs own - goal which looped over his head and in off the underside of the bar
carl jenkinson 6 â one of west ham âs better defenders and produced an excellent interception to deny sergio aguero an almost certain goal in the second half
west ham centre back james collins diverted the ball past adrian to give city an early lead winston reid 5.5 â did his best to hold city at bay but guilty of an awful dive in the dying stages that was thankfully ignored by the referee and ridiculed by the city fans
downing 4.5 â lost the ball in the build - up to city âs second goal and that summed up his performance
carlton cole failed to impress on his first start since his side 's 0 - 0 draw with southampton in february subs : nolan ( for cole 66 , 6 ) , jarvis ( for song 66 , 6 ) , nene , oâbrien , amalfitano , jaaskelainen , burke
