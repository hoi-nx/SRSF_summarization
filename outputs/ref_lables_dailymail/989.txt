â tettey âs mistake could prove costly in one of the most exciting end - of - season run - ins after it ended a run of eight games unbeaten for his side
the strong away contingent had settled easily in norwich âs riverside stadium entertainment park ahead of kick - off and their team comfortably matched them on the pitch , in unfamiliar surroundings away from their riverside stadium , in the opening exchanges

it peaked in the final few moments when , from one of those corners , middlesbrough defender ben gibson threw himself in front of russell martin âs volley to prevent what would have been a certain goal
