the police van in which gray supposedly sustained his fatal injuries does not come with a bolt sticking out from the back door , chevrolet has confirmed
designs from the car maker show that the chevrolet express - the vehicle used by the baltimore police - is smooth on the inside of both cage doors
the development raises a number of questions about the official account put out by the force which emerged today in a report of its internal investigation into gray 's death
in their report abc said that there was ' no evidence ' gray sustained a fatal spine injury during his arrest , which was caught on camera on a street side on april 12
instead he supposedly broke his neck after falling head - first whilst being transported in one of the baltimore police vans , a chevrolet express
gray 's ' catastrophic ' head injuries were consistent with hitting a bolt ' in the back door of the van ' , the report said
fatal fall ? the van is pictured above during a previously - undisclosed stop dead : gray is pictured above being arrested by baltimore officers on the day he severed his spine in custody according to abc 's sources gray was standing in the van and was bent over with his hand cuffed behind his back and his head pointing towards the back door
a picture taken by the associated press of the van in which gray was carried shows that the right hand side door is smooth and does not have a bolt sticking out of it
