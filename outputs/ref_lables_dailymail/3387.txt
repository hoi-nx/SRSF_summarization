atletico madrid and real madrid could n't be separated in the first leg of their champions league quarter - final showdown on tuesday
here , sportsmail rates the players in the first leg of the champions league quarter - final at the vicente calderon
atletico madrid jan oblak 9 - blocked everything in the first half as a wind - assisted real madrid looked like putting the tie beyond doubt in the first 45 minutes
atletico madrid goalkeeper jan oblak made a big save to deny gareth bale in the early minutes juanfran 7 - he was rattled , along with the rest of the team , in the first half but he played his part in keeping atletico madrid at bay
miranda not have put any watching suitors off with another solid display alongside godin - that is the third time this season real have failed to score against atletico madrid at the vicente calderon and miranda is a major reason for that
godin 7 - a rare slip early on let gareth bale in but the welshman failed to punish the uruguayan and he recovered well to marshall the team to another clean sheet against the european champions
atletico madrid centre - back godin rises higher than sergio ramos to attempt a header on goal siqueira 6 - no mystery why diego simeone wants felipe luis back at the club next season
mario suarez 6 - forced a fine second - half save from iker casillas but was just as blown away by real madrid in the first 45 minutes
gabi 6-simeone 's soldier worked hard in defence in the first period but maybe lacked invention in the second period as atletico madrid took the initiative
ronaldo is crowded out by atletico madrid 's mario suarez ( left ) and gabi koke 6 - currently struggling to live up to those ' new xavi ' tags
still a tremendous prospect and gave as good as he got against real madrid 's trio of luka modric , james and toni kroos
real madrid iker casillas 7 - stayed awake in the first half as real madrid poured forward but atletico madrid still threatened on the break
iker casillas makes a save as atletico madrid striker fernando torres goes for the ball carvajal 7 - was used as an auxiliary winger in the first 45 minutes as real madrid tried to take advantage of siqueira âs weakness
raphael varane 8 - real madrid 's best performer
when pepe pulled out before the start of the game many real madrid fans would have feared the worst but raphael varane never put a foot wrong
raphael varane was in excellent form for real madrid in defence at the vicente calderon sergio ramos 6 - left trailing in griezmann âs wake early on but was a match for mandzukic
still the most complete midfielder that real madrid have and they were never going to lose 4 - 0 as they did in february without him
luka modric was majestic in the first half for real madrid , but he faded along with the team in the second toni kroos 6 - a shame that he has less license to attack in his current incarnation as atletico madrid âs holder
covered ground , got real madrid passing and still managed a shot that jan oblak saved , but would n't he have more influence on games if he played slightly further forward ? james rodriguez 6 - only just back from injury and it showed in the second half
gareth bale 7 - provided cross after cross in the first half as he tormented siqueira but they came to nothing and real madrid were left to rue the chance he had when godin slipped and he was through on jan oblak âs goal
gareth bale missed an excellent opportunity to give real madrid the lead and a priceless away goal karim benzema 5-struggles to score against atletico madrid and was taken off in the second half as he once again failed to puncture their rearguard
ronaldo 6 - had several free - kicks in the first half that failed to trouble jan oblak , also failed to connect with those excellent first - half crosses from gareth bale
ronaldo was just as responsible as gareth bale and karim benzema for that
