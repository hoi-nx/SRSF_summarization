sturgeon has warned david cameron she will trigger a second scotland independence referendum if he tries to take britain to the eu exit door
the steely first minister , in her first interview with the daily mail on the day of her election manifesto launch , said for the first time that she would regard an ' out ' vote in the tory ' proposed poll on eu membership as justification to reopen the question of breaking up the britain
in a wide - ranging interview , the first minister , riding high on polls suggesting the snp is on the brink of a landslide unprecedented in modern britain politics : miss sturgeon also revealed that she - not her predecessor salmond - would take charge of any talks , even though she is not running for a westminster seat and he is the scotland first minister addressed supporters at an snp rally at a indoor mountain climbing centre in edinburgh miss sturgeon 's manifesto included proposals to seek to thwart the tory ' planned in / out eu referendum by 2017 , the first time voters would have had a say on our place in europe for 40 years
she said snp mps would seek to amend an eu referendum bill to insist on a ' double majority ' - meaning that unless england , scotland , wales and northern ireland each vote to leave the eu , the britain would remain a member state
the first minister , who has previously said merely that ' something substantial ' would have to change before the snp held a second independence referendum , said a tory government seeking to take scotland out of the eu against its will would be a trigger
david cameron speaks to supporters during a conservative party rally in sandymoor , cheshire miss sturgeon told the daily mail that an eu exit would be ' something substantive ... change in circumstances ' that would mean a second scotland independence referendum was necessary
' it 's if there was an out vote across the britain and scotland wants to stay in
' miss sturgeon , who received a rock star welcome from party faithful as she launched her blueprint for power near edinburgh yesterday , was scathing about labour 's economic plans
the prime minister today warned that miss sturgeon would hold the britain to ' ransom ' if the snp holds the balance of power in may the snp have vowed never to strike a deal to keep david cameron in number 10 - whatever the result of the election ' we will prevail on some things , we wo n't prevail on others
' the first minister said she had been ' surprised ' by messages of support from people in england and wales who said they wished they could vote snp
as a proportion of everyone in england it was a tiny proportion but it was a lot - i still get a lot of emails saying " we wish we could vote snp "
' ed miliband insisted he would not be held to ransom by the snp asked about voters ' fears in the rest of the britain at the prospect of a separatist party wielding power , which led to the daily mail dubbing her ' the most dangerous woman in britain ' , she joked : ' i thought it was possibly one of the nicest things the daily mail had ever said about me
' brandishing a picture in her manifesto of her hugging a small child on the campaign trail , she asked : ' do i look like one of the most dangerous women in britain ? come on ! i do n't think that 's how people in england see the snp
' that 's not to say they agree with us on independence - many do , but many do n't - but i do n't think many people in england see the snp as this big bogeyman threat
' if there are some people that do , i take my responsibility seriously to persuade them that they are wrong and i do accept that i have a big responsibility in how i conduct the campaign and how i speak to people both in and outside scotland to persuade people that there 's not anything to be scared of from having the snp in big numbers both inside and outside scotland
' she insisted that she - not mr salmond or the snp 's westminster leader angus robertson - would lead hung parliament negotiations if , as polls predict , the party takes as many as 50 seats and holds the balance of power at westminster
' miss sturgeon denied that a hung parliament , led by a minority labour government propped up vote - by - vote by the snp , would be a recipe for chaos which would further undermine voters ' trust in parliament
' my experience of being in a minority government - and it 's a very direct experience of being deputy leader in a minority government for four years ... it can , contrary to what you are saying about reducing trust in politics , can have the opposite effect because the public see politicians having to win arguments rather than votes by sheer force of numbers
the experience of minority government in scotland was stable - clearly , because it lasted for four years
' miss sturgeon said the coalition 's fixed term parliaments legislation would strengthen the snp 's hand
two - thirds of mps now have to back an earlier election , and governments can lose votes on budgets , queen 's speeches and other key legislation without it being seen as a vote of no confidence and triggering an election
' miss sturgeon said she had been surprised to be told that the prime minister was not prepared to sit alongside her at the end of their separate interviews on sunday 's andrew marr , as guests traditionally do
