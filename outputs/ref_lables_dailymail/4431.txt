peering into the heart of the milky way , astronomers have spotted the ' howls ' of dead stars as they feed on stellar companions
these zombie stars are thought to be leaving a ' mass grave ' of white dwarf stars near the centre of the milky way
but why there are so many of these stars here - which are left behind when a larger star runs out of fuel - remains a mystery
the smaller circle shows the center of our galaxy where the nustar image was taken the finding , published in nature , was made by scientists at haverford college in pennsylvania , us using nasa 's nustar telescope
' we ca n't definitively explain the x-ray signal yet - it 's a mystery
smaller stars , though , will shed their outer layers and leave behind a hot dense core â known as a white dwarf
when they peered at the galactic centre , they found an emission of x-rays that corresponded to thousands of dead stars being present
scientists at haverford college in pennsylvania say they have spotted x-ray emissions consistent with thousands of white dwarfs ( one illustrated centre ) at the galaxy 's centre
these are stars left behind after larger ones use up their fuel
but why thousands of these stars are here remains a mystery there are already known to be many young , massive stars orbiting our galaxy 's central supermassive black hole - but why there would be thousands of white dwarf stars as well is not clear
white dwarfs are what are left when medium - mass stars - including our sun - shed their outer layers at the end of their life
' shown is the region around the supermassive black hole at the milky way 's galactic centre - sagittarius a * - where the x-ray emissions consistent with thousands of white dwarfs were found
