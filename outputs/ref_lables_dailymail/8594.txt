incredible footage has captured the moment a huge stingray nibbles on a freediver âs head , gliding back and forth over the man âs body gently on the ocean floor
the video shows the incredibly peaceful encounter between the ray and johnny debnam , a 29 - year - old commercial diver and ocean lover
mr johnny debnam was free diving in water four metres deep ; holding his breath and diving down to the depths of the ocean on rottnest island off the coast of western australia
johnny debnam says he felt completely at ease with the stingray , although he was aware of the risks the commercial diver was free diving four metres beneath the ocean when he had his snuggle with the ray â i was totally at peace
i loved that thing going over the top of me , â johnny debnam said of the experience the video shows the swimmer completely motionless in the seagrass , with the enormous 150 kilogram ray rubbing itself back and forward over his body - even nibbling at his head
â i blew all my air out and was totally calm and at his level , â explained mr johnny debnam during a mini documentary produced for his production company terra australis tv
mr johnny debnam was completely enveloped underneath the stingray , but he remained calm and insists he relished every minute of the wonderful experience
the stingray is a potentially dangerous creature
however mr johnny debnam 's relationship with the stingray was incredibly harmonious
he is experienced with marine life and in the video demonstrates his behaviour to be gentle and threatening , and the stingray appears to reward him with some appreciative cuddles ! johnny debnam did not have any breathing equipment on when he let all his air out and calmly lay still on the ocean floor the majestic stingray swum over him three times , enveloping him under his body as he glided on top â those things are huge
