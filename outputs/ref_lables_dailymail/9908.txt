a morbidly obese man has started documenting his efforts to lose more than 300lbs - without weight loss surgery - after the intense back pain brought on by his size prompted him to get serious about his health
for years , iowa - based writer daniel , ignored that at 563lbs he was severely overweight - even shrugging off strangers who called him ' fatty ' as he walked down the street
but after a series of health issues , the 39 - year - old became inspired to shed more than half of his body weight the natural way and chronicle his journey for the des moines register
weight loss journey : daniel , 39 , of iowa , is sharing his efforts to lose over 300lbs ; he started out weighing 563lbs and has lost 20lbs in a month daniel shared that he has been overweight since high school , and over the years has gotten used to the fact that he does n't fit into seats at most public venues or booths at restaurants
it was n't until a combination of intense lower back pain - caused by carrying groceries , since daniel said he ca n't carry anything that weighs much more than a magazine - and trouble sleeping led him to see a doctor
that 's when an x-ray showed him that he also had arthritis and a narrowing of his spinal cavity
if he chose to have gastric sleeve surgery , which makes the stomach smaller and reduces the hormones that produce cravings , he could lose as much as 60 per cent of his excess weight in a year - but daniel said he is afraid of such a drastic medical procedure , and his doctor has told him that it should only be considered as a last resort
working hard : daniel is working with a mental health therapist , a physical therapist , and a nutritionist to lose weight and recover from myriad health problems ' it took me a long time to gain the weight
it will take time to lose it , ' said daniel , adding that his goal is to move slowly and lose ' maybe 50 or 52lbs a year '
