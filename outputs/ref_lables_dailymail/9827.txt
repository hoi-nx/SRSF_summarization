atten - shun ! the three leaders â wives were on parade yesterday , marching across the country in support of their men , in support of the political party into which they married , in support of desperately important employment issues â keeping their idiot husbands in a job
in the corridors of power , samantha cameron , justine miliband and miriam proved once more that they are the ones who wear the trousers , in more ways than one
indeed , samantha cameron and justine miliband marched out in almost identical uniforms ; dark slacks and blazers , paired with crisp shirts and sensible shoes
they looked like a pair of lady pilots from the budget deficit airline , ready for their long haul flight to or from the land of austerity , depending on whose husband wins
mrs samantha cameron respectfully took her shoes off before entering the home of local businessman baljinder hansraas and before anyone could scream : â holy footcream ! â she unleashed them
out popped a pair of startling tootsies , displaying what might just have been a hint of a bunion
for samantha cameron âs seldom seen feet seemed ever so slightly unkempt , unusual from a woman noted for her effortless elegance
samantha cameron put her best foot forward on the campaign trail in west london
but in this election , who can ? justine miliband resolutely wore the exact same outfit she wore last week , sending out a take me serious message that clothes do nât matter
it was left to miriam to show a bit of wackitude , pulling on a huge smile , a pair of lib dem yellow chinos and a nautical breton top ; she looked like tweety pie reporting for duty on the good ship doomed
soft fruit , fool , pudding and crumble ? that is the history of the lib dem right there
today âs wives must smile nicely
today âs wives must not rock the boat
today âs wives must wear ordinary high street clothes and nothing that hints at their secret , massive wealth â although samantha cameron âs two hundred quid spotty blouse must have slipped under tory central office radar
