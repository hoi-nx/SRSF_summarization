scientists in italy have extracted the oldest ever dna sample to be taken from a neanderthals
calcium formations on â altamura man â - a skeleton found in a cave in 1993 - suggest he was 128,000 to 187,000 years old
now researchers plan to sequence his dna to see if they can reveal new details about the evolution of our ancient ancestors

the current project has been ongoing for six years with researchers taking a tiny part of shoulder bone and analysing it in the lab. it is believed that altamura man was left in such a peculiar spot after falling in a well and getting stuck
altamura man is a city of apulia , in southern italy
it is believed that altamura man was left in such a peculiar spot after falling in a well and getting stuck researchers have , up until now , held off from excavating the remains as they believed it would cause irreparable to the skeleton
pictured is â altamura man 's â skull from different angles scientists assume he starved to death , or died from lack of water - but not much else is known about his life
neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred , meaning europeans now have roughly two per cent neanderthals dna
if they manage to sequence the dna , they hope it might reveal new details about the evolution of hominids in general and the early history of the neanderthals
