united have been brilliant in the second half of the season but the defeat at everton was a timely reminder that they still have a long way to go
it 's no surprise to those of us who can see his quality and importance to united , but without michael carrick they look far more beatable
i ca n't see how everton score that first goal if michael carrick is on the pitch
louis van gaal needs some big signings in the summer to turn united into title contenders dortmund 's midfield pair of ilkay gundogan ( left ) and sven bender ( right ) fit the bill daley blind is a poverty - stricken pauper 's version of michael carrick in that position
that 's why it would be a good idea for united to raid dortmund
ilkay gundogan has already been linked with a move to old trafford â it 's a no - brainer
alongside him in that dortmund midfield is sven bender - the german carrick
daley blind struggled to cope in united 's midfield during their 3 - 0 defeat by everton david de gea , blind and ashley young react after conceding a goal in a big defeat by everton on sunday but when sven bender tackles , the opponent knows about it â he is a beast
despite his frame ( he 's 6ft 1in , slightly shorter than michael carrick ) , he is quick to step into a tackle
what i 'm saying here is that united may need two players to replace michael carrick
and if louis van gaal is raiding dortmund he might as well sign armenian 's finest henrikh mkhitaryan
united look far more vulnerable without michael carrick in their midfield armenian creative threat henrikh mkhitaryan has been linked with a move to the premier league before ilkay gundogan , like sven bender , could be leaving dortmund this summer along with departing manager jurgen klopp i think he 's a more positive version of juan mata â look how often the spaniard gave the ball away at goodison park on sunday
there 's a lot to admire about juan mata 's game , but he is one of the guilty ones when you look at the reasons for united being ponderous in their build - up
juan mata was wasteful in possession against everton at goodison park on sunday henrikh mkhitaryan ( right ) challenges eintracht frankfurt 's carlos zambrano during a bundesliga game marouane fellaini 's rebirth has been a big factor in united 's excellent form over the past weeks so much has been made of dortmund 's poor season , but even during that time they managed to finish top of their champions league group above arsenal
these are players who , if they successfully bring their a game with them from germany , could improve united 's starting xi massively
