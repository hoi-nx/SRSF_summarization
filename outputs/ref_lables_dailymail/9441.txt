blown up in iraq , campbell defied the odds to have a miracle baby after shrapnel damaged her womb
but behind the joy of celebrating daughter lexi-river âs first birthday , the former army corporal has battled new agony after twice nearly dying from a mystery illness since the birth
miss campbell , 30 , was struck down with a condition that caused her stomach to rupture , leaving her fighting for her life in intensive care , and feared she would not be there to help lexi-river blow out the candles on her cake
â but the split was amicable , with miss campbell and mr anthony mcmorrow , 32 , a marketing consultant , making lexi-river their priority
miss campbell suffered horrific injuries when a mortar bomb hit the building in basra she was guarding while serving with 19 tank transporter squadron in 2007 as a young mum with a then three - year - old daughter , milly , from a previous relationship
she has since split from long - term partner anthony mcmorrow ( left )
but when lexi-river was ten days old , miss campbell suffered excruciating stomach pain and was rushed to hospital
miss campbell said : â because of everything i âve been through celebrating lexi-river âs first birthday is a milestone not only for her , but also for me
â she will spend the next month having tests as doctors explore the possibility she may have a rare condition which is causing her stomach to ulcerate .
