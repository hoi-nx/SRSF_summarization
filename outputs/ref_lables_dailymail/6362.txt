child protection services have again seized the two ' free range ' children of a mother and father whose unusual approach to parenting has become a national debate
danielle and alexander meitiv , both scientists in maryland , made headlines just before christmas when police found rafi , 10 and dvora , six , wandering the sidewalk on their own
the children were picked up by police , who say they followed protocol by turning them over to cps
meanwhile , mrs danielle meitiv tells fox that cps workers left her and her husband to panic for hours before letting them know their kids were safe
picked up again : the meitivs say they were left to panic for hours by cps workers after their children -- who they raise with a so - called ' free - range ' approach -- were picked up by police for the second time in two months while walking down the street alone taught a lesson ? the meitivs say their kids dvora and rafi went missing starting around 6pm
they were not reunited with them until 10:30 what 's more , the elder child , rafi , insists the scariest part of the hours - long ordeal was being picked up by police
they âve been missing since 6 oâclock â¦ somebody called 911 and the police called cps and they decided to bring the kids here and they did nât call us
even then , they say they were n't reunited with their children or even told where they were for hours
in the interim , rafi tells fox 5 that initially he believed the responding police officer was simply offering them a lift
â ' besides the policeman pulling up ... no ' : asked if he was scared during the hours - long ordeal sunday , 10 - year - old rafi admitted he was , but not because he 'd been left alone with his sister seized : officials seized six - year - old dvora ( left , far left ) and 10 - year - old rafi ( left , blue hat ) on sunday in a maryland park
their parents danielle and alexander meitiv are pictured , right , going to confront cps officials free - range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so - called ' helicopter parenting '
free - range parents advocate a more hands - off approach , where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own
' here ' was cps , rafi said
â they made us sign a safety plan that says we will not leave them attended at all until they follow up , ' and i âm not gon na risk my kids being snatched again like this by cps
' when questioned , the meitivs say they believe in a so - called ' free - range ' approach to parenting , which encourages independence from infancy
in march , the cps found the couple guilty of neglect for letting the children walk home from school alone
it usually comes when the cps has deemed parents to have neglected their children , but has insufficient information or witnesses to press charges or take action
parenting style : the meitivs believe in giving children an unusual amount of independence from a young age this seemingly arbitrary ability to place a family under investigation and rule against them has left the meitivs , who both work as scientists , furious
' on december 20 , police in silver spring picked up rafi and dvora walking home on a saturday afternoon from the park after a member of the public reported it
the cps sent the meitivs a letter on february 20 informing them their investigation had been closed and told the washington post they would not be commenting on the process
guarantees : as part of their free - range parenting philosophy , the meitivs make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street defiant : danielle and alexander meitiv have said that they will continue to bring up their children as they see fit danielle meitiv admits that the walk back from the park was longer than her two kids had taken before , but says she was n't worried because they have been on several shorter walks together with no issues
the meitivs describe themselves as ' free - range parents ' who encourage their two children to take journeys without supervision in order to build confidence and teach them about the outside world
alexander meitiv is a research fellow at national institutes of health and danielle is an oceanographer
i 'm a free range kid ' but they left them behind that day when they went to the park that was a bit further away from their house
what 's wrong ? danielle meitiv ( right ) appeared on the today show in january with her 10 - year - old son rafi ( center ) and 6 - year - old daughter dvora about a month after cps launched an investigation because she let the two walk home from a park alone parenting choice : mrs danielle meitiv ( pictured ) says she and husband alexander meitiv often let their children rafi , 10 , and dvora , 6 , walk alone to teach them about the world ' if we get a call from law enforcement or from a citizen , we are required to investigate
the free range parenting trend was first popularized in 2008 by new york journalist lenore skenazy , in a piece entitled why i let my 9 - year - old ride the subway alone
