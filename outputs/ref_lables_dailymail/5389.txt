al-khori had dozens of chemicals , poisonous materials , bolts and handwritten notes on how to make a bomb , a court heard
the equipment was found purely by chance in april last year after a fire at a block of flats in the muirhouse area of edinburgh
firefighters , who were responding to a 999 call over a fire within a rubbish chute on the 11th floor , had forced entry to a flat registered to al-khori and found jars containing various powders
castor beans , which can be used to make ricin , were also found
the building was evacuated while the police and army explosive ordnance device ( eod ) experts were called in to test the substances - some of which were years old
a search was carried out at a further block where the 62 - year - old lived with his wife in leith and a further haul of material was recovered
al-khori said the materials were used for cleaning and as fertiliser but in february he pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 explosive substances act

' the court heard that much of the bomb - making equipment , which also included electrical circuits , had been ordered from online retailers
al-khori pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 explosive substances act after officers seized dozens of explosive ingredients ' it is difficult to understand the hoarding of this material but it does appear that he is someone who has some kind of academic interest in the materials
' a thorough investigation by the organised crime and counter terrorism unit and crown office found no known links to terrorist offences and we believe faris al-khori was acting independently
the items from the flats in edinburgh were discovered by chance during a fire within the rubbish chute which was then evacuated whilst the items were recovered ' i am also grateful to the city of edinburgh council for their work to re-house vulnerable residents whilst we carried out our searches
