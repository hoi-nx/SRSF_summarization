a bitter war of words has erupted between a young woman and a butcher in sydney 's eastern suburbs over exactly what happened when belinda bartholomew , the girlfriend of sydney roosters star aidan guerra , tried to buy a chicken to cook up for a game of thrones - inspired feast
according to ms belinda bartholomew , she was called names and told to go to ' an aussie butcher ' when she tried to change her chicken selection
ms belinda bartholomew claims the man working at sam the butcher in bondi swore at her and told her to leave , but the man working at the time said his customer was the one being rude the chicken ( pictured in front of aidan guerra ) was cooked by ms belinda bartholomew as part of a game of thrones - inspired feast ' another woman entered the shop at this point and she ordered sausages and paid in cash , and when she asked for a receipt he clearly ignored her on purpose so she actually lent over the counter and printed her own
' however , the butcher vehemently denies he called ms belinda bartholomew names and said she was the one being rude on a day when he had been having issues with his eftpos machine
' ms belinda bartholomew ( pictured with mr aidan guerra ) said the butcher told her to ' go to a f * * * ing aussie butcher ' but the man working vehemently denied any claims he swore at or abused the young woman ( pictured ) he told daily mail australia that he 's trying to fit into aussie life but sometimes finds it hard to cope with attitudes in bondi
ms belinda bartholomew claims the butcher then asked her ' why do n't you just go to a f * * * ing aussie butcher '
ms belinda bartholomew ( left ) and the butcher both said she did n't end up paying for the chicken she and mr aidan guerra ( right ) later ate ms belinda bartholomew said she had decided to leave the shop without making a purchase but the butcher then thrust the chicken at her
' i said not to worry about it and proceeded to leave while my purchase was still pending so he swiped the 1.5kg chicken at me and told me to " take it and f * * * off " , ' she claims
