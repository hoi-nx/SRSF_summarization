stoneman had been entrusted with the vulnerable victim 's pin number , cheque books and bank cards to manage his financial affairs after he went into care at cedar house , rothley
but the court heard that she abused that trust and began withdrawing up to Â£ 200 a day to feed her gambling habit
the 64 - year - old admitted stealing Â£ 22,650 from the elderly victim but was ordered to pay back just Â£ 1,350 - which was all that remained of the stolen funds
the theft was discovered after the deputy manager of the care home became suspicious that stoneman 's step - grandfather , woodrow , was receiving a number of letters from the bank
leicester crown court heard that stoneman was ' solely responsible ' and ' had been waiting for the police
the devastated victim , who had gone into the care home in leicestershire after a number of falls , said he felt angry and betrayed by stoneman
in a statement read to the court , mr woodrow said : ' she has stole money from my bank account which is my life savings
stoneman had been entrusted with the vulnerable victim 's financial affairs after he went into care at cedar house , rothley ' this offence occurred from a gambling addiction while she was looking after the victim 's finances
and the fact the funds you took were funds he had accumulated over his life and depended on them to some extent to pay for his care home fees
the judge also stated that Â£ 1,350 would be confiscated for compensation and any sums recovered in the future should be paid to mr woodrow
stoneman was handed a suspended sentence of two years with 200 hours of unpaid work at leicester crown court
