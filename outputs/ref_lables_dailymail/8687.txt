club president massimo cellino insists he had nothing to do with the events that led to six players pulling out of saturday 's match against charlton
antenucci , giuseppe bellusci , dario del fabro , silvestri , souleymane doukara and edgar cani withdrew from the squad on the eve of the trip to the valley citing injuries , prompting some accusations that the players had gone ' on strike '
the club released a statement on sunday evening looking to draw a line under the controversy which read : ' club wants to clarify that during the days leading up to the away championship fixture at charlton on saturday april 17 that six first - team players suffered injuries
' massimo cellino insists he had nothing to do with the events that led to players pulling out of saturday 's match against charlton antenucci was among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by charlton and massimo cellino , who has been banned since january after being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in italian , has now also distanced himself from any possible conspiracy theory , telling the sun : ' i am not a coward and not the sort of guy who tells his players to go on strike
but if the players were injured , why did n't the manager inform the chairman ? ' this looks like a fight between manager redfearn and the ownership of the club , which is not good
' massimo cellino 's ban and the injury controversy are just two of a string of chaotic events that have plagued club recently with redfearn 's position increasingly threatened over recent weeks giuseppe bellusci , antenucci and two other italian were among those who made themselves unavailable redfearn has led the club to safety after taking over from ill - fated predecessors david hockaday and darko milanic , but he saw assistant steve thompson lose his job without warning on april 2 and his own deal , which expires at the end of the season , looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club 's current regime
