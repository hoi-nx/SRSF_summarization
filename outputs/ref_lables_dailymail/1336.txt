bard may indeed have been the original author of the play double falsehood after all a play discovered nearly 300 years ago and said to be a bard forgery was really written by the bard himself , new research has revealed
the work titled double falsehood was presented by theatre impresario lewis theobald in the 18th century as an adaptation of a shakespeare play about a spanish nobleman 's ignoble pursuit of two women
lewis theobald , a known scholar of bard , mounted his play at drury lane theatre in london on december 13 , 1727 , claiming that it was a re-working of an original by the bard and that he had three original texts
his claims were greeted with widespread scepticism in the eighteenth century , including from the great poet alexander pope , who had considerable clout
but a new study of its language to build up a psychological profile of the writer ' strongly identifies ' the legendary playwright as the true author
dr boyd of the university of texas said : ' research in psychology has shown some of the core features of who a person is at their deepest level can be revealed based on how they use language
' with our new study , we show you can actually take a lot of this information and put it all together at once to understand an author like bard rather deeply
' the study applied psychological theory and text analysing software and goes beyond confirming authorship by word counts and linguistic regularities
' results showed the author of double falsehood was likely to be sociable and fairly well educated , findings that do not fit with accounts of lewis theobald as rigid and abrasive
to get to the bottom of the mystery 33 plays by the bard , twelve by lewis theobald and nine by bard 's collaborator john fletcher , were examined in the study published in psychological science
jacobean dramatist john fletcher ( left ) most likely collaborated with bard on double falsehood ( right ) , which was long thought not to have had anything to do with the bard software evaluated ' function words ' including pronouns , articles and prepositions and words belonging to various content categories such as emotions , family , sensory perception and religion
every measure but one identified bard as the likely author with lewis theobald identified as the best match only when it came to his use of content words
he claimed the versification was very similar to other works by bard and that double falsehood contained words never seen before and not previously used by lewis theobald
