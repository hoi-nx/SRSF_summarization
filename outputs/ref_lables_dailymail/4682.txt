manchester city sniffing around with their millions , looking to prize away some of arsene wenger 's finest talent
wilshere is the latest man linked with a switch to the etihad stadium , where he would follow the likes of emmanuel adebayor , bacary sagna and nasri who swapped london for the north-west as manchester city stormed towards premier league and fa cup glory
and if Â£ 30million or more is truly on the table for wilshere , arsenal must consider it
manchester city are considering making a move for arsenal midfielder wilshere this summer wilshere has n't played for the first team since injuring his ankle against manchester united in november sanchez cost arsenal Â£ 30m , while chelsea splashed out roughly the same amount to bring in diego costa
and for all wilshere 's many talents , he would not be a game changer for manuel pellegrini , or whoever manchester city 's manager may be next season
his quick movement , superb touch and low centre of gravity is perfect for the sharp , driving style of play manager arsene wenger likes at the emirates , as wilshere 's goal of the season against norwich last season perfectly demonstrated
he was tipped as a future arsenal star and england international when he broke through the ranks in 2008 wilshere is only 23 years old but has picked up 24 separate injuries during his professional career but even as recently as this season , wilshere was hitting form before going off against manchester united
but arsenal would be foolish to dismiss anything over Â£ 30m in today 's market , especially considering the kind of players arsene wenger can now attract to the club
wilshere impressed in a holding role for england in an international friendly against scotland last year he was in form before ankle surgery , scoring a fine goal against manchester city in september the midfielder fired past brad guzan to score the opening goal against aston villa last season wilshere 's effort against norwich was voted the 2013 - 14 premier league goal of the season arsenal 's relationship with manchester city , who the club have never held a firm rivalry with , could also play a part
arsenal fans would hate to see wilshere go and he encapsulates the style at the emirates
