the long distance runners will inspire many to take up running and as the evening gets lighter and the weather gets warmer , it 's the perfect time to pull on your trainers and get fit
but what trainers should you go for ? running is often celebrated as a budget sport because you do n't have to pay expensive gym fees or buy lots of equipment
but trainers can be costly - proved by the latest adidas boost shoes that have gone on sale for Â£ 130
femail writer and marathon runner lucy tested out Â£ 130 adidas ultra trainers against aldi 's budget Â£ 19.99 pair ahead of the london marathon next week in contrast , supermarket chain aldi have a running flash sale in stores from tomorrow ( thursday ) with trainers available for the budget price of Â£ 19.99 , while stocks last
the shoes you run in are important to prevent injuries and ensure you have a comfortable and enjoyable experience - so can you really get the same results from a cheap supermarket pair over the costly version from a major sports brand ? femail asked lucy , a marathoner with a personal best time of 3.06 and co-writer of nell mcandrew 's guide to running , to take them for a test run ... the trainers adidas , Â£ 130 : adidas promise to deliver ' your greatest run ever ' with their new trainer which features their much - hyped ' boost ' technology
the adidas boost technology is a type of cushioning that they say will deliver ' your greatest run ever ' while the primeknit fabric is said to ' allow the natural expansion of any foot shape ' at Â£ 130 , the shoes only offer value for money if you intend to run in them often but the bumpy undersole does n't seem to be that durable it certainly seems to have worked for the numerous elite athletes , including jessica ennis , who have worn boost trainers thanks to sponsorship deals
speaking of the ultra version , which have been on sale since february at a rrp of Â£ 130 , adidas executive eric liedtke said : ' ultra boost represents the culmination of years of work and meticulous research striving to create the greatest running shoe ever
' aldi premium running shoes , Â£ 19.99 : the premium running shoes are part of the aldi 's latest ' specialbuys ' running range under the label ' crane ' , which will be in stores from 16th april and available while stocks last
it 's not the first time aldi have sold running trainers as a non ' premium ' version went on sale for Â£ 14.99 in 2013
aldi 's Â£ 19.99 premium running shoes for women comes in a turquoise and pink shade the men 's version is royal blue and will only be available in stores while stocks last aldi say their running range is ' high spec ' despite the low prices , as they keep their costs down by stocking their own products over big brands , having minimalist store interiors to reduce overheads and charging for plastic bags
lucy 's verdict : appearance adidas : the trainers come in black with purple embellishment for both men and women and are made using primeknit fabric which is said to ' allow the natural expansion of any foot shape
aldi : the supermarket 's trainers look the part and come in a bright turquoise and pink shade for women and royal blue for men
the aldi trainers feature reflective material - which is great for being seen when running at night - but the rest of the fabric used does look cheap
lucy 's verdict : fit and running feel adidas : the shoes have a tongue at the back of the heel so they can be pulled on easily and the primeknit fabric makes it feel you 're putting your foot into a comfortable sock
adidas shoes can often come up small , so it 's advisable to buy a pair half a size larger than your usual shoe size
the boost cushioning gives a comfortable and springy feel and despite its bulky appearance , the shoes do not feel too heavy on the foot while running
lucy found the boost trainers , left , fitted well and felt comfortable on a long run , while the aldi trainers , right , were adequate but felt bulkier and were n't as snug a fit aldi : the shoes are not available in half sizes so i opted for my usual shoe size , despite this they still felt too big
overall , they felt more sturdy then the adidas pair and i did n't feel like they adapted to my feet in the same way - running in them for a short run was fine but i would n't feel comfortable wearing them for a long run or when doing speed work
at Â£ 19.99 , if you do n't carry on running if your motivation wanes , you wo n't be too much out of pocket
i 'm not convinced this ultra model is worth the Â£ 130 price tag though - unless you can run in them often to get value for money
