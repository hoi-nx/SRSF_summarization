the oldest human footprints left behind on a muddy lakeside 1.5 million years ago appear to have been made by prehistoric hunting parties
researchers examining the site where a series of tracks left by a barefooted early human in ileret , northwest kenya , have now found a total of 99 prints
the distinct tracks found at ileret in kenya ( like the one above ) are the oldest human footprints in the world it provides some of the strongest evidence yet that the human ancestors that left the prints - homo erectus - were sophisticated hunters
while their ancestors before them may have eaten meat they scavenged or from small prey they were able to catch , hunting parties suggests homo erectus went after larger prey
dr roach , a palaeoanthropologist at the american museum of natural history in new york who led the study , said the prints appeared to have been made by adult males
he said that the tracks represent groups hunting for antelope or wildebeest
the tracks in ileret were first revealed in 2009 after researchers at bournemouth university and rutgers â koobi fora field school in kenya , announced they had discovered a collection of 22 human prints
this deep print appears to have been left by a male homo erectus that may have been part of a hunting party analysis of the print tracks ( above ) showed they had been made by a early human that walked much like we do the prints were preserved in sediment that had once been the shoreline of an ancient lake
professor matthew bennett , who was part of the team that originally studied the footprints , is shown above crouching in front of the ancient human tracks analysis of the footprints by professor matthew bennett at bournemouth university revealed the human prints had been made by a species with a similar bipedal stance and gait to modern humans , with a pronounced arch and short toes
he concluded that the prints had probably been left by homo erectus - an extinct species of early human that disappeared around 200,000 years ago
over a four year excavation period a total of 483 prints in the ileret sediment have now been uncovered - 99 of which were human
unlike the grass - eating antelope and other hooved tracks preserved in the stone - whose tracks led from grasslands to the shore - the human prints all walked in one direction along the shoreline
previous work by dr roach has also shown that homo erectus had developed the physic needed to be a deadly hunter
homo erectus , shown in the reconstruction above , may have hunted large prey in groups or hunting parties fossilised skeletons how their shoulders and collar bones would have allowed them to throw sticks or spears both accurately and powerfully
