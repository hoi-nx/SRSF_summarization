while indonesia 's plan to execute myuran sukumaran and andrew chan has not dented aussie tourist visits to the island , a proposed alcohol ban could
the number of aussie visiting bali over the past two months was up 16.7 per cent from the same period last year , with more arriving than any other nationality
a proposed ban on alcohol in indonesia could deter aussie from holidaying in bali an indonesia expert says aussie tourists are more worried about a proposed booze ban there than the execution of the bali nine pair , myuran sukumaran ( left ) and andrew chan ( right ) mr taylor says legislation proposed by two islamic parties banning consumption of all beverages containing more than one per cent alcohol is considered more of a worry , and could become law as early as the end of this year if backed by president joko widodo
mr taylor said mini marts would be the initial focus of the alcohol ban , which would be broadened but not apply to certain locations to protect tourism , such as five - star hotels
mini marts would be the initial focus of the alcohol ban , which would be broadened but not apply to certain locations to protect tourism , such as five - star hotels ' my own view would be that common sense would prevail ... but i 'd be cautious in saying that because there are some of the more pronounced religious groups throughout indonesia really gaining momentum now , ' mr taylor told aap
' so if you take that and the alcohol thing i think it 's really symptomatic of a disturbing trend - and indonesia is a country that stole my heart so i 'm not anti-indonesia - of the joko widodo government showing all the signs of being naive , dysfunctional and lost at the moment
