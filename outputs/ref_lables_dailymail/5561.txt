the birth of alanna and goetzinger 's third daughter was meant to go like the previous two - an intimate family moment that took place in a wading pool their bedroom at home , lit by candles
instead , the night turned to tragedy when the little girl rana died either during birth or within minutes afterwards
a coroner found that the care given by the midwife who assisted at the birth in 2012 was ' grossly inadequate ' and may have contributed to the death of the baby
alanna and stephen goetzinger ( pictured with their daughters kayla , right , and alice , left ) lost their daughter during a stillbirth in 2012 and have spoken out against the coroner 's report which blames their midwife coroner mcdougall said that the midwife failed to adequately prepare for the rana 's birth , allowed the delivery to take place in ' unsafe conditions ' , and that her failure to provide proper medical assistance may have caused the death of the goeztinger 's baby
coroner mcdougall found that rana had died either ' during or shortly after birth ' from meconium aspiration , a condition where a foetus inhales their faeces before birth , preventing them from breathing
the report also found that the midwife , who handed in her resignation following the inquest , changed her statement about the events of the evening , including the time of the baby 's birth and whether the baby had exhibited signs of life
three years on , the couple , who live on a farm in kanungra in south - east queensland , have spoken about the night rana was born , and what they claim was a tragic and unavoidable event
alanna , 39 , and goetzinger , 57 , are adamant that rana was stillborn , and that it was very clear from the moment she was born that she had died before birth
when she was lifted out of the water and put into my arms she was limp , there was no life in her little body , ' mrs goetzinger , 39 , told daily mail australia
goetzinger with her daughters alice and kayla while she was pregnant with rana mrs goetzinger said that her daughter rana was stillborn , and that the coroner 's report which claims she died ' during or shortly after birth ' was fabricated the report found that the midwife changed whether there were any signs of life , and also changed the time of rana 's birth from 11.40pm to 11.45pm to cover a seven minute delay in calling for emergency care at 11.47pm
' on initial questioning , midwife m stated that she " was very surprised as things were going well and the baby had a heart rate at birth " , ' the report said
' she then stated that " there was no heart rate and no signs of life after birth "
' the report also concludes that the midwife allowed mrs goetzinger to give birth at home despite her being at greater risk for meconium aspiration , as a result of her age , the higher end weight of her previous pregnancies , and the fact that she had carried rana for 41 weeks in utero
it states that the care the midwife provided ' fell significantly short ' of what would be expected of someone of her experience , and that she had failed to notice meconium in the water when mrs goetzinger 's waters had broken as a result of the poor lighting provided by only having candles in the room
' alanna and goetzinger on their wedding day ( left ) , and alanna with two of the couple 's daughters alanna and goetzinger have defended their midwife against the findings of the coroner 's inquest ' we did n't sit around and make a cup of tea deciding whether to call the ambulance
the goetzinger 's travelled to the gold coast university hospital in an ambulance , where rana was pronounced dead and was taken away for an autopsy after doctors expressed concerns over the actions of the midwife and her sub-standard attempts at cpr
mrs goetzinger said that she and her husband were made to feel like criminals for choosing a home birth ' my only consolation is that i have my two beautiful daughters , ' said mrs goetzinger ' they did nât once in three whole years contact us to ask for my opinion
' rana was tragic and devastating and i was lost for weeks , and then for both us and our midwife to be treated like criminals was just too much , ' she said
she was cautioned by both the coroner and was reported to the australian health practitioner regulation agency , who launched an investigation into her conduct and concluded that the midwife failed to uphold healthcare standards of the profession
' mr goetzinger said he wants an apology from the coroner for the claims in the report , and want to see their midwife 's license reinstated without restriction
mr goetzinger said that people should have a free and informed choice about whether they choose to have home births ' if i had millions of dollars i would sue them for fraudulent proceedings because the document is a fraud , it 's full of contradictions , ' mrs goetzinger said
