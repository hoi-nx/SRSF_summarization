mindy kaling has denied knowing anything about her brother 's controversial choice to reveal he pretended to be an african american to get into medical school
a representative for the comedienne told us weekly she has been estranged from chokal-ingam ' for years ' and claimed she ' was not aware of his decision to apply to medical school under a different name and race
' this comes as chokal-ingam , 38 , admitted his sister has told him she is ' ashamed ' of him for opening up about his alleged experience ahead of the release of his new book , almost black , in which he will describe how he gained admission to medical school in 1998 by transforming his appearance
denial : mindy kaling has said she was not aware her brother pretended to be black when he applied to medical school in the late 1990s ' my sister mindy kaling ( mindy kaling ) , of the the mindy project and is everyone hanging out without me ? , strongly disapproves of my book , ' he wrote
chokal-ingam - chokal-ingam says on his blog that he felt he had to change his appearance to get into the st. louis university school of medicine and heavily attacks affirmative action policies in the american
' i was determined to become a doctor and i knew that admission standards for certain minorities under affirmative action were , let 's say â¦ less stringent ? ' wrote chokal-ingam
' i got into medical school because i said i was black
controversial claims : on his website , almostblack.com , chokal-ingam shows side - by - side qualifications and pictures of himself as an indian - american man ( left ) and a black man ( right )
he does n't specify if he went through the same application process as an indian - american man as he did as a black man his change in appearance was ' so startling that my own fraternity brothers did n't recognize me '
' chokal-ingam the indian - american frat boy became jojo the african american affirmative action applicant to medical school , ' he said , claiming that jojo was the middle name he was born with
as an indian - american with a gpa of 3.1 , mcat of 31 and a member of the south asian student association , he did n't think he 'd get into medical school , but with a change of appearance and switch of student organization , he thought he could get into some of the top schools in the nation
' in all , i interviewed at eleven prestigious medical schools in 9 major cities across american , while posing a black man , ' he added
despite his startling claims , chokal-ingam fails to mention if he applied to the same schools at the same time as an indian - american man
when he was finally accepted to st. louis university school of medicine , he used the acceptance to claim he was only granted admission because he was black and used the situation as an example of what was ' wrong ' with affirmative action
' it 's easier for him to tap dance for the right wing as the brown man who ' gets it ' , while conveniently missing how ongoing racism makes affirmative action absolutely necessary , ' he added
and though he claims he became a serious contender at schools across the nation as a black man , he does n't specify if he went through the application process as an american - indian man
