ambulance bosses are routinely making a 21,500 - mile round trip to australia to hire paramedics on Â£ 4,500 â golden hello â payments because it is far cheaper than training them in britain
managers from the london ambulance service , the largest in the nhs , have just filled 225 vacant posts with applicants from sydney and melbourne
ambulance bosses are routinely making a 21,500 - mile round trip to australia to hire paramedics on Â£ 4,500 â golden hello â payments the selection process , held at five - star hotels , was so quick that by 8am the next day applicants had received an email informing them if they had a job
it is the latest example of how the nhs is recruiting overseas because it has failed to train enough staff in britain to meet the needs of the rising and ageing population
hospital managers have been flying out to spain and portugal to hire batches of 30 nurses at a time
the selection process , held at five - star hotels , was so quick that by 8am the next day applicants had received an email informing them if they had a job the increasing demand on ambulances means they are taking longer to reach the seriously ill. as a result , many paramedics are choosing to take up posts as â advanced practitioners â in a&e , gp surgeries and call centres for the 111 helpline where the work is less stressful and they can earn more
however , australia has a surplus.other understaffed ambulance services in the britain are also going abroad , including to poland
as well as the 225 paramedics hired from australia last month , london ambulance service hired 175 from there and new zealand in september
managers are considering flying out again later this year and calculate that the first recruitment drive saved the nhs Â£ 9million
each trip to australia costs the ambulance service Â£ 90,000 in flights and hotel bills , but they return having hired on average 200 paramedics
jason killens , director of operations at london ambulance service , said : â it âs not our long - term solution but is helping us fill a skills shortage while we train more people to become paramedics in the britain
â he said friends who were offered jobs in september â are absolutely loving it â â including having the chance to see the tour de france
â mr skelly said : â i âve always wanted to go to london as a paramedic because you get a variety of work and then you can shoot off to spain for the weekend
