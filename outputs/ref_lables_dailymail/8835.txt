the parents of a five - year - old transgender boy are sharing their son âs story with the world in a bid to prove that there is no such thing as being â too young â to identify as transgender
massachusetts couple mimi and joe lemay 's son jacob was n't always a boy
and after years of questioning how to handle his preferences , before finally coming to terms with what their son wanted , the lemays explained to nbc news that they decided to let their child assume the identity of a boy
boys will be boys : mimi and joe lemay 's five - year - old son jacob was born a girl named mia , but the couple has now accepted that their child is a boy mimi and joe lemay began to notice that jacob was having difficulties when he was a toddler
' she would take on " boy " personas , and just always want to play with boy things , ' said joe lemay
' her need to play boy roles , and her need to be seen or spoken to as a boy at home became very persistent , ' added mimi
then , shortly before he turned three , jacob declared himself a boy
happy family : jacob was born the second of three daughters in the massachusetts - based joe lemay family finding the right wardrobe : from a young age , jacob ( r ) preferred to wear boy clothes ; when his parents still dressed him as a girl , the frustrated toddler would change outfits up to 12 times a day mimi said that she was worried that jacob 's behavior would make it harder for him to build relationships - already , he had trouble relating to his peers - and she hoped her child 's desire to be a boy would go away
in the meantime , she and joe lemay made allowances while jacob was n't in public
home became a ' battleground over gender ' , mimi wrote in a letter to jacob on his fifth birthday , which was published by the synapse , continuing that they decided to let jacob cut his hair , wear boy clothes , and assume aspects of his male identity at home
while this made things easier when just family was around - his older sister eventually stopped teasing him about not being a ' real boy ' - things were still hard at school , where jacob did n't engage with his classmates
not content to just ' pretend ' to be a boy , jacob , then still called mia , hated her body and would say things like : ' why did god make me this way ? why did god make me wrong ? ' trying to fit in : while he was still perceived as a girl , jacob would only open up around his family and had trouble getting along with his peers accepting his identity : the lemays eased into jacob 's transition , slowly allowing him to wear boy clothes , cut his hair short , and refer to himself as a boy at home mimi and joe lemay saw a glimpse of their future on an april 2014 trip to disney world
' joe lemay asked jacob if he wanted to be like ryland and have everyone know he 's a boy
playing the prince : on a trip to disney world last year , jacob ( pictured right with his sister ella ) was thrilled when strangers mistook him for a boy in his prince charming costume happy kid : since transitioning , jacob has come into his own ; he socializes and shows affection more since he has started to feel more like himself mimi says she and her husband did n't expect the ' seismic shift ' in jacob 's behavior and personality that they experienced , but the boy completely came out of his shell
