but that does nât prevent one man from dipping his hand in the fish tank and giving his blood parrot cichlid a stroke
the fish begins relaxing in the man 's hand and stays very still as the owner begins to stroke it with his finger the fish initially moves away before swimming in a full circle and returning to rest in between the man âs fingers
the man places his hand into the tank and gently cups the blood parrot cichlid with his fingers before burying its face into his hand and remaining very still once more
according to mr giroux , who uploads many videos of his fish to his youtube channel , the blood parrot cichlid used to share its tank with two other fish
the fish swims away from the man 's hand a few times in the video but returns to be massaged but he was forced to remove the other two from the tank when he noticed that they were bullying his prized pet
after a while the fish enjoyed being stroked and mr giroux noted that it would become frustrated if he did nât play with it on a daily basis
