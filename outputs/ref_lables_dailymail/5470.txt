mark wood spent a day this week donning his newly arrived england suit
â trying it on is when the mixture of nerves and excitement started , â says mark wood , one of the uncapped members of alastair cook âs squad who fly to the caribbean on thursday for a three - test series against west indies
the 25 - year - old would be forgiven for checking the fit , because standing at 5ft 11in and weighing just over 12st , he is not the shape or size of your traditional fast bowler
mark wood has been called up by england for the test series against west indies when he âs not steaming in to bowl at 90mph mark wood can find himself fielding for long stretches of time
â there are times when it gets boring in the field , so i bring out the imaginary horse and try to joust my team - mates , â mark wood said recently
â i do nât know how the england boys will take it , but i âll have a go
the horse will probably come with me to the caribbean if he gets through immigration
â but england are looking for something different in the wake of their woeful world cup and mark wood , whose ability to hurry batsmen from a short run - up is reminiscent of craig white and simon jones from previous eras , fits the bill
â i can hit 90mph but it âs not something i tend to concentrate on , â said mark wood
it was no coincidence that his first three county championship appearances for durham all came at trent bridge , where the abrasive nature of the square roughs the ball up perfectly for exponents of the art. durham paceman is not the shape or size of your traditional fast bowler but he has also displayed a marked improvement in his use of the new ball , swinging it to good effect whenever he got it during the 2014 season
that breakthrough moment on the field has been replicated off it , with mark wood âs devotion to the ecb âs fitness regime enabling him to play a string of matches following a career punctuated by injuries , including stress fractures of the back , a cyst on his left ankle , knee trouble and side strains
â mark wood has sought advice from former durham and england fast bowler steve his first - class haul of 74 wickets at 26 runs apiece is creditable even if his number of appearances , 23 , is a bit thin
â i am not going to the west indies to make the numbers up
i want to play a test match , whether it be the first , middle or last one , â he said
as an england fan it has been frustrating to watch during the winter but everyone will agree that to put things right we have to start in the caribbean
â there âs no pressure on us , is there ? â said mark wood
