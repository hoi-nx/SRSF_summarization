a student who was left with an unsightly cauliflower ear following a botched piercing says she wishes she had listened to her mother who told her not to get it done
remmie , 18 , had a thick bar put through her ear as an act of teenage rebellion , and initially hoped it would make her stand out from the crowd
but when the piercing became inflamed , remmie was forced to remove the bar - and the resulting wound healed into a hazelnut - sized lump known as a keloid scar
' vile : remmie , 18 , says the unsightly lump is ' vile ' and has knocked her confidence badly desperate to get rid of the unsightly lump , remmie was forced to seek the help of cosmetic surgeon vijh
mr vijh immediately diagnosed a keloid scar , which according to the british skin foundation , affects between 10 and 15 per cent of wounds
the scars , which usually take the form of a hard lump of tissue and are often larger than the original wound , are most frequently found on the shoulders and neck
unfortunately , as mr vijh pointed out , removal operations frequently make things worse as the body goes into overdrive to heal the new wound
' despite the risk , remmie chose to go ahead and much to her delight , her ear has been returned to normal
