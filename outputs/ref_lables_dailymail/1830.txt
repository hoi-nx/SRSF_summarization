it is not uncommon to see arsenal finish a season with a string of good results
usually they rattle out a sequence of wins just in time to preserve their place in the top four but too late to affect the destiny of the premier league
chelsea were relentless from the first whistle and have had the title race firmly under control since before christmas
arsenal players celebrate after their extra-time winner against reading in the fa cup semi-finals last week alexis sanchez jumps in the air and celebrates wildly after his second goal for arsenal at wembley with a 10 - point advantage , even if jose mourinho loses to wenger for the first time on sunday it wo nât stop his side becoming champions
next year , though , chelsea wo nât have it all their own way and no team is better placed than arsenal to dislodge them
this is the summer when arsenal must go for it and make the big additions that will stop them being nearly - men
that is exactly what chelsea did 12 months ago
the money was big but the quality was proven and , after they were unveiled , everyone began tipping chelsea for the title
arsenal , it should be stressed , are not in need of major surgery and the spine of their team is now much stronger than at any point last season , when they only just held off everton âs challenge to finish fourth
arsenal manager wenger talks to his players ahead of extra time at wembley last saturday chelsea manager jose mourinho looks in fine form during a press conference on friday results have been impressive since david ospina replaced wojciech szczesny , who had failed to show the required consistency
david ospina has played 12 premier league games ; arsenal have won 11 and he has kept six clean sheets , but wenger still needs to buy a new no 1 if they are to be title challengers
koscielny has steadied things in defence , with arsenal winning 15 of the 18 games he âs played since january 1 but , to progress , wenger needs another top centre back
coquelin has added bite to the midfield , but would arsenal have enough to challenge next season if coquelin is their anchor and mikel arteta is his back up ? no. why does nât he go for pogba , who looks set to leave juventus ? wenger spent Â£ 42m on ozil , so why not spend the same and more on pogba
arsenal goalkeeper david ospina pictured during a training session at london colney last week chelsea goalkeeper petr cech warms up before saturday 's premier league clash against united olivier giroud , meanwhile , has provided a focal point up front
he is an under - rated striker and , had he not missed three months with a broken ankle , his tally would be more than 14 ; he averages a goal every 101.93 minutes , the second best rate in the premier league
arsenal 's french striker olivier giroud looks forward as he advances with the ball at wembley danny welbeck ( left ) looks to evade the challenge of reading 's hal robson-kanu ( centre ) and alex pearce of course it has been frustrating that they have not challenged for the title since last winning it 11 years ago , and wenger has not had a smooth ride
wenger has done a good job keeping arsenal consistently in the top four â all their rivals have dropped out at some point in between â and by the end of next month , they could have won back - to - back fa cups
beating chelsea on sunday wo nât alter things in the short term , but it will offer belief that arsenal can challenge next season
borussia dortmund head coach jurgen klopp celebrates after beating sc paderborn last weekend wenger applauds the arsenal fans after his side booked their place in the fa cup final big guns missed out on a fab freebie full marks to aston villa
jack grealish understandably attracted most of the headlines for his outstanding performance but the role delph played was just as important ; his aggression , energy and left foot gives aston villa balance in their midfield
earlier this season , delph was lauded for committing his future to aston villa even when their position in the premier league was threatened
what can be called into question , however , is the wisdom of some other clubs in the premier league
delph ( right ) celebrates after scoring for aston villa against liverpool in the fa cup semis delph , do not forget , was set to be out of contract this summer and a number of sides at the top of the table had their chance to sign a young england international for free
no doubt these same clubs will go out when the window opens and bring in at least one foreign midfielder , to go with the ones they signed last summer , and soon enough we will hear at some point next season that we do nât have enough english players playing for top sides competing in europe
he is now aston villa âs captain and has been their best player for the last 18 months
delph slots the ball past liverpool goalkeeper simon mignolet in aston villa 's 2 - 1 victory at wembley if delph does maintain his improvement , inevitably clubs will come looking at him
