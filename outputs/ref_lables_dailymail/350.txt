a students â union has been accused of racism and sexism after banning white people and men from an event to promote equality
those studying at goldsmiths , were invited to the students â union meeting to discuss â diversifying the curriculum â
but they were shocked when an organiser told white people and men â not to come â as it was only open to black and ethnic minority [ black and minority ethnic ] women
mustafa , student union welfare and diversity officer at goldsmiths university in london , sparked anger when she banned men and white people from a ' diversity ' meeting the union eventually backed down after a backlash from students , one of whom described the exclusive policy as â patronising beyond belief â
â the ban on men and white students is surprising , since the organisers claim to promote â zero tolerance â for â all forms of prejudice , discrimination and oppression â
a senior union member told student newspaper the tab that miss mustafa âs actions had made it â very difficult â for male students
he said many white men felt they â could not say anything for fear of retribution â , adding : â for bahar to have the nerve to write this is patronising beyond belief
â organisers later appeared to back down on the rules , with the statement â allies now welcome ! â added to the meeting âs facebook page
ms mustafa appeared to ban men and white people from attending the meeting in this facebook post a notice about the meeting later appeared to show the ban had been dropped , stating : ' allies now welcome ! ' a spokesman for goldsmiths said the university had no part in the decisions of the union , adding : â we are proud of our diverse community and do not tolerate any form of oppression , including racism , sexism or any other form of bigotry
