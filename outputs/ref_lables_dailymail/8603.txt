apple made significant improvements to the battery life of its iphone 6 and 6 plus , but they still fail to last more than a full day with typical usage
fan site appleinsider has spotted nine job listings on apple 's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries
these include one for an ios battery life software engineer ( pictured left ) and another for ios software power systems engineer ( pictured right ) the job listings were discovered by fan site appleinsider and include listings for an ios battery life software engineer , a software power systems engineer , battery pack engineering manager and a cell engineer
in particular , the ios software power systems engineer role said the successful candidate ' will be working on design and development of software for triage of battery life issues , modeling of power consumed by different parts of the system , and analytics to understand large scale battery life trends
it says its all - day battery life is based on 18 hours of use
all - day battery life : this includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30 - minute workout with music
apple 's tests were carried out in march 2015 with a pre-production apple watch and software paired with an iphone 6 and 6 plus using pre-production software
apple said battery life varies with environmental factors , use , configuration , and ' many other factors ' so actual results will vary as the site suggests , this shows apple is looking to boost the battery on ios devices but also its range of macbooks
apple 's larger iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person
alternatively , because a number of the jobs refer to a software rather than hardware engineer , these battery improvements could be made and rolled out to existing phones as part of an ios upgrade
atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms , healthcare , medical , wearable , and devices placed in rural , agriculture , offshore and other remote areas

apple also said its new 12 - inch macbook ( pictured ) uses 30 % less energy than previous models apple boss tim cook said the watch 's ' all - day ' battery life lasts 18 hours with ' typical use ' - but official tests recently revealed this equates to just 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30 - minute workout with music
apple defines the battery on its watch page and said a time check lasts four seconds they use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made
atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices ' during a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year 's ces , andreas eieland , atmel 's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel
