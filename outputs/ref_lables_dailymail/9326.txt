the shepherd âs life : a tale of the lake district by rebanks when , in 2002 , my family and i moved from busy north london to bucolic north herefordshire , we found that our new neighbours were , overwhelmingly , sheep
i did nât want to be one of those townies who moves to the country but remains ignorant of rural ways , so i made sporadic efforts to get to know them , or at least , to get to understand life on a sheep farm
when my children were small , i asked the obliging farmer whose land abuts our garden if they could watch his ewes lambing
this wonderful book has filled in most of the gaps in my education , without any 4.30am alarm calls
rebanks studied at the oxford before returning to his roots in the lake district , he is seen here with his sheep on his farm outside of penrith in cumbria it is the enlightening , exquisitely written account , give or take a few autobiographical tangents , of a year in the life of rebanks , whose family has been farming in the lake district for at least six centuries
all the same , it is no life for the faint - hearted
with starkly effective prose , he brilliantly evokes the horror of the 2001 foot - and - mouth outbreak
â it is a farmer âs lot , adds rebanks , to depend on the whims of others : of bureaucrats , supermarket buyers , shoppers
alas , most of them have no understanding of the proud , beleaguered culture he comes from , just like the secondary school teachers who told him that farming on the lake district fells was a dead - end business , a waste of brainpower
anyone with even a sliver of ambition and character , they suggested , would seek a life elsewhere
but his book does not undermine the importance of education â far from it
toiling on the farm , he found himself at odds with his decent , hard - working but obstreperous father , and escaped by reading , which he had resisted so strongly during his schooldays
on his application form for oxford he described himself as a â drystone wall builder on the lake district fells â
natural charm and a certain northern pugnaciousness helped him breeze through his interview , but in â every conversation for the next three years â he had to suffer someone saying what a big change oxford must represent after life on the farm
that oxford degree is not wasted ; in a fleeting , almost throwaway paragraph , he tells us that he is also an â expert adviser â to the unesco world heritage centre in paris , helping them understand how tourism can benefit host communities
breeding from the best rams , or â tups â , he suggests , is more intellectually challenging than much of what he did at oxford
at sales , he adds , everyone tries to get their tup to stand correctly , broad and thick - set and with their heads up , giving an impression of arrogance , â like russell crowe in gladiator â
i was beguiled by this book , such an eloquent love letter to a cherished way of life , and more specifically , to his grandparents and parents , to whom he was born not with a silver spoon in his mouth , but a wooden crook in his hand
as rebanks makes abundantly clear â not least with his effusive praise for a famous children âs author , whom he thinks of not as the creator of peter rabbit , nor even as beatrix potter , but as mrs heelis , doughty champion of herdwick sheep â there is , between the two , all the difference in the world .
