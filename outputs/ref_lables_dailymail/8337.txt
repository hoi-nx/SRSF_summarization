at half - time , everything pointed to another humiliating england defeat in dublin
such was the control leinster had been able to exert on bath in an utterly one - sided first half punctuated only by a single piece of individual brilliance by fly - half george ford , it was impossible to see a way back into the contest for the west countrymen
bath fly half george ford ghosts past leinster full - back kearney on his way to fine individual score at the aviva stadium the england no 10 's solo - try was the only score that the west country outfit managed to register in the first - half by the end , remarkably , the three - time champions leinster were hanging on for dear life as wave after wave of bath attack threatened to deliver one of the great european comebacks
driven on by their pocket general ford , bath somehow came within a whisker of finding a way into the last four
ford is congratulated by bath substitutes sam burgess ( left ) and max lahiff following his touchdown kearney is taken out in the air by watson leading to the full - back being dispatched to the sin - bin for 10 minutes â but it does nât dent our belief in what we âre doing
fly - half ford was exceptional
bath lock stuart hooper crashes over for his side 's second try following another dazzling break from ford but despite his 21st - minute moment of brilliance , it looked for all the world as if leinster would repeat ireland âs six nations strangulation of england as bath âs discipline failed under the pressure of leinster âs superior set - piece and domination at the breakdown
referee garces showed watson a yellow card , despite the shameful pleas by three leinster players for him to be shown red , and leinster centre madigan kicked two more penalties in his absence to send his side in 15 - 5 up at half - time and seemingly in complete control
madigan was in imperious kicking form as the leinster centre fired over six penalties but bath showed their mettle with a wonderful second - half revival
leinster scrum half isaac boss fires out a pass during a frantic opening quarter in dublin the 22 - year - old george ford was at the heart of everything they did while watson proved razor - sharp every time he received the ball
with 47 minutes gone , and leinster winger fergus mcfadden off the field with a concussion sustained in a tackle from kyle eastmond , ford produced his second moment of magic
this time he stepped on the inside of devin toner , before turning on the after - burners and feeding inside to his second - row captain stuart hooper to crash over
another madigan penalty â his sixth of the afternoon â made it 18 - 12 to leinster but bath had the bit between their teeth

ford kicked another penalty to drag the score back to 18 - 15 with six minutes left but the visitors were unable to land the killer blow as garvey was harshly penalised by garces with seconds on the clock
