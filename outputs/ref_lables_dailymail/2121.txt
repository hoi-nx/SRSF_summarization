nearly 3.8million crimes were recorded by police last year , an increase of 2 per cent from 2013 , figures released yesterday revealed
and a record number of rapes and other sex crimes were logged â up by a third ( 32 per cent ) to 80,200 , or 220 a day
but experts say the rise â the first since 2003 - 04 â was partly because victims were ' more willing ' to report sex crimes , including historical ones , and police were more likely to take complaints seriously , in the wake of the jimmy savile sex abuse scandal
a police watchdog recently found a fifth of crimes were not being logged properly
police recorded 515 homicides last year , 37 fewer than in 2013
but the number of rapes recorded was the highest ever at 26,703 , which is an average of 73 attacks every day
