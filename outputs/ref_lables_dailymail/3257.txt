hughes on friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out george north sensationally over-turned on appeal , following an outcry on his behalf
the wasps 8 was initially suspended for three matches , after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been â reckless â for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the welsh lion , as he scored a try for northampton on march 27
yet , in a stunning twist â and in light of fierce criticism â the ban was thrown out , as the appeal lodged by wasps was up - held
hughes 's knee collided with george north 's head as he crossed the line to score for northampton north was left out cold on the pitch at franklin âs gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher it was the third time that the wales and lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months fiji - born forward hughes missed his side 's champions cup quarter - final loss against toulon last sunday north was left unconscious by the clash ; a third blow to the head in the space of two months
hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on march 27 hughes missed his club âs champions cup defeat to holders toulon last sunday , as he awaited his appeal hearing
he is now free to return to action immediately , but he is not in the match - day squad for wasps â aviva premiership trip to welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture , he is unlikely to play again until the visit of exeter to coventry on april 26
