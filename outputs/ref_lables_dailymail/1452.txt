a lack of iron , especially in women , is known to trigger hair loss , possibly because it means less oxygen is delivered to the hair follicle , but should you take iron pills to treat it ? â this is a bit of a moot point , â says dr jolliffe , a consultant dermatologist at the royal london hospital and a specialist in hair loss
all i can say is that in my practice i see lots of girls with low ferritin levels [ stored iron rather than iron in your blood ] , who shed hair and stop shedding once you correct the ferritin level
â meal : eating protein with every meal is vital to strong , healthy hair , as hair consists of protein , experts say sally-ann tarver , a former president of the trichological society now based at the cotswold trichology centre , recommends florisene pills ( Â£ 15.95 , lambertshealthcare.co.uk ) , which contain iron , because these do nât seem to cause the digestive irritation linked to standard pills
but professor andrew messenger , a consultant dermatologist at the royal hallamshire hospital in sheffield , says that while there are many supplements claiming to help promote hair growth , very few have strong evidence to support them
â research found women with increased hair - shedding responded well to iron supplements it might be worth checking your protein intake
as philip kingsley , a trichologist , explains : â hair consists of protein , so eating sufficient protein is vital to strong , healthy hair
there is some evidence that an amino acid ( or protein building block ) called l - lysine may play a role in hair loss
a review published in the journal of clinical and experimental dermatology found that women with increased hair - shedding responded well to l - lysine and iron supplements ( l - lysine is thought to help the body to absorb iron )
however , supplements or dietary changes wo nât pay dividends overnight
â it usually takes more than two months for the hair follicles to begin to benefit from dietary changes and as hair only grows half an inch a month , it may take as long as six months before you begin to notice any changes , â says philip kingsley
there have also been studies showing caffeine is absorbed quickly through hair follicles , suggesting it could be active when used in a shampoo formulation
