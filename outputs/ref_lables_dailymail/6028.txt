according to the sun-times , dennis porter said in his ruling : ' illinois courts have consistently held that when the defendant intends to fire a gun , points it in the general direction of his or her intended victim , and shoots , such conduct is not merely reckless and does not warrant an involuntary - manslaughter instruction , regardless of the defendant 's assertion that he or she did not intend to kill anyone
' dennis porter also cleared dante servin , who was off - duty , of reckless discharge of a firearm and reckless conduct
chaos : the judge told loved ones to leave the court before the not gulity verdict was read out - fearing a spate of outbursts
outside the court dante servin ( pictured ) told reporters at the end of the hearing he has always believed the shooting was an accident disgusted : boyd 's supporters ( pictured outside court ) maintain that she was murdered and insisted the case is ' not over ' ' any reasonable person , any police officer especially would have reacted in the exact same manner that i reacted , and i âm glad to be alive
