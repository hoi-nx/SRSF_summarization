egypt âs oldest pyramid was built almost 5,000 years ago but a similar structure hidden beneath rubble could be up to four times older
geologist dr danny hilman believes that a site in west java is revered because it hides an ancient temple built between 9,000 and 20,000 years ago
geologist dr danny hilman believes the site is culturally important is because it is an ancient pyramid which was built between 9,000 and 20,000 years ago
geologist dr danny hilman thinks the reason the site is so revered is that it is an ancient pyramid which was built between 9,000 and 20,000 years ago if the structure in west java is revealed to be a 20,000 - year - old pyramid , it will be the oldest on earth
in 1996 , archaeologists discovered pyramids on the atlantic coast of southern brazilian that sate to around 3,000 bc , making them a few hundred years older than egypt 's oldest pyramid
for years , experts thought the pyramids were simply piles of domestic rubbish
the ancient structure was rocked by a pyramid in 1992 , leaving it unstable with a large hole in its domed roof , but restoration is underway
dr danny hilman , a senior geologist at indonesian âs centre for geotechnical research , says that proof of the structure âs organisation lies underground
dr danny hilman said : â people think the prehistoric age was primitive , but this monument proves that wrong
â he believes such a pyramid would be proof of an advanced ancient civilisation in java and said that the majority of the stepped site is man - made , perhaps built by generations over a matter of centuries
some rocks were originally stuck together with a form of ancient glue and have been carbon dated to be around 7,000 bc. dr danny hilman said that the ruins hide walls and rooms with steps and terraces below , which are evidence of a complex building
dr danny hilman said : â people think the prehistoric age was primitive , but this monument proves that wrong
he said that so far man - made structures have been detected 49 ft ( 15 metres ) underground
however , dr danny hilman âs controversial findings are disputed and 34 indonesian archaeologists and geologists have submitted a petition criticising the projects â methods and motives
another anonymous expert is sceptical that such an ancient civilisation could have been advanced enough to build a pyramid so many thousands of years ago , when tools recovered from a nearby cave , dating to 7,000 bc were very primitive
