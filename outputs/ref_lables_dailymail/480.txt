a telescopic tube that scans the lungs for cancer is being used by nhs doctors , cutting diagnosis time from days to just 30 minutes
when tumours in the lungs are suspected , patients can face a raft of tests and even surgery to find out if they have the disease , often resulting in an agonising wait before they start lifesaving treatment
now doctors at university college london hospitals nhs foundation trust ( uclh ) are able to start vital treatment much sooner using a single procedure
it even allows them to assess instantly the type and severity of the cancer
the procedure involves inserting the ebus down the throat , guided by a tiny camera fitted to the tube
doctors at university college london hospitals nhs foundation trust ( pictured ) are able to start vital treatment much sooner using a single procedure they survive for 503 days after diagnosis , compared with 312 days for people assessed through more traditional methods
this is probably due to the fact that ebus can more accurately diagnose the type of cancer involved and therefore the type of treatment needed
â ebus routinely prevents the need for scans , tests and operations and speeds up the route to the correct treatment , â he says
he adds : â the trial showed that the new procedure is quicker and better â it halves the time to the start of treatment at no additional cost
â bbc political editor nick robinson announced that doctors found a tumour on his lung earlier this year more than 40,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer in the britain every year , yet the disease is notoriously difficult to treat as it is often spotted at a late stage
the health of many cancer patients can deteriorate because these delays mean they are not started immediately on lifesaving treatments such as chemotherapy
by comparison , the ebus allows doctors to look directly into the windpipe and breathing tubes , while the ultrasound scanner can check the lymph glands in the centre of the chest for cancer
her doctors could not be sure what type of cancer it was without investigating further , so they recommended she have the pioneering ebus procedure
â by 4pm that day , my cancer had been diagnosed and the appropriate chemotherapy was ordered for me to start the next day
