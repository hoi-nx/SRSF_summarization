the camera on your iphone could soon help save your life by testing to see if you have cancer in just a few minutes
their device uses the powerful cameras available now on most smartphones in combination with tiny beads that bind to cancerous cells
when these are placed in a clip on module ( b ) that attaches to a iphone camera ( c ) the microbeads produce distinctive diffraction patterns when they clump around a diseased cell ( top right ) when added to a tissue or blood sample , these microbeads bind to any cancerous cells in the sample , changing the way light passes through it
using a smartphone app , these images can then be sent to a central computer for analysis and then the result returned in less than 45 minutes
when clumped around a cell , the beads alter the way the light is scattered by the sample
the researchers claim it can asses 100,000 cells from a single image in around 45 minutes
the researchers say each test costs around Â£ 1.20 ( $ 1.80 )
they have already tested their device to detect cervical cancer in tissue samples obtained during smear tests
however , they say the system - known as digital diffraction diagnosis or d3 - can be adapted to screen for other types of cancers and they have already begun a trial testing for lymphoma
professor weissleder , a system 's biologist at harvard medical school who led the work , said it could even be used to help diagnose infectious diseases like hiv , tb and ebola
writing in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences , professor weissleder and his colleagues said : ' we envisage that these advances will position d3 as a versatile screening tool for various cancer types ( eg cervix , breast ad lymphoma ) and infectious diseases ( eg ebola , hiv and tuberculosis ) with applications in field work , mobile clinics and home care settings
diseased cells often produce molecules that makes them stand out from healthy tissue and so can be detected by antibodies
the graphic above shows how the new device works with a iphone to analyse samples for signs of cancer the images above show how the microbeads ( small white circles in bottom images ) clump around cells ( dotted lines ) in samples that were found to be of high risk of cervical cancer ( left ) low risk ( middle ) and benign ( right ) by attaching specific antibodies to the beads , it is possible to make them bind to these molecules , meaning they will gather around a cancerous cell in a tissue or blood sample
the scientists developed a module that can be attached to the camera of an iphone 4s device a tissue sample taken from a biopsy or blood from a simple finger prick could be mixed with these labelled microbeads and then placed on a slide
the researchers say each test costs around Â£ 1.20 ( $ 1.80 )
the images above show how the diffraction patterns created by beads and cells change when the beads clump around a cell , highlighting cancerous cells ( bottom ) compared to a healthy cell ( top ) they found that their results were between 92 % and 100 % accurate when compared to the current ' gold standard ' diagnostic test
