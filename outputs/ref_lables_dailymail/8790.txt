a sheep farmer has won an apology from supermarket giant asda after a leg of lamb she bought from them labelled as british turned out to be imported from the other side of the world
sue sharp was shocked to find a stamp on the Â£ 11 joint saying it had come from new zealand despite asda 's packaging claiming it was born , reared and slaughtered in the british
mrs sue sharp , who runs a 1,600 - acre sheep farm with her husband robert , had purposely sought out british produce in support of her fellow farmers
misleading : the leg of lamb sue sharp bought from asda in midlothian , scottish , claims on the packaging that it is from the british
but a stamp on the meat ( pictured ) is from the new zealand health inspector but she was horrified when she got home and found the ' home - grown ' leg of lamb had actually been flown halfway round the world to the store in midlothian , scottish
asda said the mislabelled lamb was a one - off and that the gaffe was the result of human error
but mrs sue sharp has questioned the claim and is now warning other shoppers to be extra vigilant when choosing their joints of meat
cut in the british ' but a stamp branded onto the animal 's skin carries the stamp of the new zealand health inspector
asda says it has carried out an investigation into the mistake which revealed mrs sue sharp 's leg of lamb was the only one mislabelled at the galashiels store she shopped at
sue sharp , 57 , has refused to accept asda 's explanation that the mistake was a one - off mrs sue sharp , 57 , whose farm has 1,300 sheep , said : ' as a sheep farmer i 'm very interested in making sure i buy british meat
' it was a bit of a shock and something i feel rather strongly about as a sheep farmer - the last thing i want to do is buy new zealand lamb
john armour from nfu scottish said : ' for a sheep farmer like mrs sue sharp to have bought a product she thought would support her fellow british farmers only to discover that it was imported is unacceptable and asda has acknowledged that
an asda spokesman said : ' this was an isolated incident where a leg of lamb was accidentally mislabelled ' it is estimated that more than 70 per cent of the new zealand lamb sold in british comes from halal slaughterhouses without the fact being declared on the label
' asda 's planned review of practices at the galashiels store is a sensible step and it would be prudent for guidance to be re-issued to its suppliers and all asda stores across the country to avoid fresh meat being incorrectly labelled in the future
