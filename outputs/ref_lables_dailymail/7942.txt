scientists hoping to see 13 billion light years away , giving them a look into the early years of the universe , are facing opposition from native hawaiians groups looking to preserve their past
demonstrators including game of thrones actor jason momoa demanded the state and university of hawaii stop construction of a new $ 1.4 billion telescope on sacred land
dozens of protesters were arrested on thursday at the mauna kea site , a mountain burial ground said to be visited by the snow goddess poli'ahu and a native hawaiians leader has called for a 30 - day moratorium on construction
thirty - one people were arrested during protests blocking access to the construction site for the $ 1.4billion thirty meter telescope on mauna kea in hawaii protesters say that the mountaintop , where scientists are building the facility to see 13billlion years into the past , is on top of sacred burial ground land the thirty meter telescope will be one of the largest space observation facilities in the world when its scheduled construction is completed ( artist 's rendering ) apo , a trustee for the office of hawaiian affairs , said he 's asking governor david ige and university of hawaii president david lassner to bring people together to work out a long - term solution
how that plays out on this mountain is going to be a matter of getting the right set of people in the room to negotiate some sort of compromise that everyone can live with , ' apo said
however , he stated that stopping construction of the 18 - story facility is key before progress is made
apo said the state should revisit how it manages the summit , which belonged to the native hawaiians monarchy until the us - backed overthrow of the island kingdom in 1893
the state holds former kingdom lands in trust for the native hawaiians people , who see the site as sacred
' it is the burial grounds of some of our most sacred and revered ancestors , ' said pisciotta , a project opponent
' the governor 's chief of staff , mike mccartney , said his office is involved in discussions about the controversy but must decline comment to allow productive conversations to continue
game of thrones actor jason momoa , who is native hawaiian , attended protests and posted pictures of himself thrusting his staff in the direction of current mauna kea telescopes the future aquaman star said that no more dynamite should be used on top of the mountain , which is sacred to native hawaiians the dispute has pitted native hawaiians , who believe the telescope site is sacred because it is where their creation story begins , against scientists , who believe it 's an ideal location for one of the world 's largest telescopes
about 300 protesters gathered at the mountain thursday , and police and state law enforcement arrested 20 people who tried to block a road leading to the summit of mauna kea on hawaii 's big island
visitors to the protests have included game of thrones actor and native hawaiian jason momoa , who said that the demonstrators were ' protectors not protesters '
poli'ahu , the native hawaiian snow goddess of mauna kea , is said to often descend to the mountain 's summit the mountain , which already holds 13 telescope facilities , is also the burial ground for previous generations of native hawaiians numbers are expected to swell ahead of an upcoming cultural festival in nearby hilo , according to hawaii news now
project opponents question whether land appraisals were done correctly and whether native hawaiians groups were consulted , so they have tried to prevent construction of the thirty meter telescope
while the native hawaiians groups do not oppose the telescope itself , they disagree with constructing it on mauna kea
scientists hope that building the thirty meter telescope will allow them to answer fundamental questions about the universe the project includes a thirty meter segmented mirror and scientists say it will drastically increase the ability of scientists to see images from light years away and detect earth - like planets researchers , who have already built 13 telescopes atop mauna kea , picked the site for their new project because of its remoteness and ideal observation conditions protests against the alleged incursion onto sacred land also disrupted a groundbreaking ceremony last year
office of hawaiian affairs trustee apo said that the demonstrators are sometimes viewed with ' intellectual snobbery ' ( file photo , march 30 ) apo ( right ) has asked the governor and the university of hawaii to bring both sides of the conflict together during a moratorium apo said that hawaii leases the land for $ 1 a year and the university gives it to the observatory for $ 1 a year
the people arrested thursday were trying to block trucks heading to the peak
the observatory is expected to be operational by 2024 , the same year a 39 - meter telescope is expected to be completed in chile .
