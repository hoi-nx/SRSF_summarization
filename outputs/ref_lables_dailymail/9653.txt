a couple who married in their teens and suffer from cystic fibrosis are in a race against time as the young wife waits for a life - saving lung transplant
katie prager , 24 , was diagnosed with an infection in her lungs in september 2009 and is desperately in need of a transplant as doctors predicted she would not live a year without new lungs
as her health continues to decline , her husband dalton , 23 , who has already received new lungs , is pleading for help
her insurance company , kentucky medicaid , will not pay for the out - of - state treatment she needs at the upmc , he says
dalton pleaded : ' they are turning my wife into a number , a statistic , a dollar sign
this ca nât be the end of our love story
please help me save my wife katie
she will not be covered for the expensive out - of - state medical procedure again until she spends 60 consecutive days out of the hospital
' dalton said : ' they are turning my wife into a number , a statistic , a dollar sign
this ca nât be the end of our love story ' only three months away from their four - year anniversary , the couple has not been together since november 2014 when dalton received new lungs , and hope they can be together to celebrate katie said that she feels like efforts to get transferred to pittsburgh are at a standstill and that something needs to be done
' kentucky medicaid policies allow for a simplified enrollment process for out - of - state providers in such situations , ' gwenda bond , spokeswoman for the kentucky cabinet for health and family services wrote in a statement to cnn
' however , the hospital claims that kentucky medicaid told them if they wanted to treat katie , they would be required to sign up hundreds of doctors to accept kentucky medicaid patients
only three months away from their four year anniversary in july , the couple have not been together since november 2014 when dalton received his lung transplant at upmc
however , he has not been able to be near his wife in person until she receives a lung transplant because of the risk of infection
