but in more than half of seats the result is already known , according to new analysis of safe seats
more than 25million live in constituencies where the result can already be predicted , because one party is so far ahead
there are 650 seats up for grabs on may 7 , with labour and the tories needing more than half to secure a majority
however , the electoral reform society claims the result in 364 seats can be called now , based on current polls and how â safe â they were in 2010
the lib dems are defending 56 seats , of which only seven are considered safe , after a dramatic collapse in their poll ratings since joining the coalition with the tories
for example , 70 per cent of seats in the east of england are considered safe , compared to 10 per cent in scotland , where the snp is expected to make sweeping gains
the electoral reform society has produced a new online tool for voters to see if they live in an area where the election result will be decided
of 303 tories seats , 186 are considered safe while 151 of labour âs 257 constituencies are not expected to change hands.the lib dems are defending 56 seats , of which only seven are considered safe , after a dramatic collapse in their poll ratings since joining the coalition with the tories based on the 2010 election result , david cameron needs to win another 23 more seats to secure a majority in the commons , while ed miliband needs at least 70
katie ghose , chief executive of the electoral reform society , said : â the fact that we can firmly predict the outcome of over half of the seats being contested this may is a sorry indictment of our outdated voting system
