tebow will sign with the eagles on monday , just in time for the off - season program , espn 's schefter reports
tebow 's last regular - season nfl game appearance was in december 2012 with the new york jets , from which he was released in 2013 having thrown only eight passes and run just 32 times in his lone season on the team
he will join the team just in time for the start of the off - season program though tebow has n't been a part of an nfl organization since 2013 , he spent the last two season training with noted throwing coach tom house , who also worked with new england patriots quarterback tom brady the new england patriots made tebow one of their final roster cuts in 2013 and he spent last year as a college gridiron television commentator when no nfl team wanted him
the eagles decided to still bring tebow on to the roster so he could be present for the team 's whole off - season program
tebow 's last regular - season nfl game was with the new york jets in 2012 not only will this give philadelphia three former first - round picks at the quarterback position and another decorated college player , but it will also reunited tebow and sanchez , who were teammates when they both were on the new york jets roster
tebow 's pursuit of being an nfl quarterback is back on , after being on hold since being cut from the new england patriots
although tebow had some success in denver , his inaccurate passing and lack of pocket presence has plagued him in the nfl
