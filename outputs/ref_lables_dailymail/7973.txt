sonnenspeicher ( pictured ) uses a lithium iron phosphate battery to store energy harnessed by solar panels
rather than selling this excess electricity back to the grid , homeowners can then use their stored supply for power with this in mind , german firm automatic storage device ( asd ) and designer wolfram walter have created the sonnenspeicher
it uses a lithium iron phosphate battery to store the energy harvested during the day by solar panels fitted to a roof
sonnenspeicher features an intelligent management system that automatically controls the charging and discharging current , to make it easier to manage how much energy is being used

when this energy runs out , the sonnenspeicher connects to the grid ' in a millisecond ' sonnenspeicher uses a lithium iron phosphate battery to store the energy harvested during the day by solar panels

the system comes in different sizes ranging from the sonnenspeicher 300 , which is 4.8 kwh , to the sonnenspeicher 600 at 8.06 kwh up to the 1000 model which offers 13.44 kwh
prices start at â¬ 8,450 ( Â£ 6,170 )

the firm said an average home can save around â¬ 1,200 a year ( Â£ 876 ) , so it would still take around seven years to recoup the costs , but the system will last for 20 years .
