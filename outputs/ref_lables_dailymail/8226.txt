concerns are raised about labour 's policy under shadow education secretary tristram hunt the heads of some of britain âs best state schools today warn of the dangers of a labour government reversing radical education reforms
in a letter to the mail , 80 current and former leaders say there is clear evidence that academy - style freedoms are benefiting a generation of children
but they say labour â and some senior liberal democrat â appear to be threatening to reimpose state controls
the letter , signed by the heads of good and outstanding autonomous schools , was backed yesterday by cameron
in it , they claim there is evidence that the most successful education systems benefit from schools with academy - style freedoms
but the heads expressed alarm at comments by ed miliband that labour would reimpose â a proper local authority framework for all schools â
â this is not the time to stop something that is working to the benefit of so many children in schools , â wrote the heads
â the letter , signed by the heads of good and outstanding autonomous schools , was backed by cameron as the general election campaign turned to education yesterday , the prime minister also attacked labour yesterday for opposing the expansion of free schools â which are run by groups such as teachers , parents and charities and are outside of local authority control
â how can you possibly be against an excellent school setting up another excellent school ? â he accused labour of being â anti free schools â for suggesting it wants to scrap the scheme
ed miliband has said labour would â have a proper local authority framework for all schools â we write as current and former headteachers and school leaders of good and outstanding autonomous schools across the country committed to the very best in state education
but as school leaders we are concerned that recent statements from liberal democrat and labour politicians suggest they might not protect all the freedoms which schools and teachers now enjoy and which are helping to drive up standards across the board
though shadow education secretary tristram hunt said that labour would not â go back to the old days of the local authority running all the schools â , ed miliband has said labour would â have a proper local authority framework for all schools â
this is not the time to stop something that is working to the benefit of so many children in schools
