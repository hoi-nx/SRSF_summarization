an imam who was gunned down in the street in a murder that is thought to have links to terrorism had been replaced at his mosque by a caribbean preacher involved in an attempted coup d'Ã©tat 25 years ago
arwani , 48 , was found slumped in a volkswagen passat on wednesday morning in wembley
he was said to have been embroiled in dispute with his former workplace , the an-noor mosque in acton , where he had been replaced by hassan anyabwile from trinidadian
the name of mr hassan anyabwile , 53 , appears in caribbean parliament documents surrounding a violent coup attempt in 1990 by muslim group jamaat al muslimeen
mr arwani was found dead on wednesday with bullet wounds in his chest mr arwani stepped down from his role at the mosque last year after it was repeatedly linked to extremism
when contacted , staff at the an-noor mosque refused to answer questions about the former preacher 's time there over the course of six days , almost 100 members of the islamic organisation were involved in holding hostages at gunpoint in the island 's capital , port of spain
the city 's police headquarters were blown up in the coup , with mr hassan anyabwile described by a parliamentary report of being ' responsible for organising the use ' of the explosives involved
it is understood mr hassan anyabwile replaced mr arwani at the an-noor mosque in acton , london , some time around 2013
mr arwani stepped down from the an-noor mosque last year following repeated accusations that it was linked to extremism
when approached this afternoon mr hassan anyabwile , who became partially disabled after being shot four times in legs , denied any knowledge of any dispute
hassan anyabwile is named in a trinidadian parliamentary report on an attempted coup which saw 24 people killed in 1990
he is described as being ' responsible ' for the use of explosives in the blowing of police headquarters mr hassan anyabwile did not comment on claims mr arwani had been embroiled in a dispute with the mosque when approached arriving for midday prayers the man , who was helped into a wheelchair by a security guard , told the mailonline : ' feud ? i know nothing about that
' when contacted today another member of staff at the mosque refused to answer questions about mr arwani 's time there
there is no suggestion that either mr hassan anyabwile or the an-noor mosque in acton is suspected of any involvement in his death , with counter terrorism police still investigating
earlier this week sources close to the mr arwani said they feared he may have been killed by supporters of the syria president assad - of whom the imam was a fierce critic
later his 23 - year - old daughter , elham arwani , said while her father was openly ' against assad ' , she did not think that was the reason behind his killing
mr arwani 's family said they did not believe his death was connected to his opposition of the assad regime
speaking at the family home ( above ) , his 23 - year - old daughter said that was likely ' not the reason ' hassan anyabwile was involved in the attempted coup of trinidadian in 1990

hassan anyabwile , formerly known in the caribbean as beville marshall , is thought to have separated from the jamaat al muslimeen in 2001
the attempted coup brought the island 's capital to a standstill with looting and violence rife for days but friends and neighbours claimed critics of the assad regime had been targeted in the area , with some residents who displayed green flags , a sign of opposition to the syria government , having their tyres slashed
mr arwani grew up in hama , the site of a notorious 1982 massacre where up to 40,000 civilians were killed by the syrian army under the orders of hafez al-assad , the current president 's father
he fled the country as a 16 - year - old , taking refuge in the uk while his parents faced routine questioning of his whereabouts for years
