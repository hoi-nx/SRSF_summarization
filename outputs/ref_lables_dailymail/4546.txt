the 62 - year - old politician continued : ' we just set in place a process to ensure that if there 's a deal , it 's a deal that will stand the test of time , that will keep iran from getting a nuclear weapon
' making an appearance on fox news , corker said that congress scrutiny and approval of any nuclear agreement with iran is essential to help make sure that the deal is not a bad one
' it 's very important that congress is in the middle of this , understanding , teasing out , asking those important questions , ' corker said
the deal is scheduled to be finalized by june 30
