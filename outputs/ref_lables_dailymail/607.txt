mourinho might have called it poetic justice as ashley barnes was sent off on the stroke of half - time to deliver a major blow to clarets 's prospects of staying in the premier league
clarets were left feeling hard - done - by as referee jones denied them a couple of possible penalties and more significantly allowed mirallas to stay on the pitch for a tackle worse than anything ashley barnes did
the chelsea manager condemned the clarets forward for a ' criminal challenge ' on matic at stamford bridge in february when he escaped unpunished and matic was sent off for retaliation

' that was a pithy way of explaining he was less than happy with mr jones for denying clarets penalties for a john stones challenge on ashley barnes and an attempt by mccarthy to bring down scott arfield
and he was furious that mirallas stayed on the pitch for a high lunge on george boyd early in the second half
maybe we should because other teams would have done after the mirallas challenge

they had already missed a penalty from ross barkley by that stage
clarets 's tom heaton was by far the busier of the two goalkeepers and when the visitors had a late chance to equalise , it fell to out - of - sorts ings who headed kieran trippier 's cross wide
leicester 's win leaves the clarets bottom of the table having scored only one goal in seven matches
ross barkley did and the effort was saved by tom heaton with roberto martinez unconvincingly stating afterwards he applauded the youngster 's confidence for stepping up
at least it did n't deny toffees a win as mirallas had done when he grabbed the ball of baines against west brom in january and missed his penalty
