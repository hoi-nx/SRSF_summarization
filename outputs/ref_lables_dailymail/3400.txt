i conducted a poll on my radio show recently , and more than 70 per cent of those who voted believe man utd will win the title next season
is it heart ruling the head among the man utd faithful ? or is there a genuine belief that serial winner louis van gaal is about to re-assert himself at the very top again ? man utd boss louis van gaal was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1 - 0 by chelsea van gaal poses for pictures with man utd fans at the training ground during a day for the club 's foundation van gaal ( pictured talking to fans ) is starting to assert himself at the man utd after a stuttering start if he is to take man utd back to the very top , he âll need more than memphis depay
i âve already established in this column recently that van gaal is a great , and he is a winner
at the end of his ( albeit shorter ) old trafford stay , his record will need to stand comparison with that of sir alex
obviously van gaal can not win the same number of trophies sir alex picked up during his 27 year reign , so relatively speaking what does he need to achieve to be considered a success at man utd ? sir alex underachieved in europe : only two champions league wins in his time â just one more than liverpool in the same period , and the same number as jose mourinho ( who won those in significantly fewer years )
van gaal will be hungry to add to that success which came 20 years ago
so what needs to change for man utd to reach that level where they are in the mix to win the premier league and the champions league ? sir alex celebrates his second champions league triumph with man utd in 2008 van gaal celebrates winning the champions league with ajax in 1995 - his only triumph in europe keeping david de gea would be ideal , but valdes has winning experience and there is a bond between the former barcelona keeper and the manager after their time together at the nou camp
man utd need a quality right back â nathaniel clyne has been linked and the southampton man would be perfect
i âve said before , luke shaw has the potential to be an all - time great at man utd
at centre half , phil jones and chris smalling might become the trusted partnership , or wisdom may win the day and man utd could go and get mats hummels from dortmund
he âs a winner and a leader â perfect for man utd
luke shaw ( right ) has had a difficult start to his man utd career but impressed against chelsea mats hummels ( left ) of dortmund is a player who has long been linked with a move to man utd in midfield , man utd are strong in my view â daley blind and carrick can fight for that anchor spot , or even play together depending on the opposition
ander hererra ( holding off chelsea 's cesc fabregas ) has impressed for man utd in recent weeks juan mata ( right ) is starting to show his best form after moving from chelsea last january angel di maria ( centre ) has struggled this season but to leave him leave would be a massive risk for man utd man utd 's on - loan striker radamel falcao has struggled for form ever since joining the club last summer januzaj has stalled a little bit after bursting onto the scene , but he may yet come good
and that âs why man utd need to go all out to get gareth bale
man utd have already enquired about psv âs depay , he has all the skills and end product to be loved at old trafford , but man utd still need that marquee man to humiliate opposing defences at home and abroad
memphis depay ( left , in action for psv ) is a prime target for man utd and has the potential to be a great signing gareth bale has the dynamism , goals and energy that man utd have missed in their side this season van gaal signed a three - year deal
