a russian - language version of apple 's personal assistant siri has been caught giving apparently homophobic responses to questions about gay people
a man called alex posted a video on youtube in which he asked the programme on his ipad a series of questions about gay marriage , where to find gay club and how to register a gay marriage in the uk
alex got this response when he asked the russia - language version of ' siri , gay clubs around me ? ' his ipad version of the apple personal assistant told him of swearing when he asked how he could register a gay marriage in england ' however , in russia it turns out to be quite homophobic
' he asks siri in russia ' is gay marriage normal ? ' and gets the response : ' i believe this emotion should be considered negative
' to the question ' how do you register a gay marriage in england ? ' siri replies ' so , now you 're swearing obscenities and you 're going to eat with these very hands ! ' the same query also gets the response ' i will pretend i did n't hear that ' , while the apple user is told ' alex , you are so rude ! ' in reply to the question ' siri , tell me about gay marriage '
the company has said the responses to alex 's questions were down to a ' bug ' which it has now fixed gay rights are a delicate topic in russia since a law banning ' gay propaganda ' was passed in 2013 , effectively prohibiting the showing of â non-traditional â or homosexual relationships in any form to people under the age of 18
it has been reported elsewhere that the company has put siri 's responses down to a ' bug ' which has now been fixed .
