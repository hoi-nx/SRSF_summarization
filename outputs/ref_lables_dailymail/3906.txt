ms lucy jones 's research has revealed the habits which lead us to nibble needlessly , identifying the behaviours and reasons behind these three distinct snack tribes : ms lucy jones told femail : ' snack amnesiacs are mindless munchers who subconsciously snack , opening something and eating far more than they intended
' more often than not , these snackers have no concept of what or how much they are eating
according to ms lucy jones , those who are stressed out due to environmental or emotional pressures are situational snackers
this tribe often have busy schedules which causes them to skip meals
then there are the super

this tribe only nibble sensibly , as and when their body tells them to , ' ms lucy jones said
ms lucy jones is encouraging women to revamp their snacking habits by trying the 21 day snack happy challenge : a simply snack on a handful of almonds once a day for 21 days
we all lead such busy lives and juggle a variety of tasks and commitments every day , often resulting in long gaps between meals
planning ahead and arming yourself with a handful of almonds will really help to get you through the day
' ' as a high source of fibre and containing 15 essential nutrients , almonds are the perfect snack you can feel good about , ' she said
do you regularly plan out your nutrient intake in advance , even on busy days ? if you answered yes go to question 8
when you âre having a busy day , can you usually stay strong and avoid snacking on things you feel are bad for you ? if you answered no go to question 4

to fill up , the situational snacker will grab snacks throughout the day , whilst she can
if you 're a ' situational snacker ' you might find that emotional pressures , stress and a particularly busy day can cause you to snack , even if not hungry , and you may be particularly prone to pick at food as a comfort mechanism
' the key is to snack sensibly and make sure you have something nutritious to nibble on at your desk , in the kitchen , in the car , or wherever the hunger pangs strike
the nutrients in almonds make them a perfect snack to enjoy between meals
almonds are also a high source of magnesium , which contributes to a reduction of tiredness and fatigue , so they really are the perfect snack to keep you going through a busy day
' if you are a snack - amnesiac : throughout her day , the snack-amnesiac will graze on the foods closest to hand , without even realising she 's doing it
munching through a share - size bag of crisps whilst watching the telly when she only meant to eat a handful , reaching for the plate of biscuits during a lull in the board meeting and even waking up in the middle of the night and sleepwalking to the kitchen to nibble on some leftovers from the fridge are just a few examples of the mindless snacking habit in action
these great little nuts are also high in unsaturated fat , and in fact , a recent study published in the european journal of nutrition found that a mid-morning snack of almonds helped control appetite and resulted in reduced calorie intake by the participants during the rest of the day
