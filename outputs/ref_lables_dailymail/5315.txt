rosberg has published a video explaining his row with hamilton after the chinese grand prix
rosberg complained during a heated press conference that his mercedes team - mate hamilton , the race winner who was sitting next to him as he spoke , had acted â selfishly â in slowing down to such an extent that he ( rosberg ) could have been caught by sebastian vettel of ferrari
speaking on video more calmly later , rosberg , who finished second , a place ahead of sebastian vettel , answered questions he had received from fans about the furore
rosberg responded to a fan who accused rosberg of ' crying ' after he complained about hamilton hamilton celebrates his win with the mercedes team , but rosberg appears less pleased with 2nd hamilton crossed the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in china one asked if he was â crying â â by which the questioner meant moaning or being a poor loser
â rosberg was a few seconds behind hamilton when the world champion slowed
so why did he not push on and try to pass his team - mate rather than ask his pit wall engineers to tell hamilton to speed up so he could move away from sebastian vettel ? hamilton and rosberg spray champagne from the podium as mercedes celebrate a one - two finish rosberg was clearly angry with hamilton in the press conference and hit out at his team - mate â i understand why you âre asking that , â said rosberg to that question
but the reason is , i did try to attack hamilton in the first stint , and it just did nât work
my only chance of winning the race anyway , or to fight hamilton , or try to overtake him , would have come at the end of the race , so that âs what i was building up to
â rosberg made the video â he posts his thoughts following each race â after discussing the incident with his team management before leaving the shanghai track
the british driver denied he had done anything wrong following rosberg 's accusations hamilton backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team - mate 's race he added : â it was definitely intense after the race , but we had a very good sit down , a good discussion
â rosberg has since travelled to dubai en route to the next race in bahrain on sunday
was the race as expected in terms of the challenge from ferrari and , also , can you talk us through that radio message you got from the team about speeding up ? were you aware that rosberg was getting so backed - up towards sebastian vettel ? lh : i was nât controlling his race , i was controlling my own race but , great race , i âm really happy
i had no real threat from rosberg through the whole race
q : rosberg , can you talk us through your view of the race today
so , first of all it was unnecessarily close with sebastian vettel as a result , and also it cost me a lot of race time as a result because i had to cover him and then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer
q : hamilton , would you like to respond ? lh : not really ! my job is not to â¦ it âs not my job to look after rosberg âs race
