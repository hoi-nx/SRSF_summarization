a labour government would take action to enforce a premier league commitment to invest five per cent of the proceeds from lucrative tv rights deals in grassroots sport , the party has said
shadow health secretary and keen football fan andy burnham said the move could unlock Â£ 400 million to nurture the talents of the next generation of stars over the course of the next parliament
andy burnham ( left ) and ed miliband promise that labour will make the premier league invest in grassroots mr andy burnham accused prime minister david cameron of failing to get tough on the premier league despite a massive increase in its tv revenues during his time in power
mr andy burnham said : ' the last labour government secured a commitment from the premier league that five per cent of all tv income should be invested in the grassroots
david cameron is accused of not keeping his promises and getting tough on the premier league ' football at grassroots is struggling and , in many cities , premier league stadia loom over run - down changing rooms and overgrown pitches
that is why a labour government will take action to ensure that every penny the premier league owes is paid in full , unlocking an estimated Â£ 400 million for the grassroots in the next parliament
' labour sports spokesman clive efford added : ' we will get tough and under labour 's better plan we will make sure the premier league lives up to its commitment to invest in the grassroots
' bt sport and sky sports were part of the lucrative tv deal estimated around Â£ 5billion starting in 2016 a premier league spokesman said : ' the success of the premier league benefits the development of the english game outside of the top flight
