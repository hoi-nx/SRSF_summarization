faithless â dance anthem â insomnia â booms out seconds before games at fulham , and it âs rather apt for symons
those fans will quite rightly point to the fact their side were out - played for large parts against rotherham , a club with a far inferior budget and experience at this level
they are losing faith in their manager , even though fulham should retain their championship status from here
ross mccormack ( left ) pokes home the equaliser but fulham were unable to push on for the winner that they came away with a point was down to poor finishing from the yorkshire visitors , nothing more
ross mccormack came to the rescue after matt derbyshire âs early opener to spare blushes
fulham just want this wretched campaign over
â first half we were awful , â symons said
â second half was a huge improvement to a bit better than awful
symons ( centre ) admitted his side were second best and says the club need to rebuild in the summer â it is slow and it âs painful
rotherham knew points must be won here , and set about bossing proceedings from the very first minute
matt derbyshire ( centre ) pokes home the opener after four minutes to put steve evans ' side in the lead fulham xi : marcus bettinelli , richards , turner , burn , husband , scott parker , guthrie , tunnicliffe ( hoogland - 54 ) , bryan ruiz , ross mccormack , smith subs not used : kiraly , stafylidis , hutchinson , woodrow , rodallega , kavanagh goals : ross mccormack 67 booked : guthrie , burn , turner rotherham xi : emiliano martinez , hunt , craig morgan , kirk broadfoot , lafferty ; smallwood , arnason , frecklington , pringle ; danny ward , derbyshire subs not used : collin , wilson , wood , hammill , bowery , milsom , green goals : derbyshire 4 booked : kirk broadfoot referee : andy davies how it came to pass that matt derbyshire might âve put the visitors three goals up inside the first four minutes will mystify symons
but fulham fell asleep from ben pringle âs corner to present derbyshire with a third opportunity and he was nât to miss , stabbing in from close range to signal the craven cottage dissenters to find their voice
danny ward squandered a glorious chance from 12 yards , skewing a shot wide as fulham continued to be carved open
bryan ruiz ( 10 ) is denied a goal by the on - rush arsenal loanee emiliano martinez of rotherham fulham 's remaining fixtures : blackpool ( a ) , middlesbrough ( h ) , norwich ( a ) rotherham 's remaining fixtures : norwich ( h ) , reading ( h ) , leeds ( a ) kirk broadfoot was guilty of missing a superb chance from another corner and the central defender later struck a post
bryan ruiz spurned a good opportunity for the hosts , ross mccormack then failing to stretch far enough to covert at the back post
symons was bailed out by ross mccormack though , who got on the end of scott parker âs pass to poke in a 67th - minute equaliser
smith ( centre ) was unable to continue his good goalscoring form for the cottagers â the goal is a blatant handball by ross mccormack , â rotherham assistant paul raynor fumed
time for fulham to press reset and start again .
