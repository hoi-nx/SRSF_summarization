there was also a wonderful goal from shelvey disallowed in the first half because wayne routledge was adjudged to have fouled leighton baines
but he was excellent here , driving swansea early in the game before aaron lennon put everton in front on 41 minutes
fittingly it was shelvey whose penalty ultimately claimed swansea 's 47th point of the season â equalling their premier league record from 2012
