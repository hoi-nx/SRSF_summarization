it may not be a looker , but the lusitanian toadfish can do much more than croak
the fish , which lives in rocky crevices in the mediterranean sea and atlantic ocean and glides over the muddy sea floor , can whistle , croak and grunt
scientists have found that halobatrachus didactylus makes five types of calls not only to attract a mate , but to warn off rivals too may be trying to swipe their nesting site
lusitanian toadfish ( pictured ) make five types of calls and males can even sing in choruses to attract mates
the fish woo females with long , rhythmical boatwhistles , which also act as a deterrent to love rivals , male fish woo females with long , rhythmical noises that sound like boat whistles , which also act as a deterrent to love rivals , new scientist reported
because males , which grow up to 20 inches ( 50cm ) long , are fiercely territorial , their song also serves as a warning for rivals to stay away
the creature is well camouflaged so sound is the best way to get attention this is important because males nest close together to one another and form singing choruses like frogs or toads to demonstrate their virility and strength
the whistles vary according to the size of the fish , meaning that specific calls from larger specimens are particularly effective at deterring another fish from picking a fight and stealing a nest
lusitanian toadfish typically weigh more than four lbs ( 2kg ) and their large , flat heads and wide mouths , make them look like toads , giving their their name
portugal scientists discovered that the sounds made by lusitanian toadfish indicate who they are , their motivation and information about their nest
here , a female lays eggs , which stick to the roof of a nest the experts analysed the frequencies of different songs
water temperature , tide level , fish motivation and the level of social interactions affected most acoustic parameters analysed ( shown above )
for example , during low tide , the sounds made by the fish were shorter in duration and had lower main frequencies male mice sing to woo females , scientists claim
the females , meanwhile , seem to like some of the songs more than others
these songs also had a more simple structure and were longer
male lusitanian toadfish build nests under rocks during mating season , which runs from may to july and sing to attract female visitors
