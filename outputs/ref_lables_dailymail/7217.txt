leading the high street charge to the kate 's wardrobe is hobbs , a mid-range label that has taken her through everything from glamorous evening events to international tours
' the duchess of cambridge likes to play it quite safe when it comes to her wardrobe , pre and post-baby , and hobbs is the perfect brand for her , ' explains fashion pundit glazin

' the duchess wore a brown shirt dress from hobbs to visit foster carers in north london in january and a delicate polka dot velvet top by the brand for a place2be reception at kensington palace in november
but while she championed hobbs on several occasions during her second pregnancy , it is by no means the only high street staple in kate 's wardrobe
spot the kate ! kate in a Â£ 169 hobbs dalmatian coat in march that was first seen in 2013 , right the brunette royal is also a huge fan of a small anglo-french label called seraphine , which has grown from a small shop in 2002 to the a-list favourite it is today
along with a Â£ 195 coat worn in january and a Â£ 95 blue and green floral dress sported to visit the potteries in february , she also opted for the brand when making her dÃ©but in new york
on that occasion , it was the glamorous Â£ 225 plum boucle seraphine maternity marina coat that was chosen - and true to form , the design has since sold out repeatedly
seraphine is the brainchild of french expat cecile reinaud , who launched the brand in 2002 from a small shop on high street kensington , and is no doubt thrilled with the royal endorsement
she has also sported a shirt dress from jaeger and Â£ 99 print dress by alice temperley during her pregnancy
