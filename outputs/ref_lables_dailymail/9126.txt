everton manager martinez sees a fearlessness in relegation - threatened burnley similar to that displayed by his wigan team in surviving against the odds in the premier league
the burnley head to goodison park having beaten manchester city , drawn against tottenham and being narrowly defeated by arsenal in the last month
they remain two points from safety but martinez believes the fact they have been scrapping to get out of the bottom three all season - much like his wigan side in the four seasons he spent with them before joining the everton - gives them an advantage over teams who have been dragged into the race for survival
martinez ( left ) says burnley 's player remind him of his old wigan side when they avoided the drop ' you always see similarities , ' said the spaniard when asked for comparisons with his experience of the latics ' relegation battles
' i do n't think there is any fear of relegation and that is the biggest difference burnley have over other teams who are not in the relegation zone who are starting to think they have something to lose
the spaniard masterminded wigan 's escape from relegation which seemed an almost impossible task ' when you are in a situation as clear as the one they have now with the points they have , they are only one step away from getting away from the bottom three and that is an incredible incentive
' martinez was criticised for not changing his approach during everton 's difficult run a couple of months ago but he stuck to his principles and he believes sean dyche 's clear plan will help burnley survive
sean dyche has installed a fearlessness into his squad and martinez praised his weekend opponent ' your own approach becomes your biggest problem but burnley have been an incredible source of clarity , knowing what they are and how they want to achieve success and they are enjoying the best period of their season in terms of being consistent with their performances
' while burnley are fighting for their lives everton have nothing left to play for , 12th in the table on 38 points with no chance of qualifying for europe again
