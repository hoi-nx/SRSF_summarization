the mother of a high school student who has been prevented from attending classes as a consequence for not wearing the right style shoes has expressed her outrage over the ' ridiculous ' situation
riley , 14 , turned up for classes wearing new shoes on the first day of term at mcclelland college , in melbourne 's south - east , only to be told that the black soft - leather lace - ups did not meet uniform standards
the year eight student was prevented from attending her classes for the day , and has not been allowed back into the classroom since the incident , which her mother parker claims has disadvantaged and excluded her daughter
riley , 14 , has been prevented from attending classes at her melbourne high school because her shoes do not meet the strict uniform guidelines the secondary school 's policy outlined in the 2015 personal learning journal states that girls are to wear ' black leather lace - up school shoes ( not fashion heels ) ' for both summer and winter uniforms , a guideline which ms parker said riley 's shoes meet
the rubber - soled soft leather lace - ups were pointed out by a teacher on the first day of term , and riley was taken to the school 's office , where she was offered a pair of shoes from lost property , and remained until the end of the day
the secondary school 's policy states that girls are to wear ' black leather lace - up school shoes ( not fashion heels ) ' , which ms parker said the shoes comply to ms parker said her daughter needed a more practical and comfortable shoe to meet her needs ' i just ca n't make sense of this
when i spoke to the vice-principal yesterday i was told that her shoes are n't the type of shoes they 're looking for , even though they are black leather lace - ups , ' she said
' why has she not been allowed to attend class while this grey area is being cleared up ? if i decided to pull her out of school for four days , i would be in trouble
the 14 - year - old has not been allowed back into classes since monday , which ms parker said has caused significant issues when it comes to her daughter completing her school work
' ms parker also said that she pointed out to the school that being unable to attend classes and prevented from joining in with her classmates was exclusion , which went against the school 's own policy
the school offered to buy riley a pair of shoes which met the standards of the uniform policy , but ms parker said that she had declined the offer as she did not understand why her daughter was not able to wear comfortable shoes that she already owned
ms parker said that her daughter was being excluded from classes , which breached mcclelland college 's own policy on bullying and harassment mcclelland college 's principal ferra said that the school was sticking by the uniform policy mr ferra released a statement on thursday addressing the issue
' our students are expected to wear black leather lace - up shoes
' we still expect the student to wear the appropriate shoes but will be ensuring she receives regular classroom teaching , which is what we have always wanted , ' reported the herald sun. mr ferra said that mcclelland college 's uniform policy was set by the school council , and involved consultation with the school community
