a clear sign that i 'm firmly settled in middle age may be the utterly sad truth that , i am riveted by the tight jaw lines
these women had expression lines , wrinkles around their eyes and on their forehead when speaking , but chins and jaw lines that were as tight as a girl just sitting her gcse 's
so just how do they do it ? as a 40 - something woman who is sadly observing a jaw line that appears to be more and more desperate to rendez - vous with my neck each and every day â it has become my latest obsession
after some calls to my best insider a-list docs , it seems the new trend in celebrity - ville these days is not about hiding your wrinkles , instead it 's the nefertiti lift , aptly named after the egyptian queen famous for ( amongst other things ) her very defined jaw line
dr kubicka says she has clients coming in each and every day asking for botox not on their foreheads but designed to firm their jaw line
' she has clients coming in each and every day asking for botox not on their foreheads but designed to firm their jaw line
here 's why : ' the first thing that our mind assesses when it come to judging the age of the person is shape of their face , ' dr kubicka says , ' our faces change with time from a triangle ( high cheek bones and defined jaw line ) to a square with a heavy jaw line and double chin
thus , traditional botox on the forehead alone does n't improve appearance , but changing the shape of your face and tightening your jaw line , does
ashley says the latest anti aging treatment is the nefertiti lift for jowls think about the love scenes
indeed , dr kubicka of clinicbe confirms that there 's a lot that can be done without surgery : you can jab it : access to soft and fat tissue around the jaw line and under the chin can be corrected with up to 3 sessions of aqualyx ( which is a new and improved version of ' flab jab ' ) it works to dissolve fat cells and allows us to pass them out of our bodies when we urinate
you can lift it : over active platysma muscle on the neck that pulls the corner of the jawline down with every contraction can be relaxed with muscle relaxant injections such as botox which gives an effective lift
botox ( muscle relaxing injections ) : nefertiti lift Â£ 350 ( treatments last 3 - 4 months ) and finally dr kubicka says that the best innovation over the last couple of years is threads
as much as they lift they result in an increase of collagen production and line improvement as a bonus
