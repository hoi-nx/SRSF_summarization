northampton have ruled out winger george north for the game against clermont auvergne on saturday north lies motionless on the franklin 's gardens turf after being knocked out against wasps no having opted to act in the best interests of their marquee player â despite the importance of a champions cup quarter - final in france â the saints have taken an encouraging step in response to fears about north 's long - term health
' in theory we could consider him , ' said mallinder , northampton 's director of rugby
he did get knocked unconscious for a very short period of time
' in tuesday 's sportsmail , former scotland full back rory lamont â who has suffered the after - effects of concussion injuries â called for the welsh icon ( left ) to be rested for six months , saying : ' it 's a complete disgrace that it has got to this stage
george north has been let down
' it 's a tough game
george north has said that himself
a head injury is no different to any other type of injury
' nathan hughes arrives late as north touches down - moments later his leg connected with the wing 's head the welshman receives medical treatment on the pitch before being taken off on a stretcher in reference to last friday night 's incident , mallinder stressed that north had considerable medical support , in contrast to how it used to be in rugby â when attitudes were very different
' on tuesday night , nathan hughes was banned until april 28 for his ' reckless ' actions â colliding with north when the try scorer was on the ground , unable to protect his head
the sanction has divided opinion , with wasps no players incensed by what they regard as an unduly heavy - handed punishment for an offence which the disciplinary panel accepted was not malicious
asked if he had any sympathy with nathan hughes , mallinder initially refused to comment , but added : ' i said at the time i think it was a red - card offence
meanwhile , wasps no will make a statement over whether they will appeal nathan hughes ' ban
' north is congratulated by team - mates after scoring the first of his two tries against wasps no last friday night
