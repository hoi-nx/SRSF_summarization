who has been liverpool âs player of the season ? had you asked that question 12 months ago , the answer would have been glaring : luis suarez
had it been a â normal â season , steven gerrard , daniel sturridge , coutinho and raheem sterling would all have been worthy recipients
luis suarez was clearly liverpool 's player of last season after the striker scored 31 goals in the campaign steven gerrard ( left ) and phillippe coutinho ( front ) also played well as liverpool 's title tilt fell short the brazilian playmaker put in a real all - action display for his team
fast forward to the present and ask the same question : who has been liverpool âs player of the season ? there is no obvious candidate
jordan henderson , of course , would have his backers
the england international has excelled since the turn of the year , while coutinho would command his share of the vote
emre can has caught the eye since christmas , while results have been better with lucas leiva in the team ; liverpool have only suffered three defeats in the 23 matches he has started
jordan henderson has chipped in with some important goals and impressed with his boundless energy coutinho has again played well and won the game for liverpool to send them into the fa cup semi-finals coutinho has popped up with some important goals this season â five of his six strikes have earned liverpool results ( four wins and a draw )
daniel sturridge 's injury - hit season has been a tempestuous affair for the out - of - sorts striker raheem sterling was denied of service at ewood park during a frustrating display for the contract rebel at this moment , nobody is better placed than coutinho
if liverpool are going to clamber into the top four â still a possibility given liverpool âs implosion â and win the fa cup , much will depend on the little brazilian
