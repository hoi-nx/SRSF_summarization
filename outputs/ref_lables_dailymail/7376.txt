the widow of a cyclist killed after hitting a pothole during a charity ride from land 's end to john o'groats has won a six - figure payout from the council who failed to mend the road
martyn uzzell , 51 , died instantly after he was thrown into path of a car by a four - inch deep pothole
uzzell has received a six - figure payout after her husband martyn ( both pictured ) was killed during a charity cycle ride when he was thrown into the path of a four - inch deep pothole tragedy : experienced cyclist mr martyn uzzell , 51 , was riding from land 's end to john o'groats for macmillan cancer support when he died coroner rob turnbull told mr martyn uzzell 's inquest last year that there was â no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was the cause of the incident â
a month before the tragedy in 2011 , a traffic policeman saw the hole and his control room alerted their council counterparts , but the alert was not passed on to the highway inspection team
in the following weeks , the council inspected the road twice but failed to take any action before mr martyn uzzell cycled along it with two friends raising money for macmillan cancer support
he was flung from his bicycle by the pothole , landing in the path of a car and suffering fatal head injuries
his widow uzzell , 49 , from clevedon , north somerset , has now reached an out of court settlement with north yorkshire county council
however the local authority is still refusing to apologise for the state of the road in the lead up to the cyclist 's death
a coroner previously ruled that the state of the a65 ( pictured ) , near giggleswick , north yorkshire , was ' the cause of the incident ' after the inquest last year , mrs uzzell said the death of her husband , an experienced cyclist and service engineer , was preventable
the council inspected the pothole in the weeks before mr martyn uzzell 's ( pictured ) death but decided it did not need repairing ' i am told a policeman had reported the pothole on two occasions to the council but nothing was done
' a spokeswoman for north yorkshire county council said : ' whilst north yorkshire county council accepts no liability for the tragic death of mr martyn uzzell , the authority has appreciated that this is a sensitive matter and has therefore reached a settlement with mr martyn uzzell âs widow , to avoid prolonged involvement in further litigation
