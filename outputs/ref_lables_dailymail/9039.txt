cameron likes to project an image as the ' chillaxing ' statesman unruffled by political troubles - but this morning his usual demeanour seemed to desert him as he donned a bizarre outfit on the campaign trail
the prime minister looked exhausted as he stepped off the sleeper train at penzance today , ahead of a speech in which he delivered his ' plan for cornwall '
but mr cameron is still trailing ed miliband 's labour nationally , with just 14 days to go until polling day
get - up : cameron stepped off the sleeper train at penzance this morning wearing jeans , smart shoes and a navy jacket journey : the prime minister travelled for eight hours from paddington station to reach cornwall tired out : the tory leader did not appear to have enjoyed a good night 's sleep on the train and was wearing an unusual combination of solely dark colours a yougov poll published this morning put labour on 34 per cent - one point ahead of the tories
the lib dems trail on 7 per cent with ukip in third on 14 per cent
mr cameron said in an interview this week that he ' always manages to portray a calm smoothness ' - however , he looked anything but smooth at penzance station
the prime minister seemed as if he had had trouble sleeping on the eight - hour journey from london 's paddington station
destination : he apparently chose the sleeper to avoid taking time out of his schedule to travel outfit : mr cameron wore a navy jacket , dark blue shirt , jeans and smart black shoes - as well as a red box inspiration ? mr cameron may have been trying to channel the style sense of us president barack obama mr cameron sported a navy jacket with a dark blue polo shirt , and set off his outfit with the ultimate status symbol - a red box holding ministerial papers , which only a few dozen people are entitled to carry
changed : the leader put on a more formal outfit for his speech at a company in penzance gimmick : mr cameron tried out a selfie stick during a visit to radio station pirate fm today snap : the prime minister used the gadget to take this photograph of himself with the station 's staff he replied : ' i do n't know
while the overnight journey from london to penzance lasts eight hours , mr cameron would have had to carve out five hours from his schedule if he had travelled to cornwall in the daytime
there is also a 70 - minute flight from gatwick to newquay airport , not far from penzance , but the prime minister may have calculated that taking the train is likely to project a more down - to - earth image
fun : the prime minister took part in selfies with tory activists during one of his cornish campaign stops speech : workers at the rodda dairy factory in redruth watch mr cameron address them back to business : in the afternoon the prime minister flew to brussels for a summit on the ongoing mediterranean migrant crisis the constituency of st ives , where penzance is located , is the most remote in the britain because it also contains the scilly isles
the seat is currently held by lib dems andrew george , but the tories will be keen to overturn his 1,719 majority as part of efforts to drive the party out of the south-west
in his speech at a scaffolding firm this morning , mr cameron told activists that labour do not care about anything ' west of bristol ' , adding : ' now imagine what it would be like if alex salmond was calling the shots
' how the true blue pm takes refuge in navy outfits for work and play the prime minister is known for his love of navy outfits - nearly all of his suits are dark blue , and he also sports the inoffensive colour when on holiday in britain or abroad
favourite : mr cameron often wears navy blue when he is off duty , like in this photograph from his cornish holiday in summer 2013 relaxed : the prime minister wore dark blue again while on holiday with wife samantha in portugal last year suit : mr cameron was wearing a dark jacket and trousers at a campaign event in bedford yesterday superspy : cameron has backed hague to take over the role of bond cameron has backed his cabinet colleague hague to be the next bond - saying that it 's time for britain 's most famous spy to be portrayed by a yorkshire
