a pennsylvania high school is attracting national media attention for all the wrong reasons after a group of students organized a so - called anti-gay day protest , with future events scheduled
the organizers of the homophobic protest at mcguffey high school in washington county encouraged anyone who shared their bigoted stance to show support by wearing a flannel shirt to school and writing ' anti-gay ' on their hands
the event was held last thursday and students report that openly gay pupils also had bible verses pined to their lockers and were physically bullied by the so - called protesters
she was one of a number of pupils who the previous day had observed the nationally recognized day of silence , an event aimed at drawing attention to gay and lesbian bullying and harassment in schools
thursday 's anti-gay day protest is understood to have been a reaction to the previous day 's event
it is estimated that somewhere between 50 and 100 students took part in the anti-gay event and many openly shared photos on social media of them dressed in their flannel shirts
students have also reported seeing a ' lynch list ' circulating the school of lbgt students who participated in the day of silence event
