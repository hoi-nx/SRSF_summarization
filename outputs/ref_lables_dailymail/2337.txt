police still have no answers about exactly what happened that led to the neck injury though baltimore mayor stephanie rawlings-blake said , ' whatever happened happened in the back of the van '
she expressed frustration on monday as authorities could not figure out the exact circumstances that led to gray 's neck injury and said that the description of events given in a police report may not have shown probable cause in his arrest
' when mr. gray was put in that van , he could talk , he was upset
' six officers were involved in the arrest and transportation of gray after he was taken into custody
though his arrest was for the switchblade , officers said that his arrest in a ' hot spot ' area of baltimore known for narcotics was because he was running away after seeing police

a timeline released by police said gray was taken by a prisoner transport van from the ' crime ' scene to the western district station shortly before 9am
while he was in the van , gray , who is 5 ' 8 '' and 145 pounds , was put in leg restraints after he became ' irate '
thirty minutes after he was arrested , an ambulance was called to the police station to take gray to the hospital after he had a ' medical emergency ' , according to nbc baltimore
the van made multiple stops , including stopping to pick up another suspect who could hear but not see gray because of a partition in the vehicle
gray died on sunday morning at the university of maryland shock trauma center from his spinal injuries anyone who witnessed gray 's arrest or has video of the incident is being asked aid in the investigation , which the baltimore mayor said has frustrated her due to its lack of answers gray suffered a broken vertebra and an injured voice box , according to his family
an attorney retained by gray 's family , william ' murphy , spoke out on sunday and described the circumstances leading up to the young man 's death , saying that police chased the man ' without any evidence he had committed a crime '
protests continued monday as police released the arrest report for gray that ultimately led to his tragic death justice league nyc organized a rally saturday night at the western district station where gray was taken ' he 's gone , ' richard shipley said after confirming the death of his stepson
he said that the investigation is particularly interested in deciding whether police waited too late to call paramedics and whether an officer placed a knee on gray 's back during the arrest
citizens and groups including justice league of nyc took to the streets to protest following the death of gray peaceful demonstrators walk with their hands on their heads yesterday in protest over the death of gray civilian video showed gray being loaded in the van , but did not show the entire encounter or how he was hurt mayor stephanie rawlings-blake said that whatever injury occurred to gray must have happened in the van , where cameras that allowed the driver to see the back of the vehicle do not record the footage
mayor stephanie rawlings-blake said she was ' frustrated ' by gray 's death and the lack of immediate answers and said that the police department had been working to ' overcome decades of mistrust '
the mayor added that the information about gray running in the police report does not necessarily represent probable cause for an arrest and that authorities will ' provide the community with all the answers it deserves '
