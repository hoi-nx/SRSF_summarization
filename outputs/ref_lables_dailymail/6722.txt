what we may be witnessing in these opening jousts of the season is the mental disintegration of rosberg as a racing driver
his reaction to losing to hamilton â blaming the brit for slowing down and bunching him up as the attacking ferrari of vettel closed on him â told us more about his own state of mind than it offered fair criticism of hamilton
rosberg was , i thought , disgruntled by his failure to match his team - mate during a run of eight wins in the last 10 races
in those emotionally charged minutes after the chinese grand prix nothing seemed to make sense to him , rational thought was fuzzy and hamilton appeared in his mind as a blurry figure of hate
rosberg ( left ) looks less than impressed after finishing second to mercedes team - mate hamilton the german driver blamed hamilton for slowing down and bunching him up as vettel closed in rosberg ( left ) , hamilton ( second right ) and ferrari driver vettel celebrate on the podium in china it was all the more remarkable given that rosberg was for so much of last season the ultimate expression of focus , coolness , intelligence and calculation
that changed in the aftermath of spa last august , when rosberg was punished by the team ( he was made to pay for the damage caused rather than fined as such , contrary to everyone âs interpretation at the time ) for his part in an early crash with hamilton
rosberg 's attitude seems to have changed in the aftermath of his crash with hamilton in spa last august it was my view then and remains so that rosberg was marginally more to blame for the collision , but that it was no more than a racing incident
yet , mercedes made rosberg a very public scapegoat , denting his confidence at a crucial moment in the season
hamilton immediately seized the initiative , which he has never ceded in the slightest measure from that day to this
when on form , hamilton is an extraordinary racer , maybe utterly unbeatable
that must eat at rosberg âs heart
for if he can not find a way to beat hamilton soon , he could ebb away as webber did at red bull
webber , a feisty competitor and a talented driver , was a genuine threat to vettel in their first season fighting for the title , as rosberg was to hamilton in their intitial championship contest
the 17 - year - old scuderia toro rosso driver max verstappen showed he has what it takes my highlight of the chinese grand prix was the pure , instinctive racing of max verstappen
