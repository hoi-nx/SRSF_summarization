from the moment i set foot on my terrace overlooking the scenic douro to the divine meal i ate at its michelin - starred restaurant , yeatman played a wonderful trick on me
the five - star hotel in porto celebrates all things wine - port wine , in particular - and has the feel of a place steeped in decades - old tradition , with a prime location , classic design and unblemished attention to detail
but , to my surprise , yeatman has been open for just five years - a fraction of the age of some of the pricier bottles in its wine cellar
the bacchus suite at yeatman boasts a high - vaulted wooden ceiling , copper jacuzzi , fireplace and a rotating bed portugal 's first wine hotel is built into a hill , providing sweeping views of porto and the douro from the indoor pool and guest rooms when guests arrive at yeatman they set foot in a stunning lobby with a statue of bacchus , the roman god of wine for guests like myself , who know little about wine but will never allow it to go to waste , it presents an opportunity to learn and develop an appreciation for the picturesque douro region âs nectar
public spaces inside the five - star hotel , including the lobby and dick 's bar , offer a breathtaking view of portuguese 's second - largest city the yeatman is located in vila nova de gaia ; it is separated from porto by the douro , which spills into the atlantic ocean the yeatman 's large decanter - shaped infinity pool is heated and surrounded by a terrace with plenty of space to lounge in the sun from the statue of bacchus , guests â attention usually moves to the large glass doors and windows that offer sweeping views of the river and the luis i bridge , which links porto and vila nova de gaia
guests are afforded the same luxury when they enter their room and set foot on the private terrace , which has impressive views across the river of portuguese âs second - largest city

guests at yeatman are just a short walk from taylor âs wine lodges and cellars , where its port wine ages in thousands of barrels
located next door to yeatman , taylor 's port wine cellars offers affordable informational tours and tastings for visitors my superior room , themed after the quinta do passadouro winery , was decorated with its labelled bottles , photos of its vineyard and regional artefacts , plus vintage - like furniture and lime green curtains , giving it a luxurious but laid - back feel
best enjoyed before indulging , guests can spoil themselves at the caudalie vinotherapie spa , which offers a number of treatments that stick with the hotel âs wine theme
