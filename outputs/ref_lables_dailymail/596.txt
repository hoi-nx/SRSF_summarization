a laser could be mounted on the iss and used to shoot down pieces of space debris in earth orbit , says a new paper
the system would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles ( 100km ) away
powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into earth âs atmosphere , where it would burn up
tokyo researchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the iss. it would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in earth orbit ( artist 's illustration shown )
the system would have a range of 62 miles ( 100km ) and could target things less than 0.4 inches ( 1cm ) in size the paper , by researchers at the riken research institute in tokyo , was published in acta astronautica
their system would use the euso âs ( euso ) super-wide - field telescope on japan âs kibo experiment module on the iss the laser , meanwhile , use bundles of optical fibres to produce powerful laser pulses - capable of both high power and high frequency , although exact figures were not given
the impact of the laser beam on debris would create a force that reduced its velocity , causing it to fall into earth âs atmosphere and burn up
â if that goes well , we plan to install a full - scale version on the iss , incorporating a three - meter [ 10ft ] telescope and a laser with 10,000 fibres , giving it the ability to deorbit debris with a range of approximately 100 kilometers [ 62 miles ] , â said lead researcher dr ebisuzaki
looking further into the future , the team said they could have a â free - flyer â mission not attached to iss in another orbit to shoot down debris
without going into specifics , the team says their proposal could remove â most â of the centimetre - sized debris in earth orbit within five years of operation
mailonline has asked the researchers to explain how often the laser would fire , and what its maximum capacity in terms of debris - size to deorbit would be
