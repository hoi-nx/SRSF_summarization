vassilis was born in a boat
a snooze in the sunshine : the eagles palace hotel is a fine escape zone for family holidays today , tall and bronzed , like a warrior from the legions of alexander the great , vassilis is at the wheel of a speedboat thrumming across the sparkling seas off the mount athos peninsula in north - eastern greek
as we fly along like a turbo - charged bronco , dolphins breach the surface and plunge below , and then a sea turtle , almost 5ft long , slides alongside
vassilis is the boatman at the eagles palace , a long - established family hotel designed to look a little like one of the many monasteries further along the coast
it is 90 minutes ' drive from the airport at thessaloniki , along a road that meanders through olive groves and low - lying wooded valleys , into a corner of greek that is a world away from the fleshpots of the party islands far to the south
out of the blue : the eagles palace hotel occupies a pristine location 90 minutes ' drive from thessaloniki set on tumbling levels down to its own beach , the hotel is a labyrinth of terrace restaurants ( serving food and wine from local farms , vineyards and its very own olive grove ) , cooling courtyards , beach bars and a large saltwater pool
pavlos is the man if you want to take out a sea kayak or do some light paddle - boarding or more strenuous mountain - biking
taken for a ride : guests can head out on jetskis - although watersports at the hotel are not entirely cheap unlike most dudes you meet at a watersports hut , he has an mba from new york - oh , and he runs ultra-marathons , too
crucial credentials : eagles palace is an awarded member of the small luxury hotels of the world group crinkly blue eyes smile out from under his weather - beaten cap as he waves his walnut arm and asks : ' what will it be today ? ' mind you , the watersports do n't come cheap - â¬ 70 for two people for ten minutes ' parasailing , and â¬ 50 for quarter of an hour on a jet ski
a place to let a week slide by : the hotel has a gently shelving beach lapped by the aegean sea this area of greek is known for its astonishing panoply of monasteries
far above the twinkling domes , on the peak of mount athos itself , sits a stone building
a view like few others : the simonos petras monastery towers some 800 feet above the aegean sea one morning , pavlos takes us boys on bikes into the town of ouranoupoli - where an ancient watchtower stands sentinel above seafront tavernas
and at the end of the path ? a monastery which is probably 10th century , and the first of all those built along this peninsula
it is a reminder of the history which seeps through the earth in this land - and courses through the veins of vassilis and the other descendants of the ancients who shaped this greek marvel
