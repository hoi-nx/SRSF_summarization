in the end it took a mexican to end this utterly absorbing stand - off , the irrepressible , if rather unimpressive , javier hernandez scoring the goal that ended almost 180 minutes of deadlock between these fierce city rivals
only here on loan from manchester united for a season , it was a goal that means javier hernandez will be adored at the santiago bernabeu long after he has gone
but it was also a reward for ambition over the more conservative approach of diego simeone and his well - drilled side ; for the team that enjoyed twice as much of the ball and the better of the chances that were created in this tense , niggly champions league quarter - final tie
javier hernandez scores the only goal of the two legs in the champions league quarter - final between the atletico madrid neighbours javier hernandez runs away to celebrate his goal as atletico madrid were finally beaten after almost two full matches against real javier hernandez celebrates as he became the hero for real late on during the champions league quarter - final second leg javier hernandez runs away in celebration after scoring the only goal in 180 minutes between the sides to settle the two - legged derby javier hernandez slides on his knees to celebrate putting real into the semi-finals of europe 's elite competition at the bernabeu ronaldo joins in with the celebrations at the bernabeu as javier hernandez sneaked the winner against their neighbouring rivals ronaldo clenches his fists as he celebrates his side taking an all - important lead against their neighbours atletico madrid arda turan is sent off by german referee brych in the 76th minute as atletico madrid were forced to play with 10 men atletico madrid players protest the second yellow card shown to turan which left the visitors up against it at the bernabeu arda turan receives a pat on the back of the head by real 's coentrao after the turkey international was sent off real ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : casillas 6 ; carvajal 6 , pepe 6.5 , varane 6 , coentrao 6 ; sergio ramos 6.5 , kroos 8 , isco 7 ; rodriguez 7 , javier hernandez 6 , ronaldo 6 subs not used : navas , khedira , lucas silva , arbeloa , nacho booked : pepe , arbeloa scorers : javier hernandez ( 88 ) manager : carlo ancelotti atletico madrid ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : oblak 8 ; juanfran 6.5 , miranda 7 , diego godin 7 , gamez 7 ; arda turan 5 , tiago 6.5 , koke 7 , saul 6 ( gabi 46 6 ) ; griezmann 6.5 ( raul garcia 65 6 ) , mandzukic 6 subs not used : moya , siqueira , jimenez , torres booked : arda turan , raul garcia , koke sent off : arda turan ( 76 ) manager : diego simeone referee : brych ( germany ) 8 man of the match : kroos it was hard to see what atletico madrid were trying to achieve at times
but when arda turan was dismissed in the 75th minute for what looked like a harsh second yellow card for a challenge on the all - too theatrical sergio ramos , an opportunity suddenly presented itself to real
a frustrated figure until atletico madrid were reduced to 10 men , ronaldo made a jinking , purposeful run into the penalty area before executing the all - important pass
in the starting line - up only because of an injury to benzema , javier hernandez performed much as he has all season here
but with this contest only two minutes from moving into extra-time , goalless if far from gutless , javier hernandez made no mistake when it mattered most
real striker javier hernandez had been having a frustrating evening for real up until his goal in the 88th minute javier hernandez could n't quite believe how he missed his chance to give real the all - important lead at the bernabeu before his goal javier hernandez 's starting place for real was described by local media as the ' biggest match of his career ' and he lived up to it but this was extra special
this was a atletico madrid derby with a difference and the deafening roar that greeted the end of the champions league anthem said as much
you could barely hear yourself think never mind what the person sat next to you was saying , and it was no different when arda turan was dismissed and when javier hernandez then struck the decisive blow
this game quickly followed a familiar theme , with real pressing deep in the half of the well - drilled atletico madrid
real defender sergio ramos sends a powerful header towards goal but is unable to give his team the lead at the bernabeu sergio ramos tries to encourage the crowd to make more noise at the bernabeu as real tried to break the deadlock sergio ramos goes down holding his face during the atletico madrid derby at the bernabeu for the champions league quarter - final second leg sergio ramos holds his face as german referee brych approaches to figure out what is wrong with the spain defender but the chances would come for real , with ronaldo forcing a fine save from the impressive oblak just before the break and javier hernandez failing to capitalise on that delightful ball from isco just after the restart
only when arda turan was dismissed did the breakthrough come , however , ronaldo and javier hernandez exploiting the slight tactical change diego simeone had been forced to make as a result of the red card
