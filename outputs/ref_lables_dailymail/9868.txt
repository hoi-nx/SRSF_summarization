a little boy has undergone more than 50 operations to have his entire face painstakingly rebuilt
billy mitchell , now seven , was born with apert syndrome , a rare condition which left him with malformations of the skull , face , hands and feet
he endured a series of major operations to correct the deformities â which included a procedure to crack open and reshape his skull and another to rebuild his features
he also had a titanium frame drilled into his head , which was left there for nine weeks
billy mitchell , seven , was born with apert syndrome , a rare genetic condition which causes malformations the surgeries carried risks including meningitis , brain damage , catastrophic bleeding leading to stroke and potentially death , but billy mitchell pulled through and now his parents say he absolutely loves his new face
billy mitchell âs mother , mitchell , 47 , said she knew immediately something was wrong with her son when he was born
â it was then a doctor broke the news he suspected billy mitchell had apert syndrome , a genetic abnormality where the bone plates in the skull fuse too early in the womb so the skull is unable to grow normally
after his birth , doctors feared billy mitchell would not last the night
specialists feared billy mitchell 's nose was totally blocked with misformed and premature fused bone , blocking his airway
billy mitchell , pictured with his twin sister lois , has undergone more than 50 operations to have his face rebuilt but miraculously , billy mitchell held on , and in the morning he was transferred to a specialist children âs hospital where he had thin , metal tubes called stents inserted into his nose to help him breathe
the condition is characterised by malformations of the skull , mid-face , hands and feet
and operations can be carried out to re-model a child 's face
billy mitchell 's eye orbits were so shallow , especially the left , that his eye regularly popped out of its socket
doctors advised billy mitchell have his eyelid sewn together after he developed a corneal ulcer
just six weeks later , he needed a major operation to relieve pressure on his brain , save his sight and reshape his whole head
known as a â front orbital advancement â , surgeons opened his skull , detached it , remodelled his forehead and pieced it together again like a jigsaw
billy mitchell now needs 24 - hour care , which has put a strain on family life
when billy mitchell was four months old he underwent a major operation to relieve pressure on his brain , save his sight and reshape his whole head his fingers were also fused together leaving him struggling to clasp things properly
when he was 17 months old surgeons operated on him to separate billy mitchell 's fingers and toes down to the first knuckle â and as for lois , every time billy mitchell was admitted to hospital , she âd look around wondering where he was
â it was also clear she had a special bond with billy mitchell
â when she learnt to sit up we propped billy mitchell up with cushions and they âd spend ages playing together
and when lois became mobile she âd fetch billy mitchell his favourite toys
â billy mitchell âs fingers were fused together â known as â mitten hands â â and so he struggled to clasp things properly
during a nine hour operation , involving bone and skin grafts , he separated billy mitchell âs fingers down to the first knuckle and did the same with his toes
mrs mitchell said : â billy mitchell had all four limbs in a cast for seven weeks but the results afterwards were amazing
earlier this year billy mitchell had another major operation which left him with a frame fitted to his face for nine weeks â i was so upset i went straight home
â another time when the twins were two and a half we were stood in the queue to see santa when darcy noticed some children pointing at billy mitchell
" â if only they knew what billy mitchell was going through
since his most recent surgery , billy mitchell loves his new face , his mother denise said â he loved life and was determined to join in with everything , â mrs mitchell says
during a nine - hour operation surgeons took the left hand side of his skull off to remodel it and put it back with titanium springs to allow for more growth
so earlier this year he also underwent high risk mid-face surgery , where his face was literally taken apart , reshaped and put back together again to create more room
his forehead , eye orbits , nose and top jaw were taken apart , reshaped and put back together with a red frame attached through a series of wires and bolts
