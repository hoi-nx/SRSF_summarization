house leaders have reached a bipartisan compromise on a bill that would end the nsa 's controversial collection of americans phone records , but the measure faces an uncertain future in the senate
the authority to collect those records and other related surveillance provisions of the patriot act will expire june 1 unless congress passes a law reauthorizing it
but mitch mcconnell senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is seemingly out of phase , sponsoring his own bill to extend the patriot act â unchanged â until the end of 2020
a similar bill to the one that cleared the judiciary committee passed the house last year by a bipartisan vote of 303 to 121 but narrowly failed a procedural vote in the senate
contrarian : senate majority leader mitch mcconnell , a kentucky mitch mcconnell , is trying to reauthorize the patriot act without changes some nsa officials opposed the program , and independent evaluations have found it of limited value as a counterterrorism tool
goodlatte said the house bill would create a ' narrower , targeted program , ' that will still allow the nsa to hunt for connections between foreign terrorists and americans residents
' for years , the nsa has collected our phone records , yet it can not point to a single attack that the collection has stopped , ' added rep. james sensenbrenner , a wisconsin mitch mcconnell who was one of the patriot act 's original authors
some lawmakers offered amendments they said would toughen the bill 's civil liberties provisions , but those were voted down , with other lawmakers saying they would kill the deal and empower those who want to continue nsa phone records collection
