all of the 36 units at the redlands house sheltered accommodation have been given the colourful treatment which has been labelled an ' eyesore ' by local residents
but the local council defended the colour scheme , claiming it will help residents with poor eyesight find their way home

' the residents ' rent , of Â£ 103 a week plus bills , has remained the same since before the refurbishments took place
one neighbour , who lives opposite redlands house and who did not wish to be named , described the building as an ' eyesore '
it looked much better the way it was before they put the colour on it

' hayley selway , head of housing for vale of glamorgan council said the aim of the refurbishment was to ' change the look and feel of the property and bring it into the 21st century '
