built at a cost of Â£ 1 billion , new broadcasting house is the jewel in the crown of the bbc and the setting for its self - mocking satire w1a
new broadcasting house in london covers half a million square feet , took a decade to build and was opened by the queen in 2013 â four years behind schedule and at least Â£ 55 million over budget
one of the running jokes in w1a is that its fictional meeting rooms are named after popular entertainers â hugh bonneville 's character ian fletcher , the bbc 's ' head of values ' , frequently meets colleagues ' inside frankie howerd '
now , in response to a freedom of information request , the bbc has admitted it ' occasionally ' runs out of meeting rooms and spent Â£ 47,198 on booking external spaces nearby during the last financial year
' the bbc has been criticised by spending watchdog the nao ( nao ) over the running costs of new broadcasting house , which are almost double that of comparable buildings in london
