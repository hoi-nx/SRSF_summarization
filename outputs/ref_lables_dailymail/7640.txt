controversy : uber drivers in oklahoma now have a right to refuse gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender customers who use the ride - sharing app ' i believe if a private business owner wants to serve or not serve an individual , they have that purview right now , ' said jason smalley , a republican
rewritten : republican sen. jason smalley ( pictured ) rewrote the bill to give drivers the option to discriminate the company will continue to enforce its current terms of service , ' which make clear that discrimination in any form is not tolerated and will result in removal from the platform , ' she said
