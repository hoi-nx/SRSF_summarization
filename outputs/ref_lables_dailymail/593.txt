not every greek island lets you rent a boat and potter about at will , but skopelos does
splash ! splendidly small : skopelos has a relaxed , offbeat vibe that plays out in the pretty port of chora as the breeze pushed us back , the short anchor line quickly ran out until the end - then we heard a softer , more ominous splash
this generosity of spirit set the tone for our week on this hilly , pine - forested island
skopelos is known as the film location for mamma mia ! and i had feared there might be endless reminders of the day when meryl streep 's donna found love
with no airport , most people fly to skiathos , followed by an hour 's ferry ride
arriving in skopelos is special
seal of approval : kyle encountered two locals of the bewhiskered variety while sailing around slopelos it has one of the most scenic ports in greek
up a steep hill from skopelos town , and along a dirt track ( vehicle needed ) lies villa thea , with its cool stone floors , pool and large terrace
thalpos holidays boat hire operates out of sheltered panormos beach on the west coast , a 20 - minute drive from skopelos town
these shy , endangered marine mammals - once widespread around the mediterranean and beyond - are now limited to small ranges , one of which is close to skopelos
owner nikos offers visitors fine traditional seafood as well as slow - cooked pork , and the terrace has some of the most spectacular views on the island
