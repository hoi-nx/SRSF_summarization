earlier today in riyadh , a spokesman for the saudi - led coalition said arrangements had been made for at least one red cross aid delivery yesterday morning , but the icrc - which deploys 300 aid workers to the arab peninsula 's poorest country - had pulled out of the arrangement
the saudi - led coalition says it has set up a special coordination body for aid deliveries and asked ngos and governments to work with it to ensure humanitarian aid can be brought into yemen and foreign nationals can be evacuated safely
the news comes on the same day as war - weary pakistan began talks to enter the conflict after its staunch saudi allies issued an urgent request the country join the expanding coalition of sunni nations fighting shi'ites rebels in the country

the un last week said that more than 500 people had been killed in two weeks of fighting in yemen this morning pakistan 's parliament begins debating a saudi plea for military help in yemen - a request that pits prime minister sharif 's saudi allies against a war - weary pakistan public
since saudi , the gulf 's main sunni power , asked sunni - majority pakistan to join a saudi - led military coalition that began conducting air strikes last month against largely houthis shi'ite houthi forces in yemen , sharif has hedged his bets
' twelve days of fighting has not only killed hundreds of people , but cut off water and electricity and led unicef to warn yemen is heading towards a humanitarian disaster
street fighting and heavy shelling have torn through the streets of in aden - the last bastion of support for the saudi - backed hadi - for days

last year , the saudi gave pakistan $ 1.5 billion
but joining the saudi - led coalition could inflame a sectarian conflict at home where around a fifth of the population is houthis and attacks on shi'ites are increasing , further destabilising the nuclear - armed nation of 180 million people
pakistan intervention would probably also anger houthis power iran , which shares a long and porous border in a region roiling with its own separatist insurgency
the iran foreign minister will visit pakistan this week
family : jamal al-labani was in yemen visiting his pregnant wife and the couple 's 2 1/2 - year - old daughter rebels from the houthi islamist group have been battling to take aden , a last foothold of fighters loyal to saudi - backed president hadi
they have advanced to the city center despite 11 days of air strikes by a saudi - led coalition of mainly gulf air forces
sunni muslim saudi arabia launched the air strikes on march 26 in an attempt to turn back the iran - allied houthis , who already control yemen 's capital sanaa , and restore some of hadi 's crumbling authority
the air and sea campaign has targeted shi'ite houthi convoys , missiles and weapons stores and cut off any possible outside reinforcements - although the houthis deny saudi accusations that they are armed by tehran .
