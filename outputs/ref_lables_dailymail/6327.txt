cameron today boasted that 2million people have found work since 2010 , as new employment figures showed the uk workforce is at another record high
unemployment has continued to fall and a record 31 million people are in work , the last jobless figures before the general election have shown
the prime minister used the data to warn that the recovery would be ' put at risk ' by a ' stitch - up ' between labour and the snp , after ed miliband and nicola sturgeon clashed in a tv debate last night
the ons said more than 31 million people were in work after an increase of more than half a million in the past year cameron today warned the recovery would be put at risk by a labour - snp ' stitch - up ' after the election on may 7 the ons ( ons ) said that more than 31 million people were in work after an increase of more than half a million in the past year , the biggest total since records began in 1971
at the same time the jobless total fell by 76,000 to 1.84 million in the quarter to february , the lowest for almost seven years
mr cameron said : ' there are now 2 million more people in work than in 2010 â that 's more families with the stability and security of a regular pay packet
' it would all be put at risk with the chaos of a ed miliband - snp stitch - up , hiking borrowing , hurting the economy , and costing jobs â and it 'll be hardworking taxpayers who 'll pay
' he used a speech today to warn that a labour government would put 1million jobs at risk
claiming mr ed miliband represents a threat to jobs , the tory leader said : ' you know what makes me really angry ? it 's when our opponents still go on about ' you tories â the party for the few and not the many â¦ ' excuse me ? ' this is the party that 's taken three million of the lowest - paid workers out of income tax altogether ; that 's cut the taxes of 26million working people ; that 's seen 1,000 jobs created every day â jobs that are giving families security , putting food on tables , helping people out of poverty
' under the last five years of labour , unemployment went up by 600 people a day
' so if ed miliband repeated the economic mistakes of the last labour government â that he was a part of â he risks a million more people joining the dole queues
around 1.3 million people were in part - time jobs when they wanted full - time work , up by 29,000 in the latest quarter , while self - employment was little changed at 4.5 million
in a live tv debate last night between opposition leaders , snp leader nicola sturgeon warned labour 's ed miliband is not ' strong enough ' to win the election alone and urged him to ditch austerity to kick the tories out the number of people classed as economically inactive , including those looking after a relative , on long - term sick leave or who have given up looking for work , fell by 104,000 to just under nine million
with record numbers of people in work and the highest employment rate ever , people can see the difference lib dems have made in government
