' the russian - language film is about ukraine - born sniper pavlichenko â nicknamed ' lady death ' â and comes out ahead of the 70th anniversary in may of the allied victory in the european theatre of world war ii
trained as a sharpshooter and sent to fight on the frontline in 1941 , aged 25 , pavlichenko was said to have killed 309 nazis in less than a year during battles in odessa and the strategic city of sevastopol on ukraine 's crimea peninsula
hard - hitting biopic : russian actors yevgeny tsyganov ( left ) and yulia peresild ( right ) , who plays ukraine - born sniper pavlichenko are seen in a still from mokritsky 's ' battle of sevastopol ' film bringing together a shared history : the russian - language film ( above ) comes out ahead of the 70th anniversary in may of the allied victory in the european theatre of world war ii heroine : pavlichenko was said to have killed 309 nazis in less than a year during battles in odessa and the strategic city of sevastopol on ukraine 's crimea peninsula during world war ii pavlichenko was sent to the frontline in 1941 at the age of 25 after being trained as a sniper
an unyielding character , she is said to have killed no fewer than 309 nazis during the sieges of odessa and later the strategic city of sevastopol on ukraine 's crimea peninsula
' she then falls for a fellow sniper and the couple plan to marry , but she is devastated when he , too , is killed
finally she is evacuated from sevastopol after getting injured , soon before the nazis captured the strategic city in 1942
sensing her propaganda value , the soviet then sent her to tour canada and the american , where she called for the opening of a new front in the war
the women stayed in touch and roosevelt met her again years later in moscow
the new biopic was shot on location in sevastopol in november and december 2013 during the maidan popular uprising in kiev , shortly before the toppling of pro-russian president viktor yanukovych and russian 's annexation of crimea
' the differing titles for the film highlight some of the bitterest divisions between russian and ukraine
in russian , the title ' battle for sevastopol ' resonates with the patriotic fervour generated by crimea 's annexation in march last year
meanwhile , the ukraine name ' indestructible ' hints at the national spirit as government forces battle a pro-russian uprising in the country 's east
the next stage in pavlichenko 's life is far from the horrors of the frontline
critics have lauded the vivid photography in the ukraine - russian film , but complain that pavlichenko does not come across as a fully - rounded character
' we see it as a ukraine film , ' a spokesman for kiev 's state film agency told afp , saying that 79 percent of the film 's financing is ukraine , both from the state and private investors
' it 's very important today that it 's a ukraine - russian co-production
