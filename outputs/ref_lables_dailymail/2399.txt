balls was today accused of ' letting the cat out of the bag ' on tax rises after leaving the door open to trapping more middle - class workers in the 40p tax rate
in an interview the shadow chancellor repeatedly refused to rule out trying to balance the books by lowering the amount workers have to earn before they pay the higher income tax rate
but pressed on income tax , mr balls refused to rule out freezing or lowering the threshold to raise millions from people earning more than Â£ 41,865
the shadow chancellor refused to rule it out : ' what i would like to do is find ways in which i could have fewer people in the 40 per cent tax bracket
' he said he would not be ' raising the higher rate of income tax ' but left open the possibility of holding or lowering the point at which it kicks in
' pressed on whether he plans to change the income tax bands , mr balls said : ' i ca n't go through every detail
' he went on : ' i can make a promise not to increase the basic rate of income tax or the higher rate of income tax
claimed mr balls had ' let the cat out of the bag the number of people paying 40p tax has already risen by about two million to five million in two decades chancellor george osborne said : ' balls has let the cat out of the bag and confirmed a tax assault on middle earners
' by contrast , the conservatives plan is to increase to Â£ 50,000 the threshold at which people pay the higher rate of tax
' david cameron has warned the 40p tax rate is hitting too many people on ' middle incomes '
the conservatives go into the election pledging to raise the threshold for paying 40p tax from Â£ 41,865 to Â£ 50,000 by 2020
but labour says the policy is a Â£ 7billion unfunded tax cut at a time when billions are needed in spending cuts
a labour spokesman said : ' under the tory around 2 million more people have been dragged into the 40p tax band , but labour supported the increases in the 40p threshold in the recent budget
