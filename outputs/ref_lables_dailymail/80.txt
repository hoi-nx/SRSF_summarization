office workers were shocked to discover a couple having sex in a park in full view of their tower block on the hottest day of the year
the couple appeared not to mind being in full view during their steamy encounter at the three bridges playing fields in crawley , west sussex , as temperatures reached 25c in some parts of the uk
workers at an office block which overlooks the park said the pair , who were semi-naked , did not even appear to be put off when people walked past them during their sex session at 3.30pm yesterday
in one video , taken by shocked office workers , one man can be heard asking â why would you do that ? â before describing it as â well funny
â a woman exclaims â oh my god â and â oh my dear lord â as other employees point out the illicit encounter before she says she wants to get an air horn to disrupt the couple
one officer worker who also witnessed the encounter but wished to remain anonymous took to facebook to share news of the incident
she said : ' i unfortunately witnessed the incident from my office window
' it came on the hottest day of the year so far and the warmest april ever on record with temperatures reaching 25.1c at st james 's park in london and at frittenden in kent
it is not the first time a couple have been caught having sex in full view of others
earlier this year , a 50 - year - old regional manager and 26 - year - old office worker enjoyed a steamy encounter after staying late at work at an insurance firm in christchurch , new zealand
