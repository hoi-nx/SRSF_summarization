the glowing blue letters that once lit the bronx from above yankee stadium failed to find a buyer at an auction at sotheby on wednesday
the current owner of the signage is yankee hall of famer jackson , who purchased the 10 - feet - tall letters for an undisclosed amount after the stadium saw its final game in 2008
he promised before the auction that if the letters were bought by a bidder in the united states , he would fly out to see the signage himself at the winner 's home
yankee stadium : the letters at the stadium , which was built in 1923 , were installed in 1976 and taken down in 2008 in addition to the letters , sotheby 's was auctioning off a mets bullpen car from the late 60s
