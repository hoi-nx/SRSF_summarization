ex pop star : rev coles rose to fame as half of the band the communards when a high - profile vicar yesterday attacked the tory plans to sell housing association homes as a â right to steal â , it might have sounded like a stern ticking off from the pulpit
but this was the rev. coles â who sits on the board of wellingborough homes , a housing association in northamptonshire â and he is no ordinary churchman
known to many for presenting radio 4 âs gentle human interest show saturday live , he is the supposed inspiration for the hero of the bbc church sitcom rev. and while he might now feel free to attack others for seeking the right to buy their own home , he not so long ago felt he had the right to do whatever he chose himself , regardless of the law or anyone else âs feelings
for coles raised eyebrows by last year publishing a frank memoir which detailed not only his rise to fame as half of the famously gay 1980s pop band the communards , alongside singer somerville , but also his enthusiasm for â dogging â â having sex with strangers in the open air â and for taking drugs including cocaine , ecstasy and amphetamines
he also confessed that he falsely told his friends that he was hiv positive , to generate attention and sympathy , and kept up the unpleasant pretence for five years
coles , 52 , is now a regular on tv and radio , but on sundays he performs at his 14th century parish church , st mary the virgin , in finedon , northamptonshire
he took large quantities of drugs , apparently spending a whole year in ibiza on speed and ecstasy , and taking lsd
he believes the ecstasy was sometimes laced with heroin
