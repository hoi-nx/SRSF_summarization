now engineers claim to have designed a range of synthetic eyes that may one day let us replace and even enhance our own sense of vision
italian bio-designers mhox has unveiled project is has been working on to 3d organic tissues to produce working body parts that can replace the eyes of people suffering from disease
it could mean rather than getting glasses to correct their vision , people would be able to replace their entire eye
the mhox eye concept ( above ) is designed to replace and even enhance the vision compared to a normal eye the group plan to combine the biological tissue with microscopic wireless technology to provide additional functions and give super human eyesight
while currently still just a concept , the project raises the prospect of what bio-engineering may make possible in years to come
the team behind mhox say their synthetic eyes , which include lenses that improves the image sharpness and can put filters over the vision , could be available by 2027
nassetti and zomparelli , the two italian designers leading the project , said : ' latest developments in bioprinting and biohacking let us imagine that in the near future it would be possible to easily print organic , functional body parts , allowing the human to replace defected districts or enhance standard performance
' under mhox designs , patients with eye disease will inthe future be able to replace their eye with a synthetic one printed in a laboratory
for those looking to improve their vision , they could buy the ' enhance ' model that features a ' hyper retina ' to give 15/10 vision - significantly better than normal 20/20 vision
they say it could also include a gland that can filter the visual signal to the brain by producing vintage or black and white effects much like a modern camera
the synthetic eyes would come in three different models ( above ) according to the designs outlined by mhox mhox propose combining new technology like wifi with bioprinting to produce an enhanced bionic eye the concept sounds a little like something out of the science fiction hit blade runner where bioengineers built new eyes for robotic replicants
