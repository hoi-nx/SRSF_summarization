washington believes that the â special relationship â between uk and the us is over , according to a secret briefing document seen by the mail on sunday
the memo for members of congress states damningly that â the uk may not be viewed as centrally relevant to the us in all of the issues and relations considered a priority on the us agenda â
dated april 2015 and drawn up to brief the senate and house of representatives on the impact of uk âs general election , the memo also warns that the uk faces turmoil if there is a hung parliament
the memo , edited by derek e mix , the congressional research service âs chief european affairs analyst , says that the development of organisations such as the g20 group of major economies has led to a decline in the â influence and centrality of the relationship â
it was first coined in a 1944 speech by winston churchill , when he said it was his â deepest conviction that unless uk and the us are joined in a special relationship â¦ another destructive war will come to pass â
