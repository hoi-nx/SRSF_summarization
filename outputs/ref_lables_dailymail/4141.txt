the high - flyer and close ally of nick clegg , who has won praise as george osborne âs second - in - command , is on course to lose his seat to the scottish nationalists
he would be one of the highest - profile casualties of the snp surge which is set to take the seats of many of scottish 40 labour and 11 lib dem mps on may 7
other party stalwarts likely to be ennobled after the election are former leaders charles kennedy who may lose his seat of ross , skye and lochaber , and sir menzies campbell who is standing down
the lib dem believe in ultimately tearing up the current house of lords and making it a fully elected chamber
nick clegg , pictured in portsmouth today , has claimed the lib dem would serve as the â heart â of a tory - led government , opposing welfare cuts , or the â brains â of a labour one â reining in borrowing if made a peer , mr danny alexander could serve as a minister in a second coalition particularly with the tory who he has worked closely with as a member of the â quad â which approved coalition policy
if a second coalition were formed , nick clegg has claimed the lib dem would serve as the â heart â of a tory - led government , opposing welfare cuts , or the â brains â of a labour one â reining in borrowing
mr nick clegg has appeared in public several times in recent weeks to make economic announcement with david laws , who held the treasury job before mr danny alexander mr danny alexander has attacked the conservatives â plans to slash Â£ 12billion from the welfare bill as a â dangerous deceit â , and accused them of trying to â balance the books on the backs of the working poor
it âs obviously a fight but he will do miles better than these wretched polls suggest
charles kennedy is not going to lose his seat and danny alexander is not going to lose his seat , we âve seen the figures
