indiana has seen a ' significant increase ' in the number of cases of hiv more than two weeks into a short - term needle exchange program approved by gov. mike pence , state health officials said on friday
there are now 120 confirmed hiv cases and 10 preliminary positive cases tied to scott county , about 30 miles north of louisville , kentucky
health officials who declared an epidemic last month have said they expect the number of cases to rise as more people are tested
but the growing number could put pressure on mike pence to extend the 30 - day needle exchange program that he approved on march 26
the scott county outbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high - powered painkiller opana , health officials have said
since mike pence approved the temporary needle exchange , 5,322 clean syringes have been provided to 86 participants , health officials said friday
combs , public health nurse for the scott county health department , said the needle - exchange program had ' really picked up a lot this week , ' in large part because a mobile unit has been traveling around neighborhoods seeking to get more iv drug users into the program
but the future of the scott county program , as well as the fate of legislation that would allow needle - exchange programs in other counties , is n't clear
the scott county outbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high - powered prescription painkiller opana , health officials have said mike pence opposes needle exchanges as an anti-drug policy
senate president pro tem long said on thursday that the emergency exchange for scott county was ' the right reaction ' but was n't sure if it is the correct approach long - term
health officials say because of this , high rates of hepatitis c are a key indicator of needle - sharing and a potential hiv outbreak
the needle - exchange program was created through an emergency executive order signed last week by gov. mike pence in an attempt to curb the state 's largest - ever hiv outbreak clere said he appreciates mike pence 's approval of the short - term needle exchange but that ' it does n't help in other areas of the state that are at risk for a similar outbreak
' ' we simply ca n't afford to view this as a short - term problem , ' clere said
