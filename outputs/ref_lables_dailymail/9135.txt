now scientists have finally been able to record one of these eruptions as it happens to discover the sound it makes - and they are surprisingly quiet for such a violent event
scroll down to watch and listen to an underwater volcano erupting the majority of the world âs volcanoes are found deep underwater and now scientists have been able to record one of these eruptions as it happens to discover the sound it makes
the bubbling lava erupting from the volcanic vent hades ( above ) produced a distinctive acoustic signature rather than the explosive roar emitted by their cousins on land , underwater volcanoes give off a muted thrum instead
however , the research could allow scientists to monitor undersea volcanoes far more effectively than they have before
scientists found that underwater volcanoes , which were long assumed to ooze lava at relatively steady rates , in fact erupt in pulses
however , volcanoes also release aerosol gases that are now known to reduce global warming by creating a reflective barrier against the sun. using their unique sound signature , researchers will be able to detect different types of eruptions and record the gases being released far more accurately
in the latest study , published in the journal geophysical research letters , the scientists used an underwater vehicle to visit the west mata volcano , 3,937 feet ( 1,200 metres ) below the surface of the pacific ocean near samoa
a recent study found that emissions from underwater volcanoes may play a far greater role in influencing the climate than had previously been believed they found different eruptions were occurring at two of the volcano âs vents â nicknamed hades and prometheus
hades produced large lava bubbles that were released slowly , while prometheus gave off explosive releases of tiny gas bubbles
they then analysed the acoustic signatures produced by each explosion , showing they are different
the graph above shows the acoustic signature as lava bubbles from hades volcano ( marked by red arrows ) scientists have struggled to study underwater volcanoes like the one above as they are hard to spot erupting
using their unique sound signature , researchers will now be able to detect different types of eruptions and record the gases being released far more accurately this video of mount tavurvur erupting on 29 august 2014 shows what volcanoes above ground sound like
