controversial plans to spend Â£ 3.2million pulling down a 19th century country mansion and building a ' butlins - style ' gipsy camp have been approved despite angry protests by neighbours
villagers in the small country hamlet of cledford , near middlewich in cheshire , had vehemently opposed the plans saying that travellers could ' intimidate ' nearby pensioners and may ruin the idyllic surroundings
but yesterday , cheshire east council gave the proposal the go ahead at a planning meeting , which will create a ' transit site ' with room for nine gipsy families
the 200 - year - old cledford hall in the small hamlet of cledford in cheshire which is being knocked down to make way for a ' butlins - style ' gipsy camp costing Â£ 3.2million people living in the village have reacted with fury about the plans saying travellers could intimidate nearby pensioners the mansion 's grade-ii listed adjoining barn will be converted into ' washing and toilet ' facilities and office accommodation for a resident warden will also be provided at the expense of taxpayers
the cost of the project , revealed through a freedom of information request , has left locals stunned , and they now fear their picturesque cottages will be left worthless as they contemplate selling up and leaving the area
grade ii - listed cledford hall , which dates back to 1822 , was severely damaged by fire three years ago and its listing was cancelled
it will be fully demolished to make way for the site which will house gypsy families for a maximum of 28 days before they must move on
around 100 letters of opposition were handed to the council alongside a petition comprising 500 signatures but they will continue with the plans - which also include a play area - in efforts to put a stop to â unauthorised encampments â
the Â£ 3.2million cost of the project was only revealed through a freedom of information request and got the go ahead yesterday by cheshire east council cledford hall , which dates back to 1822 , was severely damaged by fire three years ago and its grade-ii listing was cancelled builder moody , 66 , bought a â dream â retirement cottage with his wife trisha , 61 , and has spent Â£ 130,000 renovating it with original victorian fittings
it now lies , almost finished , at the site âs entrance but he is refusing to move into it and fears he could lose Â£ 100,000 if it is put on the market
do we chop the price to half of what it was worth or do we sit on it ? would anybody want to rent it from opposite a gypsy site ? ' we were so confident we were going to get somewhere in that meeting because we had strong arguments especially in regards to fire safety , as the plans put the caravans too close together which flouts regulations

he says he was only given three minutes to voice his concerns on behalf of residents at the planning meeting mr moody beside the house he bought in cledford as a retirement home
these are not the sort of neighbours that oaps want opposite them
' at the planning meeting , the strategic planning board of cheshire east council had eight votes in favour of the site , with one against
cheshire east council say the development is needed to house travellers in the area mr moody added : ' none of us can understand why the council should think it necessary to spend such a large amount of money providing a luxury butlin âs - style holiday camp for travellers in such lovely countryside
councillor don stockton , head of housing and jobs for cheshire east council who lives in the nearby town of alderley edge and was part of the applying team , said : ' we need a site somewhere in cheshire east as we have a lot of travellers in the area and have had a lot of unapproved sites where travellers have been and we have not been able to move them
' this is an approved site which we have investigated and compared with many others across the borough
we are under a legal obligation to have site for travellers
