but research with twins suggests picking who to vote for in an election might have more to do with your genes than the policies of the parties
to put this to the test , the department of twin research , which hosts the biggest adult twin registry in the uk , recently performed a poll of voting preferences
deciding who you will vote for may have more to do with your family than who won the leaders debate ( above ) finds study which looked at the voting habits of twins born in the uk
the aim was to explore how much nature and nurture influence our party political allegiances and potential voting preferences the twins were all born in the uk and were broadly representative of the uk population
both identical and non-identical twins normally share the same environment while growing up
in most cases twins should have shared the same environment when growing up too
in the case of political views , these can also run strongly in families as they tend to share the same socioeconomic background and parents can often impress their political support upon their children
however , the study of twins found identical twins were more likely to vote the same way than the non-identical twins
assuming they had similar upbringings and experiences through adulthood , this would suggest there is an underlying genetic influence for political alignment
they found that voting conservative , or not , is strongly influenced by genetics
when it came to voting tory , they found that 57 per cent of the variability - differences or similarity - between people âs voting preferences were due to genetic effects
that means the identical twins were more likely to vote the same way than the non-identical twins - suggesting an underlying genetic influence was stronger than environmental or random factors
for ukip voting preferences , there was also a moderately strong heritability of 51 per cent
the exception seemed to be voting for the liberal democrats , which was affected entirely by environment with no genetic influence
identical twins showed exactly the same level of disparity in preference for the liberal democrats as non-identical twins
these latest results from uk data confirm the trends found in previous research carried out in the us
they told the researchers whether they intended to vote , what their political party of choice was , and provided their personal rating of the main party leaders voting for the conservative party , led by david cameron , pictured above after voting at the last general election with his wife samantha , tended to have the strongest heritability according to a study of uk twins a 2008 survey of 682 pairs of middle - aged twins from the minnesota twin registry showed that self - reported political ideology and right - wing authoritarianism were consistently more similar in the identical twins than fraternal twins
' the popularity of nick clegg ( above ) , leader of the liberal democrats seemed to be heritable , although voting for this party was not heritability and appeared to be influenced by the environment alone , the study showed the question of whether a leader would make a good prime minister produced mixed responses
