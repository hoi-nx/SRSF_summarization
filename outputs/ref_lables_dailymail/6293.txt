as a rangers diehard who once saw treble dreams evaporate in the wake of a refereeing error that favoured celtic , brown takes a predictably wry view of the anguish emanating from parkhead in recent days
in 1989 , brown was part of the ibrox side which contested an cup final with two trophies already banked
rangers legend brown says celtic have a case of ' sour grapes ' about their recent cup exit twenty six years on , celtic have seen their own hopes of a clean sweep disappear amid intense controversy
they have written to the sfa seeking ' to understand ' how the match officials failed to spot the hand meekings used to block a leigh griffiths shot in their semi-final defeat to inverness
brown views the whole furore as ' a bit of sour grapes ' that speaks of the frustration within his old rivals
' it 's hard for officials given the pace of the game , ' said brown
' celtic have been frustrated because they have not managed to win a treble and rangers have not been in the league for a number of years
brown could rant at refs with the best of them during his time in charge of dundee , not least when muir was fooled by a peter pawlett dive and awarded aberdeen a penalty that effectively relegated the dens park side
' it basically put us down that day but it was one of those things , a referee 's interpretation , ' reflected a more sanguine brown on his own brush with muir
inverness defender meekings blocks a goal - bound header with his hand but no penalty is given ' it is impossible for the guy on the line to see it ( meekings ' handball )
' and what of 1989 ? despite the impact of that throw - in call , brown still believes rangers only had themselves to blame
the officials let him away with it and celtic won the game , but these things happen do n't they ? ' brown was speaking to promote fan ownership group rangers first which has over 13,400 members
