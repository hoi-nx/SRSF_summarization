' loneliness maps ' are being used to tackle the problem of elderly people being left alone by working out which areas ' residents are most at risk
now campaigners say that local councils should draw up maps of the places where pensioners and others are most likely to suffer from social isolation
map : this ' loneliness map ' was drawn up by essex county council showing the areas where residents are most vulnerable to becoming socially isolated two county councils , essex and gloucestershire , have already implemented the maps , which allow them to target ' danger zones ' of loneliness
in gloucestershire , council bosses compiled the maps by studying statistics on a range of public health factors which are often linked to lonely people
danger : being lonely can lead to health problems including dementia ( picture posed by model ) the council also surveyed residents to identify those who rarely speak to their neighbours , are unsatisfied with their social life and say they do n't have someone to talk to
' if local councils and services do not act now to find the people experiencing severe loneliness , we are likely to see the consequences in our hospitals and social care services
