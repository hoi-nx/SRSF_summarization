furious parents have launched a campaign to overturn a primary school headteacher 's decision to ban all drinks except water during the school day
headteacher linda shute has banned children from consuming drinks - including tea , coffee , fruit juice and soft drinks - in a bid to protect the long - term health of pupils at rowdown primary school in new addington , south london
but some parents believe the water - only rule is too strict , claiming many children go all day without a drink because they do not like water
' mrs linda shute , who announced her aims by enforcing the rule in a school newsletter last month , said : ' the water - only policy is being very well supported by parents and children
' if teachers are allowed tea and coffee , why ca n't a child have a bottle of juice or flavoured water ? ' but the school has defended its decision
the rule has been enforced to protect the long - term health of pupils at rowdown primary school ( pictured ) in new addington , south london it follows a similar ban which sparked anger at valence primary school in dagenham , east london , when it was introduced in january last year
