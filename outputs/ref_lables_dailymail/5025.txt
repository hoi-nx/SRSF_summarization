no wonder james freedman âs super-nimble hands are insured for a huge sum â for the fingers he uses to steal wallets are the tools of his trade
now he âs exhibiting his â skills â on stage in a one - man pickpocket show , called man of steal , in which he even takes off someone âs tie without them realising
james freedman , 49 , describes himself as â the only honest pickpocket you will ever meet â
so i ask him to show me how those crooks we all fear go about their surreptitious trade
â it âs a light , fluttering motion and , if executed correctly , the victim is nât aware of it , â says james freedman
the wallet : harry is now without his cash and cred cards thanks to james freedman 's nimble fingers the phone : daylight robbery and mount does n't even feel a thing or â a much more simple ruse â â accidentally â bump into them
â to describe his activities , james freedman uses old - fashioned pickpocket patter , much of which dates back to 18th - century thieves
james freedman uses two fingers in a pincer - like movement to steal it
shady business : james freedman shows how a folded newspaper can be used to steal a pair of sunglasses james freedman shows how to remove a pair of expensive sunglasses hanging from a jacket breast pocket by flicking them out and catching them with a folded newspaper
fixing my gaze , james freedman puts his hand lightly on top of my watch , unbuckles it and whisks it away
â people have a muscle memory , â says james freedman
for all his skill as a pickpocket , james freedman says he has never used it for anything other for entertainment
â however , he admits one exception : he once saw a woman being pickpocketed outside harrods , decided to pickpocket the pickpocket and gave the purse back to the victim
proudly , james freedman says the smartly dressed thief â who realised too late what had happened â went up to him afterwards and said : â nice work
â james freedman first became interested in pickpocketing as a child when he was mugged
not long after , he saw a theatrical pickpocket on tv â and then saw his father being pickpocketed on a trip to paris
as we walk down london âs oxford street , he points out some easy prey : a woman sitting on a bench with an open bag next to her and a man with an unzipped pocket , a phone clearly visible inside it
daylight robbery : the pickpocket specialist offers harry directions while slipping a hand inside his pocket distraction : as harry looks into the distance , his mobile phone has been stolen and is about to disappear into james freedman 's pocket he can identify the model of a phone by the shape of the bulge in your pocket
iphone , â he says as we pass people whose phones , inside their pockets , are invisible to me
james freedman says : â if i stopped everyone and told them how vulnerable they are , i âd never have any time left to do anything else
â mobile phones are the perfect item for pickpockets â â it âs called apple or blackberry picking â â but the information about the owner contained on the sim card is more useful to the thief than the phone âs intrinsic value because it contains a wealth of personal information and possibly even bank details
â according to james freedman : â when we see such signs , we instinctively pat our pockets to check our valuables are ok
and the pickpocket is watching to see where the item is kept
â after spending time with this cunning man , i ca nât help keep patting my pockets obsessively as i walk along the street
i hope a real pickpocket â rather than a master showman â is nât watching me
