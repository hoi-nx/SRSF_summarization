clarkson has finally spoken out about his high - profile sacking from top gear , admitting he will ' miss ' fronting the bbc show
clarkson , 54 , who was fired in march after attacking a producer during filming , has not publicly addressed his dismissal , apart from to say that ' everyone 's upset '
but the presenter today gave his ' heartfelt thanks ' to those who sent their support in the aftermath of his sacking , saying he would ' miss being there '
it came as ms rippon , 70 , who first presented the show 38 years ago , said she would be keen to return to the motoring show if she were invited back
' clarkson was dropped by the bbc after an internal investigation found he had launched an ' unprovoked ' 30 - second physical attack on producer oisin tymon because he was offered a plate of cold cuts instead of steak and chips
following weeks of speculation over the star 's future , lord hall , the director - general of the corporation , publicly announced that the bbc would not be renewing clarkson 's contract
he said clarkson had ' crossed the line ' and that ' there can not be one rule for one and one rule for another '
now , with the future of the show still up in the air , former newsreader ms rippon said it would be ' great ' if she was invited back

meanwhile , bbc bosses are said to be desperately trying to hold onto james may ( left ) and richard hammond ( right ) - clarkson 's co-presenters - for the bbc show mr may has previously said that the trio ' came as a package ' , while richard hammond - not ruling out a return - said the sacking marked ' the end of an era ' but bbc bosses are reportedly still trying to persuade richard hammond and james may to continue with the show , in a bid to cling onto long - term fans
a source told the daily mirror : ' richard hammond is a tv presenter and this could be his chance to become top dog - he 's been on the show a bit longer than james may
' mr may has previously said that the trio ' came as a package ' , while richard hammond - not ruling out a return - said the sacking marked ' the end of an era '
some believe the pair are remaining silent while waiting for bids from rival channels , which may want to snap up the former top gear group as a trio the day after clarkson 's sacking , may gave a big hint that he has no plans to return to top gear , suggesting he is to â go back to normal life
clarkson , 54 , was sacked after attacking oisin tymon in an episode which lord hall said had ' crossed the line ' but the bbc 's creative director alan yentob previously made it clear he wanted may and richard hammond to continue presenting the show without clarkson , despite acknowledging it would be ' perfectly natural ' for them to have reservations about continuing
' if clarkson is not in it and richard hammond and james may are , that needs to be a conversation with them as well
clarkson , may and richard hammond are scheduled to take part in the live top gear shows next month
