jonathan leblanc , the company âs top developer , said that the devices would be powered by stomach acid and include mini computers
he said that technology had become so advanced that it allowed â true integration with the human body â
mr jonathan leblanc , the global head of developer evangelism at paypal , said in a presentation called â kill all passwords â that he wants to â put users in charge of their own security â
other possibilities include silicon chips which are put under the skin and â wearable computer tattoos â which send information via a wireless connection
mr jonathan leblanc said paypal was currently carrying out hackathons to develop vein recognition technologies and heartbeat recognition bands to go round a person âs wrist
jonathan leblanc , the company âs top developer , said that passwords as they are now were not working and that users need to â harden it with something physical behind it â instead of typing it into a given computer field mr jonathan leblanc said : â i ca nât speculate as to what paypal will do in the future , but we âre looking at new techniques â we do have fingerprint scanning that is being worked on right now â so we âre definitely looking at the identity field â
in a statement paypal later said that jonathan leblanc 's comments were meant as blue skies thinking and that the company was not actually developing edible passwords
