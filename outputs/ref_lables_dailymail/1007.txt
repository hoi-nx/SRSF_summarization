the suicides of five young sailors who served on the same base over two years has unearthed a shocking culture of ice taking , binge drinking , bullying and depression within the navy
the sailors were stationed or had been stationed at the wa port of hmas stirling off the coast of rockingham , south of perth
their families did not learn of their previous attempts to take their own lives and their drug use until after their deaths , according to abc 's 7.30 program
' it 's a decision that i do n't think ... any parent should have to make , ' mark told 7.30
stuart had also been on psychiatric medication , which the family were also unaware about
his father , mark , was devastated by the blow and had to make the difficult decision to turn his son 's life support henry , who was friends with stuart , said there was a drug culture within the navy ' they knew and we were n't told about it
we were kept in the dark , ' stuart 's sister jessica ames said
brett dwyer , who was best friends with stuart , took his own life just months later he wants to make sure the devastating pain he feels never happens to other families
it was also revealed by stuart 's friend and former sailor henry , who had also attempted to take his own life on several occasions , that ice use and drinking was rife within the ranks of hmas sterling
mr henry said ice was the ' drug of choice in wa ' because it was so readily available through their sailor friends
he said he believed his friends ' use of the drug ruined their lives
another sailor , brett dwyer , who served alongside stuart took his own life just three months after his best friend
but he was sent to hmas stirling where he was bullied by navy personnel

stuart 's family did not know he was on psychiatric medication and sister jessica ames said they were kept in the dark by the navy rsl counsellor brian o'neill said mr brett dwyer told the navy he was taking ice to get out of the service ' i would n't wish that on any family
while jake casey , who was pallbearer for brett dwyer , developed an ice habit and hanged himself three days before the first anniversary of his friend 's death
