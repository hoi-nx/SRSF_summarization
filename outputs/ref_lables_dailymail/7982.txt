but one russia youtuber captured the terrifying moment a stream of soil flowed down a bank next to a main road , crushing trees in its powerful path and leaving toppled power lines in its wake
the eerie phenomenon is called an ' earthflow ' and is a rare type of landslide
a russia youtuber has captured the terrifying moment a stream of soil flowed down a bank next to a main road ( pictured ) , crushing trees in its powerful path and leaving toppled power lines in its wake alexander giniyatullin kept a remarkably steady hand filming the scary scene in the kemerovo region of russia , which is thought to have happened at around 1pm on april 1 , according to a blog post on the american geophysical union âs website
' alexander giniyatullin kept a remarkably steady hand filming the scary scene in the kemerovo region of russia ( shown by the red marker ) , which is thought to have happened at 1pm on april 1 an earthflow is a type of landslide
it 's a viscous flow of fine - grained materials , such as clay , sand and silt that have been saturated with water and moves downhill because of the pull of gravity
earthflows usually begin in a large basin on the upper part of a slope where debris and weathered material accumulate
the speed of an earthflow can vary depending on the amount of water present and the angle of the slope and varies from 0.11 to 12.4 mph ( 0.17 to 20 km / h )
as the earthflow gathers momentum , it can be seen crushing trees in its path , and the sound of crumbling soil and splintering wood can be heard in the video
an earthflow is a viscous flow of fine - grained materials , such as clay , sand and silt that have been saturated with water and moves downhill because of the pull of gravity
earthflows usually begin in a large basin on the upper part of a slope where debris and weathered material accumulate , - although this point can not be seen in the video
as the earthflow gathers momentum , it can be seen crushing trees in its path ( pictured ) and the sound of crumbling soil and splintering wood can be heard the speed of an earthflow can vary depending on the amount of water present and the angle of the slope and varies from being barely noticeable to relatively rapid , as seen in the video when a road becomes completely blocked ( pictured ) in a matter of minutes research suggests that rockfall son mont blanc ( pictured ) are caused by warming temperatures climbers have long suspected that hotter summers trigger rockfalls on the slopes of mont blanc in the alps
the video shows a stream of water running down the road as the debris falls down the slope , indicating the mass of soil is waterlogged
the speed of an earthflow can vary depending on the amount of water present and the angle of the slope , varying from being barely noticeable to relatively rapid , as seen in the video when a road becomes completely blocked in a matter of minutes
in the video , the flow of debris is quite fast and it âs possible to see industrial equipment toppled at the top of the slope , while trees are crushed beneath the moving earth and what appear to be power lines and pylons pulled down and dragged along by the moving mass of earth
