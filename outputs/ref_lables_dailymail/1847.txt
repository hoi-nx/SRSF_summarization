a wicked mistake in the men 's college hockey title game on saturday by boston university 's goalie allowed providence to tie in the third period and paved the way for the friars to win their first title
the ncaa championship game , which ended 4 - 3 and was played at the td garden in boston , will always be remembered for the game - tying goal allowed by boston university 's matt oâconnor , not the winner
oâconnor 's own - goal turned his team 's 3 - 2 lead into a 3 - 3 tie
a few minutes later , brandon tanev scored with 6:17 remaining to give the friars the lead and the eventual win
it was the school 's first ncaa hockey title and third straight year a first - time champion has won it all
' they deserve to be hoisting the national championship right now
it was the providence 's first ncaa hockey title and third straight year a first - time champion has won it all after collapsing to the ice , boston university players did skate slowly over to oâconnor to console him after the tough loss oâconnor was n't the only one to have a bad miscue on saturday night
the ncaa representative tasked with presenting the friars with their trophy was apparently a little bit off his game as well
