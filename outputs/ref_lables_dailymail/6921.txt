osborne has refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the conservatives win a second term
the chancellor appeared to leave the door open when asked if he would be â depriving more families â of the payments which are worth more than Â£ 1,000 per year
more than a million households lost out when the coalition announced that families with one parent earning Â£ 50,000 would pay tax on child benefit
mr osborne was asked at a briefing in central london on the economy this morning whether he could â rule out depriving more people of child benefit , like you âve already done in this parliament ? â the conservatives say they would cut Â£ 30billion of spending if they win a second term
mr osborne did not directly answer about reducing the threshold , only saying that child benefit would not be replaced by the new benefits system universal credit , which is being rolled out nationally
the respected think tank the institute for fiscal studies have suggested that increasing universal credit for some families and using it instead of child benefit could save Â£ 4.8billion a year

it is widely speculated that the conservatives could restrict child benefit to just two children , to save around Â£ 2billion a year
it was not seriously considered in this parliament due to opposition from the liberal democrats and david cameron appeared to reject it last year amid concerns it would alienate low - income families
â labour âs shadow chief secretary to the treasury chris leslie said mr osborne had put middle income families in the firing line
he said : â the tories wo n't admit where their Â£ 12 billion of welfare cuts will come from , but after this press conference it 's now clear middle income families are in the firing line
