it 's a classic australian saying : ' g'day mate , how you going ? '
but when one australian traveller tried to get americans 's to repeat it , many were lost for words
from a homeless man who was insistent upon telling his story about britney spears , to a man who insisted murray was saying ' get out of my nightgown ' , the filmmaker captured it all
others erupted into fits of laughter as they tried to translate the classic australian vernacular , and murray also ran into one very talkative man intent on repeating he used to live in the back of britney spears ' dads house
this new yorker said ' sounds chinese to me man ' , when speaking to the brisbane man one man in nashville responded with an incomprehensible sentence while trying his hand at the australian accent this man , who did n't quite get the gist of the question , was insistent on telling a story about britney spears ' i lived in the back , of britney spears ' dads house ' , the man , who appears to be homeless , told the filmaker over and over again
when he was asked again to repeat the phrase after murray , he simply said : ' all right '
while on the subway murray asked one man to repeat what he said , but he simply declared ' ca n't do it '
kids giggled as they tried to understand what murray was saying in his australian accent many times the filmmaker was met with strange glances from confused americans children were n't much better and translating the popular australian phrase , but the best of the bunch came from a shirtless man in austin , texas
