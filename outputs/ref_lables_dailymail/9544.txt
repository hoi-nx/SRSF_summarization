ian joll was missing presumed dead after he was forced to crash land his plane on a dutch beach , but survived the incident to make it home to gravesend when joll opened the front door to see her son ian she fainted , believing she must have seen a ghost
ten minutes earlier mrs joll had received a telegram telling her that her son , squadron leader , was ' missing believed killed ' after he crash - landed his plane on a dutch beach during a strafing attack on a german aircraft in 1940
however sq ldr joll had survived the crash and after trekking miles along a beach and persuading a ship to take him back to english , he had dropped in on his parents to say hello
sq ldr joll had been involved in a strafing attack on german aircraft on may 10 , 1940 , when his plane was hit by ground fire and he was forced to crash land his bristol blenheim light bomber
after several unsuccessful attempts to set his bristol blenheim on fire , sq ldr joll decided the only thing to do was to shoot into the plane 's fuel tank
sq ldr joll and his gunner then trekked for miles where they met a dutch fisherman , who they persuaded to take them to english
their journey to english took place just 16 days before the start of the evacuation of 300,000 allied troops a few miles down the coast at dunkirk
oliver pepys , of spinks auctioneers which is now selling sq ldr joll 's medals , said : ' his mother answered the door and promptly fainted
' not ten minutes before she had received a telegram from the air ministry stating that they regretted to have to inform her pilot officer joll was missing believed killed
' quite often news would eventually filter back that the missing person was in a prisoner of war camp somewhere
' but for a relative to receive that dreaded telegram and then literally 10 minutes later that person show up alive is quite remarkable
his bristol blenheim aircraft iced up at 4,000ft and went into a spin
the squadron later upgraded to beaufighter planes and just a year later in may 1941 he survived a third close shave , when his aircraft was attacked by a german heinkel , seriously injuring his radar operator
sq ldr joll went on to fly a beaufighter night fighter ( file pic ) and shot down several nazi planes in november 1943 joll worked alongside lord louis mountbatten on planning the parachute landings for d-day and also helped develop the giant panjandrum - a huge cable - laying drum powered by rockets intended to destroy german mines on the normandy beaches
