humpback whale populations are to be declassified as ' endangered ' following a successful conservation programme
at one stage the worldwide population dropped to just a few thousand due to over-fishing and hunting , but it has now recovered to 90,000
noaa fisheries in maryland says the humpback whale is no longer endangered
they want to break up global population into 14 sub-populations
ten of these will be ' not at risk ' , two ' threatened ' and two still ' endangered '
it follows a conservation ' success story ' that raised numbers to 90,000 the proposal , by noaa ( noaa fisheries ) fisheries in maryland , is to reclassify the global population of humpback whales into 14 â population segments â , based on how they have recovered
ten of these would be deemed â not at risk â , two would be â threatened â and two would remain â endangered â
humans hunted the whales in high numbers , killing 200,000 before their listing as endangered in 1970 , four years after the international whaling commission banned commercial humpback whaling
noaa fisheries officials said decisions on which whale groups to recommend were based on many factors , including the risks they face
protection and restoration efforts have been taking place over the last 40 years after a dramatic reduction in humpback whale numbers
but since then numbers have risen dramatically , and noaa says the entire species is no longer endangered and needs to be reclassified
â the return of the iconic humpback whale is an esa [ esa ] success story , â said eileen sobeck , assistant noaa fisheries administrator for fisheries
â we support the concept of delisting as a success story and like the bald eagle , gray whale , and gray wolf see this as a cause for celebration , â edwin watamura wrote
â the proposal , by noaa fisheries in maryland , is to reclassify the global population of humpback whales into 14 â population segments â ( shown ) , based on how they have recovered
ten of these would be deemed â not at risk â , two would be â threatened â and two would remain â endangered â humpbacks travel very long distances when migrating
this is one of the routes that has been recommended for delisting , as numbers have improved dramatically following the successful conservation programme however , experts have warned that the reclassification is premature , and risks seeing numbers worldwide dropping to endangered levels again
sarah goddard , species policy officer at wwf-uk , said there were other sub-populations of humpback whales aside from these 14 for which data was poor
