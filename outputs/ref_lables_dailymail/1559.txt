cole skuse 's first ipswich goal , in their win against cardiff which kept them in the final playoff spot , was a long time coming but boy was it worth the wait
after 21 months and 82 appearances since he signed from bristol city in july 2013 , skuse opened his account with a 30 - yard effort which could barely have been struck sweeter
the score was already 1 - 1 when , in the 29th minute , cardiff defender ecuele manga stretched to clear on the edge of the box and the ball bounced to cole skuse , who hit it first time then watched it fly in off the right post

â it was a torrid night for ecuele manga who was all too easily shrugged away from the ball when ipswich striker freddie sears ran on to a long pass from berra , took a touch and then finished low under goalkeeper marshall to open the scoring after eight minutes
â ipswich restored their lead with cole skuse âs strike but fabio da silva , formerly of manchester united , missed a simple chance to level for cardiff when he shot wide from three yards
