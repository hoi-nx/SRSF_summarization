telecom watchdogs are to stop a rip - off that allows mobile phone firms to charge customers to call supposedly free 0800 numbers
currently mobile phone companies charge customers up to 20p a minute to dial what are free numbers from a landline phone
the net result is that millions of people dialling what should be free services run by the nhs , the government and company call centres end up paying hefty charges
the charges will end from july 1 under proposals published by the telecoms watchdog , watchdog ofcom , today
at the time , the company , which is about to be taken over by bt in a deal worth Â£ 12.5billion , complained getting rid of charges for 0800 numbers was â ill thought out â and would â crush an already struggling industry segment â
ernest doku , telecoms expert at the price comparison service , uswitch.com , said the end to mobile charges to call 0800 numbers was a â long - overdue victory for common - sense â
he said : â making â 0800 â numbers free from all telephones including mobile phones is excellent news since it âs rarely practical to redial from a landline to avoid charges for what are generally assumed to be â free phone â numbers
â the changes are part of a wider shake - up in call charges to non-geographic numbers , which are described by watchdog ofcom as the â biggest overhaul of phone calls in more than a decade â
