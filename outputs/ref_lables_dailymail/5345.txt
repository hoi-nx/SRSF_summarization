liverpool defender toure insists a ' sad ' steven gerrard will deal with the reality of being denied a fairytale fa cup final farewell
the former ivory coast international said the team was probably more disappointed at not being able to deliver a trophy for fans , who this season had seen their side fail to progress out of the champions league group stage and lose to chelsea in the last four of the capital one cup
a 2 - 1 defeat to aston villa at wembley stadium ended the club 's last hope of silverware and meant steven gerrard would not be given a perfect send off ahead of his summer move to la galaxy with a cup final appearance on his 35th birthday on what would have been his very last for his boyhood club

' steven gerrard was able to start the match after an injury to lucas in training , which denied liverpool some much - needed control in midfield
the former england captain looks dejected after the final whistle and his hopes of a final trophy ended however , toure insisted they should have had the ability to cope without their only genuine defensive midfielder
' as a result , rodgers became the first liverpool manager since the 1950s not to win a trophy in his first three years
steven gerrard did n't get his fairytale ending at wembley stadium as he leaves the club at the end of the season for la galaxy with the club 's champions league qualification hopes looking increasingly distant after manchester city 's win over west ham on sunday increased the gap to fourth place to seven points - although liverpool now have a match in hand - the reds boss will find his record coming under more scrutiny over the final six games of the season
' rodgers became the first manager since the 1950s not to win a trophy in his first three years despite an impressive run of form since the turn of the year , liverpool have looked ineffective in the big games , with back - to - back defeats to manchester united and arsenal putting a huge dent in their top - four hopes just when it seemed they were about to make the breakthrough , having worked so hard to get within two points of the top - four
' the team in the last couple of years have shown great energy , attitude and commitment - i thought our energy was low ( against aston villa )
the reds boss admitted that aston villa deserved the victory as they progressed to the fa cup final ' they had a good start to the game and we were too passive in the game
