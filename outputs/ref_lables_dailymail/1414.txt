video - scroll down to see mohammad shatnawi 's amazing own goal mohammed shatnawi bizarrely scored an own goal by kicking the ball over his head at the weekend mohammad shatnawi appeared to be trying to put the ball out of play after initially making a good save he watches on in horror as the ball floats ominously towards the net after his overhead kick as the al whidat striker closed in on goal and lashed a venomous strike on target , mohammad shatnawi got down well to stop it with his foot , an impulsive reaction block
