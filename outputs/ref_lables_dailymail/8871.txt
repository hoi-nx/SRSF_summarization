model ciara nugent may benefit from the right to buy scheme being extended to housing association tenants as her mother plans to buy her a property housing association tenants paying cheap rent to live in homes worth millions could get the chance to buy them at discounted prices under new right - to - buy plans
a number of people are currently paying around Â£ 150 a week to live in flats in exclusive parts of mayfair and covent garden in london which are owned by housing associations and are now worth several million
under tory plans to give tenants the chance to own their own homes , people living in these plush properties could now get the chance to buy them with discounts of up to Â£ 102,000 in london , after living in them for cheaper rents
the properties form part of affordable housing because of agreements with developers to provide low - cost provisions when new developments are built over a certain size
this enables tenants to occupy properties worth at least Â£ 1million for cheap rents , and many tenancies go unreviewed if circumstances change
an investigation by the sunday times found that 10 properties owned by the peabody housing association in london are located in the expensive areas of mayfair and covent garden - and are worth between Â£ 1million and Â£ 2.2million
but housing associations have opposed the proposals to sell their costly buildings at discounted prices , saying it will mean while individual tenants may benefit there will be no affordable housing left for people who need it most
housing associations own expensive properties , such as a house used in the paddington bear film in primrose hill paddington bear was filmed in an exclusive part of primrose hill , a property owned by a housing association they have also said owning property which has recently risen in value allows them to finance future developments
she said : ' halfway through a programme of austerity and in the grips of a housing crisis , if you had Â£ 20 billion of taxpayers ' money , would you just give it away as a gift to some of the most securely housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents ? ' the original right - to - buy scheme saw more than 1.5million council homes being sold off at discounted rates , and became one of margaret thatcher 's best known policies
some tenants who are currently paying around Â£ 150 a week to live in the expensive london districts are keen to take advantage of the right - to - buy plans to try and buy their properties
how does right - to - buy work ? introduced in 1980 , it gives council house tenants discounts to buy their home
are housing association tenants covered ? housing associations â autonomous , not - for - profit bodies that receive public money and loans from the private sector to provide low - cost homes â are largely exempt
what are the tory proposals ? they would legislate to give all housing association tenants full right - to - buy
the new properties would be more affordable , probably in less expensive locations , and could be built either by a council or housing association
another slice of the proceeds would be used to fund the new right - to - buy discounts for housing association tenants
