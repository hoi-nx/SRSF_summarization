a financial fund for killer cop slager was shut down by crowd - funding website , gofundme , on wednesday
the site told daily mail online that ' after review by our team , the campaign set up for officer slager was removed due to a violation of gofundme 's terms & conditions ' but refused to elaborate due to privacy concerns
slager has been charged with the murder of unarmed black father coast guard , 50 , who was fatally shot five times in the back in north charleston , south carolina on saturday
slager , 33 , was terminated from the police force on wednesday
a separate fundraising campaign was started on site , indiegogo , titled the ' michael t. slager support fund ' and featured a picture of slager in his police uniform
as of thursday at 11am , it had raised $ 393 of a $ 5,000 goal on donations from 20 people after being set up on wednesday
according to police reports , officers performed cpr on the 50 - year - old father - but the cop was not filmed giving any medical assistance opening fire : slager , a police officer in charleston , south carolina , was caught on video shooting dead 50 - year - old black man coast guard after reportedly stopping him over a broken tail light on saturday one of the individuals who donated listed their name as ' trayvon martin ' - perhaps a twisted reference to trayvon martin , an unarmed black teenager shot dead by a neighborhood watch volunteer in florida in 2012
an explanation of the fundraising campaign reads : ' we 're campaigning to show our support for officer michael t. slager ! ' we believe in all of our leos and want to publicly support them ! although he may have made mis - steps in judgement he was protecting the community
' a separate facebook page and twitter account were set up linking to the fundraising site
' in a statement to daily mail online , an indiegogo spokesperson said : ' indiegogo allows anyone , anywhere to fund ideas that matter to them and just like other open platforms -- such as facebook , youtube and twitter - we do nât judge the content of campaigns as long as they are in compliance with our terms of use
' indiegogo 's list ' prohibited campaigns ' includes those ' to raise funds for illegal activities , to cause harm to people or property , or to scam others '
last year , gofundme came under fire after allowing fundraising for wilson , a white cop in ferguson , missouri who shot and killed unarmed teenager michael brown
