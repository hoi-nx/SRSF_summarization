a 12 - year - old girl was tied up , beaten and raped for by seven isis different fighters when she was kidnapped from her home in the iraq region of yazidi , a shocking new report has revealed
the suffering of jalila - whose name has been changed - is just one of a number of harrowing accounts given by women who have escaped captured by the brutal islamist organisation which is taking over swathes of territory in syria and iraq
the study undertaken by human rights watch found fighters were kidnapping women and children as young as eight , forcing them to marry and convert to islam and raping them repeatedly â sometimes picking their victims â names out of a hand in a sick lottery
it adds yazidi children as young as eight have been abducted from their homes in northern iraq , raped by isis fighters and forced into marriage
one child interviewed said she was ' owned ' and raped by seven different men of those who managed to escape , many feel suicidal after their traumatic ordeal and need better medical and psychological support , says human rights watch
some tried to kill themselves while in captivity to avoid rape their terrifying campaign of systematic rape was tantamount to war crimes - and possibly crimes against humanity , the report adds
after a few weeks she was taken to a house in syria that housed other abducted young yazidi women and girls , where the men would come and select us
the names of yazidi women were selected from a lottery for men to rape , a survivor told the charity â i told him not to touch me and begged him to let me go â , she said
â during her captivity seven isis fighters â owned â jalila , and four raped her on multiple occasions
human rights watch has collected the accounts of 20 women and girls who escaped from isis , which they say shows a system of organised rape and sexual assault , sexual slavery and forced marriage â acts that constitute war crimes
these women were part of a group of 216 yazidis who were recently released by isis after being captured last year the survivors ' stories come as un ( un ) investigators found evidence isis are committing genocide against the yazidi minority in iraq
the report , based on interviews with more than 100 witnesses and survivors between june 2014 and february 2015 , highlights brutal isis attacks on the yazidi
rashida told the charity she was told by her brother to commit suicide if she was unable to escape the isis fighters who had captured her
â another woman , identified as dilara , said she was taken to a wedding hall in syria where isis fighters told the group to forget their relatives and prepare to marry them and bear their children
' rape and other forms of sexual violence , sexual slavery , cruel treatment , and other abuses committed during an armed conflict violate the laws of war , the report by human rights watch says â and better support is needed for children and women who survive such attacks
' yazidi women and girls who escaped isis still face enormous challenges and continuing trauma from their experience , â liesl gerntholtz , the women 's rights director at human rights watch said
