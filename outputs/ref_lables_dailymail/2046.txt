the creator of the best - selling alex rider spy novels has accused fellow children âs author david walliams of dumbing - down fiction and failing to â challenge â young readers
horowitz said books by the comedian â who was the britain âs top - selling children âs author last year â are â witty and entertaining â but nowhere near ambitious enough
the 59 - year - old novelist and screenwriter singled out claims walliams â gangsta granny for criticism , as well as the diary of a wimpy kid books by author jeff kinney
david walliams made over Â£ 7million in 2014 from book sales including the boy in the dress and demon dentist he added : â to some extent , narrative fiction was reinvented by jk rowling â it âs hard to believe that children were nât challenged by books that stretched to 760 pages â and a phalanx of writers crested on her success : michael morpurgo , philip pullman , jacqueline wilson , malorie blackman , eoin colfer , darren shan ... and me
' today it is jeff kinney and david walliams who top the bestseller lists , with books that are witty and entertaining but nowhere near as ambitious
â horowitz said â the idea that children automatically dislike reading or that books belong to a more fusty , ancient generation is patently absurd â
we do nât need to be afraid of powerful stories or serious ideas
the success of his books , which also include ratburger and billionaire boy , has also been boosted by television adaptations , such as the boy in the dress , which starred david walliams , meera syal and jennifer saunders , and was shown on the bbc at christmas .
