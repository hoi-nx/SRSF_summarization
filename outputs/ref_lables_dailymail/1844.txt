there âs nothing better than a succulent steak , sizzling from the hot plate , charred to perfection on the outside , bursting with juices within
people often get it wrong when cooking this cut of meat and end up with an overdone dish that âs bone dry , grey - hued and distinctly unappetising
â and while we all stress about the cooking times for steak , he advises in checking the temperature of the meat before you start preparing your meal
' one of the most important steps in cooking the perfect steak that is often forgotten or never thought about , is to allow your meat to come to room temperature first
' this will shorten the cooking time and help to prevent grey rings from happening , ' mr jared mccarroll continued
your steak should have a fine texture , be well marbled ( veins of fat running through the meat ) and firm to the touch
the shape and thickness of the steak is also important ; the best steaks are one to 1.5 - inches thick as a thinner cut is likely to get dry quicker
â the texture will depend on the quality of the beef and the cut ; fillet has the best texture but the least flavour , whereas ribeye has more flavour and more fat , less texture but more flavour , ' the chef said
â when it comes to the shape of the steak , try and keep it flat and a decent thickness
â too thin a steak will be easy to overcook
also try to keep the shape the same throughout the whole steak as this will help to keep the cooking consistent

but what are the perfect timings to cook steak the way you like it ? if you are unsure , it 's best to speak to your butcher as they will be able to give you the best advice based on the thickness and cut of meat

the more marbling a piece of steak has means the more moist it will be
marbling means your steak is full of mono saturated fatty acid , proven to reduce cholesterol levels
when seasoning , mr jared mccarroll advises using coarse salt
â the steak will absorb the salt and when you flip it the excess salt will fall off , which means you can season the other side
and while we âve all been told various cooking times for the perfect steak , mr jared mccarroll says there are too many variables to have anything set in stone
â cooking times will vary depending on the size of the steak , whether it is room temperature , how hot your grill is
