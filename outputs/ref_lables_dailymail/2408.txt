britons spend an astonishing Â£ 100 million a year on cough syrup â when a glass of honey and lemon could work just as well , according to a new bbc television investigation
it claims that branded painkillers that say they specifically treat certain types of pain are just using â clever marketing â to make patients spend up to ten times more than they would on unbranded products , and that some manufacturers simply use the same pills in different packaging throughout their ranges
in the truth about medicine , to be broadcast on thursday , dr van tulleken , an infectious diseases specialist , warns we should think less about convenience and more about the effectiveness of medicines
there are three main types of over-the - counter cough remedies , those that contain suppressants to alleviate symptoms of a dry , tickly cough , syrups that reduce the urge to cough by coating the throat , and products that help to thin sticky mucus , making coughing easier
some also contain paracetamol or ibuprofen , both of which reduce a temperature , decongestants and antihistamines that can help sleep
yet an authoritative study from cardiff university âs common cold centre claimed cough medicines work mostly through a placebo effect , and that just 15 per cent of the effect can be attributed to the medicines in them
prevent : sores on the inside of the mouth or cheeks can be caused by damage to the lining of the mouth from hot foods , biting your cheek or even rubbing dentures
they can also be a sign of an iron or vitamin b12 deficiency , so a balanced diet can help prevent them
spicy foods and chocolate can be triggers , so keep a food diary if you have recurrent outbreaks to pinpoint problem foods
it âs also worth checking your toothpaste â formulas that contain a foaming agent called sodium lauryl sulphate can cause mouth ulcers by reducing the protective mucus layer in the mouth
stick to the daily recommended allowance of 40mg per day ( 30mg for children aged one to ten ) through a healthy diet
a study of 60 over-the - counter medicines found that all but two contained sweeteners such as honey or sucrose , which can stimulate saliva and mucus production
in the documentary , dr van tulleken shows how an old - fashioned remedy of honey and lemon could be just the tonic to banish a troublesome cough
he inhales pepper spray into his lungs , which makes him cough , then takes a lemon - and - honey concoction
he inhales the pepper spray once more , but does nât cough at all
the proprietary association of great britain ( pagb ) , a trade association representing manufacturers of over-the - counter medicines , says that although it is difficult to test the effectiveness of cough medicines , as the severity and duration of symptoms can vary , research has shown they are rated as effective by 90 per cent of consumers
the film also reveals that britons families spend Â£ 350 million on a variety of painkillers , with packaging claiming to specifically target ailments such as period pain , headaches or muscular problems
â it is nât that the manufacturers are being untruthful , but it is clever marketing to tempt you to spend more money , â said dr van tulleken
the investigation claims branded painkillers that say they specifically treat certain types of pain are just using â clever marketing â to make patients spend up to ten times more than they would on unbranded products pagb chief executive matthew speers told this newspaper : â people search for products to treat their specific symptoms , so different labelling and packaging help people navigate the range more easily
