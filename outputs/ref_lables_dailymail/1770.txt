john carver has challenged his newcastle players to relieve the pressure on their shoulders by adding another dent to liverpool 's champions league hopes
john carver says his players need to relieve the pressure of their shoulders with a win against liverpool he said : ' they are only seven points off it , i think , and they 'll think they have still got a chance , seven points off it with seven games to go
john carver 's cause has not been helped by an injury and suspension list which at some points has robbed him of an entire xi , and while there is light at the end of the tunnel for midfielders rolando aarons and siem de jong , the trip to merseyside will come too soon
john carver said : ' i would say rolando aarons is certainly ahead of siem de jong at the moment , but neither of those guys will be available this weekend
' rolando aarons ( left ) and siem de jong are back in training but wo n't be available for monday night
