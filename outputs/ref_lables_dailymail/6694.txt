a second ice cream company has recalled all of its products after health officials found listeria in a sample of its frozen treats
jeni 's splendid ice creams of ohio said on its website on thursday that it is recalling its frozen products after the listeria discovery
in an online statement , jeni 's said it is taking the voluntary precautionary measure in order to ensure complete consumer safety
the company is recalling its ice creams , frozen yogurts , sorbets , and ice cream sandwiches and closing retail stores until its products are ' ensured to be 100 per cent safe '
the nebraska department of agriculture found the listeria in a sample of jeni 's ice cream it had randomly collected at a whole foods in lincoln , nebraska
' jeni 's said the recalled ice cream was distributed in the us to retail outlets , including food service and grocery stores , as well as online at jenis.com
on facebook , the company wrote that they are taking this precautionary measure in order to ensure complete consumer safety the recall includes all products bearing the brand name ' jeni 's
' the action follows a similar recall by texas - based blue bell creameries on monday night
blue bell creameries 's ice cream was linked to ten listeria illnesses in four states , including three deaths , and listeria was found in several of the company 's products
the company is the third largest ice cream manufacturer in the us and sells its products in 23 states
it said it ' ca n't say with certainty ' how the bacteria was introduced to the manufacturing line , blue bell creameries 's chief executive kruse said in a statement
on monday , texas - based blue bell creameries creameries issued a voluntary recall for all of its products on the market on monday night after two samples of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream tested positive for listeriosis just last month the family - owned creamery issued its first recall in its 108 - year history after the centers for disease control and prevention linked ice cream contaminated with listeriosis to three deaths at a kansas hospital
the recalls are uncommon : listeria is n't usually found in ice cream , since the bacteria ca n't grow at freezing temperatures
a spokesman for the fda said the agency has no evidence , for now , that the listeria found in jeni 's ice cream and the listeria found in blue bell creameries ice cream are connected
' at this time , the fda does not believe that the finding of listeria in one sample of jeni 's splendid ice creams is related to the outbreak and recall associated with blue bell creameries , ' said spokesman jeff ventura
' the centers for disease control and prevention said there are no known illnesses linked to jeni 's products
the fda said it still has open investigations in all three plants and will evaluate blue bell creameries 's progress in removing listeria from the plant and its products
blue bell creameries did produce some ice cream in its plants this week , but that product will be used for testing and data gathering and wo n't be sold to the public , the company said
