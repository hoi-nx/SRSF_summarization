mothers and babies have been banned from special screenings at an independent cinema after staff became fed up with clearing away dirty nappies and oversized prams
the manager of the rex cinema in berkhamsted , hertfordshire , cancelled the regular tuesday baby matinees due to a combination of ' whingeing , bitching , snitching and the law '
hannaway , who restored and reopened the traditional cinema in 2004 , announced the decision on the company 's website
mr hannaway said he was fed up with the whingeing from those attending the screenings without babies , even though they declared they ' might contain babies '
' rex staff have enjoyed collecting still - warm nappies from under tables , and who put up with difficult first time mothers with armoured tanks ( prams ) and a not always helpful attitude as they spread everything from the tank everywhere , ' he said
and mr hannaway also claimed that the cinema has been forced to reconsider over the ratings on the tuesday films
