howard is adamant the europa league is not to blame for everton delivering what might be their worse season for nine years
perhaps the goalkeeper would have been better off hiding behind conventional wisdom , considering the disappointment of this elongated campaign which could yet see everton finish in the bottom half of the premier league for the first time since 2006
howard is adamant the europa league is not to blame for everton 's poor season in the premier league the merseyside outfit played 10 games in europe this season before being knocked out by dynamo kiev aaron lennon scored for everton at swansea city but the game ended in a 1 - 1 draw at the liberty stadium swansea city ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : fabianski 6.5 ; rangel 6 , fernandez 6 , williams 6 , taylor 6 ; ki 6.5 , cork 6.5 , jonjo shelvey 7.5 ( dyer 83mins ) ; sigurdsson 6 , bafetimbi gomis 6 ( emnes 17 , 6.5 ) , routledge 6.5
everton ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : howard 6.5 ; coleman 6 , stones 6 , jagielka 6.5 , baines 6.5 ; mccarthy 6.5 , barry 7 ; aaron lennon 6.5 , barkley 5.5 ( mirallas 86 ) , leon osman 6 ( pienaar 28 , 6 ) ; kone 5 ( naismith 76 )
the demands of playing 10 games in the europa league have certainly taken their toll but howard rejected that theory , saying : â that âs something that âs been talked about for the last five or 10 years but it âs just a blanket statement people make
â the perception that luck has not gone everton âs way extended to saturday when aaron lennon âs first - half strike was cancelled out by a jonjo shelvey penalty
neither side came out of the fixture unscathed , with leon osman of everton and swansea city âs bafetimbi gomis due to have scans today on respective groin and hamstring injuries
howard will not allow europe to be an excuse for what could be everton 's worst season in nine years jonjo shelvey of swansea city scores past howard with a penalty to level the scores on saturday afternoon swansea city manager garry monk confirmed a striker is top of his summer wishlist after being left with no fit front men , while everton , in the shorter - term , have been told to finish in the top half
howard added : â there âs a points total we want to achieve and get ourselves in the top half of the table
