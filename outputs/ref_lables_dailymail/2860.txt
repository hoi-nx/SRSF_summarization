these hilarious images show the moment a frisky tortoise scupper his chances while trying to mate with a female
the moment things go south : the loved up male tortoise is seen here teetering before he falls on the ground shell we just leave it then ? he gets no second chances and after failing to impress his mate and she leaves talk about lying down on the job - the poor fella looked positively ' shell - shocked ' as it found itself on its back unable to get up
the amusing moment was caught on camera , by ukranian photographer , vadym shevchenko , 34 , at kiev zoo
and it seems the female tortoise was n't willing to wait around as she was pictured leaving the clumsy casanova on its back , in the mud
flat on his back , the tortoise lost his balance when the female moved away - and he had to scrabble in the mud she was n't too upset though and went to find some food , leaving her unfortunate partner flailing on the ground ' the female did n't seem to upset and she quickly moved off in search of food
' seeing its face struggling in the mud was priceless , i always laugh out loud when i look back at these photographs
