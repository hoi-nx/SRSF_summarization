he âs a tv star with a love for adventure , so it âs no wonder ben fogle looks for somewhere a little bit extraordinary for his holiday
my husband and i see the tv star lazing with his little boy by one of the five swimming pools in the martinhal beach resort in portugal , soaking up the sun. the high - end resort , which opened in 2010 , is renowned as being one of the best in the algarve for a luxury family holiday
the beautiful martinhal is a hit with families - and tv stars such as ben fogle but despite the sun shining for around 300 days of the year here and the golden sand being warm beneath your toes , the water is cold martinhal , which boasts a fine - dining restaurant , is the only five - star resort in the area to have direct access to a beach , and is set within 25 hectares in the protected costa vicentina natural park
so we âve come to check it out â after all , why should the kids have all the fun ? from the balcony in our chic beach room , we are afforded an incredible view over the glistening waters of the north atlantic ocean from the most south - westerly point in the algarve
but despite the sun shining for around 300 days of the year here and the golden sand being warm beneath your toes , do nât be fooled â the sea is sharp - intake - of - breath cold
adventurer , author , broadcaster and writer ben fogle is a regular at martinhal couples can overlook the ocean , read the papers , feast on fresh orange juice , and enjoy a classy breakfast the resort boasts a stunning swimming pool surrounded by decking - and close to a restaurant the boutique room in which we stay for three nights is in the resort 's hotel
