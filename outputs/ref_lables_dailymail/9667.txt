cats will not just catch mice but the scent they leave behind can also discourage rodents from returning the north london - based charity say that the presence of a cat and the scent it leaves behind will often be enough to scare away unwanted rodents
juliette jones , animal welfare consultant at wood green , said : ' we have more than 200 cats in need of good homes , some of which will benefit from being cared for temporarily in a home environment , until they find their forever homes
' the service is being provided through the handy smartphone app , which allows users to book cleaners and handymen for home repairs
the app allows householders to choose the cat they want to visit their home and offers photos and background for each member of the feline mousing team
those looking to borrow a cat to help rid their homes of a mouse infestation are asked to be ' flexible , patient and caring towards the animals '
the charity provides litter trays , feed and bedding to help foster families look after their pet
the service is only available in london within driving distance of wood green for now
the cats do nât need to do any mouse catching - their sheer presence alone will have any mice leaving the premises , repelled by the cat âs pheromones
' pete dowds , handy 's uk manager , said the new scheme had been created as a result of an increasing number of requests from handy customers for cleaners to bring in cats with them in order to help scare away mice

the charity provides litter trays , feed and bedding photos of the cats , like dash ( left ) and peppy ( right ) , appear on the handy cleaning and diy service app along with details about the animals ' life stories
' in the past , our cleaners have been asked to bring in moggies to scare rodents , so we were delighted to take the unusual step of being able to offer ' foster - able ' felines from wood green alongside our more typical cleaning and diy services
