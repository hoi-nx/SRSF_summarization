two ukip council candidates have been taken to school by a teacher who covered their sloppy election leaflet in corrections - but they claim it is a dirty tricks campaign
howlett , 54 , who specialises in teaching foreign - born children english , has embarrassed husband and wife team tanswell and sharon snook over their spelling , punctuation and grammar
in one section mr tanswell and ms sharon snook promise that ukip will ' take back control of our boarders ' - so the teacher wrote in red : ' i think you mean borders , not residents of a school or guest house '
the ukip candidates , from frome , somerset , defected to nigel farage 's party two weeks ago and hope to be re-elected in may , having left the lib dems to improve their chances
expert : howlett , 54 , who specialises in teaching foreign - born children english , took her red pen to the leaflet and sent it to her children mr tanswell today said his former party have ' hacked ' his emails for information to create a slapdash leaflet to scupper their election hopes , and has called in police
their error - strewn ukip leaflet has been shared thousands of times online
' i teach children who speak english as an additional language and advise other teachers about how to help them
there is no shame in having difficulties with spelling , punctuation and grammar
' i have not met the candidates , but the leaflet suggests that if you ca n't check something like this properly , how can you run something properly if you were to be elected
' i wo n't discuss ( ukip ) policies , i will just say that the children i work with are a delight , and some of them could teach mr tanswell a thing or two about apostrophes '
election campaign : tanswell and sharon snook , left and right , defected to nigel farage 's party two weeks ago and hope to be re-elected in may hint : this bullet point lacks the necessary apostrophe in one of more than 20 corrections lost in translation : a key section to persuade voters to back them next month also backfired changes : mrs hewlett suggested in her red notes ' try not to keep using apostrophes for plurals ' a picture of the annotated leaflet has spread across the internet after it was posted on reddit by a user who said a mother of a friend had marked it after finding it on her doormat
the leaflet also boasted about sharon snook and tanswell 's campaigning which led to the creation of ten free parking spaces at the local cattle market car park
mr. tanswell says the lib dems have put out the leaflet to ' stitch him up '
' it 's the lib dems who are doing it all
mr. tanswell , 48 , who runs a plumbing and heating company , added : ' i used to be a lib dems councillor
' about a month ago , i left the lib dems to go ukip and obviously a lot of them do n't like it , so they are producing stuff like [ the flyer ] and putting it out and putting my name to it
supportive : mrs howlett says she was not poking fun , adding : ' there is no shame in having difficulties with spelling , punctuation and grammar ' ' they believe the propaganda from the national parties , like the liberal party are saying that ukip are racist
' i was a lib dems councillor and i 've gone to ukip - they do n't like that
