tony abbott may have thrilled players at an australian rules function by skolling a beer but he âs drawn the ire of anti-drinking campaigners who claim he âs glorifying binge drinking and associating being a man with drinking booze
julie robert , a cultural studies professor at the university of technology sydney , said it was ' problematic ' that the prime minister , who she believes should be advocating against binge drinking , thought it acceptable to ' showcase his masculinity ' by skolling a beer
â it sets up a culture that drinking is nât about socialising with friends , it âs about how quickly and how much you can drink , â she said
it took the prime minister about six seconds to down the schooner as players cheered and chanted ' skol ' and ' tony '
critics said he should be setting an example that you do n't have to drink heavily to be a ' true blue australian bloke ' it appeared to take the prime minister about six seconds to down the schooner , as players cheered and chanted ' skol ' and ' tony ' health minister ley was quick to jump to mr tony abbott 's defence saying there was ' nothing wrong ' with the prime minister 's antics
' while mr tony abbott is not the first australian prime minister to show off his skolling skills , with former labor prime minister bob hawke a notable example , dr roberts said he should have taken into consideration recent shifts in attitudes over heavy drinking
mr tony abbott was asked to have a drink by university of technology sydney bats coach simon carradous , and the prime minister happily obliged ' he drank the entire schooner , dribbling bits on his shirt ... he was proud as punch , ' a witness said
