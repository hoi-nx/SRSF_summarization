another day , another baton change , another away defeat for middlesbrough
karanka would surely have made his defenders walk home from watford were it not for the probability they âd spend most of the journey travelling in circles
this was that kind of game , a top - of - the - table occasion when middlesbrough needed to deliver but ultimately failed on every scale â they did not create , they did not contain
what a cruel time for the championship âs best defence to explode at the seams

the championship lead which middlesbrough held at the start of play has now changed hands 16 times , with watford back in prominence and karanka sounding like a man searching for a positive note

â true enough , but the reality is middlesbrough have a chance to turn a good season into multi-million pound jackpot
they were woeful in falling at bournemouth last month and have now lost four of their past five away games

what a luxury to have two strikers as effective as troy deeney and odion ighalo
