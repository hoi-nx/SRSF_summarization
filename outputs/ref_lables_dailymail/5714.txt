not only does bale definitely want to stay at real beyond the end of this season but he is determined to win over some of the hardest to please supporters in football and become the best player in the world
bale is adamant that he wants to stay at real despite strong interest from united bale has scored 17 goals for real this season but has still bee criticised by supporters bale holds off the challenge of atletico forward raul garcia during champions league quarter - final he said last week : ' he had a fantastic season last year and he is having a very good season this time
real have also privately declared their interest in making david de gea the long - term successor to iker casillas , just as he is expected to be in the spain side
bale is out of real 's champions league quarter - final second leg against atletico on wednesday the wales international injured his calf during saturday 's 3 - 1 win against malaga after just two minutes the possibility of a bale - plus - cash move for de gea this summer would certainly suit united and please those real supporters who fail to see the value of bale and those goals that won the club three trophies last year , but the player remains adamant that his future is in real
in nearly all transfer wrangles the player gets what he wants over and above the desires of the clubs involved and it seems highly unlikely that he will be wearing anything other than a white shirt next season such is his desire to ride out the storm in real
bale enjoyed a standout first season in real and won the champions league and the copa del rey the former tottenham star scored a decisive goal in extra-time during the champions league final last season he wants to emulate ronaldo , who also had to change the minds of the disgruntled masses , and to eventually follow in his ballon d'or footsteps
in the spanish capital , while no one expects him to leave this summer , nobody sees bale 's desire to stay put as something that would necessarily prevent de gea from arriving at the santiago bernabeu at the end of the season to become his team - mate
carlo ancelotti said recently that if the club acquired a better goalkeeper than iker casillas then the spain international would lose his place and de gea is the man most supporters and the club directors identify as the one keeper who would justify the coach leaving out the legend
real would like to sign united goalkeeper to be long - term successor to iker casillas de gea punches clear under a challenge from john terry during saturday 's defeat by chelsea de gea 's girlfriend continues to live in real and her recent unflattering comments about manchester did little to quell rumours that family pressures are being applied on the keeper to return to spain
de gea spent one season in the atletico first team before joining united in 2011 for Â£ 18million all that points to the possibility of a return to real where he previously represented atletico but left after only one season in the first team
bale 's desire to stay in spain will keep him at real
