alleged kidnapper : kong xiong , 21 , of st. paul , minnesota has been arrested after he allegedly tried to force his 15 - year - old girlfriend to be his traditional hmong bride xiong and his parents say they wanted the girl and xiong to marry in the hmong tradition
the girl , who has not been identified because she is a minor , told police that xiong was her ' boyfriend ' and that they got into a physical argument over the prospect of marriage on saturday night
xiong allegedly threw the girl 's ipad against a wall at her family 's home and then ripped her sweatpants as he dragged her into his car
in 2009 xiong was tried in juvenile court or sexually assaulting a 13 - year - old girl when he was 15
ramsey county attorney john choi said about the case , ' this is a very disturbing case involving the victimization of a 15 - year - old girl that can not be tolerated in our community
in traditional hmong marriages the man generally asks permission from the girl 's family to wed her
if that method fails , there is a tradition of ' bride - napping ' in hmong culture in which the man may literally drag his bride to his house when her parents are not home
