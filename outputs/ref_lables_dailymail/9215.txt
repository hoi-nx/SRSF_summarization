ronny deila bemoaned the refereeing blunder which cost ten - man celtic side a crack at a rare domestic treble
virgil van dijk 's sublime 16th free - kick gave the parkhead side a dream start to their scottish cup semi-final clash with inverness
but the parkhead side were denied a clear penalty and the chance to go 2 - 0 ahead before half - time when additional assistant muir failed to spot a goalline handball from josh meekings
ronny deila was angry at the referee 's decision to now send off josh meekings and award his side a penalty celtic 's anger was further fuelled when steven mclean - rightly - sent off parkhead keeper craig gordon for clattering into marley watkins in 53 minutes , greg tansey equalising from the spot
a man down for 67 minutes the scottish champions wilted in extra-time , succumbing to goals from edward ofore and david raven , despite john guidetti making it 2 - 2
in measured tones , ronny deila chose his reaction to the penalty furore carefully saying : ' i do n't think i have to say much about that
' i think everybody can see what 's happening
the inverness defender ( 6 ) handled leigh griffiths goal - bound header but none of the officials saw it ' when they played with 11 v 11 we had good control of the game and produced good chances and enough to win the game
' pinning the blame for the incident on the unsighted additional assistant muir rather than referee maclean the norwegian added : ' we have five referees , maybe we need seven â i do n't know
the celtic boss remonstrated with steven mclean at half - time and was angry at the poor decision ' he has one task
inverness ' players celebrate at the final whistle after reaching the scottish cup final after extra time ' i think we fought very hard
' the josh meekings incident , the latest in a wretched season for scottish referees , will reopen the debate surrounding television replays
' this will not help anything today , ' said ronny deila , dismissing the idea
virgil van dijk ( left ) had given celtic the lead and put his side in control before all the incidents kicked off ' we did n't do it and put ourselves in very sad situation
' but inverness are a good football team
' insisting he had no issues over the red card for craig gordon which forced him to remove the dangerous james forrest and put lukasz zaluska in goals ronny deila vowed to lift his shatteted players for wednesday 's trip to dundee on league business
craig gordon ( left ) was rightly sent off by the referee for fouling marley watkins when he went through ' the league title is still the most important thing
