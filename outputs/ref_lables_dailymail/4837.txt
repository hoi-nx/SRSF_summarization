' nelms penned a moving essay celebrating his wife and everything she does for their family as a stay - at - home mother to their two - year - old son ezra ' on the contrary , i mean that i quite literally can not afford my wife to be staying at home
' nelms told the independent journal review that his wife , glorianna , stays at home with the couple 's two - year - old son ezra because of high child care costs
but nelms said working has always been a part of gloriana 's life , who had been employed since she was 14 and was contributing to her family 's income when she was 17
so nelms , from plano , texas , decided to write an essay , which was posted on we are glory , in which he would break - down the monetary value of everything his wife does to care for the family
in the essay nelms says he ' ca n't afford ' his wife to be a stay - at - home mother , and then breaks down the monetary value of all that she provides
' i would have to make over $ 100k to even begin to be able to cover my living expenses as well as employ my wife as a stay-at-home mom ! ' he writes nelms said that he felt ' ashamed ' for every time his wife felt she did n't have ' as much right to our income as i do ' and that his income ' does n't even come close to covering what she does for our family ' nelms estimates that the childcare his wife provides is worth $ 36,660 a year , the annual - salary for a full - time nanny
after adding that his wife helps deal with the family 's finances and does the laundry , he concludes that his wife 's annual salary should be $ 73,960
