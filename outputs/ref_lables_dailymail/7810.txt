dental kits which allow people to carry out their own fillings and repair caps and crowns at home are on the rise as patients say they ca n't afford a visit to the dentist
the kits , which can cost as little as Â£ 5 or even be bought in pound shops , are intended to provide a temporary solution for lost fillings or broken caps and crowns
however , more and more people are said to be buying the kits to carry out their own dental work as the price of receiving filling by a nhs dentist in england is as much as Â£ 52
more and more people suffering from dental problems are turning to diy dentistry kits due to the price of nhs dental treatment ( picture posed by model ) according to the guardian , one of the biggest sellers of first aid dental kits is dentek , who sell around 250,000 products a year , although there is no research on how they are used
and although department for health figures show that more people than ever are receiving dental treatment on the nhs , experts are pointing to anecdotal evidence , which suggests that diy dentistry is on the rise
which is why you have a situation where people in the north - east have gaps in their teeth and are resorting to diy dentistry
the rise of the diy kits come as british dental health foundation revealed last year that one in five people admitted they would carry out diy dentistry , including pulling out their own teeth , because they ca n't afford to go to the dentist
