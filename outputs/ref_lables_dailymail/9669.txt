city are confident uefa âs punishment for breaching financial fairplay regulations will be lifted this summer which would allow them to bid for stellar names like sterling , gareth bale , kevin de bruyne and ross barkley
city boss pellegrini has been hampered over the past year by uefa restricting them to a net transfer spend of Â£ 49million in each window and keeping the club âs overall wage bill to its current level of Â£ 205million - a - year
uefa âs settlement with city published in may stated those penalties would remain in place until the end of the 2015/16 season but the club âs latest financial figures showed drastically - reduced losses of Â£ 23million which they feel proves they are now compliant with fpp regulations
pellegrini is hoping that the financial restrictions imposed by uefa for a breach of financial fair play rules will be lifted at the end of this season city have been limited to a net spend of Â£ 49million in the last two transfer windows - they spent Â£ 25m bringing wilfried bony in from swansea in january ahead of monday night âs trip to crystal palace , pellegrini was certainly talking like a man excited at the prospect of signing ' crack ' players this summer
â manchester united , barcelona , liverpool and arsenal have all paid more in transfer fees in the past 12 months than city who were traditionally uefa âs biggest spenders after the club was taken over by abu dhabi owners in 2008
uefa also ordered city to play with a reduced squad from 25 players to 21 in the champions league this season and while that restriction has now ended , any time reduction in the penalties on spending and wages is more controversial
arsenal have paid more in transfer fees than city in the last 12 months , including Â£ 30m on alexis sanchez the document published last may by uefa âs club financial control body investigative chamber explicitly said city âs financial penalties would run for two seasons at least and there has been no official deviation from that decision
the published statement said at the time : â city agrees to significantly limit spending in the transfer market for the seasons 2014/15 and 2015/16
it means city will have to argue their case with uefa that as they have been financially compliant over the past year , they deserve to be free of restrictions moving forward
city have been heavily linked with a move for former chelsea midfielder kevin de bruyne the club also want to be involved in any race for liverpool contract rebel sterling they have been strongly linked with former chelsea winger kevin de bruyne who has been one of the best players in the bundesliga with wolfsburg
â since the transfer penalties were introduced , city have spent Â£ 91million on players in the last two windows ( net spend Â£ 68million )
