the skylines of the world , an african desert and even the barren landscape of the arctic have been reimagined as part of an annual skyscraper competition
more than 480 design teams submitted entries to evolo magazine 's 2015 contest and a jury of experts chose three winners and awarded 15 other designs with honorable mentions from 480 global entries
the first place was awarded to a polish group called bomp for its ' natural habitat ' essence skyscraper , beating the designs for a giant ' times squared 3015 ' concept at the heart of times square , a bio-pyramid in the sahara desert and cybertopia - a project that blurs the lines between digital and physical worlds
the skyscraper competition was established in 2006 to recognise ' outstanding ideas for vertical living '
the first place in this year 's contest was awarded to a team of polish designers for its project essence skyscraper ( shown )
the main body of the building is divided into 11 natural landscapes including open floor plans , water floors , fish tanks lifted up to 98 feet ( 30 metres ) above ground , and jungle areas the evolo magazine awards were established in 2006 to recognise ' outstanding ideas for vertical living '
since then , the publication has received more than 6,000 projects that use technology , materials , designs and space in novel and challenging ways to question how ' we understand vertical architecture and its relationship with the natural and built environments
' evolo said the winners were selected for their ' creativity , ingenuity , and understanding of dynamic and adaptive vertical communities
' the first place this year was awarded to bomp - a team comprising of designers ewa odyjas , agnieszka morga , konrad basan , and jakub pudo - from polish for the project essence skyscraper

the designers said their design ' would serve as a place to briefly escape urban life and stimulate diverse and complex experiences
third place was awarded to egor orlov from russian for his project cybertopia which reimagines the city of the future as the combination of digital and physical worlds - ' a city that grows and morphs instantly according to its residents needs
' our design transforms the original rigs into vertical bio-habitats , which aims to exert instant response to oil spills , restore damaged eco-systems and offer shelter from future disasters , ' the team said the 15 honorable mentions include skyscrapers designed for the arctic , structures that intend to reverse desertification , abandoned oil rigs transformed into bio-habitats , and atmosphere laboratories among others
the third place was awarded to egor orlov from russian for ' cybertopia '
it reimagines the city of the future as the combination of digital and physical worlds - ' a city that grows and morphs instantly according to its residents needs ' these include the bio-pyramid : reversing desertification , created by david sepulveda , wagdy moussa , ishaan kumar , wesley townsend , colin joyce , arianna armelli and salvador juarez from the us
this project aims to build a skyscraper for people who return to chernobyl and is fitted with air and water purification systems

' it is necessary to create working and living areas for the northern sea route transport infrastructure , ' said russian designers nikolay zaytsev and elizaveta lopatina the designers of the exploring arctic : multifunctional complex in dikson harbour ( pictured ) continued : ' the initial idea is to design a separate anthropogenic microcosm , detached from the harsh arctic environment , but based on the dynamic equilibrium between people and nature ' the giant ' times squared 3015 ' concept would be built inside a huge vertical tower at the heart of times square and would measure 5,687ft tall ( 1,733 metres )
the group said that as the planet continues to overpopulate , their entry explores spatial , environmental and experimental possibilities of vertical living
the ' times squared 3015 ' concept would be built inside a huge tower in times square , would measure 5,687ft tall ( 1,733 metres ) and was designed by blake freitas , grace chen and alexi kararavokris concept design drawings ( pictured left and right ) show the massive skyscraper would contain a beach , stadium , farm and residential apartments
