the new craze is popular among teens desperate to emulate kylie jenner 's bee - stung pout ( pictured ) the reportedly painful method involves participants placing their mouth over the opening of a cup , jar or shot glass and sucking in until the air vacuum causes their lips to swell up countless teens , both boys and girls , have been sharing the disturbing results of their experiments on twitter and instagram surprisingly , given the sheer number of teens attempting the feat , it appears the results are far from desirable the method works by way of the airlock created in the opening of the glass or jar , which increases blood flow to the lips and causes them to swell
the method works by way of the airlock created in the opening of the glass or jar , which increases blood flow to the lips and causes them to swell problematically , the results are said to last for hours , even days , with several people complaining that they were stuck with the after - effects for much longer than expected last month , two icelandic sisters attempted the trick by sucking into a hairspray lid , and warned others against it after the stunt went disastrously wrong
' one boy expertly demonstrates just how extreme the effects can be if you try hard enough sore - looking red marks are visible around the lip line of this dejected experimenter as for kylie jenner herself , the 17 - year - old kardashian clan member has recently denied artificially enhancing her lips , despite much speculation to the contrary
people flashback to pictures of me when i was 12 and say " kylie jenner 's so different " but how can i look the same from 12 -18 ? ' kylie jenner has reacted to the challenge by taking to twitter to say : ' i 'm not here to try & encourage people / young girls to look like me or to think this is the way they should look
' plenty of twitter users have been quick to ridicule the craze , labelling it ' dumb ' and ' gross ' ' i screwed up , ' wrote one teenage girl along with her # kyliejennerchallenge selfie , while another complained she looked ' gross ' we can only hope this particular trend dies out as fast as it gained steam
