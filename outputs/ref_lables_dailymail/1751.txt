there were black worms along four meters of the edge , where uncle abdo was able to put in food for biso
' uncle abdo , who named the cat , said biso would regularly hide from bigger cats in the hole , but one day , squeezed inside and was not able to come out again
he added that workers had tried to rescue the cat years ago , but a scared biso had stayed behind the wall
and after dina zulfikar , an animal rights worker , filed a report at the cairo police station march 13 , officers arrived at the metro station
