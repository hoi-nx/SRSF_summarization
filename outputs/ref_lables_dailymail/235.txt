there 's something about a city on a beach
if you ca n't wangle living there full - time , then barcelona must surely be a top contender for the best city break destination
an overview of barcelona , the city of contrasting art and architecture with a handy beach alongside it one moment visitors are marvelling at such landmarks as gaudi 's unfinished sagrada familia church ... ... the next locals and tourists alike are strolling to the beach for an after swim or game of volleyball first of all , there 's the jaw dropping architecture
no other city in the world has as many buildings on the unesco world heritage list as barcelona , from rome walls to the fantastical creations of gaudi
finally , after a number of false starts , andrea catherwood got to stay at the iconic hotel arts there 's enough art and culture to keep you busy for a decade of weekend breaks , plus cracking food , colourful markets and plenty of places to party all night long
we stayed at the hotel arts , a modern masterpiece of the city
it 's a glittering 44 - storey skyscraper of glass and steel , towering over the beaches and port olimpic as well as the nearby old fishermen 's quarter of barceloneta , where a warren of narrow streets are festooned with laundry from apartments above the tiny tapas bars
at the foot of the hotel is frank 's huge futuristic sculpture of a golden fish , el peix d'or , installed to mark the 1992 olympics
i 've wanted to stay at the hotel arts since i read about it in tatler in 1997 , when it won its best hotel in the world award , but i 've had a few false starts along the way
in 2012 , i tried to book a stay there during chelsea 's clash with barcelona in the semi-final of the champions league , but there must have been an ' oligarchs - only ' policy because it was fully booked
just last year , i was chairing a conference in the city , where we had a reception on the hotel 's terraces
andrea catherwood calls hotel arts as a modern masterpiece , a glittering 44 - storey skyscraper of glass and steel the footpath for walkers and joggers along barceloneta beach with hotel arts and mapfre tower behind now , finally , i was here , unencumbered by work , football fans or hen weekends , with no more baggage than a weekend case
one building our writer is always drawn to , among the stunning buildings of barcelona , is gaudi 's casa batllo so it was not until the following morning that we could appreciate the views from our room - from one window we could see port olimpic and the shining mediterranean , from another we could make out gaudi 's unfinished church , the sagrada familia
of all the stunning buildings , the one i 'm drawn to every time is gaudi 's casa batllo , a building of curves and flowing lines covered in tiny mosaic and wrought iron balconies
the two michelin - starred enoteca is the flagship restaurant of hotel arts - it 's stunning but not stuffy my out and out favourite was mont bar
the two michelin - starred enoteca is the flagship restaurant - it 's stunning but not stuffy , and you fully expect penelope cruz to be dining with pedro almodovar at the next table ( hotel arts is where she and many hollywood a-listers stay )
perhaps fittingly , given enoteca 's superstar status , we were served miraval rosã© from brad pitt and angelina jolie 's estate in provence
it 's a great city to get lost in and some of the best sights are n't in the tourist guides
