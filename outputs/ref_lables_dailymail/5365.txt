as ibrahimovic famously believes the world cup is ' nothing to watch ' without him , he 's unlikely to be quaking in his boots about facing messi in the nou camp on tuesday night
for most people , barcelona 's progress into the champions league semi-final looks a formality given they beat psg 3 - 1 in the first leg in french
the only man bound to disagree is the one who modestly called his autobiography ' i am ibrahimovic '
ibrahimovic is put through his paces with blaise matuidi ( left ) and zoumana camara at the nou camp ibrahimovic and his psg team - mates , including david luiz , pictured , face barcelona on tuesday night the sweden international was suspended for the first leg after he was dismissed against chelsea at 33 , ibrahimovic is past caring what other people think of him
the swede with bosnian roots has played for ajax , juventus , barcelona and both inter milan giants
they agreed to pay him Â£ 200,000 - a - week , even though french 's 75 per cent top tax rate meant their total bill would be close to Â£ 50million a year
he recently called french a 's * * t country ' and had to apologise in a rare burst of self - awareness
ibrahimovic has never won the trophy as a player , and his bad luck in the competition continued when he was harshly sent off in the previous round against chelsea and was therefore suspended for the first leg against barcelona
ibrahimovic is psg 's main attraction and will take centre stage against his old club barcelona on tuesday the former barcelona striker jumps for joy after scoirng against bastia in the french league cup final ibrahimovic , pictured celebrating with marquinhos , will be convinced that psg can progress against barcelona for paris to pull off one of european football 's greatest comebacks , ibrahimovic and marco verratti will have to excel
against barcelona , ibrahimovic will have special motivation
ibrahimovic spent just one season at the nou camp before moving to serie a giants inter milan he felt messi 's insistence on playing more centrally inhibited his own game and that coach guardiola was n't strong enough to devise a system that could incorporate both of them
ibrahimovic made his point by scoring for paris in barcelona in a group game earlier this season
