arsene wenger wants cesc fabregas to be shown the â respect he deserves â when he returns to the emirates in the blue of chelsea on sunday
cesc fabregas returns to arsenal on sunday and arsene wenger hopes fans will give him a good reception arsene wenger wants ' respect ' for the club 's former players and counts cesc fabregas as a man who deserves that gunners fans offer their good luck to cesc fabregas in 2011 , but the reception is likely to be more frosty this time extreme , perhaps , but this is an emotive issue which continues to bubble away at the club where cesc fabregas built his career , not least because the circumstances behind his summer move from barcelona to chelsea are still as clear as mud
arsene wenger was at his cryptic best on thursday when asked if it was his call to not take up an option he had to re-sign the player , saying : â we will have to discuss that one day
â at that point it was suggested to arsene wenger that cesc fabregas chose not to come back and arsene wenger said : â i do nât know , i do nât know
â the frenchman has previously claimed that by the time he knew cesc fabregas was available , a deal with chelsea was virtually concluded â comments which jarred a little with the spaniard âs statement last summer that arsenal â decided not to take â their option
whatever , it would be ambitious for cesc fabregas to expect an overwhelmingly positive reception on sunday
the midfielder set up diego costa to seal a 2 - 0 victory for chelsea against arsenal earlier this season certainly , there was already a degree of disappointment within the club about how their relationship with the player ended when he left in 2011
but arsene wenger said : â i want every player to be respected , and cesc fabregas when he comes to the emirates on sunday , ( i want him ) to be respected like he deserves
this club and myself had a very positive influence on cesc fabregas âs life , so i would be a bit uncomfortable to have to justify today why he is not here

â with seven straight league wins , arsenal approach the fixture at speed , but arsene wenger accepts it is unlikely chelsea will lose a 10 - point advantage on the run - in
