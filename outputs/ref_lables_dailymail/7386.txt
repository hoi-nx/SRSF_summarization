arsenal goalkeeper szczesny admits he feels sorry for federici , insisting the reading stopper was ' the best player on the pitch ' despite his costly error in saturday 's fa cup semi-final
federici allowed alexis sanchez 's driven shot to slip through his body in extra-time as arsenal ran out 2 - 1 winners at wembley to reach their second consecutive final , having beaten hull to lift the trophy last year
the mistake overshadowed a number of strong saves federici had made to keep his side in the game and szczesny had only kind words for his opposite number

it only went to extra-time because the goalkeeper was magnificent , ' szczesny told arsenal 's official website
the australian let an alexis sanchez effort slip through his hands and sneak over the line in extra-time ' it was a really good performance from him and he 's shown what a good keeper he is
' arsenal looked like they might enjoy a comfortable afternoon when alexis sanchez opened the scoring in the first half , but garath mccleary 's equaliser galvanised the championship outfit
szczesny was also at fault for the reading goal when he let gareth mccleary 's shot find a way into the net victory would also see the gunners become the most successful fa cup team of all time as they currently sit level on 11 titles with manchester united
