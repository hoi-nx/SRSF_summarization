sisters morgan , 21 , and sheree , 25 , allowed their bank accounts to be used to accept stolen money two sisters who allowed their bank accounts to be used in a ' vile ' plot to con an elderly couple out of their Â£ 36,000 life savings have avoided jail
sheree morgan , 25 , and younger sister morgan , 21 , both of nelson , lancashire , agreed to let their bank accounts be used to accept thousands of pounds in stolen money after the victims were conned out of over Â£ 36,000 over the telephone by a fraudster posing as a policeman
the couple , a man aged 86 , and his 84 - year old wife from cardiff in south wales , were contacted by a man pretending to be a metropolitan police detective sergeant falsely claiming they were about to fall victim to an eastern european crime gang who had got hold of their bank account details
he urged the elderly couple they needed to transfer their money into various accounts ' for their own security
' the caller even pretended he knew of a list of previous transactions the elderly couple had made , initially rattling off eight incorrect withdrawals before correctly guessing a Â£ 50 shopping bill at asda
consequently the couple were persuaded to go to their local leeds building society and make transfers from their account and makes others from their hsbc savings totalling Â£ 36,140 to other accounts
the elderly couple tried to get their money back when they realised they had been duped but their plea was refused after the banks said staff had acted ' without negligence and acted upon instruction
' sheree claimed she was approached by a friend from school who asked her if she wanted to make some money
' morgan ( pictured left ) and her sister sheree ( right ) with her ex-boyfriend daniel webster officers who investigated the scam discovered the morgan sisters allowed Â£ 17,500 to be put into their bank accounts after the con
sheree also recruited ex-boyfriend daniel webster , 23 , and her mother justine davies , 44 , to use their accounts for the illicit transfers

the elderly couple were advised to go into their local bank branch and transfer their funds into the accounts - but if queried were to tell staff that it was for ' home improvements ' after being made to believe that the fraud was to do with an insider at the bank
justine davies , the mother of sheree and morgan - she has been handed a one year community order ' she described him as extremely well spoken and seemed to know what he was talking about
' mother of two sheree received Â£ 5,000 in her account on january 17 2014 and withdrew the money straight away
she later introduced her sister to the friend and a few days later Â£ 4,800 was transferred into morgan 's account
the following day morgan withdrew Â£ 3,000 of cash and spent Â£ 1,490 on travellers cheques and was paid Â£ 200 for allowing the transfer
sisters morgan ( left ) and sheree morgan ( right ) have avoided jail despite pleading guilty to money laundering he said he was aware of what his ex-girlfriend had done and it was agreed he would be paid approximately Â£ 1,000
in mitigation kevin donnelly said sheree - who is due to start a sociology and criminology course at burnley college - had been ' unaware of the unpleasant and cynical targeting of the elderly couple '
for morgan , simon gurney said : ' she dealt with the smallest sum of money , Â£ 4,800 in a single transaction put into her account
judge andrew woolman said : ' the couple were clearly elderly and confused and found this fraudster persuasive and on the direction of the fraudster had large sums of money transferred - not into his account but he used you in order , no doubt , to ensure there was no evidence against him , having committed this offence
