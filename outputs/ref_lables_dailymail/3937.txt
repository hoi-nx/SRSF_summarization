last week , oil & gas investments ( ukog ) boasted it had discovered a â world class potential resource â beneath the home counties
the oil exploration company claimed analysis of a well near gatwick airport suggested 100 billion barrels of oil lay beneath the weald basin , covering surrey , sussex , hampshire and kent
uk oil & gas investments has backtracked on its claims the uk could be sitting on an oil reserve larger than what has been extracted from the north sea and kuwait
ukog and a consortium of other oil firms hold a licence for just 55 square miles in surrey and sussex , a tiny fraction of the weald basin
but after finding oil in the area , it scaled up its findings across the whole 1,100 - square mile sussex weald area
the company has now admitted that its estimates were based on findings made in a 55 - square - mile stretch of the basin , less than two per cent of the total surface area a map showing the location of the oil and gas deposits within the weald basin , which are thought to lie at between 2,500ft and 3,000ft below the ground it claimed the entire region was rich with the fossil fuel , sparking hopes it had uncovered â uk âs dallas â
lenigas has been criticised on the past for exaggerating his companies ' successes to drive up share prices even then , it seems unlikely it could estimate how much lies beneath the whole region , adding : â the company has not undertaken work outside its licence areas sufficient to comment on the possible oip ( oil in place ) in either the approximate 1,100 square miles or the whole of the weald basin
â following the announcement of a â significant â discovery on april 8 , ukog âs share price soared from about 1p to over 4p the next day
