janner signed a letter saying he wanted to remain a peer just a week before he was ruled unfit to face child sex charges
abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the lords if he was too frail to be brought before court
the cps has faced widespread criticism since announcing last week that janner would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has alzheimer âs disease
but now it has emerged that the peer was apparently well enough to sign his name in an april 9 note to lords authorities
he has not attended the lords since detectives raided his north london home in december 2013
but janner requested an extension of his leave of absence instead of offering to stand down in the letter sent to a senior lords official 12 days ago
a lords spokesman confirmed the alleged paedophile signed the note himself , but could not confirm whether the handwriting below the signature was his
simon danczuk , the labour politician who exposed the late liberal mp cyril smith âs horrific abuse of boys , said it was not right for janner to stay in the lords yet avoid court
â if he has got a leave of absence from the lords , that implies that he may get well
he is bringing the lords into disrepute almost single - handedly
â the cps faced widespread criticism after announcing that janner ( pictured ) would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has alzheimer âs disease pete saunders , chief executive of the national association for people abused in childhood , added : â he could nât have signed this letter if he was non compos mentis
he was suspended by labour after the cps ruled last thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988
â director of public prosecutions dpp said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the janner 's qc son prosecutors were forced to defend a senior legal adviser yesterday over fears of a conflict of interest in the janner case
last week it was revealed she over-ruled an expert in child abuse cases by deciding not to charge janner
