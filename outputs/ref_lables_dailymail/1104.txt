nasa has unveiled a revolutionary type of wing that it says could save millions in air travel
the wing is able to morph itself like that of a bird to provide the same functionality as normal flaps , but with much less weight
it can also reportedly be used to increase fuel efficiency and even reduce noise on take - off and landing
the wing can bend from -2 degrees up to 30 degrees
it means that regular flaps are n't needed - and it is much lighter

the wing is able to â bend â through angles from -2 degrees up to 30 degrees
the breakthrough could also increase fuel efficiency up to 12 per cent , and reduce noise at take - off and landing up to 40 per cent

â this is the first of eight large - scale integrated technology demonstrations era is finishing up this year that are designed to reduce the impact of aviation on the environment
