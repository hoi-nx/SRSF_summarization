two states at the center of gay rights protests over laws designed to ' uphold religious freedom ' engaged in hurried climbdowns yesterday , with both approving alterations to legislation that critics said legalized discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation
' now that this is behind us , let 's move forward together with a renewed commitment to the civility and respect that make this state great , ' indiana governor pence said after signing his state 's amended measure
the arkansas legislature also passed changes to its legislation at the behest of the state 's asa hutchinson governor asa hutchinson , who rejected a previous version of the bill at the last minute on wednesday following public uproar and a personal plea from his son
asa hutchinson signed the new legislation last night
lawmakers in arkansas and indiana hoped that by amending their states ' measures they would quiet the national uproar over new religious objections that opponents say are designed to offer a legal defense for anti-gay discrimination ' now that this is behind us , let 's move forward together with a renewed commitment to the civility and respect that make this state great , ' indiana governor pence said after signing his state 's amended measure thursday evening indiana house speaker bosma speaks at a press conference announcing changes to the state 's religious freedom law as senate president pro tem david long , left , looks on
the republican leaders on thursday added anti-discrimination safeguards to the controversial religious freedom restoration act ' i think it âs sending the right signal , the way this has been resolved , to the world and the country that arkansas understands the diversity of our culture and workforce but also the importance of balancing that with our sincerely held religious convictions , ' asa hutchinson said
the two , republican - controlled states were in a frenzy this week to quell national outrage over legislation meant to satisfy evangelicals who do not believe they should be compelled by the government to provide goods and services to certain customers if doing so would violate their religious convictions
republican leaders in the indiana conceded this week to critics arguing that their state 's law , signed into effect by governor pence a week ago today , inadvertently left room for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation
' it was never intended to discriminate against anyone , ' senate president pro tem david long said at a thursday morning at a press conference
arkansas governor asa hutchinson earlier that day said he wants the legislature to either recall the bill from his desk or pass a follow - up measure that would make the proposal more closely mirror a 1993 federal religious - freedom law in addition to the already protected classes of persons , the new language specifies that businesses , individuals and other providers can not refuse to do business with persons on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity
no one has the legal right to ' refuse to offer or provide ' goods , services , facilities or employment to anyone for those reasons , it says
after adamantly defending the state 's law in the national press , pence suddenly said tuesday that ' it would be helpful to move legislation this week that makes it clear that this law does not give businesses a right to deny services to anyone
' there will be some who think this legislation goes too far and some who think it does not go far enough , but as governor i must always put the interest of our state first and ask myself every day , ' what is best for indiana ? ' pence said in a statement
the altered bill would more closely mirror federal legislation the new version of arkansas ' law more closely mirrors federal legislation
the fixes passed the state 's senate wednesday night and its house thursday
' how do we as a state communicate to the world that we are respectful of a diverse workplace and we want to be known as a state that does not discriminate but understands tolerance ? ' he said during a press conference outside the state capitol
' a family - owned pizzeria in indiana that said it would n't cater same - sex weddings shut down until further notice on wednesday after the owners received threatening phone calls , and the establishment 's yelp page was flooded with bad reviews indiana , the first of the two states to pass the offending religious liberty legislation , saw a fierce backlash over the weekend and early this week that included thousands of protesters descending on the state capitol and a prominent local business cancelling a planned $ 40 million expansion of its headquarters after pence formally approved the religious freedom restoration act
asa hutchinson , who took office just two months ago , seeking to avoid an uprising of equal intensity in his own state , pushed legislators in arkansas to make adjustments to their bill before he put his name on it
