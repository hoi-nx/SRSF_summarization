toure 's attacking gifts are n't enough to make up for his defensive deficiencies anymore , said neville in a scathing attack on the ivorian following city 's 4 - 2 derby loss to manchester united
manuel pellegrini 's city were poor for all but the opening 15 minutes against louis van gaal 's side at old trafford and neville , speaking on sky sports , is certain big changes are afoot for the club
' it 's a crossroads for them now , ' neville said as city drifted four points behind their third - placed cross-city rivals who are now one point off arsenal in second
toure 's defensive lapses are costing city , claims sky sports pundit neville niall quinn and souness joined the chorus of criticism of the under - fire ivorian ' there is definitely going to be change at city , whether it 's players , the manager , people above
' there are some weeds in the garden and you 've got to get them out of the changing room pretty quick
' neville singled out toure as an example of the ' weeds ' at the etihad in a scathing attack
neville predicts changes at city and says the club need to get rid of ' weeds in the garden ' ' if i was a player in that dressing room looking at him in central midfield thinking you 're not chasing back , you 're not running around , you 're not sprinting for the ball
' souness , also on sky sports , even suggested the 31 - year - old 's work when his side does n't have the ball is a factor in their disappointing champions league results in recent years
neville accused toure of a ' complete dereliction of ( his ) duty ' when marking fellaini and blamed his lack of tracking back for manchester united 's third goal from juan mata
city players ' heads drop after conceding the fourth goal on sunday their their cross-city rivals ' he can not play in a two in midfield against an opposition of any quality , ' said neville on sky sports
' against maybe one of the lesser teams at home you can put him in there and play with two up top , but against any team of quality you 've got to shift him out of that position in the centre of midfield
as a central midfield player in the big matches he just can not do it
' souness said toure 's become ' a bit of a liability ' for city in the past two years , despite being instrumental to their premier league title win last season
' niall quinn , also on sky sports , said bluntly : ' city lost out today because he was all at sea and did n't do his defensive duties
' toure also came in for criticism on match of the day 2 for his lack of leadership after he took the captain 's armband at half - time
sinclair and phil neville were both critical of city and toure on match of the day 2 ' fellaini has completely outshone him today
' picking out on particular aerial duel , which toure lost , sinclair said : ' this is nothing to do with ability , that 's to do with desire and wanting to take one for the team
' sinclair also felt toure was at fault for chris smalling 's goal , manchester united 's fourth
