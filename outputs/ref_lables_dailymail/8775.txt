easter is over for the wild rabbits of greater sydney as councils and parks prepare another attempt to kill them off with strategically placed carrots that have been laced with a deadly virus
public land managers are desperate to reduce the most recent ' significantly rampant population ' of the pest , which causes millions of dollars of major agricultural and environmental damage each year
' this year , because of really high summer rainfall - which led to great food availability - there has been a big surge in the rabbit population in sydney
feral rabbits , which are deemed a pest in nsw , are liekly to br targeted with the calicivirus , also known as rhd ( rhd ) , in may it comes after over 30 government bodies scattered carrots laced with calicivirus around public areas in march ' the way we introduce the calicivirus in rabbit populations is first we chop regular carrots up and distribute them to different areas and see if they are going to eat them
' while rabbits under one year old have a higher chance of surviving , about 70 - 100 per cent of rabbits die once infected with the calicivirus , also known as rabbit haemorrhagic disease ( rhd ) , which damages the animal 's liver and gut and causes haemorrhaging and bleeding
about 30 public land managers and councils in sydney , across 160 localities , scattered the infected vegetable in public areas in march , but a second smaller scale program is likely to be implemented in may across 10 areas as well as the central coast
' it 's just because in some areas the numbers have shown the rabbit populations have n't gone down as much as we 'd like , ' mr wilson said
they breed quickly , producing up to five litters of five young each year , and can be found right across australia in various habitats ' it 's important that people who own pet rabbits vaccinate for calicivirus now to ensure that if their domestic rabbit comes in contact with the virus , which is mainly spread by contact between other rabbits and insects , they are immune
