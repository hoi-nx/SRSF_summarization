this week , colby had the tumour removed free - of - charge thanks to the us - based little baby face foundation ( little baby face foundation )
he said : ' when someone like cunningham can have free plastic surgery on the nhs and colby ca n't , it 's just out of order
' ms cunningham sparked outrage when she announced she 'd received a Â£ 4,800 boob job on the nhs
his mother said : ' if the growth had n't been removed properly , it could have resulted in him losing his eyesight

these growths are usually benign but can cause severe pain and can bleed or weep easily if disturbed colby was born with a condition known as haemangioma , a tumour , swelling or growth of the cells that line blood vessels - the endothelial cells
she said : ' he had a small , pink birthmark on the side of his eye and it was in the same shape as a love - heart
' i was n't really that concerned about it because a lot of children are born with them
' she said doctors in uk used a range of topical medications and pills - including propranolol - to try and reduce the swelling , but to no avail
the toddler 's parents say they were also been the victims of abuse and slurs over their son 's appearance , and feared for his chances of living a ' normal ' life his mother added : ' in english they seemed to be picking random numbers hoping it would make a difference , hoping it would shrink it , but it did n't make a difference
' we did n't really have much of an option except the wait - and - see approach , which we knew deep down really was n't the best thing for colby
' in february , a team led by paediatric facial plastic surgeon dr milton waner ( left ) went ahead with a three - hour operation to cut the tumour away at new york 's lenox hill hospital the operation , consultation fees , flights and accommodation would have set the couple back at least Â£ 10,000 without the help of the foundation desperate , and frustrated with the lack of options in the uk , they turned to the new york - based little baby face foundation ( little baby face foundation ) , contacting them by facebook
