vaughan has confirmed that he has held talks with the ecb over becoming england âs new supremo as the governing body âs new regime move closer to replacing paul downton
the 2005 ashes winning captain is the hot favourite on the three - man shortlist compiled by the ecb at thursday âs management board meeting ahead of andrew strauss and alec stewart , who have both registered their interest
vaughan spoke with new ecb chief executive tom harrison for an hour and has worked closely in the past with chairman - elect colin graves at yorkshire and looks set to be offered the job if he can reach agreement
vaughan has emerged as the favourite for the newly created role of director of england cricket vaughan spoke to the ecb about the role on thursday after emerging as the no 1 choice alec stewart , who is also in the frame , stands at the kia oval ahead of a surrey team photo shoot on thursday â i had a good chat with tom harrison which was just about general stuff , â said vaughan
i knew him from his img days and back in the day when he played for derbyshire but we had not met in person for a long time , â vaughan told the daily telegraph
â former england stars vaughan and alec stewart both work in the media as cricket analysts and commentators andrew strauss is another former england captain who is being considered for the role that may be so but the ecb are keen to make a quick appointment and vaughan looks certain to be the one they want to effectively become a football manager type figure with overall responsibility for coaching and selection
vaughan has also been a strong critic of peter moores in his second coming as coach in his various media roles and it is the amount of successful interests vaughan has that remain the biggest obstacles towards his appointment
â i am loving my job at the moment , â said vaughan
â it will be fascinating to watch vaughan commentate for bbc âs test match special on a team he may well soon be in charge of
england coach peter moores has said he could work with vaughan despite their uneasy relationship paul downton lost his job as the ecb 's managing director of cricket alec stewart ( age 52 ) current job : director of cricket at surrey
reason it might happen : alec stewart has added his name to the ring of potential candidates , and knows the job of director of cricket inside out
andrew strauss ( age 38 ) current job : sky commentator
show us your medals : captained england to home - and - away ashes triumphs
reason it might not : andrew strauss is still in the early days of his career as a commentator â and is enjoying it
players he likes : joe root is a particular favourite â he is next in line to replace alastair cook as test captain
