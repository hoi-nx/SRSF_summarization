sitting in a restaurant with friends , teresa james pushed food longingly around her plate , desperate to eat but unable to stand the pain it would cause
but teresa james âs agony was tempered with pride , because when she did manage to summon a smile , it was the most dazzling at her table
teresa james , 40 ( pictured ) , believes the discomfort involved with teeth whitening is worth it for the end result of a bright smile she had spent four hours earlier that afternoon bleaching her teeth and , as far as she was concerned , the considerable discomfort was worth it
â whitening has been unbearably painful at times , â says teresa james , 40
â but i am obsessive about having a bright smile
â teresa james âs regimen may sound somewhat masochistic , but she is one of an increasing number of women for whom whitening their teeth has become an integral part of their beauty routine â as normal as colouring their hair or waxing their legs
in america , sales of tooth whitening products have risen 300 per cent since 1996 , and the trend for excessive bleaching has grown so commonplace there that dentists have coined a new word for it â â bleachorexia â
almost a third of british are now preoccupied with whitening their teeth , and research this week revealed the highest - earning cosmetic dentists made a collective turnover of Â£ 1 billion last year â a 22 per cent increase from 2010
â tessa ( pictured ) is part of a growing group of women for whom teeth whitening has become an integral part of their beauty regime teresa james , a banking finance officer from london , started whitening her teeth five years ago , influenced by the brilliant smiles of celebrities she admired
â my own teeth looked grey in comparison after years of caffeinated drinks and they were affecting my confidence , â she says
in october 2012 , an eu council directive made it illegal in british to use hydrogen peroxide â which can cause sensitivity and burning when applied too often or at too high a dose â in concentrations above 6 per cent , and decreed any concentration over 0.1 per cent could be administered only by a dental professional
teresa james ( pictured ) started whitening her teeth five years ago having been influenced by the brilliant smiles of celebrities she admired usually , the first treatment is carried out at the surgery , then the patient is given syringes and the tray to use at home â 45 minutes a day , for a fortnight , being the norm
the treatment normally costs up to Â£ 500 , so when teresa james spotted a diy whitening kit online for Â£ 17.99 , she was tempted
it looked authentic enough : a silicone tray and five syringes of bleach
teresa james is nât sure how strong this hydrogen peroxide was , or indeed even if it was hydrogen peroxide
â lisa arbiter ( pictured ) has been bulk - buying high - strength bleach from america to whiten her teeth every month for the past 13 years sure enough , the minute teresa james put the tray on , her gums started to tingle
keen to go whiter than white , she kept the bleach on for an hour â another mistake , says dr druian
â but teresa james was so delighted with the initial results that she used her whitening kit once a week , leaving it on for longer each time
lisa arbiter ( pictured ) was just 19 when she first tried bleaching her teeth , she now says it 's addictive and she 'll carry on doing it for ever â my teeth were so weak and sensitive i worried they were going to fall out
â so teresa james invested in whitening toothpastes , a whitening powder and a whitening pen instead
ironically , the changes made to the law in 2012 , which were supposed to protect patients â dental health , have seen a flood of illegal diy whitening products on to the market , alongside unqualified practitioners who cater for those â like teresa james â who ca nât afford a dentist âs whitening service
lisa arbiter ( pictured ) buys Â£ 50 boxes of syringes of a 25 per cent solution from the america and insists she has no pain or side effects from the treatment â at a high concentration , this can burn gums , leading to receding , and make tooth enamel rough and porous , which leaves it prone to further staining â trapping users into a vicious cycle of whitening
unknown to natasha , aged 17 , she is a year under the legal age limit for teeth whitening , but the beautician did nât check
increasing numbers of women are ordering industrial - strength hydrogen - peroxide whitening products online from the america , where there are no legal limits on levels
donna ( pictured ) and her husband , andy , both started bleaching their teeth before they got married last october lisa arbiter , 33 , has been bulk - buying high - strength bleach from america to whiten her teeth every month for the past 13 years
she buys Â£ 50 boxes of syringes of a 25 per cent solution from the america , yet insists she has no side - effects other than sensitive teeth
although her husband stopped after their wedding , donna ( pictured ) has carried on and says its part of her beauty routine now but newlywed donna billson â a recent convert to tooth bleaching â is already hooked on doing it far more frequently than that
donna and her husband andy , 34 , started whitening their teeth last january in the run - up to their wedding last october
