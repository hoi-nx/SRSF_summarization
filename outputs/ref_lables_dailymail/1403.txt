the flag - burning father of a runaway britain jihadi schoolgirl yesterday admitted taking his daughter to an extremist rally when she was 13
hussen â who blamed police for failing to stop his daughter fleeing to join is earlier this year â conceded the teenager was â maybe â influenced by the rally organised by banned terror group al-muhajiroun
mr hussen told mps last month , after his daughter amira abase fled to syria aged 15 , that he could think of â nothing â to explain why she and two friends had decided to join is , as well as keeping quiet about his own links to radicalism
yesterday mr hussen , who went to this rally and another similar one with his daughter and wife fetia , conceded they might have influenced the youngster , who would have been 13 at the time
the rally was held against the treatment of ethiopia in saudi arabia after human rights violations , and mr hussen , 47 , who is from ethiopia , said : â we both lost many people back home , we wanted to try to get help for people back home , too many human rights violations there
soon after , in an extraordinary exchange at the home affairs select committee , mr hussen blamed the authorities for failing to stop his daughter running off to syria
asked by chairman keith vaz if amira had been exposed to any extremism , mr hussen replied : â not at all
â yesterday respected analyst shiraz maher , senior fellow at the international centre for the study of radicalisation at king âs college london , tweeted : â remember that amira abase âs father blamed the police for his daughter going to syria and effectively misled parliament with this nonsense
â mr hussen told the times yesterday that he felt ashamed to have been at the flag - burning rally
â mr hussen came to britain from germany in 1999 and said he came â for democracy , for the freedom , for a better life for children , so they could learn english â
mr hussen said he felt â terrible â to know he had been protesting with one of mr lee rigby âs killers and said : â it was brutal , it has nothing to do with islam , it is not human
