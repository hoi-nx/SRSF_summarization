whether it 's from a university or a new employer , we all know that horrible , deflated feeling that comes with getting a rejection letter
but 17 - year - old siobhan o'dell hit back after being sent a rejection letter from duke , by sending the admissions office a message of her own , rejecting their rejection
mirroring the standard format of college rejection letters , she added : ' despite duke 's outstanding success in rejecting previous applicants , you simply did not meet my qualifications
' therefore , i will be attending duke 's 2015 freshmen class
' speaking to mailonline about the letter , she said : ' they sent me a typical college rejection letter , " this year we had an outstanding pool of applicants ... " , blah , blah , blah
' miss siobhan o'dell 's letter has attracted nearly 100,000 likes and rebolgs since she posted it to her tumblr account , and will even feature in duke 's college newspaper since posting a copy of the letter to her tumblr account , the image has gone viral , attracting nearly 100,000 likes and reblogs since first being posted
' not sharing the joke : duke did respond to miss o'dell 's email , but clearly did n't share her sense of humour , instead telling her she could appeal their decision , but was unlikely to get it overturned while miss o'dell 's letter did n't earn her a place at duke , it seems to have got the attention of students on campus , and is even set to feature in the college newspaper
duke did eventually respond to her rejection letter , but did n't appear to share the joke , instead telling her that should could appeal their decision , but ' it 's very rare ' for the call to be overturned
