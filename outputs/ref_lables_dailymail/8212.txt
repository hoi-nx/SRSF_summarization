the area junior was trapped in was pressurized and temperature controlled , so his life was never threatened help me ! after his call to 911 cut out , junior started banging on the ceiling of the cargo hold and passengers and crew heard , prompting the flight to turn around turn around : the pilot headed back to seattle after just 14 minutes in the air
junior says he is sorry for the passengers whose flight to los angeles he delayed luckily that was never the case since the cargo hold where junior fell asleep is temperature controlled and pressurized , so he was never in danger of freezing or running out of oxygen
