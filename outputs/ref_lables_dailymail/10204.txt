a group of black attorneys have called for the second officer connected to the fatal shooting of south carolina father scott to be arrested
national bar association officials said that officer clarence habersham , 37 , who was the second policeman to arrive at the dead man 's body after shooter michael slager , should be fired and prosecuted for filing a false report
the call comes after michael slager , who has been fired from the north charleston police and charged with murder last week , is thought to have falsified reports on the circumstances that led to scott 's death
michael slager , 33 , who is white , said that he felt ' threatened ' by scott , who is black , during a confrontation over his taser , but video shows the civilian running away before being shot
clarence habersham , who approached the body after michael slager went to go grab the taser that fell , can be seen examining scott
michael slager then drops the taser next to the dead body in the presence of clarence habersham
clarence habersham then used his radio to report that scott had gunshot wounds to his chest , right side , and backside
however , the black officer gave a two - sentence supplemental report and said that he tried to render aid to the body , which no one in the video does
video released after michael slager 's account into the death shows scott ( left ) running away from the traffic stop when he is shot
mourners have placed flowers at a memorial to the veteran ( right ) over the past week michael slager said after the incident that he ' felt threatened ' by scott , though video shot by feidin santana contradicts his report officers in the video are seen walking around and checking the pulse of the body
the national bar association , the country 's oldest group of black lawyers , said that clarence habersham ' deliberately left material facts out of his report ' and left it ' incomplete '
the group said it was ' outraged ' by the incident and that any other officer of the seven that quickly arrived on the scene should be indicted if they filed a false report
police version police officer michael slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with scott began at around 9.30am on saturday
at that point , the officer fired at scott several times because he ' felt threatened , ' michael slager 's statement said
what the video shows michael slager 's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting scott in the back
the video shows michael slager handcuffing scott 's lifeless body
footage then appears to show michael slager jogging back to the point where the taser fell to the ground , bringing it over to scott 's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him
the service was also attended by a number of the state 's politcians scott , who was remembered as a beloved father , had his coffin draped in an american flag during saturday 's funeral ceremony
