a video showing a man cracking a giant egg to reveal another fully formed egg inside , may be enough to scramble your brain
youtube user elman511 cracked open the over-sized egg that was laid by one of his hens , exclaiming : â the big egg has another normal egg in it ! â while the instance is extremely rare , it âs caused when the hen is in the process of forming an egg in her oviduct and another oocyte â the ovum or egg cell that becomes the yolk of the egg â is released too soon
egg - citing : in the video , â elman511 â cracks the egg ( pictured ) , which is double the size of a normal one , to find a standard - sized egg inside , along with yolk and white
the unusual occurrence is down to a counter-peristalsis contraction this is when a second oocyte ( yolk ) is released by the hen 's ovary before the first egg has completely traveled through the oviduct and been laid
this means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte , which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell , creating a giant egg around the first one
