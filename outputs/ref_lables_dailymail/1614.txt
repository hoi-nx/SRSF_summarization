rodgers has launched an impassioned defence of his abilities , insisting there is nobody better equipped to manage liverpool under the fenway sports group model
it has been a difficult week for rodgers , with the meek manner of last sunday âs 2 - 1 defeat by aston villa in the fa cup semi-final ensuring his position has come under scrutiny like at no point during his three - year reign at the club
fenway sports group , liverpool âs owners , maintain rodgers â job is not even up for discussion but that has not stopped jurgen klopp â who will leave borussia dortmund at the end of the campaign â being mentioned as a possible successor
rodgers insists he is the man to guide liverpool to success despite a disappointing season the liverpool manager is under pressure following the fa cup semi-final defeat by aston villa last sunday but rodgers has been boosted by the news that jordan henderson ( left ) has committed his future to the club but rodgers has not been rattled by the intensity of the criticism nor is he dwelling on the disappointment
he is concentrating on building liverpool back up and wants the club to be ' really forceful ' when they embark on their summer recruitment drive
â after the weekend there is always emotion , â said rodgers , who will again be without sturridge at west brom and is ' unsure ' when he will return
when i sit down and look at it , i will hold myself up against anyone to manage this club and to fit the model of what they ( fenway sports group ) want
