his manager brendan rodgers said after his team âs defeat that gerrard had been excellent
gerrard was poor throughout , unable to shift the momentum of a liverpool performance that will rank as one of the great disappointments of the club âs recent years
if brendan rodgers had hoped for a display from gerrard that would fit the rather romantic narrative of him returning to wembley on his birthday then he was disappointed
gerrard âs efforts fitted not the occasion but instead a liverpool team showing that was low on energy , wit or strategy
