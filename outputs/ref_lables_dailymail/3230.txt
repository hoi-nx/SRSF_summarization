perhaps it will be forgetting where you put the car keys , or what you went to get from upstairs
imagine what it 's like being unable to recall what you 'd done an hour before
today , in the third part of our major good health series on dementia , we look at ways to help minimise the impact of these memory problems , to prolong independence and help those with dementia live as full a life as possible
during deep sleep , brain waves move memories from the hippocampus - the area of the brain that is involved in short - term memory - to the prefrontal cortex at the front of the brain , where long - term memories are stored
if this does n't happen , short - term memories get overwritten with new ones and the consequence is forgetfulness , according to researchers at the university of california , berkeley
it is a common misconception that we need less sleep as we get older - in fact we need just as much , the problem is that older people find it harder to reach a deeper sleep
getting a good night 's sleep can be especially difficult for those with dementia , especially those with alzheimer 's disease who may experience changes to their sleeping patterns
one of the most important measures is to avoid catnapping during the day ( this becomes harder to avoid as dementia becomes more advanced )
a regular bedtime is also important as this gives the body the cues it needs to feel sleepy at set times , making it easier to fall asleep
although many people believe a nightcap will help them sleep , alcohol is counter-productive and tends to make you wake in the night
regularly eating food high in fat and sugar leads to inflammation in the hippocampus eating too much junk food : cakes , chips and biscuits wo n't just impact on the waistline - they can adversely affect your memory , too
scientists at the university of new south wales , australia , found that eating these foods every day caused inflammation in the brain after just one week
it 's a tried - and - tested principle : for example , a review of 15 studies by the respected cochrane library looked at the benefits of a variety of activities designed to stimulate the brain and promote memory such as word games , puzzles , listening to music and practical activities such as baking and indoor gardening
the studies involved 718 participants with dementia - some took part in these activities and others did not
after between one and three months those who 'd taken part in the brain stimulating and practical activities did better on cognitive function tests than those who did not
tips to help with a failing memory a failing short - term memory is a characteristic of dementia and can make it difficult to cope with day - to - day life
the following strategies may help : one of the most important measures is to avoid catnapping during the day have set meal times , as these are easier to remember - and write them down on a whiteboard to help recall what time is meal time
the mediterranean type of diet may be most beneficial as it 's been shown to maintain the health of the blood vessels , and keeping a healthy circulation is key for people with dementia as it ensures a healthy flow of blood to the brain
try to include oily fish such as trout , salmon or mackerel three times a week : the latest research suggests this is a good way to stop brain shrinkage
these fish contain omega - 3 fatty acids and research has found that people with the highest level of these have less shrinkage in the hippocampus , the area associated with memory
to confirm a diagnosis of dementia or to access specialist services , a gp can refer a patient to a memory clinic
having a history of their life can help them remember and , as the condition progresses this book may also be useful to bring out to show them if they seem distressed
asking the person with dementia to reminisce and recall stories about the people or events shown in the pictures can also be a good way to ' use it '
