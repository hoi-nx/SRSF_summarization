i see bolt on the circuit and he âs always good fun
he likes to make jokes of me ! i remember in moscow , at the last world championships , when i was competing in the 200m when most people saw me as a 100m runner , he killed me in the warmup
â what are you doing ? â he asked me
â this is for the 200m runners â the 100m was a few days ago
gemili says bolt is a joker on the circuit and gives him great advice the young british athlete says he is nowhere near bolt 's standard at the moment but it could be his time soon gemili has announced his participation in the sainsbury 's anniversary games this summer it obviously worked , as i then ran sub- 20 and he was praising me a lot and saying great things about me
bolt gave me some great advice to really enjoy athletics and have fun with it
i like to think i always have a great time when i go to compete
i do nât think bolt will be too worried about me at the moment , he âs something special when he gets himself into shape and competing
bolt has been beaten before , which shows he is only human
in british and europe we have some great young names coming through that can go on and push the performances up
i âd like to think there is a chance for british sprinters to step into the void
there will be a nice little gap opening and it will encourage a lot of people to step up their performance ten british sprinters - including gemili ( centre ) got together for as stunning sportsmail photoshoot as well as funding the road to rio athletes , every week national lottery players raise over Â£ 33 million for arts , heritage , charity , community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities
