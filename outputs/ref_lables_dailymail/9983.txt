' around 40,000 people suffer from anorexia in france , the vast majority women and teenage girls
maud olivier and catherine coutelle , the mps who proposed the law , said in a joint statement that ' certain sites known as pro-ana can push people into a vicious circle of anorexia and authorities can not do anything about it
in march , mps in france rejected a proposal that would have seen ultra-slim models banned from the fashion runways
