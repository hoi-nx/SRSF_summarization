' it 's a real honour , a very proud moment for myself to lead the side out , â kane added
â at just 21 years and 251 days , the tottenham striker led out his side for the first time in draw with burnley he and burnley âs danny are also working to the same aim - bidding to work their way into the thoughts of england manager roy hodgson ahead of next summer âs european championships in france
