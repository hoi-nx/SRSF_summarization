for any players who have featured for 90 minutes in a match under marino , the next day at training is dedicated to â scarico â â recovery
marino was the manager who brought sanchez into udinese âs first team in 2008 after he had been signed from chilean club side cobreloa two years earlier
udinese had italy internationals antonio di natale , simone pepe and fabio quagliarella vying for places up front , but marino knew in sanchez he had a â jewel â on his hands
sanchez has impressed for arsenal this season following his Â£ 30million switch from barcelona marino , pictured managing pescara in 2013 , brought sanchez into the udinese first team in 2008 the main problem he encountered , however , was that he could not keep sanchez off the pitch
â sanchez could easily play three matches per day , â marino , now in charge of vicenza , said
â that hunger earned him two Â£ 30million moves , first to barcelona in 2011 and then to arsenal last summer
it is also why sanchez , arsenal âs stand - out player this season , found it so difficult when he was rested for two games by wenger â against aston villa and tottenham â with a sore hamstring
sanchez spent five years with serie a side udinese before earning a move to spanish giants barcelona sanchez takes on defender miranda during chile 's friendly with brazil at the emirates stadium last week â putting him on the bench is like taking a toy from a child , â marino warned
â there was just one thing that worried me when he joined barcelona â they were full of amazing forwards and it was by no means a given that sanchez would be in the starting 11
â sanchez found it difficult when he had to be rested for arsenal 's matches with aston villa and tottenham they warned him that when the games rained down over the winter it would soon catch up with him , but sanchez , bar that short wenger - enforced break , has not stopped , even if he has nât been as prolific as he was in the first half of the season
