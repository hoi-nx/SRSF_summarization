a cancer patient has told how a large tumour underneath her left breast ' dissolved away ' after a pioneering new treatment
the 49 - year - old woman showed a staggering response to a new combination of two drugs , to treat skin cancer
doctors at the memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york have hailed their patient 's recovery ' one of the most astonishing responses ' , ever seen
they combined a standard drug already used , ipilimumab , with another , nivolumab
a 49 - year - old cancer patient 's giant tumour underneath her left breast ( starred left ) was ' completely destroyed ' and ' dissolved away ' ( right ) after she received a pioneering new drugs cocktail to treat melanoma they hope the new therapy could save thousands of lives in future
a case report , published in the new england journal of medicine , reveals that after just one dose of the two drugs , the 49 - year - old woman reported her tumour ' kind of dissolved '
then five months ago , another growth was removed from under the patient 's left breast
when the patient arrived at memorial sloan kettering cancer center , she had developed a huge tumour underneath her left breast , which protruded through the skin
the woman was given her first dose of ipilimumab and nivolumab , without complaining of any side effects
when she returned to the hospital three weeks later , for her second dose of the drugs combination , she revealed to doctors the huge mass underneath her left breast had ' disappeared ' , leaving a hole in the skin
' the world health organisation estimates that worldwide there are 66,000 deaths annually from skin cancer , with approximately 80 per cent due to melanoma
the study found 61 per cent of those treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab showed signs of their tumours shrinking but the side effects experienced by the patients on the combination therapy were worse , though they were still manageable
' more research is still needed , however , to know if it is necessary to give all patients this combination , or if patients should receive drugs like nivolumab and ipilimumab in sequence
