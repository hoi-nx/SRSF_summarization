deila lauded his players for stretching their lead at the top of the premiership with victory at st mirren â then hit out at the state of pitches in scotland
a james forrest strike and stefan johansen âs penalty were enough to see off a spirited challenge by the bottom side as celtic moved eight points clear of aberdeen
but although pleased with the way his side stayed patient to win , deila felt their cause was nât helped by the state of the paisley surface
and he believes scotland football will struggle to develop top players if there is nât a drastic improvement in our pitches
celtic manager deila was impressed with his side 's performance against st mirren on friday night â it was a tough game , st mirren were well organised and played very deep , â he said
but the pitches in scotland are terrible
â it âs better to play on an artificial surface than this
if they are watering artificial pitches and they are of the best quality , it âs totally different and much closer to european standards
james forrest slides on his knees to celebrate scoring celtic 's opening goal against st mirren â if we are going to develop good young players , you need a good surface to play and train on
sixty per cent are artificial and the grass pitches are better as well because they do nât train there and there are nât other teams playing on them
but deila , a strong advocate of fitness and conditioning , laughed it off
â celtic midfielder stefan johansen slots home from the penalty spot to secure his side 's 2 - 0 victory goalscorer johansen believes there âs no stopping celtic as they close in on a treble
â deila berated the state of pitches in scotland and claimed it would be better to play on artificial surfaces
