miliband and justine miliband first met at a dinner party , hosted by the woman he was ' secretly ' dating relish the scene
a dinner party in west london
the hostess : stephanie flanders , the glamorous then economics editor of bbc 's newsnight
central to the party that night back in march 2004 was stephanie flanders ' boyfriend , labour rising star miliband
justine miliband had been back in britain for two months after a brief spell as a lecturer at harvard in the u.s. ever the policy nerd , the son of a marxist professor waxed lyrical about economic theory
as he held court , a young woman called justine miliband , who was sitting across the table and whom he had never met before , became transfixed
a clever young environmental lawyer , she had been invited by stephanie flanders â the brilliant daughter of michael flanders , of the fifties and sixties musical comedy duo flanders & swann
yesterday , justine miliband recalled in a red - top newspaper : ' i thought he was good - looking and clever and seemed to be unattached
' mrs justine miliband said that she was ' furious ' when â far from being ' unattached ' â she found out that he was ' secretly going out with ' the woman who had invited her for dinner
the story emerged yesterday when mrs justine miliband gave an interview to the labour - supporting mirror
' justine miliband told how , during the 2005 election campaign , miliband had come to her rescue after she was bitten by the dog
former partners of mr miliband include juliet ( left ) and fellow political aide liz lloyd ( right ) after their first meeting at that 2004 dinner party , it was at least a year before they started dating
justine miliband 's recollection is n't , though , the first public airing of her love story with ed. in the biography of the labour leader , titled miliband : the milibands and the making of a labour leader , an associate is quoted as saying : ' although she was struck by his eyes â wide and brown and fixed on their subject â a friend remembers her undoubted excitement after meeting miliband as : ' gosh , how fascinating , he 's really clever ' , rather than : ' gosh , how handsome '
' perhaps glossing over what may be seen as such caddish behaviour , the mirror omitted to say that the dinner 's hostess , stephanie flanders ( who later left the bbc for a Â£ 400,000 - a - year job at a bank in the city ) , was miliband 's then girlfriend
it was left to blair 's biographer rentoul to let the cat out of the bag after reading the mirror story , when he tweeted : ' justine miliband on clandestine ed. why has mirror not named the host of that dinner ? it was stephanie flanders
' stephanie flanders ( pictured ) , a former girlfriend of mr miliband , hosted the dinner party where he first met his future wife considering that she , at the time , was economics editor of bbc-tv 's flagship newsnight , rentoul added : ' could the secrecy have been because he was a treasury special adviser and stephanie flanders was a bbc economics journalist ? ' what 's more , there is another intriguing twist to this story of high politics and high economics
for two years ago , miliband ungallantly blurted out , during an interview with a celebrity magazine , that not only had he romanced stephanie flanders but that his close labour colleague and shadow chancellor , balls , had had a relationship with her , too
justine miliband said : ' we did both date her but there was a long time apart between me and stephanie flanders and i do n't have any problems running into each other now
' for her part , stephanie flanders had no forewarning of justine miliband 's revelation and restricted her response to curtly dismissing her relationship with him as having been ' very brief and a very long time ago '
and she met balls when they both worked at the times but back to miliband 's tangled love - life
after breaking up with liz lloyd , mr miliband had a brief relationship with the journalist miles ( pictured ) ' we discussed it like we were in a fabian society seminar , ' recalled collins
and so back to miliband and justine miliband
the next time they met after his questionable behaviour at his then girlfriend stephanie flanders ' dinner party was in the months leading up to him becoming an mp
no more mr nerd : justine miliband 's interview in yesterday 's labour - supporting mirror some months after , justine miliband planned a holiday with a woman barrister friend , quincy whitaker , to libya to see the roman ruins
however , after it was booked , justine miliband said she wanted to go , instead , with miliband
their relationship had consolidated further by the time justine miliband was appointed secretary of state for energy and climate change in the brown government
