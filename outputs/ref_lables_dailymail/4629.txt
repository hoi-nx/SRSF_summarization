now 96 - year - old robert clark is engaged in a different sort of battle after a council refused to increase funding he needs for a live - in carer
it means the second world war veteran could be forced out of his home of nearly 50 years and into a care home â a move his son describes as â like going back into a prisoner of war camp â
yesterday his son mike clark , 58 , who runs an executive coaching business , said : â he fought for the freedom of this country â without people like him brent council would nât even exist
now a great - great - grandfather and one of britain âs oldest surviving pows , mr robert clark is registered blind , deaf in one ear and is dependent on a wheelchair
writing home : veteran robert clark , pictured in 1940 , when he was serving with durham light infantry for the past two years he has used his Â£ 50,000 savings to pay towards a Â£ 960 - a - week live - in carer , while brent council contributed Â£ 350 a week
but as his money runs out , the council is refusing to increase its funding and mr robert clark may have to go into a care home instead
â he hates being anywhere which is nât familiar â¦ going into a care home will be like going back into a prisoner of war camp
â despite tens of thousands signing the petition to allow mr robert clark to stay in his own home , brent council said they will not increase their funding for a live - in carer
the council âs porter said : â we recognise mr robert clark âs contribution to this country and sincerely empathise with the situation that he and other older people â¦ are in
â however â¦ the care package that mr robert clark is choosing is not affordable to council taxpayers given the constraints of local government funding and the need to be consistent for the 2,900 people we support
â he added : â mr robert clark owns his home , so there is absolutely no question of brent council evicting him despite what has been suggested in this petition
â prisoner : robert clark ( front row , second left ) pictured on june 21 , 1943 at prisoner of war camp campo pg70 in italy the council said mr robert clark âs needs can be met in a care home for Â£ 451 a week
alternatively , he could choose to receive the same weekly sum and stay at home , but would have to pay the extra amount necessary for a carer
