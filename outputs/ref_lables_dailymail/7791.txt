a mother whose son suffered severe brain damage during birth is set to receive potentially the biggest medical negligence payout in history
the high court ruled today that united lincolnshire hospitals nhs trust must pay in excess of Â£ 14.6 million for birth injuries , after failing to carry out a caesarean section on suzanne adams and properly monitor her during labour
the hospital 's negligence led to her son james , now 12 , being born with cerebral palsy
the decision , believed to be one of the most significant in a case of medical negligence and the largest ever such court - ordered award for birth injury , reflects the lifetime care that james needs
suzanne adams ' son james was born with cerebral palsy after she hospital staff failed to carry out a caesarean section or properly monitor her during labour james can not speak , dress or feed himself ( without assistance of a machine ) and must use a wheelchair
james had an abnormal heart rate and was evidently in some distress and mrs suzanne adams was exhausted by a prolonged labour
today , the high court ruled that united lincolnshire hospitals nhs trust must pay ms suzanne adams in excess of Â£ 14.6 million for birth injuries - the largest ever court - ordered award for birth injury james , now 12 , can not speak , dress or feed himself and must use a wheelchair
he will be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life the confusion about ctg interpretation and the additional failure to carry out a timely caesarean section meant there was a delay in delivering james
the sum ordered by the high court includes money to pay for all james â needs including : * 24 hour care provided by a team of live - in carers
* sophisticated eye - gaze equipment to enable james to speak and communicate with people and carry out his school work
ms suzanne adams ' lawyer , stephens , a partner with law firm access legal , argued that had the caesarean section had been carried out - or hospital staff had monitored the baby âs heart rate properly - the midwife could have identified that james was in distress
â the united lincolnshire hospitals nhs trust finally admitted liability for james âs injuries in 2009 - seven years after his birth
' the award will help james realise his potential
' pauleen pratt , acting chief nurse at united lincolnshire hospitals nhs trust , said : ' the trust and the nhs litigation authority are deeply sorry for what happened and for the impact this has had upon james and his family
