a divorcee who claims her ex-husband cheated her out of a multi-million - pound fortune has won the right to reopen their divorce battle in the supreme court
alison sharland , 47 , agreed a Â£ 10.35million settlement in a deal that saw her give up her claim to an equal share in her husband 's software company
but husband charlie had lied about the value of his share in appsense , and she now says she is entitled to more
but his firm appsense was later valued wildly higher , and his stake was said to be worth Â£ 132m the court of appeal found that mr sharland , 54 , had deliberately hidden information and lied to the court but refused to overturn the divorce settlement
but within days of the agreement an initial public offering on the stock market â which never took place â valued the company at more than Â£ 460million , meaning his shares were worth around Â£ 132million after tax
