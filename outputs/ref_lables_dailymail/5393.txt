the skeleton of a new species of giant predatory bird that terrorised the earth 3.5 million years ago has been discovered and is helping to reveal how these creatures would have sounded
palaeontologists say the four feet ( 1.2 metres ) tall bird is the most complete skeletons of a ' terror bird ' - a group of flightless prehistoric meat - eating birds - to be discovered
the south america bird has been named llallawavis scagliai - meaning scaglia 's magnificent bird after one of argentina 's famous naturalists scaglia
a giant prehistoric â terror bird â - once thought to have been a ruthless predator which snapped the necks of mammals with its enormous beak - was actually a vegetarian , according to one study
palaeontologists in the us have also found footprints believed to belong to the south america cousin of gastornis , and these do not show the imprints of sharp claws , used to grapple prey , that might be expected of a raptor
dr degrange , a palaeontologist at the centre for research in earth sciences and the university of cã³rdoba in argentina , said : ' the mean hearing estimated for this terror bird was below the average for living birds
' terror birds , or phorusracids as they are also known , were a group of carnivorous birds that grew up to 10 feet tall and had large hooked beaks
although smaller than some of the species discovered , llallawavis scagliai , was one of the last terror birds to prowl the earth before they died out around 2.5 million years ago
it was discovered by fernando scaglia , from the lorenzo scaglia municipal museum of natural sciences , along with matias taglioretti and alejandro dondas at la estafeta beach south of mar del plata city in the buenos aires province of argentina in 2010
scientists used 3d scanning of the long skull of llallawavis scagliai ( above ) to examine its hearing ability dr scaglia is the grandson of galileo juan scaglia who was director of the museum between 1940 and 1980
the fossilised skeleton ( above ) was found in a cliff on a beach south of mar del plata city in argentina however , despite this they were able to retrieve a skeleton that is around 90 per cent complete
in a study published in the journal of vertebrate paleontology , the researchers were able to reconstruct the structure of the bird 's inner ear using 3d computed tomography
they found that llallawavis would have had an average hearing range of around 3,800hz and a sensitivity of around 2,300hz
la estafeta beach ( above ) near mar del plata in argentina where the fossil was found has strong tides that threatened to wash the skeleton away forcing palaeontologists to work fast to excavate it to save it from harm he said : ' the palate is a big area of jaw muscle attacment in birds
he said : ' the discovery of this species reveals that terror birds were more diverse in the pliocene than previously thought
