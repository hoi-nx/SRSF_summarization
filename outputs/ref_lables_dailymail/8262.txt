mrs wilkinson said : ' we were heart broken when we discovered that joel wilkinson had such an awful terminal disease
' we told phoebe as soon as joel wilkinson was diagnosed that he had a problem with his muscles and that they 're weaker than normal
' she now only plays " muscle friendly " games that do n't involve joel wilkinson running around and getting extremely tired
' phoebe loves her little brother so much and she even takes care of him when they are both at school as they share break times together
boys with duchenne muscular dystrophy 's will have difficulty with walking , jumping and climbing stairs
' she openly tells their friends that she wo n't join in with any games unless joel wilkinson can keep up too
' mr and mrs wilkinson found out their son joel wilkinson had duchenne muscular dystrophy just before his third birthday last year
' joel wilkinson will lose the use of his legs first , leaving him wheelchair - bound , and then other muscles thereafter
at first joel wilkinson 's parents thought he was a late developer but when at six months he could n't sit and by two he could n't walk they knew something was seriously wrong
mrs wilkinson said : ' results from the blood test in july said he had muscle dystrophy , but it was n't until the end of september , after more tests , that we found out it was duchenne muscular dystrophy
' the disease , which results in muscle degeneration , has already left joel wilkinson unable to get up the stairs or walk long distances
mrs wilkinson added : ' joel wilkinson struggles to stand up and despite only being three he looks like a little old man when he tries to get up
' it 's an awful illness but we are going to ensure that joel wilkinson has the best life and with phoebe 's help we know he 'll enjoy every second
' when i tell them both to tidy up their toys phoebe will instantly stick up for him and say " what about his weak muscles "
the family have now decided to make joel wilkinson 's short life full of joy as well as playing with her brother at home , phoebe looks after joel wilkinson at school , spending break times with him ' it 's adorable but he 's so spoilt
' the family have set up at online fundraising website to ensure joel wilkinson he gets the specialist treatment he needs to make his life as comfortable as possible
' we need funds to help joel wilkinson be as independent as possible when he grows up and so we can adapt our home , ' mrs wilkinson explained
mrs wilkinson said : ' thanks to phoebe , joel wilkinson has a constant play mate and she helps him ensure he gets the most out of the time he has being able to move his muscles
' there is n't any medication joel wilkinson can take that will slow down his muscle deterioration so we have to watch helplessly as he slowly becomes weaker
but thanks to phoebe , joel wilkinson has a constant playmate often phoebe will clear up joel wilkinson 's toys after they have played together so he does n't become to fatigued
