the surviving daughters of a mother who has been imprisoned for strangling six of her children to death moments after they were born are standing by their murderous mom
megan huntsman , 40 , is facing life in prison after pleading guilty to killing the six newborns , then stashing their bodies in the garage of her home in pleasant grove , utah
a judge today handed huntsman six sentences of five years to life - but family members rallied round her even as her ' cold and calculated ' crimes were recounted to the court
three will run consecutively , which means she will spend at least 15 years in prison - and likely much longer
she is pictured today in court grisly : investigators are shown above searching huntsman 's garage , where a total of seven baby corpses were found in cardboard boxes
darren west , who previously served time in prison , is not considered a suspect in their deaths scene : her estranged husband found one of the babies ' bodies while cleaning out the garage at her pleasent grove , utah home , pictured , in april last year she told the court that the woman who committed the crimes was ' not my megan huntsman '
the sentences handed down to huntsman today were the maximum possible for her crimes
three of them will be served consecutively - meaning she will spend a minimum of 15 years inside , and likely much longer
