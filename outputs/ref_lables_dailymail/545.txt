for the first time , astronomers have found the building blocks of life in a distant early star system
the discovery is a boost for finding alien organisms and suggests the conditions that spawned life on earth are not unique to our solar system
the discovery is a boost for finding alien organisms and suggests the conditions that spawned life on earth are not unique to our solar system radio telescope observations showed the disk surrounding the million - year - old star mwc 480 480 to be ' brimming ' with the complex carbon - based molecule methyl cyanide
experts believe comets and asteroids from the outer solar system seeded the young earth with water and organic molecules to set the stage for life to evolve
astronomers used the atacama large millimetre / submillimetre array ( alma ) , a powerful suit of interacting radio telescopes in chile 's atacama desert , to investigate mwc 480 480
' i believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond earth in the next decade , ' said stofan , chief scientist for nasa , ( pictured ) there at least 200 billion earth - like planets in our galaxy â and now nasa officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them
' the molecules surrounding mwc 480 480 have been detected in similar concentrations in our own solar system 's comets , she pointed out
astronomers used the atacama large millimetre / submillimetre array ( alma ) , a powerful suit of interacting radio telescopes in chile 's atacama desert , to investigate mwc 480 480
the findings , reported in the journal nature , reveal that there is enough methyl cyanide around mwc 480 to fill all of the earth 's oceans
among complex organic molecules , cyanides - especially methyl cyanide - are important because they contain carbon - nitrogen bonds essential for the formation of amino acids , the components of proteins
as the mwc 480 480 system evolves it is likely that organic molecules locked away in comets and other icy bodies will be ferried closer to the star where conditions may be suitable for life , the scientists believe
