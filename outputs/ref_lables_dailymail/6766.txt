england left for the caribbean on thursday knowing they must beat the west indies on their return to test cricket to salvage the futures of key personnel and silence speculation that continues to swirl around kevin pietersen
the stakes are high for england after a disastrous world cup and the introduction of a new ecb chairman in colin graves who has made it clear that jobs will be on the line in a three - tests series that begins in antigua on april 13
kevin pietersen , who has rejoined surrey in an attempt to win back his test place , was the name on everyone âs lips at gatwick as beleaguered coach peter moores and returning captain alastair cook put on a united front ahead of a five - week tour they can not afford to go wrong
england captain alastair cook faces the media at gatwick on thursday morning coach peter moores ( left ) answered questions about the possible return of kevin pietersen â kevin pietersen âs not on this trip so i do nât have to focus on kevin pietersen at all , â insisted peter moores , who initially lost his job as england coach after clashing with kevin pietersen at the end of 2008
â my focus is to support alastair cook as captain and work with the 16 players we have here to try to make sure we play the sort of cricket people want to watch and help us win
â from my point of view kevin pietersen is nât on the radar
kevin pietersen is not my decision
this is about focusing on an england team
i understand kevin pietersen is a huge subject but cooky and i ca nât get drawn into that
â alastair cook , who made it perfectly clear last year that he did not want kevin pietersen in his side again even before his bitter autobiography that appeared to sever all ties with england , concurred with his coach
kevin pietersen ( left ) controversially celebrated australia 's world cup win with his friends james faulkner yorkshire opener adam lyth ( centre ) will get a chance to impress on the west indies tour â contrary to what you may read in the media i âm a long way away from that decision
it âs down to paul downton , tom and colin graves about kevin pietersen , it âs not down to us , â said an england captain who was dropped from the one - day side after of a world cup where england failed to negotiate the group stage
â we âve got 16 guys going to west indies who are desperate to start turning round english cricket from what âs happened over the last three months
â alastair cook spoke in abu dhabi last month where he played for mcc against yorkshire of his anger at frustration at missing out on the world cup
on thursday he was more conciliatory , particularly towards the coach who dropped him
â i have known mooresey for years and i love working with him , â said alastair cook
durham fast bowler mark wood is another new face in england 's tests squad â i âve been living a normal life again which i have nât had for a long time and it âs been great spending time with family and friends and being at home
â moores would not go as far as to say he regretted the decision to drop alastair cook and make eoin morgan one - day captain ahead of the world cup
there âs been a lot of noise around english cricket and a lot of emotion which is understandable but i think now we âve got 16 players who are going to the west indies under alastair cook and we âve got to go and try to play some really good cricket
â new chairman colin graves , who has heaped pressure on england by encouraging kevin pietersen to return to county cricket , caused another stir when he called west indies mediocre and said there would be an inquiry if england failed to win
and peter moores acknowledged that jobs are on the line in the caribbean
both alastair cook and peter moores were keen to talk about the squad and not about kevin pietersen â from my point of view it âs not about the coach
â he knows , though , that his job will probably not go any further than the west indies if england fail to win
