even more so in the case of this striking tree spotted in southern china
the banyan tree in guangxi province does not stand on a single trunk , but a whole web of roots
the roots then became the trunk of the tree , leading to its strange appearance
remarkable : the web is so flimsy that the entire tree sways in the wind entangled : the trees are known for their extensive network of roots , which often grow above ground
