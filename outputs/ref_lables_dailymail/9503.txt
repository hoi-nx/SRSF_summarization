cameron said he knows that when it comes to immigration , ' fears and worries ' remain let me reassure you , i know that when it comes to immigration , fears and worries remain
i am not one of those politicians who says they â get â how people feel about immigration then speaks differently in private
sitting in the house of commons from 2001 , i had a ringside seat on labour âs complete failure on immigration â and it was infuriating
fake colleges , bogus visas , wide open loopholes , the wrong welfare incentives , sham marriages , an abject failure to deport foreign criminals , migrants bringing family members to british even if they could nât speak a word of english â a litany of failure
underpinning it all was contempt for the views of most british people
we all remember pm âs boast that labour was practically â sending out search parties â for migrants
there are new charges for migrants using the nhs ; there is no social housing unless you âve been in an area for two years ; and there is no housing benefit full - stop for eu jobseekers
on top of all this direct action to control immigration , we recognised that the rising immigration numbers were nât just about lax borders and a system easily abused ; it was about british people not being trained to get into the jobs that were becoming available â or not incentivised to work at all , because of labour âs welfare system
under labour , for years , 90 per cent of job growth was taken up by foreign workers
with the conservatives , two - thirds of our job growth now benefits british citizens
so why have many more eu migrants come here ? partly it âs our extraordinary economic success , with british creating more jobs than 27 other europe countries combined
it will involve : no benefits at all for eu jobseekers
if you have nât got a job within six months , you âll be required to leave
if you âve got a job , you will get no in - work benefits until you âve been here and contributing to our country for at least four years
i will fight , negotiate , do all i can to secure a better deal for british
and then we would put this to the british people in an in - out referendum in 2017
eight hundred people died in the most horrific of circumstances , so it âs also right that british â not just a compassionate country but a strong one too â does what it can to prevent such scenes from ever happening again
we need to hunt down the traffickers who prey on human misery , deal with the boats that bring people across the seas and help foster stable conditions in countries which export so much illegal immigration
all of this is a serious , grown - up plan for reducing immigration long - term
immigration should be about welcoming those who can contribute to our country ; who want to come to british , pay their way , make a life here , and abide by british values
if i am prime minister after may 7 i will see through this serious , sustained attempt to control immigration long - term
i will get british a better deal in europe â and i will give the british people the final say in an in - out referendum
