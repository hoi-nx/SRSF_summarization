as bamford fired home his 19th boro goal of the season on tuesday night , there was one question on everybody âs lips : can he make the grade at chelsea next season ? the 21 - year - old striker has been prolific in his loan spells at boro , derby and mk dons , so much so that sportsmail understands his parent club are opening talks with him over a new deal
he will also be given the chance to impress mourinho on chelsea âs summer tour although at the end of it he is expected to go out on loan again
this time , though , bamford will be sent to a premier league club , preferably aitor karanka âs boro should they join the blues in the top flight
but bamford is a confident young man and will believe he can emulate tottenham âs kane and force chelsea âs hand
bamford is currently one of 26 players out on loan from stamford bridge - five of which are rival frontmen - while academy forwards dominic solanke and isaiah brown have already won elevation to the senior set - up
the chances of bamford making his mark next season , you feel , are slim
but then were nât the chances of kane scoring 29 goals for tottenham in his breakthrough season and then netting on his full england debut also outlandish ? bamford has already impressed mourinho with his attitude
â to play for chelsea , â returned the well - mannered but equally brazen rookie
chelsea boss mourinho ( right ) has been impressed with bamford 's attitude as well as his development romelu lukaku ( pictured in 2011 ) was sold to everton in the summer after failing to make the grade chelsea youth product dominic solanke ( centre ) has won elevation to the first - team squad this season tottenham striker kane ( left ) has scored 29 goals in his breakthrough season for the club bamford has always achieved his goals in life - be it straight a grades at nottingham high school , teaching himself spanish and to play guitar or , indeed , scoring goals as a footballer
last summer , when mourinho convinced bamford that boro was the best place for him , the manager dispensed with his cool exterior and hugged his player
â he was very emotional , â recalls the 21 - year - old
on tuesday night he became boro âs first player since 1990 to score 17 league goals in one season
for bamford âs ability - the raw talent which persuaded chelsea to prise him from nottingham forest as an 18 - year - old after only 12 minutes of first - team football - has never been in question

bamford enjoyed two loan spells at mk dons before spending the second half of last season at derby
