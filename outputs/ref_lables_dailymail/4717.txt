miliband would be a ' catastrophe ' for britain , according to ftse 100 bosses seven out of 10 business chiefs at britain 's biggest companies think miliband would be a ' catastrophe ' for britain , a survey has revealed
the poll of ftse 100 chairman has revealed overwhelming support for cameron to remain prime minister , despite the widespread business concern over his pledge to hold an in - out referendum on european
it comes just days after more than 100 company bosses signed a letter warning against a labour government
mr miliband last week vowed to ban 90 per cent of zero - hours contracts and unveiled proposals to make it easier for workers to take their bosses to court for unfair dismissal
one of the ftse 100 bosses surveyed , who did not want to be named , said businesses could work with labour 's shadow business secretary umunna and its economics chief ed balls
but he said mr miliband 's ' tone and rhetoric ' had proved ' deeply disturbing ' , adding : ' at times his language is vitriolic and he appears to completely misunderstand business
' mr umunna , speaking on radio 5 live today , umunna insisted labour was no anti-business and defended mr miliband 's recent announcemtn that labour would all - but outlaw zero - hours contracts
cameron and george osborne , out campaigning today , have jumped on business criticism of the labour to boost their core campaign message that only the tories can be trusted with the economy he said : ' business people have been very impressed that miliband took a decision on a matter of principle on the in - out referendum
in a highly unusual intervention just weeks from the general election , the business chiefs claimed a labour government would ' put the recovery at risk '
mr miliband said the letter was not a surprise and only showed that the tories were on the side of ' a few big firms and individuals at the top '
the business chiefs who signed the letter run companies with well known retail brands such as primark , iceland , ladbrokes and costa
however , mr miliband said the letter only served to expose the choice at the election
