the victims all believed they were involved in a relationship with a mormon man living in the same state - only to find out they were being duped by a woman named kayla in texas
and the women had a chance to confront the woman , named kayla , on an episode of dr phil that aired on friday
kayla responded by saying she tried to figure out her life in the ' wrong way '
' it 's for the simple fact that being gay and being mormon is hard , ' kayla said
he apologized to the women who all had been talking to a kayla , who used keagan 's pictures online the women 's faces all looked disappointed and shocked when kayla first walked through the door , revealing herself as the person they had all been talking to the women mostly wanted to know why kayla decided to pretend to be a man and why she had spoken to some of the women for longer than others kayla had stolen the identity of a montana student named keagan , who the women had a chance to meet on the dr phil segment
it emerged that kayla was a catfish - someone who tricks others online by setting up fake profiles with fake pictures and names - after one of the women became suspicious and looked into the man she had been talking to
kayla told dr phil that she ' did n't have any evil intentions ' and that she was just trying to figure herself out
' kayla , who now says she is gay , said
the women appeared uncomfortable at times during the interview and some even rolled their eyes at what kayla was saying
most of the women , however , agreed to forgive kayla for what she did she told fox13 that they would regularly text and talk and he even sent her flowers on valentine 's day - but that anderson would never agree to meet up
the pair eventually realised the texts they were receiving were from the same number and it turned out they had both been duped by a woman called kayla , from texas
