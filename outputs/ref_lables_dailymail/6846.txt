dr oz 's fellow faculty members at columbia have written an op - ed lashing out at how his ' unsubstantiated medicine ... sullies the reputation ' of the university - in just the latest attack on his talk show tactics
but they also leap to the physician 's defense in the piece , saying that his on - air ' ozisms ' should not cancel out his stellar work at the university , where he has an unblemished record as a doctor
the eight staff wrote the op - ed for usa today after 10 doctors urged columbia to sever all ties with oz , who serves as vice chairman and professor of surgery at the college of physicians
those doctors accused him of being a ' charlatan ' who promotes ' quack treatments ' on his syndicated talk show - accusations oz has vehemently fought this week
' many of us are spending a significant amount of our clinical time debunking ozisms regarding metabolism game changers , ' the staff members wrote in the op - ed. ' irrespective of the underlying motives , this unsubstantiated medicine sullies the reputation of columbia and undermines the trust that is essential to physician - patient relationships
support : the eight faculty members , including drs michael rosenbaum , left , and joan bregstein
' what happens when a doctor 's job in media - medicine collides with office - or hospital - based medicine ? dr. oz is a case in - point
irrespective of the underlying motives , this unsubstantiated medicine sullies the reputation of columbia and undermines the trust that is essential to physician - patient relationships
however , unless these foibles can be shown to render dr. oz inadequate or ineffective at columbia , there is no justification for forcing him to resign from a well - earned position in academic medicine
' dr. oz might begin each program with a simple disclaimer : " the opinions expressed on this program may not be evidence - based or part of accepted medical practice and have no endorsement from columbia
" ' the full op - ed can be read at usa today ' non-evidence based medical recommendations presented without the appropriate caveats are costly and potentially harmful , ' they wrote
' however , unless these foibles can be shown to render dr. oz inadequate or ineffective at columbia , there is no justification for forcing him to resign from a well - earned position in academic medicine
' rather , he should start each show with a disclaimer : ' the opinions expressed on this program may not be evidence - based or part of accepted medical practice and have no endorsement from columbia , ' they said
the op - ed was penned by dr michael rosenbaum , dr joan bregstein , dr elizabeth oelsner , dr sumit mohan and dr dana march of columbia university medical center , dr michelle odlum of the school of nursing , dr katherine shear of the college of physicians & surgeons , and tal gross of the department of health policy and management
defense : on friday , dr oz appeared on the today show and said his show would survive the criticism vehement : he told matt lauer that his show was more about living ' the good life ' than medical information he said he continues to stand by his use of the word ' miracle ' to some treatments - but wishes he had not used it for weight - loss supplements
' the 10 doctors who attacked me got what they wanted â sensational headlines and sound bites , ' he previously said on his thursday show , which was entitled the truth about his critics
' dr miller had written of oz : ' he 's a quack and a fake and a charlatan
' columbia previously released a statement that it ' is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members ' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion
