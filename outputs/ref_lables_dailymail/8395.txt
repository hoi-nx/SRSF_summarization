transip hired a pair of pole dancing robots for an event in shoreditch
the dancers , which cost around Â£ 2,500 to hire , were made out of old car parts and were designed by british artist giles walker , with their moves controlled by a computer
the robots were originally created in 2012 by giles walker for a show called ' peepshow '
' with this in mind , i wondered if it was possible to literally make a cctv camera sexy using simple mechanics ... and by using the imagery of a pole dancer question the roles played in voyeurism
the robots will be pole dancing for the remaining four days of the event , along with presentations from leading figures in the technology industry
