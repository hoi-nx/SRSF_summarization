with its gabled , late - victorian red - brick exterior and oak - panelled interior , cournswood house could almost be bletchley park , the english country house at the heart of the recent oscar - nominated drama the imitation game , about the cracking of germany 's wartime enigma
so it is appropriate that at least two of cournswood 's long - term residents have had strong bletchley connections
the first was wartime naval cryptographer and enigma codebreaker dillwyn knox , who bought it in 1921 and lived there until his death in 1943
his funeral was attended by many from bletchley park , and a memorial stone to dillwyn knox can be found bordering the property
cournswood house is in the south of buckinghamshire â in ten acres of secluded woodlands in the picturesque village of north dean bletchley connections : codebreaker dillwyn knox , left , who bought it in 1921 and lived there until his death in 1943 and right , sharon constancon , who is related to the leon family who once owned bletchley park and the current owner , businesswoman sharon constancon , is related to the leon family who once owned bletchley park
' i only discovered this when i went on a visit to bletchley park with my uncle , ' says sharon constancon
' the leon family donated the building to the government in 1937 for use as a code - breaking centre
' while both are in buckinghamshire , cournswood house is in the south of the county â in ten acres of secluded woodlands in the picturesque village of north dean â while bletchley park is in the town of bletchley in the north , 20 miles away
during the second world war at bletchley park , dillwyn knox led the team that made the first breaks into the code germany was using , and he encouraged turing â the subject of the imitation game â in his work there
' i fell in love with cournswood house the moment i saw it , ' says sharon constancon , who bought it in 2003
