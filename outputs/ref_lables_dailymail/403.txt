husband and wife david and sandra , 53 and 52 , from plymouth , have told their shocking story of harassment , which culminated in david 's sister anne cancelling the couple 's wedding using a fake email address just weeks before the big day
i did not think someone was capable of doing that , ' says sandra of the horrifying moment anne informed them she 'd managed to cancel their nuptials behind their back
and they subsequently took anne to court for harassment
sandra first met david after his 20 - year marriage fell apart and her friend anne , david 's sister , suggested they meet
' i met anne for coffee and david came out and i 've never let his side since , ' she says
but although anne 's matchmaking had worked , she was not happy about their relationship and started sending sandra threatening text messages telling her to stop seeing her brother
anne was sending messages saying , " your mum âs dying and you better get back to her "
' ann duffy , pretended to be her now sister - in - law and cancelled her brother 's wedding but the relationship continued and sandra and david became even closer
then david took the hint and gave sandra a romantic proposal
' we went to the registry office , put the deposit down and made special invites - i could n't believe it was really happening , ' sandra says of the wedding
' but in 2012 , sandra âs mother lost her battle with cancer and a year later david âs mother celia also became ill and moved in with sandra and david
but sandra would nât let anne in their house , which reignited the rift
david remembers : ' i was lying in bed when the phone rang and anne said : " i 've got to tell you - you might want to pot the phone on loudspeaker
" ' david and sandra at their wedding sandra says : ' i was in tears and angry
' anne had created an email address in sandra 's name to set about jeopardising the couple 's plans
luckily the registry office juggled things around and were able to fit david and sandra back in on their planned date
ann duffy called plymouth register office 20 days before her brother 's wedding and canceled it anne was jailed for eight weeks at plymouth magistrates ' court
when sandra reported anne to the police , anne admitted it straight away and was given a date to appear in court
but the angry text messages still continued and when the big day arrived , the couple still feared anne might ruin it
sandra and david at their wedding ' we did nât see her until we got out side , ' remembers sandra of their wedding day
' and of anne 's injunction against coming near sandra , david says : ' it 's the best way â the less we see of her the better
' sandra says : ' it 's jealousy bitterness and anger
' anne did not want to appear on the programme but said she had her reasons for cancelling the wedding and loved her brother
