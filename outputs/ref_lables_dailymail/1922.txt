genetically engineering plants and crops to change their dna has been a cause of much controversy in recent years
but new research has found that mother nature might be making its own gm food , as sweet potatoes have been found to genetically modify themselves
and this seems to have been occurring for thousands of years , meaning humans have been unknowingly eating gm foods for much longer than they thought
scientists in belgium say all sweet potatoes ( stock image shown ) contain ' foreign dna '
agrobacterium bacteria in the crop exchanges genes between species
this makes sweet potatoes a ' natural genetically modified organism '
and humans have been eating it for thousands of years the remarkable finding of â foreign dna â in the vegetable shows that it contains a type of natural genetically modified organism ( gmos )
it is not the first instance of natural gmos to be found , but it is the first in sweet potatoes - a major crop plant
agrobacterium is specialised to transfer part of its own dna , called dna , to plants - and it was this dna that was found in sweet potatoes
it is one of the earliest domesticated crops with archeological findings in caves of the cholca canyon in peru that are 8,000 to 10,000 years old â the natural presence of agrobacterium t-dna in sweet potato and its stable inheritance during evolution is a beautiful example of the possibility of dna exchange across species barriers , â said dr gheysen , one of the researchers involved
