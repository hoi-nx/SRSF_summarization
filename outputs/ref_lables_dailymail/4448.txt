there is a problem with england 's top order and it is not an easy one to solve
england 's top three are exceptional players but the issue is that they are very one - paced and when the west indies bowling was so disciplined , that became a problem on the first morning of the first test
it is ok batting the way england did if they had got through to lunch on 60 without loss , but they will be exposed against better teams than west indies , like australia , if they crash to 34 for three in the first session as they did here
joe root ( left ) and ian bell ( right ) put on 177 runs for the fourth wicket on day one in antigua ian bell raises his bat to the crowd after scoring his 22nd test match century at the sir viv richards stadium ok , if they stay in the runs will come and england supporters will be happy but it should be remembered that england have promised to play a certain way
ben stokes was unbeaten on 71 at the close of play as england reached 341 for five ian bell and joe root lifted england 's run rate and got them out of a hole having fallen to 34 for three gary ballance has got this big backwards movement so to get him driving , and dismissing him the way the west indies did , represented a sucker punch
thanks to those two and ben stokes , this turned out to be very much england 's day
cook is bowled through the gate by kemar roach for 11 on the first morning in antigua jonathan trott 's first test in 18 months ended in a third - ball duck as he was dismissed in the first over moores and cook are both genuinely good guys trying to do a good job , so when i received a text from moores asking if i would have a motivational talk with the team on the eve of the test i was happy to oblige
it was only a 15 - minute chat at the end of england 's team meeting and , while not going into it too deeply , i just tried to give the team a sense of perspective
and when england were 34 for three , i was receiving a lot of comments in the commentary box about my supposed motivational skills ! i replied that i only actually spoke to the england middle order .
