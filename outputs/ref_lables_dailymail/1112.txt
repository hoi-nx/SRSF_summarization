a grandfather who could n't afford his own cruiser has come up with an innovative solution - putting his caravan on a boat and taking it out on the water
thurston , 80 , takes his vessel , dubbed the ' catamavan ' , out on the river swale in kent regularly and enjoys the views of the countryside
he says his small yachts were too cramped for leisure cruising , and he could n't buy a bigger vessel , so two years ago he built the caravan boat to take his mind off his recent divorce
bizarre : this ' catamavan ' , a cross between a boat and a caravan , has been spotted on the river swale in kent the catamavan has an oven , fridge freezer , shower , toilet , double bed and two tables , and it is fitted with a small engine that reaches four knots
project : thurston started building the unusual vessel while he was doing through a divorce ' in the swale you get lovely nights and mornings but sometimes it 's a bit cold to sit outside and have a meal so you eat below deck and do n't get any views
' the father of four keeps the catamaran anchored in conyer , kent , which is 19 miles away from his home in herne bay
' i started building it as a bit of a distraction really , ' he said
home : the catamavan cruises up and down the river swale in kent , near mr thurston 's home ' i used to build paragliders and para-motors and i have always worked on boats , but i wanted to do something a bit different
