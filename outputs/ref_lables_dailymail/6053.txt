researchers from london and edinburgh are developing a computer that can collate meteorological information and then produce forecasts as if they were written by a human
useing a process known as ' natural language generation ' ( nlg ) , it has the potential to one day be used in humanoid robots on our tv screens
researchers from london and edinburgh have developed a computer that can collate meterological information and then produce forecasts as if they were written by a human
it uses a process known as ' natural language generation ' ( nlg ) these computer - generated weather updates are being being tested by scientists at heriot-watt university and university college london
if the project is successful , a prototype system will be tested by generating local weather reports on the bbc 's website
currently , the bbc website features 10 reports written by meteorologists
using met office data , the researchers are developing new algorithms for automatically generating weather reports
if the project is successful a prototype system will be tested by generating local weather reports on the mailonline 's website ( shown ) , which currently features just 10 reports for large areas of the country nlg is the process of producing readable texts in english , or other languages , automatically on a computer
it is often referred to as a translator that converts computer speak into natural language , which is tricky for computers due to variances in tone and grammar
