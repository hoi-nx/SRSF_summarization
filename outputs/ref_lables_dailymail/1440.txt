head coach john carver has hinted that de jong could even make the 18 for sunday 's premier league fixture against tottenham at st james ' park , and while the dutch has not ruled that out , his sights are set the swans ' visit to tyneside on the following weekend
newcastle playmaker siem de jong is hopeful of returning to the first - team before the end of the season he told nufctv : ' i do n't think i could play 90 minutes in the coming weeks , so it will be maybe as a substitute at the end of the game , but i do n't know if i will be on the bench ... we have n't discussed yet when i 'll be back
' de jong , a Â£ 6million summer signing from ajax , has made just three senior appearances for the club , the last of them in a 3 - 3 home draw with crystal palace on august 30 last year - his only league start to date
the summer signing has been plagued by injuries since arriving from ajax but is close to full fitness injury hit when he badly tore a thigh muscle in training days later and was sidelined until february , when disaster struck once again as he suffered a collapsed lung for the second time in his career
