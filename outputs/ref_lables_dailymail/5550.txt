a south africa writer has claimed australians is more racist than her homeland - where segregation by skin colour used to be law
while she originally called south africa home , msimang , 41 , moved to australians with her husband and children in the last few months
however , upon relocating she said she 's been faced with the realisation , that much like her native south africa : â the deepest and most abiding forms of racism â in australians are directed toward our own indigenous population
' i think the racist element [ in australians ] lies in the difficulty in grappling with past and present
' while protests about islam infiltrating australians have dominated the media , ms msimang said she started to recognise a systematic approach to ' assimilate â and ' eradicate ' australians âs indigenous heritage , simply by denying that aboriginal australian 's have different needs to white australians

in her article ms msimang said the australians government employed tactics of â trickery , disposition and violence â that are â as ugly as you âll find anywhere in the world â
ms msimang slammed prime minster tony abbott for his ' out of touch ' comments that claim australians could no longer â subsidize lifestyle choices if those lifestyle choices are not conducive to the kind of full participation in australians society that everyone should have

she said aboriginal people do n't make a ' lifestyle choice ' to live on the land , instead , it 's their connection with country that 's meant they 've stayed there and the fact that such plans could be even contemplated speaks to a â far larger problems in this country
â â right now the conversation in australians exists in the past which only allows people to say â oh , they need to get over it , we used to be racist but we are nât anymore ' while ms msimng made note that these â startling â practices are all too similar to those implemented during south africa âs apartheid , she maintains south africa has started to move forward by recognising race difference where australians continues to deny the issue
â right now the conversation in australians exists in the past which only allows people to say â ' oh , they need to get over it , we used to be racist but we are nât anymore '' , ' she said
â she said australians 's need to â lance the wound â so they can have conversations based on honesty rather than ' fake kindness â â australians âs are the nicest racists i have ever met but you have to realise we [ black people ] are not going to break if we start to have real conversations about difference
