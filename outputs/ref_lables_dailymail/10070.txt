sensors at argentina 's esperanza base on the northern tip of the antarctic peninsula recorded a temperature of 17.5 Â° c ( 63.5 â° f )
according to meteorologists this is potentially a new record for the warmest temperature measured on the frozen continent
the new temperature record was measured on the northern tip of the antarctic peninsula ( pictured ) where the ice shelf covering the sea has declined considerably in recent years and glaciers are thought to be receding over a two day period last week temperatures reached 17.4 Â° c ( 63.3 â° f ) and 17.5 Â° c ( 63.5 Â° f )
the previous hottest temperature recorded in antarctica - which is usually the coldest place on earth - was in april 24 1961 when the temperature reached 17.1 Â° c ( 62.8 â° f )
' this week 's record temperatures were made possible by an unusually extreme jet stream contortion that brought a strong ridge of high pressure over the antarctic peninsula , allowing warm air from south america to push southwards over antarctica
' at the surface , west to east blowing winds over the antarctic peninsula rose up over the 1,000 - foot high mountains just to the west of esperanza base , then descended and warmed via adiabatic compression ( without transfer of heat ) into a warm foehn wind ( a warm dry wind that blows down a slope )
the graphic above shows rates of thickness change around the antarctic peninsula coastline with areas of most loss in the past 18 years indicated by red circles and areas where ice has increased shown by blue circles however , the antarctic peninsula is one of the fastest warming spots on earth
while most of the continent has experienced an increase in ice sheet mass , nearly 10,000 square miles of ice has been lost from the ice shelves off coast of the antarctic peninsula
the collapse of the larson b shelf ( shown above ) on the antarctic peninsula is one example of the changes that have been taking place on the continent in recent years and have caused concern among some scientists marine sediment cores suggest the changes happening in the area are unprecedented at least in the past 10,000 years
this graphic shows how warm water from the ocean may be increasing the flow of glaciers from the antarctic peninsula ice sheet as they cause melting from below while fresh snow accumulates on top of the ice sheet gavin schmidt , a climate scientist with nasa 's goddard institute for space studies in new york , told national geographic that last year antarctica also logged a record cold temperature
currently the world meteorological society records the warmest temperature on the continent as being at vanda station on the opposite side antarctica on 1 may 1974 when temperatures reached 15 Â° c ( 59 â° f ) .
