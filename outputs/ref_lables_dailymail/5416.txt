across the globe , more than 42 million children under the age of five are overweight or obese
should fast food and sugary drink companies be allowed to advertise their junk food to children ? should tv ads promoting unhealthy food and drink be banned until the watershed , or wiped out altogether to save adults ' waistlines too ? a recent survey by the british heart foundation showed two fifths of parents are badgered by their children each week to buy food after seeing it advertised on tv , prompting the charity to deliver a 30,000 strong petition asking the government to ban junk food adverts being shown before the 9pm watershed a recent british heart foundation survey quizzed more than 2,000 parents with children under the age of 16
it showed two fifths of them are badgered by their children each week to buy food after seeing it advertised on tv , and feel that tv junk food adverts make it difficult to help their children eat a healthy diet
the british heart foundation has therefore just delivered a 30,000 strong petition , asking government to ban junk food adverts from being shown before the 9pm watershed , to help protect our children from making unhealthy choices
dr sally norton criticised coca cola 's sponsorship of the london eye , noting it gives the company the chance to advertise to almost four million visitors a year as someone at the forefront of managing obesity , i am furious that we are allowing blatant advertising to influence our children in other ways
take coca cola 's sponsorship of the london eye
with london eye staff apparently wearing coca cola branded uniforms to match the promotional material displayed around this family attraction , the company gets the chance to advertise to 3.75 million direct visitors a year
what 's more , we will do plenty of advertising for them as we promote the ' coca cola ' london eye , our top paid - for tourist attraction , around the world
dr norton backs the british heart foundation 's bid to ban tv junk food ads before 9pm merlin entertainments , who own the london eye , said customers were able to make their own minds up about what to include in their diets
reducing tv advertising to children as the british heart foundation are suggesting , will , of course reduce the number of junk food advertisements children see
but , as the london eye disgrace shows , junk food advertising is n't limited to tv
our children seem to spend an increasing amount of time online , actively engaging in social media , and the junk food and drink manufacturers are busy providing games , social networking apps and other tools to promote their brands in cyberspace where the adults often fear to tread
a study by the children 's food campaign , of 100 websites featuring food likely to be bought or requested by children , found that more than 80 per cent of online adverts were associated with foods classed as less healthy and therefore not allowed to be advertised during children 's tv programmes
she says : ' as coca cola knows all too well , linking its product to happy and exciting events such as visiting the london eye is likely to forever link coca cola to the idea of ' fun ' in the minds of impressionable kids ' sponsorship , whether of tourist attractions or sporting events like the olympics , is another great way of ensuring that products trigger positive connections â harnessing the feel - good factor , which can last well into the future
