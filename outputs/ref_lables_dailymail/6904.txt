mccall watched rangers bounce back to winning ways before warning his players they must show further improvement in the push for promotion
the ibrox side recovered from their defeat against queen of the south as two goals from nicky law and one each from nicky clark and haris swamped raith in a 4 - 0 victory
mccall , though , was nât happy with some of lax moments within their performance and insisted that better will be needed for wednesday night âs trip to face a livingston side fighting for survival
nicky law celebrates after putting his side 3 - 0 up as rangers cruised to victory over raith that meeting with the championship âs bottom club is rangers â game in hand over hibernian , providing the chance to push three points clear in the battle for second place
â it was okay , â reflected mccall on the victory over raith , who are locked in mid-table safety
â i thought the game today might pan out as it did , but wednesday will be different with livingston flying in terms of their recent results
â there is no singing and dancing today
i still think that we âll need to be better and we can be better , â said mccall
mccall has warned rangers to be on their guard against livingston in midweek the pick of the rangers goals again came from haris , who has scored in each of his last five ibrox appearances
the newcastle united loanee has netted seven times in 12 rangers outings overall
â we tried to swap it around by playing a diamond and by getting haris into more space , â added mccall , who expects another of the loanees , shane ferguson , to begin training with rangers today
