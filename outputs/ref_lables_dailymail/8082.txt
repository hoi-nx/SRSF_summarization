but the story of viv â who died on saturday aged 79 â is an exuberant lesson in what happens when you ignore all the advice and just blow the lot
when viv , a cake - factory worker from castleford in yorkshire , and her coal miner husband keith won Â£ 152,319 , 18 shillings and 8d on the littlewoods pools in 1961 â the equivalent of around Â£ 3 million today â she announced that her life from now on would emphatically be neither sensible nor boring
â just imagine , â grinned viv
â and then â in a phrase that decades later became the title of a hit musical starring barbara dickson â she famously announced that she was going to â spend , spend , spend â
unbeknown to the media , viv was so poor that she could nât even afford a pair of tights for the press conference , and had to borrow her sister âs
she was earning just Â£ 7 a week at the factory , and her husband the same amount in night shifts
â the story of viv â who died on saturday aged 79 â is an exuberant lesson in what happens when you ignore all the advice and just blow the lot after the cheque presentation ceremony at the grosvenor house , she collapsed into the arms of the man who had handed the couple their massive winnings â bruce forsyth
soon after breakfast , viv was good to her word â she went out and started on her mission
and of course , in the style of every pools and lottery winner , viv bought the car of her dreams
the couple âs propensity for bubbly was such that viv was known to wash in it
viv also claimed they had to buy a new luxury car every six months , as she pranged them so often
viv pictured outside the west end production of ' spend , spend , spend ' in 2000 for some , viv âs behaviour encapsulated the nascent consumer culture that was heralded by harold macmillan âs famous words from a few years before that the british people had â never had it so good â
although viv was undeniably susceptible to such commercial pressures , there were other problems
â as well as struggling to cope with their excessive penchant for alcohol , both keith and viv struggled to adjust to a strange new social life
it did nât help that viv had a temper , and she and keith often fought
that crash not only robbed viv of a husband , but it also took away what remained of their wealth
barbara dickson ( left ) , star of the musical spend spend spend and viv , upon whose life story the musical was based by then , the couple had blown half of their winnings , and in the wake of his death , harold wilson âs labour government with its punitive tax system helped itself in death duties to the remaining half
â even his watch , â viv would bitterly recall
within little more than four years , viv had gone from rags to riches to rags again
however , the managers wanted more from viv than just her voice , and insisted she should strip at the end of the song
viv agreed , but only if she could keep her underwear on
her request was refused , but viv was defiant
â â viv still refused to strip , and the following night was indeed sacked
â viv also spent time with lawyers to claw back some of the fortune taken by the taxman
she recovered a few thousand , quickly spent in the way that viv knew best â on booze and the high life
to find some security , viv remarried , and did so in her unique style three times in quick succession
without a bean and back in castleford , viv tried to commit suicide , and was admitted to a mental institution
this was turned into a bbc play , in which viv was memorably portrayed by actress susan littler
but , despite it all , viv never rued a single day in 1984 , morrissey , lead singer of the smiths , selected a vintage photo of viv to grace the sleeve of the band âs latest single , heaven knows i âm miserable now
and in 1999 , that west end musical took off , earning viv a hefty Â£ 100,000 in royalties
one might have thought that by then viv would have learned her lesson
but , despite it all , viv never rued a single day
â of course , it is easy for us to judge how viv spent her life
