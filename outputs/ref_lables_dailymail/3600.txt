their invention numbs the skin prior to the jab by producing a rapid chemical reaction to cool the patient 's skin
' our device is 3d printed and consists of two sealed chambers containing the chemical ammonium nitrate and water , ' mr hua said
' we then numb the skin by contacting the device 's metal surface to the patient 's skin
they noted that a commonly used medicated topical patch takes about an hour to work , whereas their new device ' works on the order of seconds and minutes ' , mr zhang said
the team designed the device to be single - use , rather than reusable to avoid the difficulties of cleaning it and resetting the device
it costs around $ 2 ( Â£ 1.34 ) to produce , they said the trio said the device could also be used to ease the pain of ear piercings and tattooing , and help reduce swelling
the device is 3d printed and consists of two sealed chambers containing the chemical ammonium nitrate and water
the skin can then be numbed by contacting the device 's metal surface to the patient 's skin
within 60 seconds the patient 's skin is numb and they can have an injection without experiencing pain
some of the solutions the trio researched were highly technical and required a materials science degree , or skills the first - year students had not yet learned
' the team designed the device to be single - use , rather than reusable to avoid the difficulties of cleaning it and resetting the device
the team from rice university in houston said the device could be used in future for those having tattoos , or people wanting to get their ears pierced without suffering the pain ' the materials for one of these cost about a quarter , and then we just had to do estimates based on how much manufacturing would cost
' we compared our device to similar things already in production , and we 've estimated the cost at about $ 2 ( Â£ 1.34 )
' the team is currently in the process of applying for a provisional patent for the device , and the students hope to continue their work together in their spare time when they return to rice in their second year
