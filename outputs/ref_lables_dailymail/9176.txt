andrew flintoff fears pietersen is ' running out of time ' to resurrect his england career
andrew flintoff , speaking at the ecb 's natwest t20 launch , sees a bright summer and lasting future ahead for ' probably the premier tournament ' in this country
the dual ashes - winning all - rounder is less convinced , however , about pietersen 's prospects of forcing his way back into test contention
pietersen scored 170 for surrey in the parks as he bids to earn a recall to the england squad former england star andrew flintoff thiks time is running out for pietersen to resurrect his england career pietersen already has three ashes series wins on his cv but will be 35 before the 2015 edition begins , and andrew flintoff senses he no longer has age on his side
the controversial record - breaking batsman has been surplus to requirements since being sacked 14 months ago after alastair cook 's team were whitewashed 5 - 0 in australia , but has taken heart from incoming ecb chairman colin graves ' hints that there may be a way back after all
pietersen and his agent have both spoken of the ' clean slate ' being presented to him , and he began restating his case by hitting 170 against mccu oxford in his first red - ball innings for surrey since june 2013
andrew flintoff is concerned nonetheless that there is simply no vacancy for pietersen
' he 's a fantastic player , but nobody just walks into any team - especially the england team , ' i 'm back , i 'm here , i 'm playing ' , ' andrew flintoff told press association sport
england have won their last three tests under alastair cook , pre-dating a miserable world cup , and took a three - figure first - innings lead in the first match of three in the west indies
pietersen has not featured for england since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago it is hard to identify anyone in their middle order who should step aside , on current form
' which of them do you say " you 're not playing ! " for pietersen to come in ? ' andrew flintoff said
' i just think pietersen is running out of time a little bit
' if he 'd started the season last year with surrey , and scored run after run and put himself in the position ... whereas now i think he 's looking at the ashes and he 's just running out of time
' andrew flintoff is optimistic about england 's fortunes , despite their winter woes , with or without pietersen
' the former england star is hoping to win back his test place with a return to red ball cricket england , andrew flintoff believes , just need a little more support
andrew flintoff says alastair cook is so important to england despite poor showing in the first test against west indies andrew flintoff said : ' the competition gets stronger
