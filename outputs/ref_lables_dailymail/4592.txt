scientists have used cosmic rays from the distant universe to study lightning and thunderclouds in unprecedented detail
cosmic rays constantly bombard earth âs atmosphere , and there have been some suggestions they could even trigger lightning
but this particular experiment observed how cosmic rays were affected by lightning as they passed through it - providing information on the electrical field of a given storm
scientists in netherlands were using the lofar radio telescope
they found it could measure changes in lightning caused by cosmic rays ( illustrated )
a storm can have hundreds of millions of volts over multiple kilometres
the method could provide a novel way to understand thunderclouds the experiment was conducted using the lofar ( lofar ) radio telescope in the netherlands
researchers found , almost by accident , that cosmic rays were a suitable probe to measure electric fields within thunderclouds
called cosmic rays , they 're up to a billion times more energetic than particles at cern 's large hadron collider
though they were discovered decades ago , cosmic rays at these high energies are very rare , making it difficult to pinpoint where in the universe they originated
it was found to be as strong as 50 kilovolts per one metre ( 3.3ft ) - which translates into a voltage of hundreds of millions of volts over multiple kilometres , an enormous amount of energy
