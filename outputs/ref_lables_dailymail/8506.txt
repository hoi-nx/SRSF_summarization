the saviour of english football turns out to be a long - haired argentine who tripped michael owen to give away the penalty that david beckham converted in the 2002 world cup finals
mauricio pochettino , 43 , who has long since lost the flowing locks in favour of something a little more in keeping with his managerial status , has gathered a considerable reputation since arriving in england just over two years ago
mauricio pochettino could be the saviour of english football thanks to his faith in homegrown talent the argentine has gathered a considerable reputation since arriving in england just over two years ago townsend ( second left ) celebrates his goal for england alongside his young tottenham team - mates in the week in which four of his young tottenham players â harry kane , townsend , ryan mason and walker â all played for england , ryan mason has paid tribute to the impact the argentine has had on the english game
a year ago an england debut was the last thing on ryan mason âs mind
but , when tim sherwood was replaced by mauricio pochettino , 23 - year - old ryan mason had reasons to be cheerful
( left - right ) ryan mason , walker , townsend and harry kane celebrate in the game against italy ryan mason made his debut for england against italy in midweek after breaking into the tottenham team this season which managers have the most faith in young , english talent ? the the mail on sunday looked at premier league clubs in the past three years ( since the start of the 2012 - 13 season ) to see where homegrown talent was getting the most opportunities to play
after counting the amount of premier league starts handed out by each manager to english players aged under 23 , the percentage of each manager âs total starting selections shows that mauricio pochettino ( below ) , of active bosses , backs young talent most
this table shows the top 10 and bottom six managers ( out of 42 ) , showing their total player selections and games , and the percentage of all starters who fit our â young and english â criteria
mauricio pochettino âs record of sticking by english players such as rickie lambert , adam lallana and jay rodriguez , and backing youngsters such as luke shaw , calum chambers and james ward-prowse in the southampton first team , struck a chord with ryan mason and his peers
the argentine is a godsend for fa chairman greg dyke , whose commission is attempting to find ways to nudge more managers into playing their young english players rather than rely on often mediocre , imported talent
â he is honest and picks the team on how you âre training , â said ryan mason of his manager
â ryan mason , harry kane and walker were quick to congratulate their team - mate townsend on scoring england âs spectacular equaliser in the 1 - 1 draw with italy
another man who enjoyed mauricio pochettino âs support may soon be joining those four in the england squad
james ward-prowse ( right ) of southampton could be another to soon join them in the england squad england boss roy hodgson admitted 20 - year - old ward-prowse is another player currently in their thoughts ryan mason âs parents missed his england debut as high winds caused their flight to italy to be cancelled
tottenham â ryan mason , who plays at burnley today , said : â they were devastated
â â we like him , â said england manager roy hodgson
â ryan mason believes more youngsters would come through if managers were willing to take a chance on the likes of him
premier league clubs can not expect to match those european giants unless the english game produces a foundation of top talent
but the mail on sunday research demonstrates just which clubs and , more importantly , which managers are prepared to take a risk on young english talent
using that criterion and then listing which managers have started with english players under the age of 23 in the past three seasons , mauricio pochettino emerges as the champion of the english among current premier league bosses
so quite where ryan mason and his like would be without argentine support is open to question
mauricio pochettino , it appears , is already doing more to change the culture of english football than any commission or directive .
