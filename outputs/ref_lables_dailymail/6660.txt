despite the clash , the cambridge plans to do â everything he can â to be at the official commemorations to mark the centenary of the gallipoli and anzac campaigns at the cenotaph on april 25 , kensington palace said yesterday
a spokesman for william said : â the duke âs intention is to be at the commemorations
â although her due date has not officially been confirmed , the kate told wellwishers at a charity event last month : â i âm due mid-april , to the end of april
â palace sources later said the actual date was april 25
the duke committed to being present at the commemorations in february and , according to aides , plans to play things by ear
â should kate , 33 , go into labour while the duke is at work , he faces a dash across the country to get to st mary in london in time

despite reports that there is a helicopter on stand - by , the duke , 32 , will make the journey by car instead
william is currently training for his new job as an air ambulance pilot at three airbases in cambridge , norwich or gloucestershire â both names will be on the notice of birth posted outside buckingham palace , but it will be thorpe-beeston who will take charge , â the spokesman added
the consultant â who is believed to have looked after kate when she was sick with hyperemesis gravidarum during her first trimester â will be the first person the kate calls when she goes into labour
