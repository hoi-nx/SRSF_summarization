as the sun sets on the saharan desert , its colours cast a glow on its vast sand dunes causing rainbow light to dance across the landscape
and nasa has captured how this stunning show appears from space using its landsat 7 satellite
it shows ' ribbons ' of sand and patterned stripes known as linear dunes in the erg chech , a desolate sand sea in southwestern algeria - but the exact cause of these longitudinal structures is not known
linear dunes , like these captured by nasa 's landsat 7 satellite , are straight ridges of sand that have been known to measure as long as 99 miles ( 160km )
this image shows ' ribbons ' of sand and patterned stripes in an area known as the erg chech , a desolate sand sea in southwestern algeria - but the exact cause of these longitudinal structures is not known the image was spotted by io9 and the colours were caused as rays of sunlight hit the sand and were reflected off
one theory , suggested by steven hanna in 1969 in his formation of longitudinal sand dunes by large helical eddies in the atmosphere paper , is that linear dunes are created by helical roll vortices
' observations in the atmosphere and in the laboratory indicate that dominant forms of motion in the boundary layer of the atmosphere are counter-rotating helical roll vortices aligned along the wind
' one theory , suggested by steven hanna in 1969 , is that the linear dunes are created by helical roll vortices ( illustrated left )
he said professor hanna compared data on the spacing of linear dunes with the expected dimensions of helical roll vortices in subtropical desert areas , concluding their ' probable wavelength was 1.9 miles to 3.7 miles ( 2km to 6km )
' the observed scale of helical roll vortices is in many cases much larger than average dune spacing , suggesting that linear dunes are not the product of such atmospheric motions , ' explained mr lancaster
' evidence for the existence of helical roll vortices in linear dune landscapes is slight
' barchans ' are crescent - shaped sand dunes ( top left ) that form in regions where there is almost unidirectional wind
if windblown sand comes from one direction , a dune will be a crescent - shaped barchan but if winds switch direction seasonally they become linear ( pictured left centre and in morocco right ) while in the ' formation of the complex linear dunes in the central taklimakan sand sea , chinese ' study , chinese researcher wang and his colleagues said that in the case of ' complex ' linear dunes - that are a combination of two shapes - the theory of barchans evolution may play a role
' barchans ' are crescent - shaped sand dunes that form in regions where there is almost unidirectional wind
erg ' comes from the arabic word for ' field of sand dunes ' mr wang said : ' complex linear dune formation is shown to have five stages
' the researchers continued that after the complex linear dunes develop , local wind patterns and the amount of sand suggest it is possible for them to maintain their linear shape , rather than evolving into star shapes for example , even as wind direction changes
