it is a cold , spring night in the heart of liverpool at a football ground bordering huyton , where steven gerrard grew up , so paul scholes is in unfamiliar territory
it has been a frustrating night for salford city , the club paul scholes co-owns with former manchester united team - mates ryan giggs , gary neville , phil neville and nicky butt

and even from paul scholes âs long - distance view the ripple of net is immediately visible as the ball beats the keeper and seddon turns away to celebrate
paul scholes , too , punches the air , his face beaming as it once did when he scored a last - minute goal against manchester city in april 2010
this must compare to watching manchester united in a title run - in
â seddon âs late goal set the wheels in motion for a fantastic run that has seen salford win six on the bounce , their latest victory away at burscough on saturday
it takes them five points clear of darlington , who have a game in hand , at the top of the evo-stik league first division north ( four tiers below the football league )
remarkably , salford city are the team who have happened upon five of the biggest names in english football as owners
the former manchester united players , otherwise known as the class of â 92 , are products of the premier league era which has propelled the game into a celebrity culture
here , though , they seem in their element and none more so than paul scholes
earlier phil neville was with him

a queue of fans wait for food duing the evo-stick league northern premier match jimmy birtwhistle , pictured with his grandsons , is a committee member and has looked after the turnstile for the past six years although yesterday âs 2 - 1 win at burscough extended salford âs lead at the top , the season has been anything but a smooth ride
both gary neville and phil neville say they did contact him to talk through their reasons but the offer was refused
â that was a low moment and not something we want to do often because there are good people at this level and you do nât want them to lose their job , â said phil neville
when power was in charge , paul scholes and phil neville attended training and helped out with sessions but , under the new managers , that has come to an end
â we had become the meddling owners , everything we did nât want to be , â said phil neville
gary neville takes up the story
â phil neville and paul scholes became quite involved in the first three or four months and we found that what might have been seen as a positive did nât work out that way , â he said
â you never win away games at night in midweek , â said phil neville
â former manchester united striker danny webber now plays for salford city salford city 's game against clitheroe town on saturday was free admission for fans captain christopher lynch works a night shift loading gas bottles , physically demanding work , and usually has to come off after 70 minutes in evening games to go to work
â you can understand how , when emotions are running high , owners can make bad emotional decisions like bringing players in on big money and putting yourself under financial pressure , â said phil neville

and though ryan giggs and nicky butt have nât been able to attend as much , because of their coaching duties at manchester united , paul scholes and phil neviile clearly feel the same
