a real - life willy wonka has laid claim to making the most extravagant chocolate creation - a seven - foot - tall , five - foot - wide easter egg made using 352lbs of chocolate
hansen 's egg is so big that it took him three days to put together and is made from layers of belgian chocolate which covers an iron frame
the creation had to be completed using a step ladder and is the equivalent of 1,600 chocolate bars
hansen with his 7ft tall easter egg which he will sell off in pieces to raise money for st barnabas hospice mr hansen hopes to raise Â£ 1,000 from the sale of the egg for st barnabas hospice
the giant treat , which has since been wrapped in cellophane complete with a bow on top , was made with melted chocolate which had to be tempered overnight
the 58 - year - old chocolatier commissioned an iron worker to make a special frame for his egg , which was then wrapped in grease proof paper and cling film , before being covered in chocolate
due to the nature of chocolate contracting after it cools , mr hansen had to add layer upon layer of chocolate using a palette knife over a three - day period
mr hansen , who has been in the chocolate business for almost three decades , currently has the egg on display at his shop chocolate house in folkingham , sleaford , folkingham linconshire layers of chocolate cover an egg - shaped iron frame which the chocolatier had specially commissioned in the past he has made giant easter eggs but never one that has sized up to his current creation which measures five feet in width
on easter sunday the egg is to be cracked using a hammer before it is sold off to punters who have already been sizing up the egg
mr hansen said : ' it is a fair size and it makes a massive difference compared to the others i have made in the past
' the iron frame was wrapped in grease proof paper and cling film mr hansen lost his brother cullum , 59 , two years ago after he was diagnosed with a brain tumour and towards the end of his illness had need of the services provided by a hospice
