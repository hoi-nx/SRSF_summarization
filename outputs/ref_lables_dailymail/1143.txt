according to hacked sony emails , peggy siegal said that the voting panel objected to having a british director paint their country in a bad light
she said that steve mcqueen would not win as the academy did not want such a dark message about the us to be â sent around the world â
the emails also reveal that a hollywood blockbuster of dr who is in the works - but not for a few years
but sony reacted with fury and a spokesman said that the company wanted to â strongly condemn â assange âs actions
the email from peggy siegal , who has been called the most powerful pr on the east coast of us , was sent to former sony pictures entertainment chair amy pascal in october 2013

she was also wrong about the film and 12 years a slave did win the best picture oscar
the tranche of emails were stolen last year by group calling itself guardians of peace , though it later emerged that it was the work of north korea in response to the release of the sony film : â the interview â , a parody about the secretive communist nation
when north korea threatened to carry out further attacks at screenings sony cancelled the opening but changed its mind after pressure from the white house
she said that steve mcqueen would not win as the academy did not want such a dark message about the us to be â sent around the world â

but by then the damage to sony âs reputation was already done
an email sent in january last year from wong , president of international production for sony , to the company âs chief executive michael lynton explains the plans
â pascal has already been fired by sony and is due to formally leave the company next month to set up her own production company
