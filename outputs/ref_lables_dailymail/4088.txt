the residence : inside the private world of the white house by kate andersen brower for american , the white house is as iconic and royal a palace as you can get
for non-americans , it is a respected power symbol , but not one to be especially loved
kate brower , an american journalist assigned to cover the obama white house , became intrigued by the workings of the mansion after watching downton abbey.she set about interviewing the staff , who number at least 100 , to build up a comparable picture of the american version of upstairs , downstairs
the staff all live out in washington and commute in
those on duty can not go home until the president retires and goes to bed
so they see little of their families and are often divorced as a result
the pay is not great , but the job is prestigious and passed by personal recommendation among friends
most of them have stayed there for 20 years or more
ronald reagan ( pictured with his wife , nancu ) , on the other hand , was over-chummy , so eager to talk to them that servants actually tried to dodge him in order not to get caught for hours the west wing is the president âs office quarters ; the east wing belongs to the first lady and her office staff
â the residence â , as the living quarters are called , really begins on the second floor and is kept hidden from the hundreds of tourists who parade through the state rooms every afternoon
keeping the organisation running smoothly , from the workshops in the basement to the snipers on the roof , is a complex operation
it costs money â $ 13 million a year from government funds , plus a hefty contribution from the first family itself
presidents and their wives have to pay for their own food and drink and that of their personal guests
they are also charged for dry - cleaning
even well - heeled first ladies are always appealing to keep the bills down , especially in the kitchens where top chefs are above such considerations as cost
the white house is never untenanted
the staff include ushers , chefs , maids , doormen , engineers , plumbers , full - time florists ( the flower bill is enormous ) , even calligraphers who are kept busy writing invitations in fine script
the black staff , especially the elderly butlers who remembered segregation , are especially proud to serve the obamas as the first black presidential family
one found obama and his wife , michelle , celebrating gaining the white house on their first night there with an impromptu dance to a record by mary j. blige
and yet the obamas have turned out to be rather reserved and distant with the staff â even , says one , â stand - offish â
most women on the staff thought he âd got what he deserved
the feuding clintons were the talk of the staff , who overheard their bad language and the sound of objects being thrown in bedrooms
â we âre pretty sure she clocked him with a book , â said one member of staff
he undressed in front of the staff and gave them instructions while sitting on the lavatory , whose seat had to be replaced with a bigger one when he broke it
