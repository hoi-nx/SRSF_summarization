if you needed more proof that efron has officially left the weedy teenager of high school musical behind to become a bona - fide buff babe , you 've got it
pictured on the set of his latest film , bad grandpa , efron still managed to make us swoon despite wearing nothing but nude pants and a stuffed bumble bee
this got femail thinking about how many child stars have grown into stunning adults , and how many have n't ... have n't you grown : we got a sneak peek at efron 's hot bod as well as his new film , bad grandpa , on tuesday
he 's come along way since his high school musical days ... it seems like only yesterday that efron 's baby blues peeped out at from beneath his sweeping fringe as he serenaded us in high school musical
so now he 's 27 we are more than happy to be able to perve over his bulging biceps , hard six pack and toned legs ... at first , efron appeared to be among the few male child stars who have blossomed as adults , with the girls ruling the ' i was cute and now i 'm hot ' world
the obvious exceptions are ryan gosling - is there a hot list he is n't on ? - and justin
always a handsome lad , ryan gosling went from a blond ' young hercules ' to appearing on every hot list ever justin has sorted his hair , got rid of those awful earrings and , how do we say this - grown into his face after digging a little deeper , however , we remembered saved by the bell from saved by the bell , aka mario lopez , whose dimples have dazzled for decades
joseph gordon-levitt has grown from being the long - haired awkward boy into a suave - looking gent saved by the bell from saved by the bell , aka mario lopez , has dimples that have dazzled for decades taylor lautner still has a baby face after all these years , but his new manly facial hair has got him on our list many cute - as - a - button boys , however , failed to grow into the hunks they could have been
now lusted after by everyone from vampires to werewolves , there must be something in anna paquin 's blood ... meanwhile , harry potter must have waved his magic wand at hermione ( no that 's not a euphemism ) , as emma watson grew from a pretty pixie into , well , a pretty pixie
anna paquin won an oscar at the age of just seven , but she 's more likely to win style awards today ... emma watson has grown from a pretty pixie into , well , a pretty pixie
she 's doing a great job of shirking her squeaky clean teen image , from twerking on stage to writhing around naked on a wrecking ball
as for the boys ? we 'll do the male species a favour by not taking a look at justin bieber ... duff kept her image clean after rising to fame as a singer and actress in lizzie mcguire - although admittedly we 're not 100 % sure on her green / grey hair just yet cyrus has caused controversy ever since her hannah montana days
