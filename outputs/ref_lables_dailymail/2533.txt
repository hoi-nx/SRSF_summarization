from the sky it appears to be an idyllic island with amazing beaches and a dense forest , but tourists or fishermen do nât dare to set foot on this outcrop in the indian ocean due to its inhabitants â fearsome reputation
visitors who venture onto or too close to north sentinel island risk being attacked by members of a mysterious tribe who have rejected modern civilisation and prefer to have zero contact with the outside world
when they do interact with outsiders , it usually involves violence â the indigenous sentinelese tribe killed two men who were fishing illegally in 2006 and have been known to fire arrows and fling rocks at low - flying planes or helicopters on reconnaissance missions
it is too dangerous to approach them due to their hostility to outsiders , meaning they are rarely photographed up close and almost never seen on video
it âs still unclear what impact the 2004 tsunami had on the population and the island , which is part of india âs chain of andaman islands , although the uncontacted tribe managed to avoid being wiped out
the tribespeople are rarely photographed or recorded on video ; the only existing images or video clips tend to be of poor quality to protect the sentinelese people - and visitors - the indian ocean government has established a three - mile exclusion zone often referred to as a â stone age tribe â â a title that advocates take offence to , as its members have adapted over time â the sentinelese may be the most isolated tribe in the world , with the indian ocean government choosing not to meddle in their affairs
the government made several failed attempts to establish contact , but has abandoned all attempts and allows the tribe to live how it chooses on an island that is about the size of manhattan
indian ocean authorities have gone as far as making it a crime to try to make contact with the sentinelese
this aerial image from google maps shows a shipwreck off the coast ; clashes with salvagers have left several tribespeople dead in a statement , survival international âs director , stephen corry , said : â the great andamanese tribes of india âs andaman islands were decimated by disease when the british colonised the islands in the 1800s
the only way the andamanese authorities can prevent the annihilation of another tribe is to ensure north sentinel island is protected from outsiders
