one in every six species of animals could face extinction if we do nothing to combat climate change , scientists claim
the bleak study says animals are most at risk in south america , australia , and new zealand
while another group of researchers have added to the forecast with a separate study , which warns that marine animals near north america , antarctica and new zealand are most likely to die out
scientists warn that one in every six species of animals could face extinction if we do nothing to combat climate change and those in south america , australia , and new zealand are most at risk
a stock image of an endangered flightless kÄkÄpÅ parrot , native to new zealand , is shown scientists from the university of connecticut warned that one in six animals are at risk of extinction , particularly in regions where shrinking habitats and barriers to migration compound the problem
he proposes that the rate of extinction will speed up in line with rising temperatures
if future temperatures increase by only two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels , the extinction risk would increase from 2.8 to 5.2 per cent

antarctica , which is home to many species of penguins ( stock image ) is one of these places but if global warming maintains its current trajectory and a 4.3 degree increase , that could increase to 16 per cent , he said
but if global warming maintains its current trajectory and a 4.3 degree increase , that could increase to 16 % , the study warns , which could be bad news for endangered jaguars in a separate study from the uc berkeley in california , scientists examined extinction rates in fossils over 23 million years
they found that the tropics and antarctica are most at risk and animals such as whales and dolphins are especially vulnerable another study published at the same time has compounded the warning
scientists at the uc berkeley and other institutions examined fossils to determine which marine life is most at risk of dying out , based on previous rates of extinction
one in six species could face extinction due to the effects of climate change if carbon emissions continue at current rates , it warns
these areas included regions of the tropics such as the indo-pacific and the caribbean , as well as regions such as antarctica that harbour many unique species
â our goal was to diagnose which species are vulnerable in the modern world , using the past as a guide , â said lead author dr seth finnegan , an assistant professor of integrative biology at uc berkeley
