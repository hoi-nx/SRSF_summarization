it was also barcelona âs third â probably the goal that puts this tie beyond reach
here was a goal - scorer at the top of his game , playing for a club that now brings the best out of him
suarez scores his second goal , sending psg keeper sirigu the wrong way , to make it 3 - 0 to barcelona suarez nutmegs luiz for the second time as he eases past the brazilian defender on his way to another stunning strike former chelsea defender luiz is left dejected after being embarrassed by suarez for the second time on wednesday evening suarez ( centre ) celebrates his goal as psg 's players are left dejected after being unable to stop the uruguayan psg ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : sirigu 6 ; van 5.5 , marquinhos 6.5 , thiago silva 5.5 ( luiz 21 , 5.5 ) , maxwell 6 ; rabiot 6 ( lucas 65 , 5 ) , cabaye 5 , matuidi 7 ; lavezzi 5.5 , edison cavani 5.5 , javier pastore 6 subs not used : douchez , camara , bahebeck , digne , kimpembe goals : neymar 18 , suarez 67 , 79 bookings : cabaye , 36 manager : laurent blanc 6 barcelona ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : marc-andre ter stegen 6 ; montoya 6 ( montoya 80 ) , pique 6.5 , mascherano 8 , alba 6.5 ; sergio busquets 7 , rakitic 5.5 ( jeremy mathieu 74 , 5 ) , iniesta 6 ( xavi 53 , 6 ) ; suarez 8.5 , lionel messi 6.5 , neymar 7.5 subs not used : bravo , pedro , rafinha , bartra bookings : pique , lionel messi manager : luis enrique 7 man of the match : suarez referee : mark clattenburg ( england ) 7 stadium : parc des princes by adam crafton lionel messi is playing with joy again , and bringing the best out of neymar and suarez , too
suarez has 11 goals in his last 11 games for barcelona , and six in six in the champions league
suarez was nât schooled in tiki - taka or the barcelona way , but the combination of an energetic high pressing game married to quite gorgeous technique and invention fits him like a glove
psg got a late and lucky consolation goal that some will feel keeps this tie competitive , but for those of a more earthbound persuasion it is hard to see it as anything but over
suarez killed it with his two goals leaving psg to seek a 3 - 0 win at the nou camp inside 90 minutes to progress
luiz was suarez âs victim here , and he took chunks out of his reputation , without so much as a baring of teeth
shorn of key individuals by injury and suspension , laurent blanc started with luiz on the bench â and was forced to promote him to the action after 21 minutes when thiago silva limped out of the game
barcelona were already ahead by then and instantly one feared for luiz against opponents with such flair and movement
suarez would have known that , and known luiz âs defensive frailties even when fit from his time in the premier league , and the way the goals were scored suggested he had no compunction capitalising on it either
suarez scores his first goal of the night to make it 2 - 0 to barcelona after bustling past three psg defenders suarez nutmegs luiz wide on the right touchline on his way to scoring barcelona 's second goal of the evening suarez runs away to celebrate his goal as he joined by his ecstatic team - mate neymar , who had earlier made it 1 - 0 to barcelona suarez is mobbed by his jubilant barcelona team - mates after his first goal as they enjoy their trip to french basically , to get nut - megged once is unfortunate ; to have it happen twice suggests someone is trying to make you look a twit
suarez then held off two psg players as he darted through the tightest of gaps into the penalty area , finishing past an equally defeated keeper sirigu
it is hard to imagine how , even with the fillip of gregory van der wiel âs deflected shot , psg can claw this back
neymar ( centre ) opens the scoring for barcelona after just 18 minutes with a side - foot shot into the bottom right hand corner of the goal neymar celebrates his fourth champions league goal in eight matches this season by putting the ball under his shirt neymar is mobbed by barcelona team - mate lionel messi , who provided the assist for the brazilian 's goal barcelona worked the ball well for neymar to open the scoring - click here to read our brilliant match zone from the game edison cavani was the prime culprit and he had a night of clumsy control and missed opportunity when it mattered most
javier pastore set the tone for psg in front of goal , by making a hash of their first chance of the night
barcelona started well and could have gone ahead when lionel messi hit a post with a curling 20 - yard shot after 14 minutes
it served as a warning and four minutes later barcelona went ahead
from there , barcelona countered with terrifying speed , lionel messi feeding neymar , who finished astutely with only sirigu to beat
javier pastore fluffs his lines as he misses a brilliant chance to put psg 1 - 0 up against the run of play gregory van der wiel 's ( left ) late deflected effort gave psg a glimmer of hope ahead of the second leg next week shortly before half - time the italian was needed again , when luiz took on too much sweeping up at the back and was caught in possession by suarez
