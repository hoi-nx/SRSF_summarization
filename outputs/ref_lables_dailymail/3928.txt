a writer and victim of date rape has revealed why she is pushing for ' yes means yes ' sex contracts to become mandatory on college campuses across the country
new yorker amanda chatel explained in her essay for your tango that adoption of the ' yes means yes ' law , which defines consent as ' affirmative , conscious , and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity ' from each partner , is just one step in combating society 's prevalent rape culture
' inciting change : new yorker amanda chatel explained in an essay that she is a victim of rape who is advocating for ' yes means yes ' laws to be passed in states across the country the ' yes means yes ' law , which was first passed in california in 2014 , is a spin on the old sexual assault mantra ' no means no '
the legislation declares that all colleges and universities taking financial aid funding from california must adhere to the standard for consent outlined by the law , which reiterates that a lack of resistance or objection does not imply consent - a concept that amanda chatel struggled with years following her sexual assault
amanda chatel explained for a long time she blamed herself because he ' came on strong ' and she was a ' bit inebriated ' ' but now , several years later , i know , more than ever , that my consent was not given , and it was rape
no shame : the new yorker wrote that she blamed herself for years after her sexual assault because never actually said ' no ' , even though she was n't a willing participant ' it âs both disheartening and disgusting that we even need a law that stipulates that a woman must be able to give consent or else it âs rape , ' amanda chatel said of today 's rape culture
in connecticut , state officials are now considering the adoption of a similar ' yes means yes ' bill
and while amanda chatel said the law is ' great in theory ' , she explained that ' we need to change the way people think of rape ' before the law will prove to be effective
