miliband vowed to end casual employment contracts yesterday but his crackdown backfired spectacularly as he forgot labour use them miliband was accused of hypocrisy last night after labour town halls and mps were revealed to be hiring thousands of workers on zero - hours contracts
the labour leader yesterday vowed to end casual employment contracts that â undermine living standards and family life â
in a disastrous day for labour âs general election hopes : speaking in huddersfield , mr miliband said a labour government would legislate to require employers to offer a contract to anyone who had been working regular hours for 12 weeks
it emerged that 68 labour mps had also signed up researchers and other staff on zero - hour contracts in the last two years including shadow health secretary andy burnham ( right ) and shadow chancellor ed balls ( left ) freedom of information requests circulated by the conservative reveal that labour councils are behind 21,798 zero - hours contracts
among the worst authorities are wolverhampton , which had 738 staff on zero - hours contracts as of may 2014 ; liverpool with 442 as of september 2014 ; and ealing with 278 as of january 2015
they included shadow health secretary andy burnham , shadow chancellor ed balls , mr miliband âs parliamentary bag carrier karen buck and his election supremo lucy powell
freedom of information requests found 22,000 zero - hours contracts were handed out by labour - run councils , including doncaster ( pictured ) where mr miliband is standing for mp conservative chairman grant shapps said : â it âs the same old hypocrisy from miliband
' on the day he generates a load of hot air about zero - hours contracts it emerges that his party is one of the most prolific users of them
' labour did nothing about zero - hours contracts during its 13 years in power , and now we learn that labour mps and councils use them routinely
â the spotlight was also turned on a number of startling claims made by mr miliband yesterday â whose speech worsened already bad relations with big business
the uk âs official statistician said : â it is not possible to say how much of this increase is due to greater recognition of the term zero - hours contracts rather than new contracts
â however , mr miliband still made the claim the centre - piece of his headline grabbing announcement yesterday
the tories say they have tightened the law to end abuse of zero - hours
labour mp karen buck ( left ) and mr miliband 's election supremo lucy powell ( right ) also use zero - hours chancellor george osborne made similar comments last night , saying : â of course it would be very difficult â¦ there are some zero - hour contracts that people want
matthew irvine , associate at the law firm thomas eggar , said : â to many this will seem an eye - catching and attractive policy with miliband championing workers rights over capitalist employers who are putting profit above workers â welfare
' miliband âs proposal would potentially undermine job creation , jeopardise zero - hours workers â current jobs and increase their insecurity
â yesterday , opening up yet another front in his war on business , miliband pledged a labour government would â end the exploitation of zero - hours contracts â
claim : we have an epidemic of zero - hours contracts in our country
reality : according to the ons , between october and december last year a total of 697,000 people said they were employed on zero - hours contracts in their main job
claim : zero - hours contracts â undermine hard work , undermining living standards , undermining family life
only one in ten on zero - hours contracts said they would like a different job
claim : the tories wo nât end the exploitation of zero - hours contracts
reality : last june the conservative - led government took action to ban so - called exclusivity deals which prevented people on zero - hours contracts from working elsewhere
reality : mr miliband said he could not survive on one of the contracts â but plenty employed by labour councils and officials have to do so
some 68 labour mps are reported to have employed staff on the contracts over the last two years , including ed balls , mr miliband âs parliamentary bag carrier karen buck and his election chief lucy powell
meanwhile , foi requests show labour - run town halls are responsible for 21,798 of the contracts â including 300 in doncaster , where the labour leader is seeking re-election as the local mp
a survey of employers by the chartered institute of personnel and development found that a third of voluntary sector organisations used zero - hours contracts , along with a quarter of public sector employers
