travolta has broken his silence on the controversial scientology exposÃ© going clear and says he never intends to watch the documentary
speaking to the tampa bay times while promoting his upcoming film the forger , travolta said his decades of personal experience in the organization have been nothing but positive -- nothing like the blackmailing , physically abusive cult portrayed in the film
travolta then spoke for the only celebrity whose dealings with scientology get more screen time in going clear than his own , cruise
' i 've been so happy with my experience in the last 40 years ... that i really do n't have anything to say that would shed light on ( a documentary ) so decidedly negative
' those 40 years travolta has spent as a scientologist are addressed head - on in the film , which claims that church elders have blackmailed the 61 - year - old into being one of their most visible cheerleaders
but travolta , despite his refusal to sit through the film , said it 's merely a showcase for ex-members ' who were disgruntled with their experiences ' with scientology
' i 've been brought through storms that were insurmountable , and ( scientology has ) been so beautiful for me , that i ca n't even imagine attacking it , ' why would i even approach a negative perspective ? that would be a crime to me , personally , to do that , ' he said
scientologists hold a ' blackmail file ' on travolta to stop him leaving the faith , which includes ' damaging material ' from his sessions with auditors at the church , the doc claims
sylvia ' spanky ' taylor - once a member of the church and the point of contact with travolta - described a prison camp where members would be forced to work 30 - hour shifts , with around three hours of breaks the film features a number of allegations about how members are threatened and tortured in prison - style camps and cut off from their family if they decide to leave scientology
perhaps the only celebrity discussed more in the film going clear is cruise , whose marriage to kidman the doc claims was picked apart by scientology elders it included interviews with former senior members and officials who made explosive claims about punishments endured by members and how followers have been manipulated
' the documentary also claimed scientology chiefs hold a ' black pr package ' on travolta , with all the disclosures he made during auditing sessions
as well as the claims about travolta , former senior members of the faith told documentary makers about the various forms of punishment meted out by leaders
another form of punishment involved members of the highest ranking order within the scientology church , sea org , whose members are said to be punished by being thrown in ' the hole '
' senior members of scientology , that are part of the higher sea org order , apparently are forced to play musical chairs to bohemian rhapsody by queen to vie for a place in the church , as a form of punishment gibney ( left ) directed the documentary and interviewed senior former members and paul haggis ( right ) in a statement it said : ' the church has documented evidence that those featured in gibney 's film regurgitating their stale , discredited allegations are admitted perjurers , admitted liars and professional anti-scientologists whose living depends on the filing of false claims
' yet gibney and hbo stonewalled more than a dozen requests by the church to offer relevant information about them , with more than 25 individuals with first - hand information eager to speak
to this day , neither hbo nor gibney can deny that they have yet to present the church with a single allegation from the film so the church may have an opportunity to respond
