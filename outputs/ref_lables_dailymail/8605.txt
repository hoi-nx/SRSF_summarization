there wo nât be many who can guess which premier league player picked up my first 10 - out - of - 10 performance of the season this weekend
step forward leicester striker vardy
leicester striker vardy celebrates scoring their late winner to keep their survival hopes alive vardy was being criticised two years ago at leicester but now is a pivotal part of their team jose mourinho ? ronald koeman ? sean dyche ? not even close ... louis van gaal should be crowned manager of the year manuel pellegrini is punching above his weight at leicester ... the club must think big or forever remain small two years ago vardy was being hammered by leicester fans who thought he was useless
at the hawthorns on saturday i witnessed a match - winning performance from the most expensive player ever to come from non-league football
vardy put in a 10 - out - of - 10 performance at the weekend as he inspired leicester to an unlikely victory credit must go to nigel pearson ( bottom left ) and his staff who supported vardy through a tough time it âs vardy âs hold - up play that wins the free - kick for the first leicester goal
and it was his strength that won the ball off gareth macauley on the halfway line - then you can only admire his storming surge towards goal and the quality finish as he rifles the ball into the back of the net for the winner in injury time , embarrassing lescott again
when leicester were nât in possession vardy was chasing everything
when they had the ball , his movement was good â he took up a great position when ulloa missed a sitter just before half - time
but what i saw on saturday was 10 out of 10 from vardy
vardy is not world class or england material yet but put in a brilliant performance on saturday for leicester
