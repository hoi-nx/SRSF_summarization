an account purporting to be sydney radio station 2ue sent out a tweet on thursday morning which appears to have come from a disgruntled former employee
' we hope you like the sound of whinging hyenas reading the news
what looks to a tweet from a disgruntled former radio employee emerged on 2uenews twitter on thursday morning the hashtag was in reference to the station 's former newsreader steve blanda , who had read the news at 2ue for over a decade
last thursday the 90 - year - old radio station 2ue broadcast its last ever bulletin out of the sydney office , following a merger with rival station 2gb
jobs were lost out of the brisbane 4bc office , and at magic 1278
2ue in sydney has just merged with rival station 2gb , which meant job losses from the newsroom and additional redundancies nationally a 2ue spokesman said the new combined newsroom will be staffed by more than 20 journalists from both stations
reporter robert spicer filed a brief story about the history of the station , which has covered every major news story for the most part of the last century including former prime minister gough whitlam 's dismissal , the beaconsfield mine disaster and the recent sydney siege
morrison , a former 2ue breakfast and drive broadcaster , said the station took a financial hit after letting controversial ratings winner alan jones defect to 2gb in 2002
' instead of local presenters in sydney and brisbane alan jones ' ( right ) show will be broadcast in the breakfast slot , while ray hadley ( left ) will present mornings - both from their 2gb programs morrison , who is now spokesman for billionaire mining magnate gina rinehart , said it is a shame the longstanding 2ue-2gb rivalry was now over
