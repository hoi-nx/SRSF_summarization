as jimmy prepares to play his 100th test - needing only three wickets to equal ian botham âs england - record haul of 383 - sportsmail 's lawrence booth spoke to those who knew him and played with him in his early days for burnley , lancashire and england
england quick jimmy plays his 100th test match in antigua against the west indies from monday jimmy needs just three wickets to go level with sir ian botham as england 's top test wicket taker michael brown burnley cc team - mate , now club chairman we used to call jimmy the â pro killer â
playing in the lancashire league , he âd regularly get the opposition professional out
he was quite a slight kid
it was probably when he was 17 that we thought , wow , he âs got some pace
and he had this ability to bowl jaffas
when he bowled so brilliantly against pakistan in the 2003 world cup everyone at burnley was saying : â we âve seen these magic balls before
â jimmy was known as pro killer during his days with burnley , reveals former team - mate and now club chairman michael brown my mum can take some of the credit for jimmy being signed by lancashire
he was bowling really well for burnley , and she rang up john stanworth , who was at the club at the time
jimmy was invited for trials by lancashire and that was that
he was always a shy lad
but he cares very much
john stanworth former lancashire player development manager his potential was brought to my attention by val brown so i âm not going to take credit for unearthing jimmy
i did nât necessarily think he âd be the bowler he is today but there was just something about him
even established batsmen struggled to line him up
i just said : â we âve got a 17 - year - old bowling 80mph and getting the top three out ! â warren hegg jimmy âs first captain at lancashire and wicketkeeper he burst on to the scene in my first year as captain
i thought : â either i âm losing it or this kid âs special â
jimmy ( back row second from left ) ' would nât say boo to a goose but bowled like the speed of light , ' says his 2002 lancashire captain warren hegg ( front row fifth from left ) he was a keeper âs dream
but i could console myself with the thought that i âd kept to england âs best
mike watkinson jimmy âs first coach at lancashire i was coaching the lancashire second team when jimmy arrived
he had wicked pace back then - probably even more than he has now - but he could be a little inconsistent
since then , he âs worked things out for himself
jimmy âs been his own best coach
ian ward jimmy âs first first - class victim : lancashire v surrey , old trafford , may 31 , 2002 he was then as he is now - as lithe as a whippet
sky sports commentator ian ward ( left with shane warne ) was jimmy 's first first - class victim i thought â christ , this guy can bowl ! â in those days lancashire had peter martin and glen chapple and we were nât expecting them to go on forever
mark ramprakash dismissed first ball in the second innings of the above match i faced his first couple of balls in the first innings and they were wide of off stump
but they went through noticeably quickly and hit the keeper âs gloves quite hard
mark ramprakash , now england batting coach , was dismissed lbw with the first ball of the second innings in the second innings he gave me a straight one first ball
nasser hussain jimmy âs first england captain , in 2002 - 03 he came into the team after yet another ashes disaster
jimmy and his first england captain nasser hussain celebrate a wicket during the 2003 world cup for such a young lad , he was nât someone you needed to over-manage or look after
if anything i probably had such a good impression of him that i gave him more responsibility than i should have done - like bowling him instead of andrew caddick at the end of our world cup game against australia at port elizabeth in 2003
it âs one thing being a swing bowler but it âs the way he could get it to go so late
he âs a very clever cricketer
mark butcher man of the match on jimmy âs test debut against zimbabwe at lord 's in 2003 jimmy celebrates the wicket of zimbabwe 's travis friend with michael vaughan ( right ) and robert key ( left ) during his debut test at lord 's in may 2003 , in which mark butcher claimed five wickets and man of the match like jimmy , i took five wickets in that game
it âs an easy thing to do when you âre new to get your bouncer through quickly , then send down something a bit floaty when you bowl a fuller length
