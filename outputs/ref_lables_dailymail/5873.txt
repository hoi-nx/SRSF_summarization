we spent Â£ 400 on a 1940s loo - it took us four months to find one ! claire nugent , 43 , and nigel morter , 47 , have been married for 14 years
they restored a 1940s airfield control tower in norfolk and now run it as a b&b
she says : when nigel morter and i met as students in 1993 we soon discovered we both absolutely loved the 1940s
when we moved in together after university , we âd scour the local north london markets for 1940s pieces while checking out bric - a - brac shops and antique dealers on holiday
they restored a 1940s airfield control tower in norfolk and now run it as a b&b in 2011 , our dreams came true when we bought a world war ii airfield control tower near wells-next-the-sea for Â£ 295,000
it had been used as accommodation or a grain store since the war so needed a lot of work â we spent nearly Â£ 200,000 getting it back to how it used to be
we once bought a cast - iron bath on ebay only to discover it was still installed
we had to pay someone Â£ 250 to drive up with pipe cutters and spanners to dig it out of the bathroom
it cost Â£ 400 from a reclamation yard in the west country â the most we âve paid for something
we spent new year âs eve two years ago desperately driving around trying to find a signal so i could bid on some concertina dividing doors
eventually we managed it with 15 seconds to spare and got them for Â£ 200
it âs been great to bring this great tower back to life ' our biggest expense was the windows , as control towers have so many
we spent around Â£ 45,000 having custom - made replicas , but ours are thankfully double glazed
i invited my ten - year - old nephew to stay and showed him photos of how it had been when we moved in
my biggest weakness is 50s cocktail bars - at one stage i had six emma edwards , 46 , lives with her partner nigel preston , 57 , in manchester
she runs the vintage website missbamboo.co.uk
nigel morter and i have been together for 11 years , but we âve shared a house only for the past three
so , luckily , nigel morter gave me the go - ahead to renovate his place , where we now live , two years ago
in total , the work cost about Â£ 10,000
emma edwards , 46 , lives with her partner nigel preston , 57 , in manchester
she runs the vintage website missbamboo.co.uk and , at one stage , had six 1950s cocktail bars ( left ) the most extravagant item i âve bought is hawaiian vintage tropical wallpaper that has a pink tropical flower and island print
i got four rolls from a specialist website for Â£ 100 each
i made nigel morter take the train with me and we had to lug them back ourselves â they were so heavy and awkward that we had to stand in the space between the carriages the whole way home
the tv is the only modern - looking item , i hate its appearance , but it âs great to watch a vintage movie on and keeps nigel morter happy
yes , i know it 's kitch but that 's why i love the 1960s ursula forbush , 48 , is single , a manager for a charity and lives near bristol
she says : from the red glass vases and psychedelic wallpaper , to the formica tables and g - plan dining suite , everything about my two - bedroom terrace home is a tribute to the late sixties
ursula forbush , 48 , is single
i have a like - minded friend who completely decorated her home in sixties style , and i vowed to one day have my own sixties abode
she said : ' every night i come home to my sixties bubble , switch on my old record player , listen to some vinyl , and all the stresses of 2015 melt away ' i have a record player reminiscent of a white space helmet , and there are original white fluffy flokati rugs on my lounge floor
i also have an orange slow cooker , plus boots heated curlers , and hood - style hairdryer which cost Â£ 5 from a charity shop â i do nât use the hair gadgets in case they blow up
every night i come home to my sixties bubble , switch on my old record player , listen to some vinyl , and all the stresses of 2015 melt away .
