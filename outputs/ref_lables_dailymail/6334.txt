madrid galactico bale will be the subject of a three - way Â£ 75million transfer battle between chelsea , manchester united and manchester city this summer
but sources in spain suggest that the club could be willing to offload him even though manager carlo ancelotti has said he wants the winger to remain at the club
real forward bale is a transfer target for manchester united , chelsea and manchester city bale could be sold by real as they pursue a deal for borussia dortmund star marco reus the complex politics at madrid mean that bale could be traded to help finance the inevitable signing of at least one platinum player during the summer and work within the parameters of financial fair play
marco reus only recently signed a new four - year deal with borussia dortmund
under the terms of his previous contract marco reus had a buy - out clause of Â£ 20m
when bale signed his record Â£ 86m deal to join real from tottenham two years ago he had a Â£ 75m release clause written in
dortmund rate marco reus ( right ) at around Â£ 40million after his Â£ 20m buy - out clause was taken out of his new deal bale has said he wants to stay at real despite becoming unpopular with some fans this season as it stands chelsea would seem favourites to buy bale , and the blues also want real centre half raphael varane
west ham , tottenham and southampton were all in the hunt for the manchester united striker who can be bought from manchester united for Â£ 7m
chelsea appear most likely to sign bale - and they also want his real team - mate raphael varane ( right ) real could look to make hernandez 's loan move a permanent one after his goal against atletico madrid it might have been a simple finish served up by ronaldo , but the late winner hernandez scored to beat city rivals atletico madrid in their champions league quarter - final has lifted the striker to legendary status

i understand sam allardyce is virtually resigned to not being offered a new contract by west ham next season when his current deal expires in the summer
west ham boss sam allardyce is considering managing abroad next season if he is not given a new contract sam allardyce still harbours the ambition of being england coach having just missed out when steve mcclaren was given the job in 2010
sam allardyce believes his cv could be enhanced by managing abroad - in spain , holland or germany
real sociedad manager david moyes is one of the candidates to replace sam allardyce at west ham this summer i am also hearing rio ferdinand could be offered the chance of a swansong in major league soccer depending on which club have spaces when their transfer window opens in june
