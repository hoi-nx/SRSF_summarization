councils are pocketing thousands in change by forcing drivers to overpay for parking because their meters do not accept five or 10 pence coins brought in three years ago
town halls have failed to recalibrate some of the 100,000 ticket machines in the uk - making it impossible for drivers to pay the exact cost of parking
in manchester , where 240 machines are still not upgraded , motorists without old - style coins must use Â£ 1 and two 20p pieces for a typical Â£ 1.25 hour 's parking - handing the council a 15p profit
big profit : town hall bosses in manchester have been accused of pocketing thousands of pounds extra from 240 parking ticket machines in the city because they still do not accept new 5p and 10p pieces the council also charges Â£ 1.85 for an hour and a half and Â£ 3.10 for two hours and 30 minutes , meaning that drivers without the right coins must overpay for them too
nationwide there are 100,000 parking meters yet several councils are still yet to upgrade them to accept the three - year - old 5p and 10p coins
experts fear the problem could become even worse when the new 12 - sided pound coin is released in 2017
manchester drivers have demanded refunds and want to know why the council is yet to upgrade its machines
' coin chaos : the 5p and 10p pieces introduced three years ago are slightly thicker than the old ones , which means that a considerable number of machines still reject them the parking machine he used currently charges of Â£ 1.25 for an hour 's parking , Â£ 1.85 for an hour and a half and Â£ 3.10 for two hours and 30 minutes
the new thicker nickel - plated steel coins were introduced in 2012 by the royal mint and since then , 330million are in circulation while older copper - nickel coins have been steadily recalled
industry chiefs insist the bill for converting parking meters , vending machines and phone boxes to accept the new Â£ 1 coin could be more than Â£ 200million
the 12 - sided coin , which resembles a classic threepenny bit , was announced as a way to fight a surge in the number of Â£ 1 in circulation - a racket that costs the economy some Â£ 45million a year
but roughly 1.2million machines on the market will have to be re-calibrated to fit the new piece , which is set to be introduced in 2017 , according to one industry expert
jonathan hilder , ceo of the automatic vending association , estimated that forgeries make up some 3.03 per cent of the more than 1.5billion Â£ 1 coins in circulation
a freedom of information request to manchester council revealed the town hall made Â£ 14.8m from car parking in 2013/14
