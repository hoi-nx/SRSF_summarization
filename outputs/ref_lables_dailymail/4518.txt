the kidnapper who claims to have masterminded the gone girl kidnapping of huskins in california says he will turn himself in , but only if his co-conspirators are given immunity
in yet another email to the san francisco chronicle , the individuals wrote that police could accept this offer , or that he would ' go overseas and teach english ' or ' live off the grid and read books for the rest of my life
huskins , 29 , was allegedly snatched from her home by kidnappers who tied her boyfriend up on march 23 , then released one day later 400 miles away beside her parents ' home
the old email had demanded that the police make clear that neither denise huskins or her boyfriend quinn - who was with her at the time she was allegedly kidnapped but waited 12 hours to call police - will face any criminal charges
it is not the first email the alleged kidnappers have sent the paper either , also reaching out to them on march 24 with an audio file of denise huskins to prove she was still alive one day after being taken from her home in mare island
they claim they drilled holes in the window of denise huskins and quinn 's home to gain entry , and then used squirt guns with ' strobe flashlights and laser pointers ' attached to them to make it appear as if they were firearms
they say they played ' calming music ' as they went about the abduction , and put monitors on quinn , 30 , so they could make sure he did not go to police
they then say they put denise huskins in the trunk of quinn 's car and drove off with her
the group of three people claim they drilled a hole in a window of denise huskins and quinn 's home ( above ) and used squirt guns that they made to look like guns to take denise huskins the kidnapping , which has been called an ' orchestrated event ' by authorities , has drawn comparisons to the film gone girl ( above ) in the end however , they claim it was a case of mistaken identity , and they did not mean to take denise huskins , thinking that someone else would be in the house
' attorneys for both quinn and denise huskins claim that their clients have confirmed aspects of this email , and that they have sent photos of the holes drilled in the window that the kidnappers used to gain access to prove that whoever sent this note is telling the truth
