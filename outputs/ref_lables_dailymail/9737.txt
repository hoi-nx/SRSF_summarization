here , dr cotton , a senior lecturer in chemistry at the university of birmingham , explains how dnp came to be used as a diet pill , and why it the chemical is so dangerous â¦ writing for the conversation , dr cotton said : eloise aimee parry was the latest of a string of young people to fall victim to the chemical 2,4 - dinitrophenol , known as dnp
it is a very dangerous chemical and scientists have been aware of this for nearly a century
during ww1 , dnp was sometimes used to fill armour - piercing shells , as a mixture with picric acid , known as tridite or tridite
just like tnt it was found to be toxic to the munitions workers handling it
the commercial use of dnp is as a pesticide or herbicide and , in 2009 , 11 workers in a chinese chemical factory â plus nine of their relatives â contracted dnp poisoning , their skins turned yellow or even black and two died
after ww1 , scientists at stanford university investigated dnp to see if it was a useful slimming aid
eloise parry , known as ella , ' burned up from the inside , after swallowing the highly - toxic substance known as dinitrophenol , or dnp ella 's mother said her daughter never intended to take her own life , she just did n't understand the danger of taking an overdose of the tablets
ella is pictured in 2001 however , they also found out that there were a number of side effects ( including cataracts ) and that the safety margin was too slim
dnp was banned in the united states under the food , drug , and cosmetic act of 1938 ; the us food and drug administration said that dnp was too toxic to be used under any circumstance
fiona parry , 51 , has issued a stark warning against diet pills following her daughter 's death dnp went underground for years , but it was again marketed in the 1980s as a " weight - loss without dieting " drug â and , more recently , the internet has given it a wider circulation , describing it as a " safe weight - loss drug "
not for human consumption how dnp works was discovered in 1948
there have been a number of fatalities in the uk caused by dnp
scientists warn dnp is highly toxic
it was originally used in weapons in ww1 and is used commercially as a pesticide the preceding year a 28 - year old high wycombe bodybuilder , sean cleathero , died after his temperature rose to 42 Â° c when he consumed dnp at his gym
' in 2004 the uk food standards agency advised consumers not to take any product containing dnp at any level : " this chemical is not suitable for human consumption
