sipping a glass of glorious red wine which has been carefully aged in a hand - crafted oak barrel is my idea of heaven
but until now the only way to enjoy a tipple with that gorgeous authentic taste that can only develop through spending years in a special wooden cask has been to pay through the nose
a Â£ 5 bottle has suddenly become Â£ 12 because the wine has lingered in an oak barrel before bottling
so when i read this week about a new gadget that claims to be able to â oak age â wine in hours rather than years , my curiosity was seriously roused
the oak bottle promises to impart an authentic aged flavour â a process that can take up to two years â in just a day or two
how about a bottle made out of oak which will â oak age â a single bottle in a fraction of the time ? now , after three years of experimenting , joel has developed what he claims is the â smallest possible oak infusion vessel ever made
â the idea is you decant a bottle of wine into the oak bottle , leave for up to 48 hours ( depending on the strength of the oak flavour you fancy ) and â hey presto ! â your supermarket bottle of plonk fresh from last year âs grape harvest should suddenly taste like a posh wine from a world - class vineyard that has had years to mature and develop oaky flavours
but can a simple gizmo really mimic such a time - honoured process ? can i turn a cheap plonk into a lovingly aged wine ? i âm eager to try
when it arrives , the oak bottle looks like a wooden version of the thermos flask i take on picnics
merlots benefit hugely from being oak aged
but first i have to fill the oak bottle with water
oak shrinks when dried out , so the instructions warn me the oak bottle is inclined to leak until it is sealed using lukewarm water to swell and close up any open wood grain
the celts were nât wine drinkers but apparently were the first to use oak barrels to store and transport their beer and mead
the oak bottle promises to impart an authentic aged flavour they quickly discovered the wooden barrels not only added flavours to the wine but , because wood is porous , also allowed air ( specifically , what we know as oxygen ) to permeate the contents slowly , removing harsh flavours
in fact , that âs the other reason we pay such a premium for barrel - aged wines â the oxygen changes the molecules in the wine , sweetens the acids , softens the bitter bits and lets the tannins ( or sediment ) drop to the bottom , giving it a gorgeous rich mellowness
barrels , which hold up to 300 bottles of wine , can cost well over Â£ 1,000 , with the price determined by the quality of the oak that âs been used and the skill of the cooper making them
while the overwhelming aroma you get from oak is vanilla , if the wood is toasted a bit over a fire , you also get nutty flavours of hazelnuts and almonds
all these flavours infuse the wine
can the oak bottle â which apparently has a â medium toast â flavour â do the same in just one day ? and , just as important â can it turn a young fruity wine into a vintage quaff ? if it can , i âll be the first to splash out Â£ 50
even though the wine has been in the oak bottle for less than 24 hours , the taste of wood is overpowering
oz clarke said the oak bottle is a fun product that would certainly make an interesting gift for a wine buff in a traditionally oak - aged wine , the woody flavours would integrate over many months to give a rich , mellow taste
in fact , the oak bottle âs developers say you can taste the wine every hour until you reach a level of oakiness appropriate for that particular bottle
i also think the oak bottle might actually improve the more times you use it
the oak bottle is the result of three years of experiments for example , in winemaking a producer might empty his oak barrel after 18 months
i suspect it will be the same with the oak bottle , so those overpowering notes of beeswax furniture polish would mellow
the oak bottle is a fun product , and would certainly make an interesting gift for a wine buff
this forces oxygen into the wine , loosening the flavours and making it more drinkable
