you could soon unlock your phone simply by holding it up to the side of your face
researchers have created a sensor that can recognise the unique shape of your ear , your palm or any other body part you want to use to access your device
called bodyprint , the technology turns a standard touchscreen into a biometric scanner removing the need to specialist hardware such as fingerprint readers or infrared cameras
this allows the touch sensor ' to scan users â body parts , such as ears , fingers , fists , and palms by pressing them against the display
' to accept an incoming call , users would only need to press their ear against the phone
during tests with 12 participants , bodyprint classified body parts with 99.98 per cent accuracy and identified users with 99.52 per cent accuracy
this means that just gripping the phone could unlock it for you a video demonstrating the technology revealed bioprint can also be used to add multiple users to a single device
it âs not just ears that could be used for identification - your fist , phalanges ( in your fingers ) , palm or your fingertips could also be used
during tests with 12 participants , bodyprint classified body parts with 99.98 per cent accuracy and identified users with 99.52 per cent accuracy
