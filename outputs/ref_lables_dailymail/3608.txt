a celtic treble is gone , but the recriminations , anger and sense of injustice will linger and fester for some time to come
cup defeats to inverness are rarely a tranquil affair
yet in a re-enactment of the night caley went ballistic their players celebrated david raven 's late , extra-time strike by sliding joyously on their fronts before a small , delirious support
david raven ( second right ) celebrates with his inverness team - mates following his extra-time winner the celebrations continue on the pitch as inverness rejoice in reaching the scottish cup final they will be back here in greater number for this club 's first ever scottish cup final against falkirk â a former club of manager hughes - on may 30 where they will be favourites to triumph
virgil van dijk ( centre ) fired celtic into an early lead with a superb free - kick in the 18th minute a goal to the good via virgil van dijk 's superb 16th minute free - kick the parkhead side were denied a clear penalty kick â followed by an inverness red card for josh meekings - before half - time
celtic 's stefan johansen was deftly played through on goal , his shot parried across goal the face of goal by inverness keeper ryan esson , where leigh griffiths seemed certain to score with a swooping header
the hand of josh meekings blocked the ball , yet additional assistant referee alan muir - standing five yards away â failed to see it through the bodies in his way
with josh meekings off and a chance to make it 2 - 0 from 12 yards this could easily have been the celtic walkover people expected
greg tansey shoots past replacement goalkeeper zaluska to equalise for inverness and the turning point for this latest triumph came in 53 minutes
in a bitter , unpalatable irony for celtic supporters it came from a penalty
and a red card for their keeper craig gordon after he upended marley watkins as he outstripped adam matthews and hared in behind the celtic defence
the decision to dismiss the celtic keeper was correct
that the officials had gone this one right â while making such a hash of the first half equivalent â was of no consolation to celtic 's players and management at time up
' virgil van dijk 's post match protestations were strong enough to earn a booking
edward o'fere gave inverness the lead in the 96th minute despite the attention of virgil van dijk ' everybody of course gets angry , ' added deila
' to say so , however , is to overlook a rather large obstacle in celtic 's way ; inverness
for zaluska , craig gordon 's deputy , the task of keeping greg tansey 's penalty out with his first touch was a tall order
four minutes later they took the lead with a superb strike from virgil van dijk
john guidetti levels matters in the 116th minute with a well - taken free - kick inverness defender gary warren was booked for a crude - if vital - foul on forrest on the edge of the box as the celtic winger threatened to use his pace to rampage the inverness support
virgil van dijk took the free kick , curling a magnificent right foot effort into the top left hand corner of off the inside of the post
on league duty last week inverness had recovered from the loss of an early goal and so it was here
whatever the celtic injustices , they can hardly deny their opponents played to devastating effect on the break
and in 95 minutes it seemed they were broken when shinnie 's cross from the left touchline ricocheted off the knee of marley watkins into the path of striker edward ofere
celtic players stand dejected on the pitch following their 3 - 2 loss in a personal disaster for inverness stand - in keeper ryan esson â who had enjoyed a fine game beforehand â allowed a swirling john guidetti free - kick to bounce over his outstretch hands and into the net for 2 - 2 12 minutes into extra-time
inverness could â should have had a second penalty when the unconvincing zaluska clattered his fists into the back of edward ofere in 108 minutes
david raven , castigated by his manager before extra-time , slammed the ball into the net from an acute angle after more outstanding work by shinnie , driving into the area and hammering the ball across the face of goal
' such was the inverness strength that celtic were done
