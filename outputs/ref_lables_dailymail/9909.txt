aston villa boss sherwood has offered encouragement to a six - year - old fan he beat to the job
pye , from leamington spa , applied for the aston villa hotseat after paul lambert was sacked in february
aston villa boss sherwood ( centre ) showed his softer side by replying to 6 - year - old pye he wrote : ' from your letter it is clear to see that you would indeed be an ideal candidate for the job due to your knowledge of the game - and your very capable backroom staff , of course ! ' hopefully you 're not too disappointed at missing out and i 'm informed that i just managed to pip you to the post so you were very close to being offered the job
the youngster applied for the role when paul lambert was sacked but was pipped to the post by sherwood ' i will certainly be aiming to make you and all the other supporters happy
pye had written to chief executive tom fox after paul lambert was sacked with aston villa in the relegation zone earlier this year
pye is captain of norton lindsey and got a special message from sherwood about being a captain he wrote : ' i would appoint my mum and dad as assistant managers so they can drive me to the training ground each day
' the 6 - year - old would have appointed his parents as assistant managers if he had been offered the dream job
