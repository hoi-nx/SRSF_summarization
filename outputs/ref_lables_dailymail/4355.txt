all the smiles can not hide the reality that mccluskey and his union are a potent , sinister force in britain politics out on the election campaign trail under blue skies in south wales , the trade union firebrand 's manner was as warm as the weather
but that did not stop ' red ' mccluskey giving me the time of day on a street in neath as he conducted a two - day tour of the principality to drum up support for labour 's cause
yet all the smiles can not hide the reality that mccluskey and his union are a potent , sinister force in britain politics , seeking to use their financial and organisational muscle within the labour movement to drag britain back to the dark days of the 1970s
as the mail reveals today , the sheer scale of the influence unite holds on scores of labour candidates is chilling given the socialist revolution the union would seek to impose
labour 's umbilical link to mccluskey 's union has received much less attention in recent days than a potential deal with the left - wing , anti-austerity snp , yet it is just as potentially disastrous for the governance of this country
not only is unite â which has a claimed membership of 1.42million â intertwined with the labour 's structure , mps and finances , but it also remains addicted to the failed socialist policies of the past , including a major expansion in the public sector , less flexibility in the workplace , higher taxation and ever more state spending
mccluskey has denied that he has too much influence over ed miliband , adding that unite is supporting the party ' 100 per cent ' mccluskey 's determination to influence labour was all too evident in bbc radio wales
with an air of quasi-regal grandeur , he visited several factories , gave talks to labour activists and held a number of photo opportunities â including one in cardiff at the statute of that old champagne socialist nye bevan
and he denied that he had too much influence over ed miliband 's party : ' if only that were true , ' he said , while proclaiming his loyalty to the cause
yet there was something synthetic about mccluskey 's protestations of support for labour
when asked in an interview with bbc radio wales about ed miliband 's leadership , mccluskey could say only : ' he 's doing ok '
beneath the surface , i have no doubt he longs to hear ed miliband offering more nakedly socialist policies , rather than trying to appeal to middle england
on the contrary , mccluskey is pivotal to labour 's future because of the stranglehold his union has over the party
since 2010 , unite is estimated to have donated at least Â£ 14.4million to labour 's coffers
it was unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured ed miliband ( pictured left ) was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother david ( right ) the dominance of unite runs right through labour 's organisation , with huge implications for the make - up of a putative ed miliband government
as martin mayer , chairman of unite 's political committee and a member of labour 's national executive recently admitted , the union is involved in a ' serious attempt to win back the party '
tragically for britain , there is now a real danger that an incoming labour government would be forced to lurch even further to the left , not just by snp by also by unite , with ed miliband too weak to stand up to those who are determined he will be their puppet in downing street .
