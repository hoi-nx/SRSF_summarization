west brom manager pulis will receive a hero 's welcome when he returns to crystal palace on saturday but in the midst of yet another relegation battle for the 57 - year - old , he must wonder if he 'll ever be successful at the right end of the premier league
for all the expertise pulis has in keeping clubs in the top flight , a talent that has the everlasting gratitude of stoke city and crystal palace supporters , his overall record is one of the worst of any long - serving premier league manager
this is his seventh season in the top flight and he 's never finished in the top half of the table
if , as expected , garry monk 's swansea city do n't drop lower than 10th , pulis will be the only manager in the premier league with more than 12 months experience who has never finished higher than 11th
pulis has never managed to guide a team into the top half of the premier league to add to his frustration as he takes the applause of the crystal palace fans who remember him for masterminding their great escape last season , pulis will know he is n't yet guaranteed preserving his proud record of never being relegated
west brom 's home defeats against qpr and leicester city have left them stuck on 33 points
pulis took stoke city into the premier league and turned them into an established team alan pardew , who has achieved a similar miracle at crystal palace this season to what pulis achieved last season , has a top - five finish at newcastle united on his cv
alan pardew could guide crystal palace into the top half of the table just as mark hughes could do at stoke city - something pulis never achieved pulis will remain plain - speaking til the end
' you 'd back pulis ' message to keep west brom up
