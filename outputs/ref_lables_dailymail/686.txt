united manager van gaal has praised the resurrection of fellaini as the big belgian prepares to play in the fixture that marked the low point of his old trafford career 12 months ago
on march 25 last year , fellaini was jeered by both city and united fans as he was substituted in a 3 - 0 united defeat that proved the deathknell to the manager who signed him , moyes
even more hurtfully , reds legend paul scholes was scathing about fellaini 's united career up that point , saying on television : ' i 'd be expecting a lot more of him
' united manager van gaal has praised the rebirth of resurrection fellaini fellaini , pictured against aston villa on april 4 , is expected to start against city on sunday in the corresponding fixture last season , the belgian ( back ) was criticised by fans and pundits in a 3 - 0 loss things have changed dramatically since then with fellaini developing into a more effective no10 than juan mata , rooney or angel di maria have been this season
united have won five league games in a row and are in third place , a point ahead of city for sunday 's derby
fellaini plays a factor in all these aspects , we needed him in the team , now he has that role and he plays his role very well
' fellaini , who cost Â£ 27million when moyes signed him from everton , has scored three goals in united 's revival and also scored three times for his country in their two recent euro 2016 qualifiers
his overall physicality has helped lvg bring back a formation that he used earlier in the season against chelsea , city and west brom , without winning any of them
the united boss has until now been reserved in his praise for de gea but he went on a charm offensive yesterday after the keeper made a rare mistake to allow aston villa 's christian benteke to score last weekend
