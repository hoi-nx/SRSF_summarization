preconceptions , i find , can be really unhelpful , so before travelling to the datai , a luxury hotel in malaysia , i decided not to find out anything about it
i preferred instead to be delighted - or otherwise - on arrival
i was travelling with my old mucker doon mackichan ( from smack the pony , plebs , the day today )
our paths first crossed almost 30 years ago as rookies on the comedy circuit , but since then we have , by chance , both acquired part - time homes in the same seaside town
it is doon mackichan who has taught me to stride like a warrior into the freezing channel
luxury personified : the datai hotel has all the colour and wonder of the emerald city , says maria mcerlane setting off for the far east , there was something of the hinge and bracket about us , blithering away in actressy tones , trying to charm the air malaysia crew into granting us a cheeky upgrade
) but that was soon forgotten and the joy of leaving britain behind in cold mid-december was fully realised when we disembarked into the densely tropical humidity of langkawi
after a 30 - minute taxi ride through darkness and impenetrable forests , the the datai appeared with all the colour and wonder of the emerald city
full - size carved horses illuminated by antique torches guarded the entrance , as beautiful silk sari - clad malaysia staff welcomed us with cocktails
in the background , the ubiquitous lobby pianist / singer warbled away to i just called to say i love you
langkawi is an archipelago of 104 islands in the andaman sea , 20 miles off the coast of malaysia

keen to revive our weary bones , doon mackichan asked if it was safe to swim
spot of swimming anyone ? the andaman ocean turns out to be the perfect choice for a dip at any time clearly he does n't know doon mackichan
despite it being close to midnight , we ran down to the beach , disrobing and squealing , before plunging into the silky - smooth andaman sea sea
phosphorescence streamed through the water , illuminating our limbs as we swam towards the lights of thai on the horizon
buggies can be summoned at a moment 's notice , but the next morning we preferred a stroll on the beach , through the jungle , along wooden walkways and up the 139 mayan temple - inspired steps to breakfast
clutching our nature books , we were serenaded by squawking macaques and doe - eyed dusky leaf monkeys swinging from tarzan vines through the trees
first class display : the pair were serenaded by doe - eyed dusky leaf monkeys in the trees brahminy kites and green imperial pigeons flew overhead , and we both leapt back in horror when a three foot long monitor lizard slithered across the path into the undergrowth
having ignored the warning to keep all doors and windows closed , doon mackichan arrived back at the villa to find a scene of devastation : a monkey burglary
doon mackichan had painted a watercolour earlier that morning which the monkeys had ' relieved ' themselves on
doon mackichan remarked that it resembled a ' birds ' nest in the sky ' , albeit one that serves traditional thai cuisine
maria mcerlane heads to the beach after a lazy breakfast the most pleasing element of our beach view was the lack of visiting boats , save for the naga pelangi ( rainbow dragon ) , a traditional wooden malaysia junk schooner hand - built in the boatyards of duyung island on the east coast of malaysia
we were invited aboard for a trip to the geopark to watch brown eagles feed and , in doon mackichan 's case , to find dolphins
during our stay , in a futile attempt to counter the calorific intake , we swam morning , noon and night
i could see the creek below and hear the monkeys gossiping
