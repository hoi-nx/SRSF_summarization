kris wardle , who lives in leicester , thought his world was complete when he married his long - term girlfriend katrina in 2011 with her teenage son , mark , acting as best man
however , less than two years later , the hgv truck driver would be a widower , after his beloved wife was killed in a frenzied knife attack by now 21 - year - old mark after a row over his cannabis use
' kris wardle said katrina , who was known as tina , already had two children when they met and was a devoted mother when they fell in love in 2002 when her son mark was ten years old
' they came first , always , there was no question about it , she loved her kids , she loved them to bits , ' said kris wardle
' mark was the apple of tina âs eye , no two ways about it
mark howe was obsessed with the tv show dexter which features a serial killer michael c hall who starred as dexter in the tv show ' he did nât talk a lot , he âd come in , he âd do a bit of homework , he âd watch some tv , play computer games and sometimes we âd talk , but it would be inconsequential things , just little things , mainly about games
' as time went on , the couple grew concerned that the now 13 - year - old mark was spending more time in his bedroom playing computer games and withdrawing not only from his friends , but his family too
' tina was a little worried because he seemed to be getting quieter in himself , she talked with me about it and she spoke to some of her friends from work , and they were saying he âs a teenager , ' said kris wardle
kris wardle said mark became increasingly obsessed with violent games and while he and his wife were watching television , they would hear mark yelling at his games console
kris wardle and tina married in 2011 and planned a long life together ' it was still mark but he it was like he was just going through a really a rough patch , emotionally
kris wardle said when tina smiled , the room would light up ' it was like having a total stranger living in the house
' kris wardle said they became concerned about mark and although he hated his mother interfering , she felt she had to try
kris wardle said in september 2011 he asked tina to marry him , and to help mark feel more included , asked him to be best man
happier times : tina strikes a pose for the camera ' i said it âll be nice my son giving me my wife
' kris wardle said he and tina had a perfect day
' however , kris wardle said although the wedding day was a happy occasion , mark was getting worse as he started to smoke cannabis which would would push him further into a dark world
tina was ' devoted ' to her children , said kris wardle ' mark had got to the point where he âs bringing it in and the house stunk of it
' kris wardle said tina challenged mark about the drugs , but he would shout back
unknown to the couple , mark was secretly sending his friends text messages saying how much he hated his mother and began stabbing the punch bag in his bedroom while also becoming obsessed with the tv show dexter , which is about a serial killer
on the 16 july 2012 , kris wardle , 51 , was working away from home when he received a frantic text from a family member saying that mark had confessed to his sister that he had killed his mother
' desperate to know that his wife was safe , he asked his father , brian , to go round to the flat where he found tina lying in a pool of blood while still on the phone to his son
' inside the flat , police discovered just how frenzied the killing was and it was established that tina had been stabbed 53 times
mark was arrested at the care home where he worked and blamed his step father , although the story was quickly discounted by detectives who had taken kris wardle into the police station for questioning
kris wardle said : ' that night i just lay there
' kris wardle said he was hoping that mark 's trial in january 2014 would provide some answers as to why he killed his mother , although he said he was left bitterly disappointed
' mark howe pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to life with a minimum of 21 years and six months
kris wardle says he is now focusing on rebuilding his life by fulfilling his and tina 's dreams
kris wardle says tina always wanted to visit cambodia so he has scattered some of her ashes there ' tina had seen a picture of a place in cambodia , called bayon temple , part of the angkor wat region in siem reap , ' he added
while the tree 's there , tina âs there
