a married couple who have endured the heartbreak of ten miscarriages in ten years , have revealed the joy of becoming parents to their miracle daughter
last year sarah , 36 , and mark , 35 , from south wales , never gave up hope of becoming parents despite being told they 'd never conceive naturally
yet last september they defied doctors to have eryn , who was born seven weeks early , weighing just 3lb 11oz
sarah and mark show off their longed - for daughter eryn elisabeth sarah , a project manager , said : ' we 'd just been put on the waiting list for ivf , when i had an inkling i might be pregnant
mark , a technician , said : ' it was wonderful to find out that sarah was pregnant , but after so many miscarriages , we could not help but worry
project manager sarah , pictured with her treasured daughter , advises other mums struggling with infertility to not give up after telling the midwife their history they were referred to the sonographer and a scan revealed a heartbeat
in the weeks that followed , the pair were told that their baby was developing well and found out at the 20 - week scan that they were expecting a girl
everything went smoothly until 29 weeks , when sarah 's waters broke so early , the doctors did not believe they had gone
the couple then spent the next few days in and out of hospital
after going into labour early , sarah feared she 'd lost eryn and could n't hold her newborn for five hours ' i was in agony with the pain of every baby kick , stretch , minor movement or hiccup , ' she said
sarah spent the next two weeks in hospital , but did not go into labour and decided to go home
she eventually went into labour on september 30 and was booked in for an emergency caesarean , as the baby was in the breech position
eryn was born at 33 weeks at the princess of wales hospital in bridgend at 2.52pm , weighing just 3ib 11oz
the couple said they became ' used ' to the heartbreak of miscarriages after losing ten babies sarah said : ' i was handed eryn , complete with tubes and wires , and i crumbled with a perfect rush of emotion and love
