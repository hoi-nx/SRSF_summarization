ronny deila has warned television broadcasters to stop messing around scottish football fans
the celtic boss leads his side into a scottish cup semi-final with inverness at hampden park on sunday with a 12.15 kick - off
and after a week of turmoil and complaints â from clubs and supporters â over the unhealthy sway television has on kick - off times , ronny deila says the balance of power in the relationship is all wrong
ronny deila will take his celtic side to hampden park for the scottish cup semi-final on sunday the match will take place at 12:15 , a time that scottish football fans do not agree with ' i think tv is an issue that i do n't like in terms of the kick - off times , ' said the norway
' it should be about the supporters and the clubs so that they can make money by getting people into the stands - because that is what we live for
celtic players train at lennoxtown in preparation for sunday 's crunch match against inverness ronny deila ( right ) believes that teams should have more of a say on kick - off times , rather than broadcasters both capital clubs have lodged formal complaints over the governance of the game , with chief executive neil doncaster under pressure ahead of a stormy spfl agm on thursday
at the heart of the problem is the growing fury of fans at being messed around with late changes to kick - off dates and times to facilitate broadcasters offering scottish football a tiny fraction of the billions paid to england clubs
none of celtic 's post-split fixtures will be played on a saturday at 3pm , forcing season - ticket holders from ireland and england to cancel or alter their travel plans
' there are different traditions in different countries , ' added ronny deila
' in norway , we had the best time , which is six o'clock on sunday , but now they are doing different times
a celtic scarf displayed outside celtic park shows fans ' desire for ronny deila to win them the treble this season ' i would also rather play at six in the evening than 12 in the morning
' addressing concerns that celtic are being affected more than most through large gaps in the stands , ronny deila acknowledged : ' it 's a big problem for us
we have to play most of our games at 12 o'clock and that 's not the best for our supporters
' supporting the view of hearts , hibs and rangers that the decision to play the final game of the championship season 24 hours after the rest was foolish and contrary to ' sporting integrity ' , ronny deila added : ' in my opinion , in the last two rounds of matches every team should play at the same time so you ca n't play knowing other results
