you might think seemingly endless sales would be guaranteed to tempt shoppers through the door
debenhams and mothercare have called a halt to long - running promotions which fail to excite shoppers , replacing them with shorter events that have more impact
and both have announced revived figures since making the change
experts claim prolonged sales can devalue products and encourage shoppers to delay buying an item until it is reduced
high street chains , including mothercare , are calling time on cut - price promotions that seem to go on forever figures show a third of all fashion purchases are now made in a sale or promotion , and there have been warnings that shoppers are being â trained â not to buy at full price , undermining profits
in the past , retail analysts mocked debenhams for being â never knowingly not on sale â â a pun on the john lewis slogan â never knowingly undersold â
now , the department store has reduced its endless blue cross sales and promotions , which it admitted sometimes â create noise but do nât create value â
debenhams said despite fewer sale events , feedback suggests customers now think the store is better value chief executive michael sharp said : â it âs not about ending promotions , but being more focused and removing events that create noise but do nât create value
