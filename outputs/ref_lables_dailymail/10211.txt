security researchers have discovered a way to intercept a person 's fingerprints on a samsung galaxy s5 running android 4.4 and older fingerprint scanners are often touted as the future of security and an alternative to the notoriously flawed password
but experts have discovered they may not be as secure as first thought after a number of android devices , including samsung 's samsung galaxy s5 , were said to be potentially ' leaking ' fingerprints
the security researchers have found a way to intercept a person 's biometric data after it is captured by a built - in scanner , but before it becomes encrypted
the pair told thomas fox-brewster from forbes that the flaw lies in older versions of the android operating system , up to and including android 4.4
subsequently , anyone running android 5.0 or above are not at risk and the security experts are advising people on older models to update as soon as possible
the vulnerability means that a hacker can access the kernel , or core , of the android operating system
once inside they can monitor all data sent to and from the phone , as well as data recorded by the handset 's built - in sensors , including the fingerprint scanner
typically , when a fingerprint is scanned it is encrypted and separated from the rest of the device in a secure folder
hackers ca n't get access to this folder even with access to the kernel , but they can collect scans immediately from the fingerprint sensor before they reach this folder
in addition to using these fingerprints to access the phone , for example , they can be used to make payments with paypal
when a fingerprint is scanned it is encrypted
hackers typically ca n't access this encrypted file , but the flaw allows them to collect scans from the sensor before being encrypted during tests , mr wei and mr zhang confirmed the flaw was present on samsung galaxy s5
they have not yet tested it on other android smartphones with built - in fingerprint scanners , including the galaxy note 4 , note edge and huawei ascend mate 7
however , they believe the problem to be ' more widespread ' than the samsung galaxy s5 and are planning to put this to the test
fireeye 's research is n't the first time the samsung galaxy s5 's scanner has been exposed as vulnerable
in april last year a group of german hackers managed to spoof the scanner using a dummy print
it took hackers just two days and a small collection of everyday household items to bypass the fingerprint sensor on an apple iphone 5s following its launch in 2013
' this is n't the first time samsung 's samsung galaxy s5 scanner has been exposed as vulnerable
this situation is made worse by the fact that once a password has been initially used to access paypal and samsung phones , the fingerprint can be continually used for access without re-entering the password - even if the phone is rebooted
