the uk is to open its first three proton beam therapy centres after cancer - stricken five - year - old ashya king made a miracle recovery after receiving the treatment
cardiff - based proton , is to open the treatment centres , which will be available to nhs cancer patients , in cardiff , london and northumberland by 2017 , with the first in the welsh capital being operational by next year
the announcement comes just weeks after the parents of brain cancer sufferer ashya king told of how he was given the ' all - clear ' after receiving proton bean therapy at a centre in prague
the kings defiantly fled to spain in a bid to get ashya king to the proton therapy centre in prague and protect him from the devastating side effects of nhs treatment professor mcvie said : ' this is an exciting and important development of the provision of cancer treatment in the uk
while conventional radiotherapy uses high energy beams of radiation to destroy cancerous cells , often damaging surrounding tissue , proton beam therapy aims radiation directly at the tumour
while radiotherapy can lead to side effects such as nausea and can sometimes disrupt how some organs function , proton beam therapy has a lower risk of side effects
however , cancer research uk estimates that only one in 100 people would be suitable for proton beam therapy and there are also concerns that the long - term impact of the nascent procedure is not yet known
the only proton beam facility currently in operation is at the clatterbridge centre for cancer nhs foundation trust in the wirral , merseyside , which delivers ' low energy ' therapy for rare cancers around the eye
the nhs currently pays for those deemed appropriate for proton beam therapy to go to the united states for treatment
' it is anticipated that nhs demand for proton beam therapy abroad will reach 1,500 patients by 2017
proton beam therapy is a highly - targeted type of radiotherapy that can treat hard - to - reach cancers , such as spinal tumours , with a lower risk of damaging the surrounding tissue and causing side effects
the government has announced that it is to create two nhs proton beam therapy units which will open in 2018
the kings faced every parent 's worst nightmare when their young son was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour after suffering a series of mystery symptoms
and despite threats to revoke their parental rights unless they went along with the therapy , the kings defiantly fled to spain in a bid to get ashya king to the proton therapy centre in prague and protect him from the devastating side effects of nhs treatment
