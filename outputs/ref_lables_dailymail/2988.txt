less than a week since it smashed its previous speeds , the so - called japan bullet train has entered the record books once more
the seven - car maglev - short for ' magnetic levitation ' - hit a top speed of 375mph ( 603 km / h ) and travelled for almost 11 seconds at speeds above 373mph ( 600km/h ) during a test run near mount fuji
the run beat last week 's speeds of 366mph ( 590kph ) , which in turn beat the train 's previous 12 - year record of 361mph ( 581km/h )
it beat last week 's speeds of 366mph ( 590kph ) , which in turn beat the train 's previous record of 361mph ( 581km/h ) the train is able to go this fast because it makes use of a charge to lift and move it above a guideway
it hovers four inches ( 10cm ) above the tracks and is propelled by electrically charged magnets
central japan railway plans to have a train in service in 2027 to join tokyo and the central city of nagoya - a distance of 177 miles ( 286km )
the speeds , however , wo n't be as high when the new line between tokyo and nagoya comes into service
maglev trains use magnets to lift the carriages above the track
by 2045 , maglev trains are expected to link tokyo and osaka in just 67 minutes , slashing the journey time in half
the maglev trains are expected to eventually consist of 16 carriages and carry up to 1,000 passengers at a time
maglev was first proposed as a method to propel trains as far back as the mid 20th century

told the los angeles times that maglev trains have proved to be expensive , power - intensive , and potentially unsafe
by 2045 maglev trains ( example pictured ) are expected to link tokyo and osaka in just one hour and seven minutes , slashing the journey time in half
the maglev trains are set to eventually consist of 16 carriages and carry up to 1,000 passengers at a time central japan railway plans to have a train in service in 2027 to join tokyo and nagoya - a distance of 177 miles ( 286km )
the technology works by using a vacuum tube to decrease the speed limitations imposed by air resistance on regular maglev trains
