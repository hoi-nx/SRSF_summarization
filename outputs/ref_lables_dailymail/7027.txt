alastair cook hung his head in disbelief after wasting a golden opportunity to end his long wait for a century before the man who seems destined to succeed him as england captain showed how to do it
but the problems alastair cook had in finding fluency in his 211 - ball 76 were put into stark perspective by yet another display of the rare class and maturity that has made root england âs outstanding batsman
root celebrates his century and is 118 not out at stumps on day three of the second test against the west indies england 's root smashes a short ball to the boundary as west indies keeper and captain ramdin can only watch on root plays confidently off the back foot through the offside during a commanding innings once he got his chance on day three root and gary ballance run between wickets as they easily work the west indian bowling around on a hot day in grenada stokes is giving a salute send - off by his west indian rival samuels after holing out for eight runs this has been another slow , attritional test in conditions that are hardly conducive to entertaining cricket
here he took advantage of the solid platform that had been painstakingly laid by alastair cook and jonathan trott to give england a chance of going on to the sort of total that could put pressure on west indies on the final day
only a late burst of madness which saw moeen ali run himself out and stokes hit a bishoo long - hop straight down deep square leg âs throat spoilt england âs day
they ended on 373 for six , a lead of 74 , and root and jos buttler will have to stick around for as long as possible on friday if england are going to dictate terms
england captain alastair cook hits through the offside as he enjoys some width on day three of the second test against the west indies jonathan trott cuts before the ball can reach west indies captain ramdin 's gloves on his way to 59 runs in the first innings alastair cook congratulates jonathan trott on his first test half - century since returning to the england line - up in the morning session on thursday jonathan trott plays the spinner behind point at the national cricket stadium in st george 's , grenada , on st george 's day opener jonathan trott ducks a bouncer but leaves his bat hanging in the air from paceman gabriel blackwood clutches onto an edge from jonathan trott off the bowling of bishoo to end the opener 's innings jonathan trott appears disappointed after the conditions appeared to favour the batsmen after they 'd done the hard work early on root âs fastest hundred for england , coming from 125 balls and including 13 fours , two sixes
in the past year he has scored four test centuries root is the fifth england batsman to score six consecutive 50s in test innings
since june 2014 he has scored 1,037 runs , averaging 103.7 root has featured in five of england âs past six test partnerships of 150 - plus runs
â while root was the star of the day , this was hardly a failure for an england captain who has now made four scores of 70 - plus in his last seven test innings , but alastair cook would have given anything to have been able to add those extra , elusive 24 runs
here alastair cook and jonathan trott recorded england âs first century opening partnership for 31 innings as england went about their quest for a decisive lead in workmanlike fashion on a slow pitch and an even slower outfield
the second - slowest half - century of jonathan trott âs career , which was reached off 137 balls , was also one of the most important for a man who was in almost as great a need of runs as alastair cook after his double failure in antigua
alastair cook stands and waits for the result of a west indies decision review after an lbw appeal was judged not out by the on - field umpire alastair cook is lucky the umpire gave him not out initially after the ball pitched outside off and hit in line but was only just clipping the stumps alastair cook hits aggressively behind square as blackwood braces himself at the national cricket stadium alastair cook checks on the welfare of blackwood after his well - hit pull shot struck the close - in fielder west indies bowler gabriel is a blur as he comes into his delivery stride on day three of the second test alastair cook 's off stump is rattled and the bails fly off after a wide delivery from gabriel found the skipper 's inside edge gabriel and his team - mates celebrate as alastair cook leans on his bat in disappointment after being dismissed for 76 alastair cook trudges off the field after a solid innings that ultimately fell short of an elusive hundred for the left - handed opener but if gary ballance was busy then root roistered along , reaching 50 off 69 balls and 100 off 125
this was his england record - equalling sixth successive test score of 50 or more , a landmark shared with patsy hendren , ted dexter , ken barrington and alastair cook himself
together , root and gary ballance took england beyond west indies â score after tea and added 165 before samuels found a way through ballance
a second drag - on for the st george 's day play came for england no 4 ian bell , who also cut gabriel onto his off stump an annoyed ian bell has to make the long walk back to the pavilion after being dismissed for a disappointing one run ian bell inspects the inside edge that orchestrated his downfall in the first innings here after bringing strong form into the match root came out firing and punished any short deliveries , needing no second invitation to dispatch bishoo to the boundary onside or offside , it did n't matter for root as he raced past his half - century , taking full advantage of a tiring bowling attack ballance hits the spinner through the offside as he too made the west indies pay for wayward bowling ballance raises his cherry - covered bat after reaching his half - century , following up his second - innings 122 in the first test root and gary ballance touch fists as they leave the field with their wickets in tact for the tea interval gary ballance can hardly believe it as he is bowled by a looping delivery from makeshift spinner samuels ballance looks up in disbelief after his excellent innings comes to an end on 77 runs from 188 deliveries moeen ali fails to get off the mark as he takes off for a single but is rightly sent back by root ramdin completed the run - out after the throw from blackwood as moeen ali 's first innings back in the england line - up ends with a duck stokes does n't get a full piece of an innocuous delivery from bishoo and skies his shot into the outfield stokes looks on in hope as his shot floats into the safe hands of blackwood , who took his second catch of the day after the pair clashed in west indies first innings while samuels batted , the all - rounder stood a saluted as stokes left the field stokes looks at samuels as the cheeky centurion stands at attention with his hat on his check for the send - off
