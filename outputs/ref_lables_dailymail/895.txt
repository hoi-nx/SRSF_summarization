messi , neymar and luis suarez is a star - studded strike force that almost every team in the world would dearly love to have , but when the going gets tough , barcelona turn to jeremy mathieu and pique
the french centre - back flung himself through the air to reach xavi 's free kick at the back post , heading home from close range , finally breaching celta vigo 's stern defence
pique , meanwhile , just a minute before jeremy mathieu scored , had made an incredible , game - saving tackle on celta vigo striker charles , to prevent him from opening the scoring
jeremy mathieu ( right ) heads home in the 73rd minute to hand barcelona a 1 - 0 lead against celta vigo celta vigo goalkeeper alvarez conde ( right ) is unable to stop the powerful header from jeremy mathieu celta vigo : alvarez conde , mallo novegil , gustavo cabral , fontas , castro otto , hernandez , fernandez , krohn-dehli ( radoja - 67 ' ) , orellana , larrivey ( dias de oliveira 71 ' ) , duran booked : krohn-dehli , duran sent off : orellana subs not used : mina lorenzo , lopez sanchez , blanco , bongonda , gomez sola barcelona : bravo , alves , pique , jeremy mathieu , adriano correia , rafinha ( xavi ' ) , sergio busquets , iniesta ( pedro 75 ' ) , messi , luis suarez ( rakitic 85 ' ) , neymar subs not used : ter stegen , montoya , bartra , sergi goals : jeremy mathieu 73 ' booked : luis suarez ref : inaki vicandi garrido att : 23,731 this gritty , barely - deserved triumph helped barcelona stay four points ahead of real madrid at the top of la liga , after ancelotti âs side 's almost - harrowing 9 - 1 demolition of granada celta vigo âs aggressive pressing nearly paid dividends , but their hard - work and effort counted for nothing thanks to jeremy mathieu âs goal
their frustration manifested itself in a bizarre way , with orellana sent off for throwing a lump of turf at sergio busquets
for some reason alvarez , celta vigo 's goalkeeper , is kryptonite for barcelona 's attacking trident , as they also failed to beat him in 90 minutes at the camp nou earlier this season
after barcelona 's halloween nightmare against celta vigo , the directive from enrique here was not to leave with egg on their faces on easter sunday
barcelona 's own website stated that ' a dose of retribution ' was in order , after the 1 - 0 defeat by eduardo berizzo âs side in late autumn
the french wheels away in celebration of his second half header at the balaidos stadium pique ( right ) and sergio busquets join the french defender in celebration of his goal with real madrid in disarray , a couple of weeks spent healing wounds away from the santiago bernabeu seemed an agreeable plan , while barcelona 's momentum was disrupted
enrique has n't shown himself to be the sentimental type , but the former celta vigo manager gave rafinha alcantara a rare start against the team which he played for , both before moving to barcelona at 13 , and last season on loan
jeremy mathieu ( left ) is congratulated by team - mates messi and neymar ( right ) after his goal javier mascherano was suspended for accumulating too many yellow cards , as is his wont , but luckily for barcelona busquets was fit enough to start for the first time in over a month
alvarez turned in the display of his life at the camp nou and barcelona 's attacking trident must have worried it was going to happen again , when he made a brilliant diving stop to deny messi
profligacy was an issue in that 1 - 0 defeat too , which we were reminded of when neymar slashed the rebound high and wide
orellana was shown a red card for throwing a chunk of grass in the direction of sergio busquets the lump of turf strikes sergio busquets in the neck after tempers reached boiling point neymar antagonised the celta vigo fans as he drew several fouls , but the barcelona ones too with his incredible wastefulness
orellana ( right ) leaves the field after referee inaki vicandi garrido brandishes a red card the barcelona players surround referee following a controversial decision one horrendous defensive mix - up left nolito charging for the ball with bravo
celta vigo were almost instantly punished for it , with jeremy mathieu breaking the deadlock
it âs not pretty , it âs not â the barcelona way â , but if enrique lifts la liga , nobody will be worrying about that
