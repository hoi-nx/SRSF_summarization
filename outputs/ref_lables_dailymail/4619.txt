a waitress on a zero - hours contract who kept silent over her boss groping her because she feared her hours would be cut has won a Â£ 20,000 payout at an employment tribunal
lucy southern , who worked behind the bar at the hotel owned by britannia hotels in leeds , was quizzed about her sex life and asked whether she wore stockings in bed by her line manager alex nkoroi
she complained in august 2013 but nothing was done and in october , alex nkoroi began touching her , slapping her bottom and kissing her on the neck
lucy southern worked for britannia hotels and claims she quizzed about her sex life and groped by her line manager alex nkoroi she also claimed he stood behind her to ' grind ' up and down her back , simulating sex
' ms lucy southern , who was 22 at the time and no longer works at the hotel , added : ' if i take back what i said about alex nkoroi i can just get my hours back ca n't i ? ' in the judgement of the panel , which found both alex nkoroi and brittania hotels guilty of sex discrimination by way of harassment but cleared them of indirect sex discrimination , the tribunal stated : ' the claimant was a casual member of staff
' she had a zero hours contract and it was certainly her belief whether right or wrong that the second respondent ( alex nkoroi ) would be able to influence the number of hours that she would be given to work
alex nkoroi was then required in september last year , to attend a bullying and harassment training course
alex nkoroi had always denied all the allegations , but at the tribunal in leeds , after saying he was a practising christian and swearing on the bible , he refused to deny the accusations , though he said he had forgotten some and that some of the touching might have been accidental
' an employment tribunal at the city exchange in leeds , pictured , ordered britannia hotels to pay miss southern Â£ 19,500 in compensation for injury to her feelings it emerged at the hearing that miss southern suffers long - term mental health problems , but had made her employer and alex nkoroi aware of it
' the tribunal awarded her Â£ 19,500 compensation for injury to her feelings , explaining : ' where persistent harassment over a period of eight months has occurred , substantial compensation is likely to be justified but where the employer then has the means of addressing the problem , but wholly fails to do so in relation to a process that takes another year to complete , the impact upon this claimiant was clearly likely to be magnified
