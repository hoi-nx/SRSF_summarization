a mother was left in shock after her four - year - old daughter discovered a four - foot snake in the bath - just a week after moving into the house
michelle woods , from norton in teesside , was told by her daughter elisha that ' something was moving ' in the bath
and when the pair walked into the bathroom to check what was there , that 's when they came face to face with the reptile
the four - foot red and orange corn snake , which michelle woods discovered slithering around in the bathroom of her new home
she believes it may belong to the property 's previous tenant mrs michelle woods , a full - time mother , said : ' i thought she was joking , but elisha made me go and have a look , so i went and checked the bin and nothing was there
' panicking , ms michelle woods said she called the rspca , who were unable to help - so in desperation , posted an appeal on facebook
within an hour , a local woman who keeps snakes had recognised her plight and identified the reptile as a corn snake , a non-venomous species normally kept as a pet
michelle woods with her daughter elisha , who first spotted the snake in the bath before alerting her mother it is not clear how the snake ended up in the bathroom , but ms michelle woods believes that the previous tenant may have kept snakes as pets and lost the red and orange reptile while moving
