after an initial spell as bradford chairman , he came back in 1983 when he and another local businessman , jack tordoff , saved bradford from the receivers , buying the club for around Â£ 30,000 each
stafford heginbotham resigned as chairman in 1988 due to ill health
bradford reacted to early criticism that it had failed to honour the tragedy and there are memorials in the city centre and at the stadium and an annual memorial service , attended mostly by a few hundred of the people most closely affected
in 2010 , on the 25th anniversary , there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city 's centenary square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to valley parade
football 's authorities decided that this year there would be a minute 's silence before all games on april 25 , when bradford play barnsley at valley parade
then - bradford chairman stafford heginbotham ( left ) outside valley parade , where 56 people died and 265 were injured the remains of the stand at bradford 's ground after the disaster on saturday may 11 , 1985 at valley parade investigators look around the burned out stand at bradford 's ground following the tragedy in 1985 the charred remains of a bradford programme from the day of the fire in which 56 people were killed author fletcher writes about his own experience at the bradford disaster , and asks why chairman stafford heginbotham was not investigated : ' why was it left to the 12 - year - old who lost three generations and four members of his family , who was with over 40 people when they died within a 10 - yard radius of him , who somehow got out of the stand , as the last person to get out , the only person to get out the front after being at the back , and the only person to survive the smoke ? ' many supporters were unsure about a memorial flag which was taken to wembley when bradford reached the league cup final two years ago
arsenal and hull fans then applauded in the 56th minute of last year 's fa cup final , a well - intentioned mark of solidarity copied by oldham fans at valley parade , this season
it may never be the same again after fletcher 's book
he started his own investigations in 1994 , when his mother told him valley parade had not been stafford heginbotham 's first fire
