she set up her own business , the west brewery , in 2006 ... listening to the italy businessman on the other end of the line , petra could see pound signs in front of her eyes
but , as she consulted her diary , petra â who runs one of uk âs most successful small breweries , knew what her answer had to be
petra wetzel , 40 ( pictured ) , is a divorcee who lives in glasgow with her son , noah , nine ( pictured )
she set up her own business , the west brewery , in 2006 â he could only offer me a two - hour slot bang in the middle of my son âs sports day last year , â recalls petra
â blonde , attractive and the founder of one of uk âs most successful small breweries with an annual turnover just shy of Â£ 10 million , petra may well be every man âs dream
the only man in my life is noah
â as a single mother , running a hugely successful business is a tall order
what makes petra âs success even more extraordinary is that she started her company when noah was just a baby â and in the wake of a broken marriage
and later this year she is opening a second brewery in glasgow to cope with demand
petra ( pictured ) was inspired to start her own brewery when her father visited her glasgow and she realised that the city did n't have its own brewery he ordered a pint of local lager , took a sip and winced
then he asked what the best glasgow lager was and , to my horror , i realised i did nât know
he could nât believe that a city like glasgow did nât have its own brewery
â twelve years later , petra opened a small brewery and beer hall / restaurant with her then husband , gordon , with the help of a loan from her parents
â west brewing company opened in march 2006 , just eight months after noah was born
â he was conceived on a trip to chicago , where we âd gone to learn about brewing , â petra recalls
â she adds : â we had bills to pay , so i was working three days a week just two months after noah arrived
â the west brewing company opened in march 2006 , just eight months after petra 's son , noah was born
she initially started the company with gordan , her then husband however , in october 2006 , when noah was just three months old , petra âs life went into free fall when her marriage fell apart
i focused on looking after noah and my job
â however , in december 2007 , a little over a year after the break - up of their marriage , petra had another shock : the business was in crisis
noah gave me the confidence i needed , â says petra
my parents agreed to look after noah for seven weeks in germany
petra ( pictured with noah ) says her son gave her the confidence she needed to carry on with the business even after the initial struggles â it was tough
noah went into full - time day care and most nights i would still be at my laptop at 1am
â i quit my legal job and bought the assets out of the hands of administrators and began building it , single - handedly , into the thriving company it is today
i could beat myself up about not being there enough for noah
noah knows he âs my priority
we have the most wonderful full - time nanny , helen , who noah adores , and i spend every second i âm not working with him
