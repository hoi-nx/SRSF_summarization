uefa have set a potentially dangerous precedent by ruling that the final 18 seconds of england women 's u19 qualifier against norway will be replayed after a refereeing mistake
the elite round qualifier will be restarted at 9:45pm at seaview in belfast on thursday with the match resuming with england retaking a penalty in the 96th minute at 2 - 1 down
england 's 3 - 1 group 4 victory against switzerland on thursday afternoon means the young lionesses will qualify for the u19 if the penalty is scored and the match is drawn 2 - 2
england are awarded a penalty during their european u19 women 's championships qualifier in belfast referee marija kurtes points to the spot as england are awarded a penalty in the 96th minute williamson steps up to take a penalty in the closing stages of the match against norway williamson runs forward to strike the ball but team - mate ayane ( circled ) has entered the box williamson turns and celebrates as she slots the ball into the goalkeeper 's bottom - right corner german referee marija kurtes officiating a women 's bundesliga match in munich last month jenna dear scored twice at the seaview stadium while williamson , who is set to take the last minute spot - kick against norway , earned some practice as she scored past swiss goalkeeper tania chassot from 12 - yards
norway are second in the group following an impressive 8 - 1 win against northern ireland , but crucially have a slightly inferior goal difference meaning the spot - kick will give england a place in the european championship finals in israel
the astonishing decision has been taken for the first time in a uefa competition following an fa appeal after the referee had wrongly denied england the opportunity to retake the penalty during saturday 's match following encroachment
england midfielder williamson thought she had equalised after slotting the ball into the bottom - right corner but team - mate ayane had entered the box too early and german referee marija kurtes disallowed the goal
however , instead of ordering it to be retaken , 28 - year - old kurtes - who was named referee of the year by the football association ( football association ) in 2014 - wrongly awarded an indirect free - kick to norway
england players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against norway but referee marija kurtes awards an indirect free - kick and the celebrations are cut short williamson has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake but williamson then realises the referee 's decision and two norwegian players are seen celebrating german referee kurtes is understood to have been sent home following her error on saturday april 4 - england 1 - 2 norway ( match to be replayed from 96th min on april 9 at 9:45pm ) april 4 - switzerland 1 - 0 northern ireland april 6 - norway 2 - 0 switzerland april 6 - england 9 - 1 northern ireland april 9 - switzerland 1 - 3 england april 9 - northern ireland 1 - 8 norway a scene of apparent confusion followed england 's wild celebrations as marija kurtes explained her decision
williamson had grabbed back the ball to retake the penalty and placed it on the penalty spot before realising an indirect free - kick had been awarded
' the replay of the match should be carried out as follows : ' the match will be replayed from the minute the penalty kick was awarded to the football association at the european women 's under - 19 championship 2015 match between england vs norway played on april 4 , 2015 , and extended according to the discretion of the referee
' according to the laws of the game ( law 14 ) , a team - mate of the player taking the kick infringes the laws of the game : - the referee allows the kick to be taken - if the ball enters the goal , the kick is retaken - if the ball does not enter the goal , the referee stops play and the match is restarted with an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the infringement occurred ' as the ball entered the goal , the kick should have been re-taken
williamson scored from the penalty spot during england 's 3 - 1 victory against switzerland on thursday jenna dear ( right ) scores with a header as england inched closer to european championship qualification ' the match is scheduled to take place at the seaview stadium in belfast on thursday at 9:45pm local time with another referee
' an fa spokesperson said : ' after england women u19s ' match against norway on saturday , april 4 , the fa lodged an appeal to uefa following a disallowed penalty
england , coached by former national captain mo marley , were 2 - 0 down to norway on saturday before substitute ayane pulled one back in the 87th minute to give her side hope of claiming a point
rather than retaking the penalty , an indirect free - kick was wrongly awarded by japanese referee toshimitsu yoshida to bahrain and the game ended with a one - goal margin
