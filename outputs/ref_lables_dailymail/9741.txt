the monster iceberg , larger than manhattan , was spotted breaking away from antarctica 's getz ice shelf by the u.s. national ice center ( nic )
the image on the left shows the landscape before the iceberg broke three and on the right the monster berg floating in the ocean glaciers in the amundsen sea of west antarctica are losing ice faster than anywhere else on the continent and are the largest contributors to the rise of sea levels
measuring 17 miles ( 27km ) long , iceberg b-34 appears to have fractured and moved out into in the amundsen sea sometime in mid- to late - february 2015 , nasa said
the first image ( left ) shows the iceberg on february 16 , when it was still attached to the ice shelf
glaciers in this region are losing ice faster than anywhere else on the continent and are the largest contributors to the rise of sea levels large icebergs can have large - scale impacts on the southern ocean
the amundsen sea has long been thought to be the weakest ice sheet in the antarctic
a study published in december suggests the barren region is haemorrhaging ice at a rate triple that of a decade ago
researchers believe that the melting of glaciers in antarctica , which contain enough water to raise sea levels by at least a metre , may be irreversible
the findings of the 21 - year study by nasa and the university of california , irvine claim to provide the most accurate estimates yet of just how fast glaciers are melting in the amundsen sea embayment
scientists found the rate by taking radar , laser and satellite measurements of the glaciers ' mass between 1992 and 2013
scientists are hoping to combine images such as this with noises recorded from icebergs to detect the different ways that glaciers lose ice into the oceans
this is depleting the bulwark that prevents the permanent collapse of glaciers covering the southern continent
if the ice becomes too thin it would allow the permanent glaciers to slip into the ocean and start melting , sharply increasing the rise of ocean levels
researchers found that the total volume of antarctic ice changed little between 1994 and 2003 , but after that point melting markedly accelerated
