a new vaccine to stimulate the body 's immune system could offer a cure for hiv
the ' kick and kill ' strategy aims to eradicate the virus , by stimulating the immune system - the body 's natural defence mechanism - with a vaccine
researchers believe the injection could flush out dormant hiv hiding in white blood cells with a chemical ' kick ' , allowing a boosted immune system to identify and kill the cells
the theory , developed by researchers at ucl , the university of oxford and the university of north carolina , is based on a single patient case study
scientists hope a new ' kick and kill ' vaccine could flush out hiv hidden in the body before stimulating a person 's own immune system to kill the cells ' our study shows that the immune system can be as powerful as the most potent combination drug cocktails , ' study co-author dr gupta , of ucl , said
' the study looked at a single 59 - year - old man in london who was an ' elite controller ' - meaning his immune system could control hiv for a long period of time without his needing treatment
when the bone marrow was removed , the immune system was severely impaired , allowing the hiv to re-activate and replicate
this caused the level of virus in his bloodstream to rise from fewer than 50 copies per millilitre to approximately 28,000 copies per ml before is immune system 's function returned
when the patient 's immune function returned about two weeks after the transplant , the levels of hiv in his bloodstream rapidly fell
professor deenan pillay , also of ucl , said : ' by measuring the strength of the immune system required to keep this virus under control in this rare individual , we have a better idea of the requirements for successful future treatment
' however , demonstration even from a single subject , that our immune system can rapidly control hiv - 1 tells us a lot about the types of immune responses we should target and augment through vaccination
' dr gupta adds : ' drugs to stimulate reactivation of dormant hiv are still imperfect , and we do not know if they would be able to flush out all of the hiv from the body
' likewise , it remains to be seen whether a vaccine could enable a normal hiv patient 's immune system to kill hiv with the full strength of an elite controller
