when ali maffucci got a deal to write a cooking and healthy lifestyle book , she quit her corporate job and began working from home
as the months ticked by , she piled on the pounds
but desperate to loser weight for the book 's photo shoot , she decided to try adopt a novel way to lose weight
miss maffucci made one simple change to her diet that helped her drop over 11 kg ( 24 lbs ) in just three months
she is pictured before ( left ) and after ( right ) her weight loss now , ms maffucci weighs 10 stone , is a size 8/10 and is working on toning instead of losing weight after eating courgette noodles recommended by her mother , ali maffucci fell in love with the spiralizing tool
not long after , she took to the internet with her blog , inspiralized , where she began creating and sharing recipes using spiralized vegetables
the spiralizer is a razor - sharp cutting device that creates thin ribbons of fruits and vegetables
originally a japanese invention , it allows people to create nutritious , very low - calorie , low - carb â pasta â , â noodles â and â rice â from everyday fruit and vegetables , in less time than it takes to peel a potato
spiralize a sweet potato and in minutes you âll apparently get a filling portion of â rice â with just half the calories and carbs of regular basmati
she said : â many of us do tend to overload our plates with pasta , rice , bread and potatoes when they are on offer
a well - balanced meal should be a quarter protein , a quarter carbohydrate and half fruit and vegetables , so the spiralizer could play a really useful role in redressing the nutritional balance in a carb - heavy diet
â it was nât necessarily that i was eating unhealthy food , it was more that i was eating a lot of healthy food
' my fiancÃ© would come home and i would make dinner for him , and by the time we were done i would be exhausted , and i would just lay on the couch and probably snack on more food , â ms maffucci said
â i told myself , how could i promote this healthy lifestyle if i was nât living it myself ? â she had until late august â about three months â to transform her lifestyle so she could look and feel fit and comfortable during the photo shoot
she made a plan to get to 140 - 145 pounds ( 66 kg ) - by consistently exercising and eating her own spiralized meals minus the snacks
â i said myself " i âm gon na eat healthy spiralized meals for lunch and dinner , and that kept me satisfied and kept me fueled "
â she said did nât find it difficult to stick to spiralized food
if you were to boil some pasta , drain it and then try to eat it , it would nât really taste good ; it âs sort of the same thing with spiralized food , ' she said
â she said by eating food she normally would , and replacing pasta , rice , potatoes and processed food with spiralized vegetables , she did nât have to sacrifice her taste buds in the name of health
ms maffucci said she did nât find it difficult to stick to spiralized food ( her recipe for spiralized courgette with a fried egg is pictured )
after sticking with the spiralized food and staying true to her exercise schedule , ms maffucci reached 150 pounds ( 68 kg ) by early august , extremely close to her goal
