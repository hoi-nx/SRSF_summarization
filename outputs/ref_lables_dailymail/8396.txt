authorities in montgomery county have released the 911 call that led to two ' free range ' getting picked up and held by police and cps for five hours over the weekend
the unnamed caller gave the operator a blow - by - blow account as he wandered behind rafi , 10 , and his sister dvora , 6 , in silver spring on sunday
the 7 - minute call would reignite a controversy focused on those kids and their scientist parents , danielle and alexander meitiv , who espouse the hands - off parenting style
' scene : the 911 call that reignited the ' free - range ' parenting controversy for two maryland parents has been released and reveals that rafi , 10 , and his sister dvora , 6 , were picked up by police while walking through this vicinity of the washington , dc - adjacent suburb of silver spring on sunday the operator asked , ' have you talked to them to see , you know , why are they just walking around by themselves ? ' ' no , no , they came up and asked to pet my dog , i let them , and that was it ... i do n't want to scare them , ' he said
their parents danielle and alexander meitiv have been cited multiple times for allowing their kids to roam free in their suburban neighborhood
but the meitivs say authorities crossed a line over the weekend when they picked up rafi and dvora and held them nearly six hours without food before allowing them to reunite with their parents

the parents danielle and alexander meitiv ( right ) have vowed to sue authorities responsible for keeping them in custody for six hours picked up again : the meitivs say they were left to panic for hours by cps workers after their children -- who they raise with a so - called ' free - range ' approach -- were picked up by police for the second time in two months while walking down the street alone attorney matthew dowd , of the firm wiley rein , is representing the meitivs and on tuesday sent a pointed letter regarding sunday 's events
rein wrote : ' the actions of cps and montgomery county police violate the fundamental rights parents have in raising their children
the meitivs made headlines just before christmas when police found rafi and dvora walking the sidewalk on their own
' besides the policeman pulling up ... no ' : asked if he was scared during the hours - long ordeal sunday , 10 - year - old rafi admitted he was , but not because he 'd been left alone with his sister free - range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so - called ' helicopter parenting '
what 's more , the elder child , rafi , insists the scariest part of the hours - long ordeal was being picked up by police
they 've been missing since 6 o'clock â¦ somebody called 911 and the police called cps and they decided to bring the kids here and they did n't call us
even then , they say they were n't reunited with their children or even told where they were for hours
parenting style : the meitivs believe in giving children an unusual amount of independence from a young age guarantees : as part of their free - range parenting philosophy , the meitivs make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street ' they made us sign a safety plan that says we will not leave them attended at all until they follow up , ' and i 'm not gon na risk my kids being snatched again like this by cps
' when questioned , the meitivs say they believe in a so - called ' free - range ' approach to parenting , which encourages independence from infancy
in march , the cps found the couple guilty of neglect for letting the children walk home from school alone
