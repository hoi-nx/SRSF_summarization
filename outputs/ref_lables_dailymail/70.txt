it 's every chocoholic 's dream come true - a mountain of easter eggs covering the entire house
but while lian marshall - pictured among the treats - does have two chocolate - loving daughters , this incredible bounty is not for them
ellie , 10 , and taylor , five , lost their eight - year - old brother harvey last year to a mystery illness , and when easter approached they decided to donate all their eggs to the patients at sheffield children 's hospital where he was cared for
lian marshall - pictured among the treats - has two chocolate - loving daughters but this incredible bounty is not for them
instead the eggs will be donated to sheffield children 's hospital once the family , from furness vale , derbyshire , posted on facebook , kind strangers began to send eggs - and now there are more than 1,000
ellie said : ' i thought it was going to be never - ending ! it feels really nice to remember him and i do n't think the hospital were expecting as many
ellie marshall , 10 , and taylor biggin ( both above with mother lian ) , five , came up with the idea in memory of their brother harvey ' it feels a bit strange at the moment
