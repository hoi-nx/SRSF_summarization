he has just been given licence to pick one of the finest backs of the era for the world cup , but cheika is more pre-occupied with the denigration of his wallabies pack
toulon playmaker matt giteau could be a glorious asset at the showpiece tournament after wallabies âs policy against picking players based abroad was relaxed this week , but one thing he ca nât do is anchor the scrum
the national coach refuses to bite back , but he has evidently noted and logged claims from these parts that his forwards will be cannon fodder for their english and welsh rivals , amid the three - way tussle for qualification from daunting pool a. wallabies head coach cheika is aware that his pack is being written off for the world cup cheika 's side will face england and wales in crunch pool games at the tournament in september england 's pack demolished wallabies at scrum - time during last november 's 26 - 17 victory at twickenham in fact , many of the claims have come from these pages
speaking to sportsmail from sydney , cheika repeatedly name - checked a certain knight of the realm and columnist of this newspaper , among the voices arguing that the green - and - gold pack will be smashed into submission
â it has been pretty well reported here that clive woodward and others have said that england are going to take us apart in the forwards , â he said
â jonathan joseph looks like a nice player and they âve got some good options in midfield now
ford has done well for england at 10 , they âve got fast wingers and i âm a big fan of mike brown at full - back
â cheika âs admiration for england âs attacking runners behind the scrum is part of the former leinster coach âs overall assertion that the european nations are just as adept at playing an open game as their southern rivals , when conditions allow
but his repeated references to the pre-tournament dismissal of his pack suggest that there will be a strong emphasis on the set piece in particular during the world cup countdown over the summer
toulon playmaker matt giteau ( left ) is set to feature for the wallabies at the world cup â commentators in the uk are saying we wo nât be able to match it with england and wales in the forwards , â he reiterated
â according to cheika , the epic final day of this year âs rbs 6 nations â truly â super saturday â â gave a vivid demonstration to viewers down under about the threat to the wallabies from england and wales
â england and wales will be feeling good about themselves after the rbs 6 nations
â as a long - standing fan of rugby league , cheika is well aware of sam burgess âs potential to make a major impact in his new code , once he has come through the transition phase
cheika has cited ben youngs ( left ) and danny care as dangerous no 9 's who challenge the advantage line jonathan joseph ( second left ) was superb for stuart lancaster 's side throughout the rbs 6 nations â i believe that he will be picked and that england will use him as a weapon off the bench with 10 or 15 minutes to go , â he said
â in contrast to his kiwi counterpart , steve hansen , who is concerned that rugby is becoming boring , cheika is expecting an â awesome â world cup with an emphasis on try - scoring , thanks in part to the improved pitches at leading grounds here such as twickenham and the millennium stadium
â wallabies should be able to play positively , with their backline enhanced by the presence of matt giteau â who had been in test exile since moving to toulon in 2011
cheika confirmed yesterday that he met the 32 - year - old recently , prior to the announcement of the aru âs historic policy change and believes that he can add utility value to the wallabies squad
with such pedigree in just one position , wallabies âs pack can not be written off lightly
