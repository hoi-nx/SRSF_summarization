williams started embellishing his stories because he felt insecure following in brokaw 's very large footsteps at nbc , according to a new report
the network handed williams a six - month suspension in february after he acknowledged he had lied about being on board a helicopter that came under fire while reporting from iraq in 2003
but according to a report in vanity fair , williams started exaggerating his stories because he felt insecure about brokaw , whom he succeeded at nightly news in 2004
clash : brokaw and williams are pictured in new york in 2004 - the year williams took over brokaw 's role on the nightly news
a new report has claimed williams always felt insecure following him ' and he had to follow brokaw , which brought its own set of insecurities
' but according to former correspondents who spoke to vanity fair , brokaw was n't so accepting of the ' quirks '
on hearing the tale , brokaw went into ' spasms of anger ' , one former exec told vanity fair
' others said that the two men had a troubled relationship after williams took over the role because even though brokaw pushed for him to get the job , williams never ' embraced ' him
' [ williams ] knows the rank and file will never love him like they did brokaw , so he never tries
' exaggerations : during a report in february , pictured , williams recounted a tale of how he had been on a chinook that came under fire while in iraq in 2003 - but he had actually been in a separate aircraft it also meant that when williams found himself in hot water over his claim he had been in a downed chinook - when he had actually been in a separate aircraft - brokaw did n't have his back
a friend told the publication that while brokaw - who was ' livid ' about the scandal - did n't call for williams to be punished , he ' did n't try to save him either
' following the suspension , williams reportedly declared to a friend : ' chalk one up for brokaw
' not impressed : brokaw , pictured in february , came ' incensed ' when he heard williams ' exaggerations the article also claimed that when he was called out for lying in his reports and conversations following the 2003 helicopter incident , williams could n't bring himself to admit he had made it up - and instead , he suggested he might have a brain tumor
' ( he said , ) ' did something happen to ( my ) head ? maybe i had a brain tumor , or something in my head ' , ' a source said
' when it came to uncovering the truth behind what actually happened in the 2003 helicopter incident , nbc quickly learned williams himself would be of no help
others suggested that the problem with williams ' work was because the newscaster , who had never been a war or foreign correspondent before taking over at nightly news , had no interest in reporting on war stories or ' heavy ' news and lacked the experience of his predecessors
while some nbc employees say this diversity was admirable and something his predecessors had never mastered , others say it did not go down well with the network
' in february , williams was forced to admit that he was n't aboard the helicopter that was hit and forced down by enemy fire in iraq in 2003 - a story he had often repeated over the past 12 years
' overwhelmed ' : sources told vanity fair that williams , pictured in iraq , did not want to report on ' hard ' news and did n't enjoy politics or war stories , and lacked the experience of his predecessors lies : during a report in 2003 , he reported how a chinook , pictured , had been grounded but he later claimed he had been aboard the aircraft that was shot down
even though williams learned about the uproar over his false story on facebook , he failed to bring it up with nbc execs when he met with them the next day , suggesting deeper flaws within the network and its relationship with staff , former employees told vanity fair
' while williams initially believed he 'd be back to work within days , he was ultimately suspended for six months , and he accepted that he had to step back , sources said
nightly news is now being anchored by lester holt and it is unclear if williams will return
iraq war , 2003 over the years , williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an army chinook helicopter during the iraq war in 2003
