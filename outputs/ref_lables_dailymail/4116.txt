it sat on a stark white block in a vast room that resembled a laboratory
i was at the sculpturecenter in the new york borough of queens , a spot dedicated to all things modern and avant garde
taking pride of place was a cluster of bottles , each of which contained dog fluff and a photo of the mutt it came from
â cultural revolution : new york is in the throes of a cultural revolution - but moma is still brilliant welcome , then , to nu york , a city that bears no resemblance to the version depicted in friends and gossip girl and instead centres around a throbbing contemporary arts scene largely based in brooklyn and queens - the latter the beneficiary of a recent gentrification programme
it was all a far cry from iceland where i had begun my trip , courtesy of an icelandair wheeze that gives you the option of stopping off to see the sights of reykjavik and the spectacular golden circle for up to seven days en route to boston , anchorage , washington or , in my case , new york
stunning : the gullfoss waterfall in pingvellir national park is a short hop from reykjavik awe - inspiring : geysir is home to a row of geysers that fire boiling water and a sulphurous stench into the air covered with a thick layer of snow , pingvellir national park sits atop the fault line that separates the north american continent from the european one and provides iceland with its volcanoes , geysers and geothermal springs
the next morning , it was off to new york which , with its claustrophobic cluster of skyscrapers and determinedly chic inhabitants , was a very different prospect indeed
looking cool : williamsburg , home to jake gyllenhaal among others , is awash with artisan bars new look : queens has had a makeover , with tough neighbourhoods replaced with cool shops and chic bars among them are the staff at the roger smith hotel in midtown manhattan , who took a break from watching the super bowl to ply me with burgers and fries as i arrived , dishevelled , following a five - hour flight from reykjavik
the next morning , after an all - american breakfast of bacon and waffles , i left the chintzy charms of the roger smith behind for a visit to moma , the epicentre of new york âs cultural cool
carrying bags of warhol prints and a sunday morning sized moma mug , we hopped into one of new york âs iconic yellow taxis for a short ride to low - rise williamsburg , where another hipster favourite â craft beer â is taking hold
artisan beer , artisan food and artisan art are all staples of new york âs burgeoning hipster culture , although to a cynical brit like me , some of it felt a little try - hard
brilliant : the museum of moving image is set to become a new york must - visit - well worth going to a case in point is the play sleep no more , which made its dÃ©but in london to critical rumblings and indifferent audiences but has become a real favourite in new york
luckily for those whose tastes do nât stretch to baffling plays and bottles of dog fluff , new york still has much to love
along with moma , there âs the brilliant museum of moving image in queens which takes you on a whistlestop tour through the us â lengthy cinematic history with the help of a cleverly curated selection of pieces , among them the creepy doll which found fame in the exorcist
in queens alone , there âs everything from brazilian to uk and everything in between - and nearly all of it is delicious
nu york might not be to everyone âs taste but there âs no shortage of reasons to love the big apple â pulsating art scene and a quirky taste in plays included
