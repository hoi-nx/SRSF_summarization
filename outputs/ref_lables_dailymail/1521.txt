when leanne , a mother - of - four from romford in essex , began to suspect that her partner steve was having an affair , she was heartbroken
but in a twist that she could never have foreseen , the other woman turned out to be her younger sister larissa
now , three years after the affair that tore her family apart , ms leanne says she is still struggling to come to terms with what happens - and still has bad days when she ca n't stop crying
' but all that changed when larissa , who is seven years younger than ms leanne , moved into her home when she was 17
although larissa says there was nothing between her and steve to begin with , a night out when she was 20 resulted in a liaison with her sister 's partner - and the start of an affair
' upset : leanne appeared on itv 's this morning to tell her story rapprochement : larissa is finally winning back her sister after more than three years in the cold caught in the middle : sarah guyton was caught in the centre of the increasingly acrimonious dispute noticing that the pair were spending increasing amounts of time together , ms leanne became suspicious but , believing that her sister would do nothing to hurt her , stayed quiet
' then , a few months later , larissa revealed she was pregnant and claimed not to know who the father was
' larissa had never really had a boyfriend
' larissa and steve were both over the moon about it , really happy , ' she says
' putting her fears to one side , she supported her sister and was there when larissa gave birth to her son logun in august 2011
speaking on itv 's this morning , ms leanne says she was convinced that her sister was the other woman the moment she saw the newborn
shock : leanne also spoke of the moment that she realised her sister 's baby had been fathered by her partner ' i had suspicions anyway but as soon as i saw the baby , i knew because not only did it look like steve , it look like my children when they were babies
i saw a friend straight after and i said , " that baby is steve 's "
but then , consumed with guilt , she finally confessed the truth to their mother sarah guyton in a text message that read : ' well what 's she going to do when she finds out logun is steve 's ? i ca n't hide it any more
' ms leanne was , she says , left ' utterly devastated ' by the news and furious that despite repeated questioning , both larissa and steve had point - blank denied having an affair
then , a few days after the bombshell hit , steve moved out of ms leanne 's home and in with her sister
' larissa responded angrily and more than three years on , the sisters are still estranged and struggling to come to terms with what happened
