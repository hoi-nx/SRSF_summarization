celtic manager deila will try to persuade jason denayer and manchester city to extend the centre - back 's loan deal next season - but hearts captain danny wilson is also among his defensive targets
jason denayer made his full international debut in belgium 's 1 - 0 european championship qualifying victory in israel on tuesday night , coming on as a substitute after vincent kompany was sent off
the 19 - year - old also faces competition from kompany at manchester city , and deila would welcome another season - long loan arrangement
celtic want to keep manchester city defender jason denayer ( left ) on loan for another season hearts captain danny wilson is another defensive target for celtic manager deila but , with jason denayer due to spend pre-season with his parent club in a bid to prove himself , there is no guarantee he will return , and certainly not in time for celtic 's champions league qualifying campaign beginning in mid-july
so deila confirmed he would look to sign a centre - back and responded to reports that former rangers player danny wilson was among his list of potential targets
' that is one of many names we are talking about but there is nothing serious in that , ' deila said
' deila , who spent last week watching norway training before their 5 - 1 defeat in croatia , added : ' jason denayer is going back to manchester city after the season to have a pre-season and we will see if we can get him back or not
that is something we want , but we have to co-operate with manchester city
' jason denayer is ambitious - he wants to play at the highest level he can
but it 's playing that is the most important thing , and playing at manchester city is very , very hard
' celtic boss deila has confirmed that he will ask manchester city if he can keep jason denayer next season jason denayer rises highest to score against aberdeen at celtic park at the beginning of last month celtic were involved in another loan deal this week when 18 - year - old midfielder liam joined rosenborg until the summer
' jason denayer , pictured celebrating a goal in august last year , is hoping to break into manchester city 's first - team when asked if more scottish players should experience playing abroad , deila said : ' abroad or not , i 'm not sure what is best , but you have to learn a different culture , different ways of playing football , which is positive , and also learning a language and getting away from a safe environment
