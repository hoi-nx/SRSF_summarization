it 's that time of the season when premier league footballers cast their vote for the pfa â player of the year
last year âs winner luis suarez now resides in spain , so , too , does 2013 victor gareth bale
here , sportsmail runs you through the six leading contenders â¦ name : harry kane club : spurs age : 21 stats : apps 44 , goals 29 striker harry kane has hit an astonishing 29 goals in 44 games for spurs so far this season harry kane ( second right ) has twice been named player of the month during his breakthrough campaign harry kane ( left ) broke into the england squad and scored 79 seconds into his debut against lithuania reasons he deserves it : very few would have predicted harry kane would plunder an incredible 29 goals by early april in what is essentially his breakthrough season
in an age where diving , spitting , lying and cheating too often dominate our news agenda , harry kane âs goal - laden arrival has been a joy to witness
reasons he does nât : are there any ? you could argue it took him until november to score two premier league goals but that was as much to do with a lack of opportunities
previous ( individual ) premier league honours : player of the month ( 2 ) name : eden hazard club : chelsea age : 24 stats : apps 44 , goals 17 eden hazard has been chelsea 's outstanding performer , scoring 17 times in 44 games hazard ( left ) has been a menace to opponents all season with his trickery and high workrate hazard ( centre ) is the odds - on favourite to be named pfa players ' player of the year reasons he deserves it : he âs running back into form at just the right time and his goals look like they âll edge chelsea towards the title
reasons he does nât : like harry kane , it is hard to make an argument against a player who has performed at such a high level on a consistent basis
previous honours : player of the month ( 1 ) name : sergio aguero club : city age : 26 stats : apps 31 , goals 23 reasons he deserves it : without his goals city âs title challenge would have faded long ago
sergio aguero , though , has managed to mask those shortcomings with his brilliance
sergio aguero has again been in prolific scoring form for city , blasting 23 goals in 31 matches sergio aguero ( right ) has struggled with fitness and has only managed to score three times in the league in 2015 reasons he does nât : if sergio aguero managed to avoid what are all - too - frequent visits to the treatment room then city might be pushing chelsea harder for the league title
previous honours : player of the month ( 2 ) name : david de gea club : united age : 24 stats : apps 37 , clean sheets 13 david de gea ( left ) has been outstanding for united with 13 clean sheets this season de gea shone for united in the early part of the premier league campaign when united struggled for form de gea 's displays have been integral to united 's top - four charge and he has been their best player reasons he deserves it : only de gea was spared criticism as united struggled to find their rhythm during the early part of the season
for while de gea has been united âs best player , he has not single - handedly done enough to turn them into challengers for the premier league crown
previous honours : pfa team of the year 2013 name : alexis sanchez club : arsenal age : 26 stats : apps 43 , goals 20 alexis sanchez hit the ground running at arsenal following his barcelona switch , with 20 goals in 43 games alexis sanchez hit 14 goals in 18 appearances during his most relentless scoring period this season chilean international alexis sanchez has added greater aggression to arsenal 's attacking line with his arrival reasons he deserves it : there was a suspicion it would take the chilean time to settle in the premier league
previous honours : none verdict : if the bookies are to be believed then the award will be going to last season âs young player of the year , eden hazard
however , do nât underestimate the amount of goodwill there is towards harry kane within the game and he could well clean up with both the young and senior prizes
harry kane certainly gets my vote !
