standing isolated surrounded by the vast , golden north saudi arabia desert is a bizarre single rock castle , which has been lying undisturbed for centuries
qasr al-farid or ' the lonely castle ' has a sad tale , standing incomplete and abandoned , looking out of place in the vast , barren landscape
the tomb is the largest of 131 monumental tombs , which were carved straight into rock in the city of mada'in saleh during the pinnacle of nabatean era
it is remarkable how the lonely castle has remained so preserved against the elements for over 1,900 years and this can be attributed to the dry climate
situated on a pre-islamic archaeological site located in al-ula , is located on one of the major trading sites , which linked the south of the saudi arabia peninsula to the north
nabataeans constructed their massive stone buildings mainly from single pieces of sandstone , and carved from the top down if the smooth stone reminds you of the iconic carved site of petra in jordan , it should come as no surprise to learn they are linked
it displays similar architecture design to qasr al-farid , being carved out of a single stone body
