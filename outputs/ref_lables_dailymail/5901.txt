kevin gameiro saved his goalkeeper 's blushes with a late equaliser which put defending champions sevilla into the last four of the europa league
beto had looked to have cost his side their progress , with the game heading towards extra time , before substitute kevin gameiro arrived to slot home with five minutes remaining
it had been a risk to start the portuguese keeper , but sevilla boss unai emery decided it one he was prepared to take , despite beto 's absence since a game against real madrid in the first week of february
carlos bacca slams home the early penalty after vitolo had been brought down by neto after five minute hulk celebrates his goal with axel witsel but zenit could n't hold on for extra time in the end it was a gamble that spectacularly back - fired , with the keeper gifting zenit two of the softest goals imaginable , to see the holders surrender a two - goal lead in the tie
first , just a matter of seconds after the half - time break , with sevilla two goals up on aggregate a cruising , beto dropped the ball , under no pressure , at the feet of salomon rondon , allowing the venezuelan to rekindle the tie from a matter of yards
then , when brazilian forward hulk hit a speculative , but not overly threatening shot from 40 yards , beto could only flap it over his own line , turning the tie on its head and sending it towards extra time
bacca is mobbed by his sevilla team - mates after putting them in complete control of the tie early on zenit : lodygin , criscito , neto , lombaerts , igor smolnikov ; javi garcia , axel witsel ; danny , shatov , hulk , salomon rondon ( kerzhakov 83 mins ) subs not used : malafeev , rodic , anyukov , tymoshchuk , sheydaev , arshavin goal : salomon rondon 48 , hulk 72 booked : neto , axel witsel , lodygin sevilla : beto , benoit tremoulinas , pareja ( iborra 22 ) , coke , carrico , aleix vidal , vitolo ( denis suarez 92 ) , banega , mbia , krychowiak , carlos bacca ( kevin gameiro 72 ) subs not used : rico , figueiras , navarro , reyes goal : bacca 6 , kevin gameiro 85 booked : iborra it was a pulsating finish to a game that had started promisingly , but looked to have faded away somewhat in the first half
that advantage lasted little more than five minutes however , as defender neto stupidly dived in on sevilla winger vitolo , to concede an early penalty
andre villas-boas ' team barely registered a shot before first - half stoppage time , the one exception coming in the 18th minute , when captain danny exchanged passes with hulk before seeing his near - post shot saved by beto
