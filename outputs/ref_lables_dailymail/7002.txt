despite being embroiled in the very public and traumatic feud where the vinceni girls were dragged kicking and screaming from their mother 's home in the middle of the night to go back to live with their father in 2012 , the girls have established healthy and happy lives in italy and speak to their mum every night
60 minutes reporter tara brown interviewed the two eldest girls , emily and claire , who she described as elegant , gracious , reserved and studious , at their home near florence and they expressed their regret for the way they handled the dramatic exit
' they are elegant , gracious , reserved and studious , ' 60 minutes reporter tara brown told daily mail australia
' tara brown said the girls were somewhat aware of the hysteria the distressing scenes of their exit caused and ' have a bit of regret about how they handled it ... so public and being so vehement , but they were manipulated '
the girls are living positive and fruitful lives , attending school six days a week , talking about what they will study at university and going out with their italy boyfriends in florence
despite claims by the girls ' mother that they were not happy in italy , the sisters now seem settled and leading good lives with their father tomaso
' this scene of one of the tomaso girls in apparent distress outside her father 's villa in florence after the four sisters were taken back from australia to italy emily and vincenti ( pictured ) are now aged 16 and 17 and are living in italy with their father the story was that the girls had been taken from their abusive father back in italy to hide out in australia and now they were being sent back to the ' monster ' against their will
that was in 2012 and it seemed unbelievable to many australia who watched the scenes play out that the girls were legally being returned to their italy father as approved under italy law

in 2010 , garrett told tomaso she wanted to take the girls back to australia for a vacation
despite claims by the girls ' mother than they were not happy in italy , the sisters now seem settled and leading good lives with father tomaso once back in australia , ms garrett and her daughters settled down to life in queensland for two years , until the dramatic scenes which saw them returned to italy
