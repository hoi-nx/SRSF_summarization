the pentagon said tuesday it would exhume and try to identify the remains of nearly 400 sailors and marine killed when the uss oklahoma sank in the bombing of pearl harbor

the move is apparently a part of a new pentagon policy on disinterring the remains of unknown troops
according to the new policy , bodies may be exhumed from punchbowl or any other permanent united states military cemeteries - but they can not be removed from any u.s. navy vessel that is being used as a national memorial , like the uss arizona which remains sunk and on display in honolulu
they aim to identify the remains of up to 388 servicemen within five years
in 2003 , the military disinterred one casket at the punchbowl based on information provided by emory , a pearl harbor survivor who has spent years doggedly scouring documents
