carriers of the brca1 gene , like hollywood star jolie , can reduce their risk of death once they have been diagnosed with breast cancer by having their ovaries removed women diagnosed with breast cancer caused by the gene carried by jolie could be helped to beat the disease if they have their ovaries removed as she did
a study indicates that following the example of the hollywood star cuts their risk of dying from breast cancer by more than 60 per cent
two years before , she had a double mastectomy as she carries the brca1 gene variant which dramatically raises the risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer
women who carry a mutated version of brca1 or another gene known as brca2 face a life - time risk of breast cancer of up to 70 per cent
having an oophorectomy was associated with a significant drop of 62 per cent in breast cancer death in women with a brca1 mutation , but this did not occur in those with a brca2 mutation
for the 70 brca1 carriers who had their ovaries removed within two years , there was a 73 per cent reduction in death compared with women with the mutation who never underwent the procedure
the authors , writing in the journal jama oncology , said that the protective effect of oophorectomy against breast cancer was apparent immediately after diagnosis and lasted for 15 years
â those women diagnosed with the brca1 gene mutation have a 50 to 80 per cent risk of developing breast cancer , pictured , in their lifetime women with a significant family history of breast cancer may have an increased risk of getting the disease
a significant family history is defined by : women who inherit the faulty , or mutated , brca1 or brca2 genes have a 50 to 80 per cent chance of developing breast cancer during their lifetime
brca2 gene faults are more common in the ashkenazi jewish population , about 2.3 per cent of ashkenazi jewish women have a brca2 gene mutation
other studies of the gene mutation carriers have found that reduced mortality is associated with ovary removal for women with a history of breast cancer
