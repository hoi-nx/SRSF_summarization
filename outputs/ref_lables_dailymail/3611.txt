a controversial united states pastor has defended trying to buy a $ 65million private jet with worshippers ' donations and responded to critics by claiming ' the devil is trying to discredit ' him
reverend creflo dollar , 53 , launched an appeal last month for 200,000 people to each donate ' $ 300 or more ' so that he could purchase a gulfstream g650 to replace his current damaged aircraft

i never one time came to you and asked you for a dime for this airplane , did i ? damaged : creflo dollar says the church 's current plane , bought in 1999 , is broken and needs to be replaced , or he will be unable to continue working around the world ' the ( critics ) do n't know what we do
that 's why they asked the question , what does a preacher need with an airplane ? if you knew what we did , then you would n't ask that question
his original appeal for the gulfstream g650 - which claims to be the fastest plane ever built in civilian aviation - was so that ' creflo dollar can continue to blanket the globe with the gospel of grace '
' the gulfstream g650 is the biggest , fastest , most luxurious , longest range and most technologically advanced jet -- by far , ' according to the site

he preaches all over the world , but primarily works out of a 8,500 - seat amphitheater in atlanta called the ' world dome ' , sending the sermons to churches all over the country via satellite
' arrested : the reverend was charged in 2012 for allegedly attacking his teenage daughter ' our hearts desire to see precious lives changed and snatched out of darkness and thrust into his marvelous light ! ' we need your help to continue reaching a lost and dying world for the lord jesus christ , " the appeal continued before asking supporters of the ministry to sow a $ 300 seed into the airplane fund , billed project g650
