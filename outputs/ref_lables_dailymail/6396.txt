city 's tenacious , creative and versatile midfielder james milner could leave as a free agent goalkeeper - gerhard tremmel ( swansea ) at 36 years old , he is no spring chicken , but gerhard tremmel could prove a useful acquisition for a newly - promoted side
gerhard tremmel has played second fiddle to michel vorm and then lukasz fabianski during his four years at swansea , but has performed well when called upon in the cup competitions and was in goal when the swans beat bradford in the capital one cup final two years ago
swansea 's gerhard tremmel , 36 , is the understudy for lukasz fabianski but has done well in the cups right - back - glen johnson ( liverpool ) england 's first - choice right - back at the world cup is still a regular for liverpool , but he looks almost certain to end his six - year spell at anfield this summer
england 's first - choice right - back at the world cup looks set to leave liverpool after six years this summer centre - back - kolo toure ( liverpool ) another regular at liverpool who is still to extend his contract
inconsistency has been kolo toure 's curse - the 34 - year - old ivorian has produced some howlers at liverpool centre - back - ron vlaar ( aston villa ) ron vlaar performed so well at the world cup that his omission from the team of the tournament raised a few eyebrows , especially when thiago silva was selected ahead of him
holland 's ron vlaar was a surprise omission from the team of the world cup but could leave aston villa left - back - luke garbutt ( everton ) everton have been doing everything they can to tie this promising young defender down to a new deal , but he is yet to put pen to paper
everton want to lock the talented 21 - year - old luke garbutt down for the long term but he 's yet to commit right wing - james milner ( city ) probably the most high - profile free agent available this summer , james milner has 15 years ' worth of top - flight experience to his name and 53 england caps
james milner has 15 years in top flight experience , 53 england caps and still is n't 30 , so a great buy for someone mikel arteta ( arsenal ) named arsenal captain last summer , but mikel arteta has not played for the gunners since november due to injury
mikel arteta has n't played for arsenal since november due to injury and will need to displace francis coquelin central midfield - tom cleverley ( manchester united ) named captain for a tour match against roma last summer , tom cleverley clearly thought he had a future under new manchester united manager louis van gaal
unwanted by manchester united , aston villa and everton want to sign england international tom cleverley left wing - jonas gutierrez ( newcastle ) bravely battled back from testicular cancer to return to the newcastle squad last month , but is no longer wanted by his club
testicular cancer survivor jonas gutierrez will be an important figure somewhere , even if it is n't newcastle striker - danny ings ( burnley ) one of a number of young english strikers pushing for national selection after scoring nine goals for burnley this season
manchester united and city are said to be interested in burnley 's dangerous striker danny ings striker - james wilson ( manchester united ) promoted to the first - team squad last summer following a fairytale debut under ryan giggs against hull
