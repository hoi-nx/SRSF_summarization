nigel farage suffered a fresh blow today after a poll of key marginal seats revealed voters were deserting ukip in droves and returning to labour and the tories
in 10 battleground constituencies polled by the conservatives peer ashcroft , ukip 's vote has fallen in nine
support for mr nigel farage 's party has more than halved in two seats and by more than a third in most of the others
the ukip leader has seen his support in thanet collapse from a 12 point lead over the tories
today 's polling also mirrors nationwide polls which show that ukip 's support has fallen by 25 per cent in the last six months alone
ukip 's dramatic collapse in support has not , however , led to a surge in support for the tories
according to lord ashcroft 's poll of 10 marginal constituencies today , the tories are set to lose four seats to labour but cling on in five
according to lord ashcroft 's poll of 10 marginal constituencies today , the tories are set to lose four seats to labour but cling on to at least five the results suggest labour has strengthened its position since lord ashcroft polled the same constituencies last year , when the party was only picking up three seats from the tories
but if the general election was held tomorrow , the tories would hold on to five of the 10 marginal seats it won in 2010 â pendle , blackpool north & cleveleys , loughborough , kingswood and gloucester
comic al murray , also known as the pub landlord , arrived at thanet district council offices in margate , kent , today to hand in his nomination papers as he stands in the thanet seat against ukip leader nigel farage with the race in thanet going down to the wire , any votes the comic takes from the main candidates could prove costly lord ashcroft has one constituency â pudsey â where labour and the tories are tied
but the real shift in the seats , according to the conservatives peer 's polling , is the huge squeeze on ukip 's vote
