a preservation group says old texas dance halls that for years served as important social centers in rural areas of the state are decaying and closing , with comparatively few still operating competition : patrons are seen listening during a fiddle festival at dance hall kendalia halle was built more than 100 years ago by german immigrants , who through the latter half of the 19th century comprised more than 5 percent of the state 's population , according to the texas state historical commission
it 's one of an estimated 1,000 dance halls that sprung up around texas in the 1800s , knitting together german , czech , polish and other immigrant communities
about 400 such halls still stand â many unused and decaying â but only two traditional texas dance halls continue to operate on nearly a daily basis : luckenbach hall in fredericksburg and gruene hall in new braunfels
' the culture has shifted away from rural areas where most of the halls are , but what we see is that these cultures are foundational to what texans are and what texas is , ' said patrick sparks , board president of texas dance hall preservation
sparks ' group and others are working to preserve the state 's remaining dance halls , in part by creating an inventory so that the most distinctive ones become candidates for the national register of historic places
' you can still go out on a saturday night and experience an authentic dance hall like you could 100 years ago and that 's something that really defines our culture here in texas , ' sparks said
some dance halls also are architecturally unique , according to sparks
the cat spring agricultural society pavilion west of houston is a 12 - sided hall built in 1902 by german immigrants that features an elaborate wooden truss rising up to a cupola
twin sisters , founded by german immigrants , for years served as a vital community center , vogel said , and it 's important ' to reacquaint and refamiliarize people with this heritage
' from about 1870 into the 1920s , european immigrants in texas built hundreds of these halls
they largely served as meeting places for agricultural groups , rifle clubs and mutual benefit societies
' texas dance halls are becoming a very good investment because there are fewer and fewer of them , ' lee temple said
