a giant lamb born weighing the same as a toddler is thought to be the biggest ever birthed in the uk
the animal , aptly named hagrid after the fictional giant in harry potter , was born on tuesday at three times the size of its peers
dwarfing other newborns on the farm in gelston near grantham in lincolnshire where he was born , hagrid 's owners believe he may be the biggest ever lamb born in the uk at 25lbs
hagrid 's owners said his mother had always birthed large lambs but that they had never seen one of his size chris elkington and his wife louise , who have 130 breeding ewes on their farm , believe hagrid is the largest lamb ever born in the uk while normal lambs are born at around 10inches tall , hagrid stands almost five inches taller and weighs significantly more ' she had been a rather big ewe all year and when i got her in the shed i said to my wife we were going to have a massive lamb - but not quite that big
' the previous record for the largest lamb in the uk was held by one called joan born at 24lbs
delivered five days early on a farm in denbigh , the animal was three times heavier than the average newborn lamb .
