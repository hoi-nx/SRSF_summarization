hammers are determined to ensure their season does not end with a whimper , according to defender carl jenkinson
the hammers ' once promising campaign has tailed off , with a run of just one win in 11 premier league games seeing the club slip from champions league contention to mid-table
their latest disappointing result came at manchester city on sunday as they went down to an insipid 2 - 0 defeat
carl jenkinson holds off the challenge from jesus navas during hammers 's 2 - 0 defeat by manchester city hammers defender carl jenkinson challenges aleksandar kolorov during the clash at the etihad on sunday with europe now not realistic and relegation not an issue , the hammers would now seem to have little to play for but carl jenkinson insists the remaining five games are not meaningless
the 23 - year - old , who has enjoyed a successful season - long loan from arsenal and could make the switch permanently , said : ' people in our dressing room are fired up
' people are n't resting on their laurels , people ai n't happy finishing mid-table
' hammers were never in the game at the etihad , losing after a bizarre own goal from james collins and a swift counter-attack strike from sergio aguero before half - time
james collins scored a comical own goal to give manchester city the lead on sunday enner valencia and kevin nolan did have late chances after manchester city lost momentum following injury to david silva but they were generally lacklustre throughout the contest
carl jenkinson felt the visitors paid the price for their mistakes but does not feel the team are much doing much differently from the early part of the season
