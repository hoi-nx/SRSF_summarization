for many of those concerned about the future of the planet , giving up meat is seen as a major way for people to reduce the impact they have on the environment
producing beef , for example , requires large amounts of water , land for grazing and emits tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere
but now bill gates , the billionaire founder of microsoft and philanthropist , has said it may in fact be possible to keep eating meat and still care for the planet
he also explains that some of the impacts of meat farming have been overstated
instead he believes it will be possible to provide enough meat for the world 's growing population as demand in developing countries increases
professor gefen , a bioengineer at tel aviv university , has begun a year - long feasibility study into manufacturing chicken in a lab , funded by a non-profit group called the modern agriculture foundation which hopes ' cultured meat ' will one day replace the raising of animals for slaughter
' the consumption of meat has met with considerable criticism in recent years as climate change experts have warned about the harm it is doing to the planet
a recent report from chatham house said that the global livestock industry produces more greenhouse gas emissions than cars , planes , trains and ships combined
lord stern , the economist appointed by the british government to assess the financial impacts of climate change , has also urged people to give up meat
cattle , like those above , and other livestock produce more greenhouse gas globally than transport emissions bill gates has invested some of his fortune into projects aimed at finding sustainable solutions to problems in poverty stricken areas of the world including turning sewage water into clean drinking water ( shown above ) this makes livestock farming increasingly difficult in areas hit by drought
demand for meat is expected to soar over the next 30 years or so , with global beef consumption rising from 64 million tonnes in 2005 to 106 million tonnes in 2050 according to the food and agricultural organisation of the united nations
however , mr bill gates , who set up the bill and melinda gates foundation with his wife to fund research into sustainable technology that can tackle poverty around the world , said some of the impacts of meat have been overstated
global demand for beef , like the steak above , is expected to soar to 181 million tonnes by 2050 but mr bill gates says that it should be possible to meet this as some of the environmental impacts of meat are overstated most of this green water comes from rainfall and also evaporates back into the atmosphere , meaning it is not lost
' mr bill gates has also been funding new research projects aimed at producing meat substitutes and says he has been impressed with the results
mr bill gates also explains that he once dabbled with being vegetarian himself in his late twenties but found he could n't keep it going
