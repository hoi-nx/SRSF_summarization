in 2011 the unmanned dawn spacecraft became humanity âs first ever emissary to the huge asteroid vesta , which resides in the asteroid belt between mars and jupiter
and using images collected by the spacecraft , nasa has unveiled an interactive tool that lets you explore this world
using the map you can see a huge amount of features on vesta , from craters to the amount of sunlight hitting the surface - and switching to â 3d â also lets you fly around like you were in your own spacecraft
vesta , discovered in 1807 , is the second most massive body in the asteroid belt after the dwarf planet ceres - which dawn has now travelled to
elsehwere there are craters , hills and mountains on the surface , most formed by impacts
nasa scientists in california have revealed an interactive 3d map for vesta ( shown ) using images from the dawn
the map lets you see features on the surface including craters , hills , mountains and even ' canyons ' you can also measure elevation changes on the surface and see different measurement data
and a ' gaming mode ' lets you fly around the largest asteroid in the solar system using your keyboard 's arrow keys
the dawn spacecraft spent a year , from 2011 to 2012 , mapping and exploring vesta
you can draw lines on the surface to see elevation levels ( shown ) , place a pin to see how the angle of the sun changes at a location over time , or even draw a box to generate files to use with a 3d printer the dawn spacecraft spent a year , from 2011 to 2012 , mapping and exploring vesta ( illustration shown )
