in a retweet on thursday , a staffer to real estate magnate trump managed to capture the coarsest background conversations u.s. are having about former secretary of state hillary clinton 's personal baggage
' if hillary clinton ca n't satisfy her husband , ' a texas - cowgirl college student tweeted , ' what makes her think she can satisfy u.s. ? ' when someone retweeted the quip two hours later and included trump 's twitter handle in the message , one of the billionaire 's staffers retweeted it for him â to his audience of 2.8 million people
his office confirmed on friday that it was a trump employee , not a fat - fingered ceo , who was responsible
' it was retweeted by one of ten staff members that periodically help execute on mr. trump âs various social media platforms
' ' as soon as mr. trump saw the tweet he deleted it , ' the spokesperson added
sawyer burmeister , a texas equestrian champion , originated the line about hillary clinton 's alleged inability to ' satisfy ' her randy husband bill bill clinton , the 42nd u.s. president , had an affair with a white house intern named lewinsky
' sawyer burmeister confirmed to daily mail online that she had deleted her tweets because of a nasty backlash she originally offered an apology to people who were offended , but it apparently was n't enough for some sawyer burmeister is no stranger to media attention
and she 's a pre-law student studying criminal justice at tarleton state university in texas , according to her social media profiles
trump 's retweet might have disappeared if a snarky twitter user had n't made a screen capture on his phone
