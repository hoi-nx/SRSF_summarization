benitez is what he is ; an excellent cup manager
but despite managing some of the continent 's most established clubs since leaving valencia just over a decade ago - liverpool , inter , chelsea ( albeit on an interim basis ) and napoli - he has amassed a grand total of zero league titles
benitez famously guided liverpool to the champions league in 2005 as he enjoyed cup successes benitez remains popular at anfield , but when he left there were few regrets over his departure donovan chandler is a liverpool fan writer on 90min.com at anfield , we will be eternally grateful for the champions league trophy he delivered in 2005 , in spite of possessing what was , on paper at least , our worst accumulation of players in recent history
for all the spaniard 's successes , he also brought in the hapless djimi traore and czech forward milan baros and although we ran manchester united a close second two seasons after that , we actually ended up further away from the premier league title than we had been in a number of years during his final campaign ( 2009 - 10 ) - a failure that signalled the end to an anfield tenure that also yielded our last fa cup
benitez won the fa cup with liverpool in 2006 on penalties against west ham with fernando torres and steven gerrard playing well together , benitez got close to the title , but never won it and for all his moments , i fully believe we are on the right track again under brendan rodgers , even if we ca n't quite clutch that final champions league spot this season - or miss out on the fa cup
that 's why , if benitez returns to england again in the summer - as is being speculated due to napoli 's serie a shortcomings this season - it will receive little more than a shrug from large sections of the kop
