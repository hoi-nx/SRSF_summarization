having struck his second shot 163 yards to within six feet of the pin , spieth stood over his ball on the 18th green
he was nât going to three - putt from there , so whatever happened this would be the lowest 36 - hole score in the history of the masters
and at that point , spieth checked
spieth always does the sensible thing
spieth walks off the 18th after carding a 66 to finish 36 holes at a 14 - under 130 spieth leads charley hoffman by five strokes , matching the largest halfway lead in masters history some might think that makes him boring
to shoot 14 under , the lowest two - round score at augusta , and equal to the best 36 - hole score recorded at a major championship , is nât boring
a performance as breathtaking as tiger âs arrival in 1997
if spieth repeats his achievement at the hero world challenge in florida last year , perhaps , when he led from wire to wire and recorded a score of 26 under par. those numbers are unlikely though
against that , it will be a lot harder to chase spieth âs total than just maintain it
modern courses have , of course , been tiger - proofed before â but in the short term augusta may need to be spieth - proofed , too , if his scoring stays stable
this was his sixth round as a professional here and his worst score is level par. he has been in the top three players in five of those six , too
â i was a bit out of my comfort zone , at the moment on the 18th , â spieth confirmed
still , it âs pretty cool any time you can lead the masters and to set a record is awesome
â spieth broke ray floyd 's 36 - hole scoring record by a stroke and blitzed the first 36 holes at the age of 21 and playing in his second masters , spieth looks in complete control horschel , spieth âs playing partner , had wished for an imaginary tape recorder at the end of the first day
many had augusta pegged as the venue where mcilroy would complete his personal grand slam in 2015 ; instead , this masters may go down as the moment where he was placed in the threatening shadow of a young texan gunslinger , now in the vanguard of an american revival
up ahead of spieth , els laboured valiantly to stay in touch
by that time , however , a 21 - year - old called tiger had announced his arrival at the 1997 masters
mcilroy may have achieved more and younger than els , and spieth may not be the ice - cold winning machine tiger was at his age â but he has done a damn good impression of one over the first two days
already in the record books , spieth has many more landmarks in sight these next two days
the record for birdies here stands at 25 from phil mickelson ; spieth already has 15
spieth took augusta on , yet remained entirely in control
as graeme mcdowell pointed out recently there are better drivers , better chippers , better putters â and the statistics bear this out â but none who do all three as well as spieth
spieth made 15 birdies through two rounds as he blazed his way around the augusta fairways and greens the young texan pumps a fist to celebrate a birdie on the 13th during his sensational round â that was special , even for you , â said horschel âs caddie micah fugitt
it is nât just that spieth does nât think like a 21 - year - old
the next tiger ? that is a heap of pressure to drop on young shoulders
mcilroy said he could have played the course a hundred times in those circumstances and not made spieth âs score
where do spieth âs first 36 holes stand in the annals at augusta ? ray floyd played the previous best 36 holes â 13 under par â in 1976
spieth now has that record , as well as that of the youngest player to hold the 18 - hole lead
