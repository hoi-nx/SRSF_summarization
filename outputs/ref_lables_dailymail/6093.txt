welcome to the exoplanet hd 189733b , where temperatures reach 3,000 Â° c ( 5,400 â° f ) and winds are in excess of 620mph ( 1,000km/h )
this world might be 63 light - years away - and we ca nât even get a direct image of it - but scientists have incredibly been able to measure its atmosphere , just by measuring its sodium emission
the findings - made with a relatively small telescope - suggest we may soon have the opportunity to examine other distant worlds beyond the solar system in unprecedented detail
swiss researchers measured the temperature of ' hot jupiter ' hd 189733b
they found the temperature reaches up to 3,000 Â° c in the atmosphere ( shown in diagram )
the findings were made using a novel technique relying on sodium signals the research was carried out by scientists from the universities of geneva and bern in swiss
the scientists found that the temperature on the planet increases dramatically with altitude â up to 3,000 Â° c ( 5,400 â° f ) in the upper atmosphere , hot enough to melt lead
type : ' hot jupiter ' gas giant distance from earth : 63 light years temperature : up to 3,000 Â° c ( 5,400 Â° f ) wind speed : 620mph ( 1,000km/h ) conditions : glass particles in the atmosphere give it its dazzling blue colour
coupled with the extremely high wind speed of 620 mph ( 1,000km/h ) , it reveals the planet has an extremely turbulent atmosphere - and is almost certainly inhospitable to life
and he said the research was important because they used a ' dinky four - metre telescope from the ground to do measurements of the quality as the hubble space telescope
lower down on the planet , temperatures are believed to drop to a still - scorching 1,700 Â° c ( 3,100 â° f )
comparable measurements of this planet have been made before , using large ground - based telescope ( with mirrors up to 10 metres in size ) and the hubble space telescope
