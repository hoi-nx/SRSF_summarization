a team of experts is hoping to enter the record books by building the world 's fastest bike powered by hand
engineers developed the human powered vehicle ( human powered vehicle ) and will attempt to beat the women 's arm - powered speed record in nevada later this year
it will be piloted and powered by paracyclist liz mcternan and will need to travel in excess of 21.39 miles per hour ( 34.42 km / h ) over 656ft ( 200 - metres ) to beat the record
engineers have developed a human powered vehicle ( hpv ) ( pictured ) and will attempt to beat the women 's arm - powered speed record in nevada in september
it will be powered by paracyclist liz mcternan and will need to travel in excess of 21.39 miles per hour ( 34.42 km / h ) over a 656ft ( 200 - metre ) stretch of tarmac the current benchmark is held by tracy miller who broke the record on 13 may 1995 on a bike called chairiot
ms liz mcternan 's hpv was been designed by mechanical and composites engineers and students from plymouth led by kyte , lecturer in mechanical and marine engineering design , working with students matthew sharman and rhys parsons
the frame of the handcycle is made from aluminium with the help of plymouth technicians julian seipp , rick preston and neil fewings and the team are now building the aerodynamic shell from an advanced composite material

motion travels through a chain to a drive at the rear university technicians julian seipp , rick preston and neil fewings and the team are now building the aerodynamic shell from an advanced composite material ( illustrated ) they were also carried out to help ms liz mcternan master the head - mounted controls
ms liz mcternan , who last year ranked in the world 's top eight in her sport , said : ' i had first tried out a prototype in october but i was really surprised to see how compact and well engineered the new bike is
' handcycling is growing in popularity and annual speed trials for a range of hpvs are held on the long straight roads of battle mountain , nevada , where competitors can build up speed over a five - mile ( 8km ) run - up before being measured over a 656ft ( 200 metre ) stretch
the frame of the handcycle is made from aluminium and because ms liz mcternan ( pictured ) has limited use of her legs , the steering system instead is controlled by her head
the current record is held by tracy miller who broke the record on 13 may 1995 on a bike called chairiot mr kyte said : ' after months of planning , design and building it was great to be able to welcome liz mcternan to plymouth and to embark on the first real tests with her at the controls
