all of the behavioural traits below are danger signs , offering six crucial clues to spot the dysfunctional people most likely to break your heart
how ' in touch ' with themselves are they ? are they aware of their character and personality faults ? do they know their strengths ? they do n't have to have spent the last decade on a therapist 's couch to have done some soul - searching
you seem a bit distant tonight , anything bothering you ? do they grab your arm , kiss you spontaneously , say nice things â or does hugging them feel like you 're cuddling an ironing board ? 3
find out : do they have lots of friends , or have much contact with their family ? are they generally popular , or do people seem a little distrustful of them and stand - offish ? are they well liked at work ? 4
does this person know how to cook , clean , look after themselves , pay bills on time and manage their money ? are they mature enough to know they ca n't afford a lamborghini when they 're barely covering the rent ? tracey says that if he does n't like himself then it will be difficult to form a happy relationship find out : does their home look like a bomb 's hit it ? is there lots of unopened mail ( unpaid bills ) stacked up on the side ? do they seem to be living beyond their means for the job they have ? do they ever ask you to lend them cash or bail them out ? 5
the more hang - ups they have , the more you 'll be used as their therapist
