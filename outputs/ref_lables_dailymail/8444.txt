bertrand believes he deserves to be higher up the england pecking order and has pledged to prove his worth to manager hodgson
bertrand was the fifth left back to be called in to hodgson 's england squad last month a call - up had been predicted for england 's internationals against lithuania and italy last month , yet hodgson plumped for leighton baines , kieran gibbs and luke shaw
danny rose was then preferred when luke shaw pulled out , only for bertrand to get the nod once the tottenham full - back and then leighton baines dropped out
it meant the southampton left - back travelled to italy and eventually played the final few minutes of the 1 - 1 draw in turin , with his third england cap a peculiar end to the international break
bertrand slides in to challenge everton midfielder james mccarthy earlier this month ' to finally sit there and be part of it and wear the actual kit and everything , knowing the whole country is cheering you on is fantastic
' england are , in fairness , blessed with strength impressive depth at left - back , with west ham 's aaron cresswell another arguably worthy of a call - up
bertrand appreciates that breadth of options , but hopes to prove to hodgson that he deserves to be further up the pecking order
' bertrand was one of three southampton players in action that night in turin , with nathaniel clyne starting at right - back for england and graziano pelle leading the line for italy
bertrand made his move to southampton from chelsea permanent in january after impressing on loan the 29 - year - old striker showed no ill - effects of the scoring drought at club level , glancing the italy ahead at the juventus stadium - a goal the striker followed up with a first premier league strike since december 20 in saturday 's 2 - 0 defeat of hull
