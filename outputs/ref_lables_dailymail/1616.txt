dementia could soon be treated with a ' brain pacemaker ' inserted directly into the skull , according to new research
scientists have shown that using deep brain stimulation ( dbs ) , a technique already used to treat parkinson 's disease , can boost memory by causing new brain cells to be formed
deep brain stimulation is already used to treat parkinson 's , but now researchers now believe it could be used to improve brain function and ward off diseases such as dementia ( file image ) experiments on rats found the therapy improved their powers of recall , and it is hoped the same will apply to humans
' dbs is a surgical procedure that has become an established nhs treatment for parkinson 's sufferers whose condition does not respond to drugs
tests on lab mice showed improved memory within just 24 hours , while the rodents ' life - spans were unaffected ( file image ) now the new research , published in the journal elife , has discovered it could also be used to enhance the growth of brain cells which relieves the harmful effects of dementia related conditions and improves short and long term memory
it found new brain cells , or neurons , can be formed by stimulating the front part of the brain known as the prefrontal cortex which is involved in memory retention using minute amounts of electricity
prof vyas said : ' the findings from the research clearly show the potential of enhancing the growth of brain cells using deep brain stimulation
' for decades , scientists have been finding ways to generate brain cells to treat brain trauma and injury , and age related diseases such as dementia
