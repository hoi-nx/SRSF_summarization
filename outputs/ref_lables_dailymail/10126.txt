a new study has shown women still have an increased risk of breast cancer years after stopping taking hormone replacement therapy hormone replacement therapy increases a woman 's risk of breast cancer up to eight years after she has stopped treatment , scientists have warned
the new findings come from experts who conducted one of the world 's largest studies into the effects of hrt - used to ease the effects of menopause
the million women study , a collaboration between cancer research uk and the nhs , results suggested that women who are using combined hrt have double the risk of breast cancer compared to non-users
now scientists involved in the women 's health initiative study have warned , after further follow - ups , that women who take the combined oestrogen and progesterone hrt therapy continue to have a high risk of breast cancer , up to eight years after they stop treatment
there are three types , oestrogen - only hrt , cyclical hrt - where oestrogen is taken continuously but progesterone is given either monthly or every three months - and continuous combined hrt , where both female sex hormones are taken at the same time
women 's health initiative researchers had intended to follow the women up until 2005 , but in 2002 it became clear women taking hrt were suffering higher rates of heart disease
those women who took the combined hrt , which boosts the body 's levels of both female sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone , have an increased risk of breast cancer up to eight years after treatment they discovered it was the women taking either the combination hrt or those taking oestrogen - only treatment that were going on to suffer heart problems
as a result , all women were asked to stop taking their treatment - hrt or placebo - immediately
after the reported increased risk in breast cancer for women taking combined hrt , use of the therapy dropped dramatically
' for oestrogen and progesterone together , we see an increase in risk - even years after you stop
the women 's health initiative in the us and the million women study in the uk are the two largest studies into the effects of hrt
both found strong evidence the treatment increases a woman 's risk of breast cancer , pictured , with the latter finding it doubled a woman 's risk in the first two years , after stopping hrt treatment , researchers noted a sharp decrease in breast cancer risk in those women who had taken both oestrogen and progesterone
but for those women taking oestrogen only treatment , the risk for invasive breast cancer fell
he said while the results do show a higher than normal risk of breast cancer years after stopping hrt , it is only ' a little more risk than we thought with oestrogen and progesterone '
