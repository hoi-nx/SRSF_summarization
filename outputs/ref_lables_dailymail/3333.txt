back in january 2012 chelsea took three promising young boys , all brothers , from their home in graham gardens , luton , after watching them beat the mighty bayern munich in a youth tournament
on wednesday , jay dasilva , the eldest of the three children , who left luton âs academy to make the 100 - mile round trip , three or fours times a week , in their mum alison âs rover to chelsea âs cobham training base , turns 17
chelsea 's kids have been buoyed by jose mourinho 's insistence on promoting young players at the club dominic solanke ( right ) celebrates scoring in the fa youth cup final first leg victory over manchester city in an environment where the competition is fierce and the temptation is to spend big in the transfer market , jose mourinho made the surprise announcement that he will promote one of chelsea âs youngsters next season
ruben loftus-cheek , a powerful , muscular presence in chelsea âs development teams , will be with the first - team squad at the start of pre-season
those with an intimate knowledge of jay dasilva âs progress at chelsea over the past three seasons believe this first - year scholar is not far behind
a week ago jay dasilva returned to the national conscience when ian wright claimed he was â better than any other premier league left back â after chelsea became uefa youth champions in switzerland
john terry is the last player to come through chelsea 's youth ranks and become a first - team regular john terry broke into the chelsea team in 1999 , but the club has been unable to unearth a stellar talent since he moved through the junior teams at pace , settling at left back after spells as a winger , and is one of the most level - headed young players at the club
jay dasilva is a promising young player on the blues ' books , along with two of his brothers the young left back is forging a bright reputation for himself and was recently hailed as a star by ian wright jay dasilva beats norwich 's reece hall-johnson to the ball during a premier league international cup match last week he was in nyon , switzerland , joining in with his team - mates when they poured a bucket of ice over their coach adrian viveash as chelsea âs under 19 team celebrated becoming uefa youth league champions
despite the progress of jay dasilva , along with many other young players in chelsea âs lavish academy system , there is a good deal of scepticism about their chances of making the first team
jose mourinho , who was about to quit real madrid to return to chelsea , was compelled to make a flying visit to england to watch chalobah in the championship play - off final against crystal palace in 2013
ruben loftus-cheek has been guaranteed a chance to make his mark in the chelsea first - team squad but chalobah ( centre ) shows that chelsea 's young players must take their chance when it comes chalobah was the big hope at chelsea 's academy , but he did not shine when jose mourinho made a special trip to watch him when he played for watford in the championship play - off final ( right )
chalobah had been the big hope in academy circles , the one player chelsea âs academy director neil bath hoped could break the run , stretching back to 1999 , since a youth - team graduate became a first - team regular
still , it is also something of a myth that jose mourinho will not give youth a chance because he won the 2004 champions league final with porto by playing three players from the club âs academy system
