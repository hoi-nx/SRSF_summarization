kyli , a self - confessed â food person â , was 26 when she first started experiencing agonizing pain â which made her feel like she had been â kicked in the abdomen ' â whenever she ate , a symptom which doctors initially brushed off as being due to a mild pancreatic problem which would â resolve itself â in a matter of days
kyli , now 29 , was eventually diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis , and the north carolina resident found herself looking at a lifetime spent on a feeding tube , as the disease , which effects less than .01 per cent of people , would only get worse
mystery illness : kyli wolfson , pictured , had trouble getting a correct diagnosis when she woke up in excruciating pain in october 2012 ; her illness left her unable to eat for a year and a half at first , doctors faced difficulties even diagnosing kyli ; though she 'd had digestive problems for years , her rare disease was n't initially considered
however , kyli 's pain continued to return every time she tried to eat anything â even soup â leading her to visit two more hospitals in search of a new diagnosis and a cure
' three months after her first visit to the emergency room , she was finally diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis , a condition she had likely had since birth but was only found after doctors put a camera down her throat to her pancreas â a potentially life - threatening procedure that was only tried after all other options had been exhausted
literally starving : still maintaining an appetite but unable to eat without pain , kyli was constantly hungry â leading her fiancÃ© dustin to feel bad eating in front of her rapid weight loss : kyli 's weight , which is normally at around 110lbs , dropped to 80lbs when she was at her lightest sufferers of the illness , which is characterized by an inflammation of the pancreas , have to be fed through a feeding tube because the condition never improves , and eventually leads to permanent damage
' luckily , kyli found a support group for people who have chronic pancreatitis on facebook , some of whom said they found a way to eat : a risky surgical procedure to remove the pancreas , spleen , gallbladder , appendix , and duodenum , which allows the pancreas ' cells to be transplanted into the liver , enabling it to function as a pancreas
so kyli flew to a hospital in minnesota that specializes in the 14 - hour surgery , and scheduled her procedure for january 2014
enduring love : kyli 's wedding to fiancÃ© dustin is back on , now scheduled three years after she first went to the emergency room with stomach pain after her surgery , kyli spent another two and a half weeks using a feeding tube before being told to try food again
' now feeling healthy and grateful for the transformative surgery , kyli was able to reschedule her wedding to dustin
