the case of a britain woman allegedly murdered by her pastor husband in ghana took an astonishing twist last week when a court was told that she died of a heroin overdose

her husband adusah â a self - proclaimed prophet and evangelical preacher â has been charged with her murder
pastor adusah has been charged with the murder of his pregnant wife , charmaine spears ms speirs and mr adusah , who were married last september , were said to have argued during their stay local news reports said an autopsy showed the mother of one died of ' opiate heroin overdose '
mr adusah 's defence lawyer mr adomako acheampong has claimed in court that 41 - year - old ms speirs was a habitual heroin user â and that her whole family were addicted to the drug
but speaking exclusively to the mail on sunday , ms speirs 's brother paul said that his sister had never touched drugs and it was ' an outrageous lie ' to say his family were all addicts
he added : ' the defence lawyer seems to be suggesting she had been a heroin addict for years but that 's absolute rubbish
mr adusah is the leader of global light revival ministries church based in tottenham , north north london and has been active as a preacher in britain since 2010 and he rejected the claim that his entire family , including parents peter , 63 , a self - employed plumber , and 61 - year - old cleaner linda , were addicted to drugs , saying : ' my parents ca n't stand the things

the couple travelled to ghana early last month so mr adusah could preach at a three - day religious rally
