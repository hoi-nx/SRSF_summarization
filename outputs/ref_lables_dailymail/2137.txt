the great dying , which struck the earth 252 million years ago , wiped out more than 96 per cent of the world 's creatures
and while extreme volcanic eruptions are commonly blamed for triggering the event , research has found the majority of species on the planet were ultimately killed when the oceans became more acidic
in particular , they claim the volcanic eruptions released huge amounts of carbon dioxide which were absorbed into the oceans and changed their chemical compositions
the great dying , which struck the earth 252 million years ago , wiped out more than 96 % of the world 's creatures
and while extreme volcanic eruptions are commonly blamed for triggering the event , research has found the majority of species on the planet were ultimately killed when the oceans became more acidic the study , led by the university of edinburgh , is the first to show that highly acidic oceans were to blame
and the researchers said that the amount of carbon added to the atmosphere to trigger the mass extinction was ' probably greater than today 's fossil fuel reserves '
the great dying , also known as the great dying extinction , took place over a 60,000 - year period , and acidification of the oceans lasted for around 10,000 years
these extreme temperatures already threatened many land and marine species , but this was made worse when large volcanic eruptions began to take place

as carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere , global temperatures soared and this caused oceans to get hotter
but it was the acidification of the oceans that was the driving force behind the deadliest phase of the extinction , which dealt a final blow to an already unstable ecosystem , the scottish researchers said

oceans can absorb some carbon dioxide , but the large volume released - at such a fast rate - changed their chemistry
to make these conclusions , a team led by dr clarkson and professor rachel wood analysed rocks in the united arab emirates ( pictured ) - which were on the ocean floor at the time of the extinction
from this they developed a climate model because the rocks preserve a detailed record of changing oceanic conditions similar analysis in italy found evidence of vinegar - like acid rain caused by the sulphur dioxide in 250 million - year - old rocks
this proved acid in the rocks protected the vanillin , as its low ph deactivated the destructive enzymes to make these conclusions , a team led by dr clarkson and professor rachel wood analysed rocks in the united arab emirates - which were on the ocean floor at the time - to develop a climate model to work out what drove the extinction
models of ocean chemistry show that anoxia and euxinia - the presence of hydrogen sulphide - would have been closely associated with high levels of carbon dioxide , which suggests a combination of gases acted as a killing mechanism
' scientists have long suspected that an ocean acidification event occurred during the greatest mass extinction of all time , but direct evidence has been lacking until now , ' said dr clarkson from the university of edinburgh 's school of geosciences
meteor impacts contributed to wiping out species during mass extinction events on earth ordovician - silurian mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago this was the third largest extinction in earth 's history , and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years
late late devonian mass extinction - 375 - 359 million years ago three quarters of all species on earth died out in the late devonian mass extinction , although it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years
permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago the permian mass extinction has been nicknamed great dying , since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out
triassic - jurassic mass extinction - 201 million years ago there were two or three phases of extinction that made up the triassic - jurassic mass extinction event
cretaceous - tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago the cretaceous-tertiary mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs
