a 25 - year - old is facing jail on fraud charges after she allegedly faked having terminal cancer to her family and friends
meaghan , 25 , left those closest to her devastated when she sent text messages in december 2013 , saying she was suffering from multiple myeloma , a type of cancer which forms in the bone marrow , and she was unlikely to survive
miss meaghan 's friends , who have known her since high school in dayton , ohio , went to great lengths to show their support - they shaved their heads in solidarity for her chemo and got matching tattoos of an inspirational song lyric
close friends ( including whild , right ) rushed to support her , even shaving their heads in solidarity and getting tattoos the 25 - year - old , who lives in chula vista , california , also had a fundraising website set up for her by her stepmother , margaret hudson
well - wishers sent $ 5,000 towards her ' medical expenses ' and high school friend whild also told nbc that a further $ 2,000 was raised for meaghan at a bowling alley event
last july , meaghan 's story fell apart after an anonymous tip was made to the chula vista police department saying that she did n't really have cancer
' you are receiving this message because you contributed to the cancer fundraiser back in december 2013 for meaghan
while initially that sounds like good news ( and it is in many ways ) , she has deceived her family and friends into believing she has been suffering from multiple myeloma for over a year now
