nhs worker tipler embezzled nearly Â£ 650,000 from a cancer hospital
pictured during her trial at southwark crown court last summer an nhs worker who conned a hospital out of more than half a million pounds earmarked for life - saving cancer drugs has been ordered to pay back just Â£ 28,737
tipler , 33 , used her job to steal Â£ 642,000 from the royal marsden nhs trust which she spent on designer shopping sprees , mortgage payments and her planned wedding
but she and partner chaplin , 34 , who was the ringleader of the plot , were caught and both jailed last summer
at southwark crown court today , judge anthony leonard qc said tipler had made Â£ 54,852 from the scheme
at the proceeds of crime hearing , he ordered her to repay Â£ 28,737.90 within six months or spend another 18 months in jail
chaplin claimed he ' made nothing ' from the scam but was ordered to repay Â£ 115,000 form the the Â£ 310,000 the judge said he made
' for several months after december 2011 , she substituted account numbers of pharmaceutical firms who were due payment with the details of men recruited by her partner and the ringleader of the plot , 34 - year - old chaplin
passing sentence in july last year , judge leonard said that while chaplin from carshalton in surrey was the ' main instigator ' , tipler was ' invaluable ' to the scam , which he said could have been ' catastrophic ' for the hospital 's patients
' the judge accepted that the crime was hatched by chaplin , 34 , right , but said the position of trust tipler held was invaluable in the fraud
it was also ordered that part of the money tipler is to pay back go towards compensating the hospital
it 's one of the places that benefitted from cancer drugs that the funds tipler stole were intended to pay for
judge leonard refused to accept his account and ordered him to repay Â£ 115,000 from the Â£ 310,857 he defrauded within six months or face two more years in jail
he will face just six weeks in jail if he does not pay the money within four months
