it is legendary now that when the spanish national team was coming to the boil and about to scald world football for six years , spain 's own fans did n't even know the water was hot
spain lift the trophy at euro 2008 , but their fans had booed them before , not recognising a great team the world cup followed in 2010 and now it seems the right time for the old guard to hand over to youngsters spain won the european championships for a second time in a row in 2012 before their world cup failure spain 's under 21s celebrate winning euro 2013 and their brilliant young players are thriving right now nevertheless , the current champions league quarter - finals are beginning to say something quite interesting about spain 's ' relevo '
xavi , carles puyol , xabi alonso , carlos marchena and joan capdevila have done their hard miles and it is not clear what toll battle has taken on victor valdes , david villa and fernando torres
what caught my attention is that juan bernat 's arrival to the champions league quarter - final for bayern munich at porto last wednesday earned valencia a seven - figure sum as part of the incentives associated with the full back 's move to bavaria
in other words , juan bernat was one of those guys , just turned 22 , that both valencia and bayern munich thought might be playing ' starting ' football at this elite stage of the world 's most demanding soccer tournament â but , equally , he might not
the likes of xavi ( right ) , barcelona 's midfield metronome , have done their hard miles and can now hand over it is not clear what toll battle has taken on striker fernando torres , who now plays for madrid this is the season when he 's broken into vicente del bosque 's senior team , scoring , and formed part of a quite remarkable chain of left backs at the mestalla â from jordi alba , european champion with spain in 2012 , now at barcelona , through juan bernat to jose luis gaya , a remarkable talent who is currently locked in stalled contract talks at valencia while madrid stalk his availability
and if you just look a little more closely then the eight teams left to sort the wheat from the chaff this week show evidence that , beyond juan bernat , spain still have a golden harvest to bring in
for example , take a snapshot of the penultimate trophy spain won â not euro 2012 but under 21 euro 2013 , beating italy 4 - 2
juan bernat ( right ) played in the champions league and is the latest in a string of thriving spanish david de gea ( right ) has been in fine form for manchester united and is a real goalkeeping talent for spain of spain u21 's starting line - up at the 2013 euros , only de gea has n't played uefa football this season of that starting line - up only de gea has n't played uefa football this season , eight of them are still in the champions league quarter - finals while two of the substitutes , nacho and carvajal have decent minutes in the competition
throw in the fact that spain 's winning under 21s coach was julen lopetegui , 3 - 1 up on pep guardiola 's bayern munich going into the second leg this week , and the progression from youth - level international football to full - fledged senior winner is going along very nicely
and it is important to throw in the fact that in last week 's quarters , 20 - year - old oliver torres ( 13 uefa club matches ) stood out against bayern munich for porto ( he belongs to madrid ) , while on the bench for the madrid derby were fellow 20 - year - olds jese and saul nguez , who have 18 uefa appearances between them
spanish fans did n't quite know the great team they were getting in 2008 , they could have another one now alvaro morata ( right ) celebrates with team - mates after scoring against germany at euro 2013 in israel whether they flower for club and country or bloom early but fail to excel like recent spanish generations have proven to do , the fact remains that there is a wave of fresh , exciting spanish talents who demand attention now
' i do n't think there 's strictly a " spanish school " of coaching or playing , ' he argued earlier this season
former under 21 coach julen lopetegui has managed porto to one of the results of the season in midweek ' understanding precisely what 's going on in a game is not at all easy
