and while coffee matching rules are not as hard and fast as wine pairing ones , there are still some things you should consider
the next time you order your coffee give some thought to your choice of pastry the classic english pastry has been identified as the perfect accompaniment to a creamy latte , as well as a cinnamon swirl and a pain au raisin
will corby , from online coffee subscription company pact coffee , told femail : â it is worth remembering that the coffee used to brew different types of coffee will all have different flavour profiles so the acidity / bitterness / sweetness balance of the coffee used is something to consider when pairing it with pudding
a latte ( left ) which has a light espresso flavour is best complemented with a chelsea bun ( right ) latte : cinnamon swirl , chelsea bun or pain au raisin something big and hearty has to go with the light texture and sweetness of a latte
delicate spice and toasted pastry flavours should work best , allowing you to detect the light espresso flavour through the warm milk
flat white : muffins a light fluffy muffin ( blueberry is my choice of sweet ) should accompany your flat white really well but if you are prepared to take things a little further a ham and cheese sweet / savoury muffin works even better ! irish coffee : cheese and crackers definitely an end of meal , post-dessert drink this is best paired with cheese - perhaps a crumbly hard cheese like a lancashire - and sweet crackers but maybe avoid the chutney
glazed ring doughnuts ( left ) will bring out the flavour profile of a plain black coffee ( right ) cappuccino : amaretti amaretti for dipping , avoid any extra milk or other intense flavours when it comes to this drink
black coffee : doughnuts black coffee ( brewed filter or with a v60 dripper ) with tends to have a more delicate flavour profile than coffee brewed in other ways
cortado : custard tart an espresso cut with a small amount of milk , this coffee is spanish or portuguese in origin , so i would lean towards a portuguese ( custard ) tart for this
affogato : best by itself this coffee is the dessert , in which an espresso is poured over ice cream so it should require no addition ! a post-dessert drink , irish coffee ( left ) is best paired with a crumbly , hard cheese such as lancashire ( right ) latte : coffee made with espresso and steamed milk
espresso : strong coffee made by forcing steam through ground coffee beans
irish coffee : coffee made with irish whisky and sugar , and topped with cream
mocha : a chocolate flavoured latte with espresso and hot milk
