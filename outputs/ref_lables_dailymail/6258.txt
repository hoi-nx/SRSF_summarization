when villa 's animated manager threw his gilet to the ground in celebration at the sight of benteke 's first half equaliser , he probably rather hoped his players were man enough to remain in the premier league after all
indeed when he then saw benteke convert the second of his three goals after 33 minutes , he may have felt his damning critique on monday had provoked exactly the response he was looking for
matt phillips ( left ) headed qpr into a seventh - minute lead , getting on the end of zamora 's cross winger matt phillips garnered just enough power on his head to plant beyond guzan in the villa goal barton wheels away after watching matt phillips nod in at the back post , as clark ( left ) and sanchez appeal for offside but qpr were only ahead for three minutes after benteke equalised for the hosts at villa park benteke drove beyond green from the edge of the box to net his seventh premier league goal of the season if it made for a hugely entertaining encounter , it must have been hell for the managers however friendly they might claim to be
but when charlie austin followed chint hill 's second half equaliser with a third goal for the visitors , villa had replaced chris ramsey 's spirited side in the bottom three
only 12 minutes remained , and even if benteke required just five more minutes to score again with a terrific free - kick the overriding feeling in the villa ranks was certainly more one of frustration than relief
benteke did not look like a man who wanted to enjoy his hat - trick at the sound of the final whistle
the failure too to respond to the threat being posed by charlie austin , who was allowed to take a touch to control the cross from matt phillips before driving the ball past guzan

matt phillips might have landed the first blow for qpr but the players he was probably referring to as ' the icing on the cake ' were giving him plenty of cause for celebration
as a game it was something of an emotional rollercoaster , even if the warmth of the embrace between sherwood and chris ramsey before kick - off was soon replaced by the cold reality of a dire situation for both teams
never one to hide his feelings , sherwood responded to qpr 's opening seventh minute goal by unzipping the aforementioned gilet in disgust
but his team were playing with real verve , with benteke scoring a second after 33 minutes with a goal that owed as much to the speed , vision and courage of agbonlahor as the precision of the finish
benteke finished cleverly , shaping to shoot beyond clint hill before dragging his effort back inside the qpr defender and beyond the reach of a wrong - footed green
austin salutes the travelling qpr supporters inside villa park but they were n't able to cling on to the points but benteke 's wonder free - kick , much like jason puncheon 's on monday night , meant villa came away with a point benteke ca n't conceal his delight at completing his hat - trick and rescuing a point in the 83rd minute good friends chris ramsey ( left ) and sherwood know each other well and were going head - to - head in the dugout for the first time former villa striker stan collymore could n't hit his elation in the press box after benteke knocked in his second of the goal sherwood urges the supporters packed inside villa park to up the ante as they looked to move clear of trouble charlie austin vies for possession with kieran richardson during an intense and entertaining first half niko kranjcar attempts to get qpr back in the game but could n't steer his effort beyond the american guzan villa park looked a picture on tuesday night as the two relegation battlers went head - to - head in birmingham sherwood said chris ramsey was one of the finest coaches he had worked with and he certainly impressed here
it had the desired effect , clint hill equalising four minutes later ; punishment for what appeared to be bacuna 's failure to stay with his man
charlie austin 's goal â his 17th in the premier league this season - would be a further source of concern , even if benteke did then level for a second time with a wonderful free - kick that beat green via the inside of a post
