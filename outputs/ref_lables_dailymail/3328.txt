john and lead singer of the band rem stipe have joined forces calling for the equal rights of transgender inmates in response to allegations of mistreatment at a georgia prison
â transgender women in male prisons have an equal right to protection from violence and abuse in prison , and yet they continue to face horrific injustices , â according to a joint statement the musicians released tuesday
last week , the justice department said prison officials must treat an inmate âs gender identity condition just as they would treat any other medical or mental health condition following a february lawsuit from the southern poverty law center filed against georgia department of corrections officials on behalf of diamond , a transgender woman
allies : john and lead singer of rem stipe have joined forces calling for the equal rights of transgender inmates prison officials must treat an inmate 's gender identity condition just as they would treat any other medical or mental health condition , according to a justice department ruling in the case of transgender inmate diamond according to the lawsuit , prison officials did not provide sufficient treatment for 36 - year - old diamond âs gender dysphoria - a condition that causes a person to experience extreme distress because of a disconnect between the birth sex and gender identity
the lawsuit also said diamond was without hormone treatment for three years and her body suffered as a result , and that she had been sexually assaulted and ridiculed in prison
â more often than not , assaults in part go unreported because the perpetrators are prison guards , wardens and staff , â said stipe and john , who founded the elton john aids foundation
â both john , 68 , and stipe , 55 , are openly gay
in their statement , john and stipe applauded the justice department for coming out in support of ms diamond and for challenging the constitutionality of georgia âs policy of denying transgender inmates hormone treatments
a photo of diamond compared to her georgia department of corrections mugshot shows the drastic difference without maintaining treatment the justice department filed a brief in ashley diamon 's case last friday saying it 's not taking a position on the accuracy of diamond 's claims , but reminding prison officials that the eighth amendment of the u.s. constitution requires them to provide inmates with individualized assessment and care for the condition
only inmates identified as transgender during their initial intake screenings are eligible for gender dysphoria treatment under georgia department of corrections policy , but the personnel who do those screenings often are n't familiar with the condition , the lawsuit says
diamond , 36 , identifies as a female and has been on hormone therapy since she was 17 southern poverty law center staff attorney ezie said in an emailed statement friday that the justice department brief bolsters their arguments
' transgender inmates like diamond have a right to proper medical care , ' ezie said
' they have a right to protection from violence and abuse and these rights are secured by the u.s. constitution
' other courts have ordered hormones , psychotherapy and other treatments for transgender inmates
