the us scientists used low doses of the drug oxaliplatin , which has a unique ability to activate cancer - killing immune cells in small tumours but works less well in large , aggressive tumours
each year in the uk around 41,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer and 11,000 die from the disease the problem is partly caused by immune system â b - cells â that put a brake on the body âs defences in prostate and other cancers
the prostate tumours were â almost completely destroyed â by the mice âs own immune cells , the team said
lead scientist shabnam shalapour , of the university of california san diego , said : â the presence of such b - cells in human prostate cancer calls for clinical testing of this novel therapeutic approach
â because of the effect of the immune system , advanced and aggressive prostate cancer does not typically respond to chemotherapy , researchers said
b - cells also undermine the effectiveness of promising new drugs called checkpoint inhibitors which â unmask â cancer cells allowing them to be recognised by the immune system
there are currently few options for men with aggressive drug - resistant prostate cancer that has started to spread but researchers also managed to get a checkpoint inhibitor â combined with chemotherapy â to work after wiping out the b - cells in one test
while early treatment is often highly successful , there are few options for men with aggressive drug - resistant prostate cancer that has started to spread
researchers there have made this new prostate cancer breakthrough â similar immunosuppressive b - cells can be detected in other human cancers , â he added
