sixteen - year - old elise , from eaton bray , bedfordshire , is just one of the many people finding that they can no longer keep up with the financial costs of keeping and looking after a horse but , sadly , stories like rupert âs are all too common
across the country , horses , ponies and donkeys â many of them once much - loved family pets â are being abandoned in record numbers and left to fend for themselves or tied up on busy roadsides in the hope that someone will rescue them
animal welfare charities , meanwhile , are full to capacity , leaving them increasingly helpless in the wake of the hundreds of calls they receive every month about neglected or abandoned horses
earlier this month , in desperation , the rspca launched an urgent appeal to rehome some of the hundreds of horses in their care
their three sanctuaries , with capacity for 640 horses , are full , with 500 other horses being kept at huge expense in private boarding stables while they wait for a place
last year , the rspca alone took in 1,500 horses , many of them former family pets
little wonder that the word rspca workers are using to describe the situation is â crisis â
â the moment we rehome a horse another one steps into its place , â she says
â i have been here for four years and every year the problem has got worse
â sara cooper , 33 , a trainee agricultural assistant from wiltshire , says that since an accident which hurt her back she can no longer ride her horse pip , and as a result ca n't afford to keep him either it âs hard to argue with the numbers , which all equine welfare organisations say have risen steadily in the recession , and continue to do so , despite the economy improving
dene , a horse consultant for campaign group animal aid , says that many people remain unable to afford the minimum Â£ 3,000 cost per year to keep a horse â a sum that can soar if there are veterinary bills
yet those who bought a horse years ago and are now struggling to afford it , find they have no one to sell to
â sara cooper 's horse pip ( pictured ) is one of the many family pets who find themselves either being sold on by owners who can no longer afford to keep them , or abandoned by those who fail to find them a new home reluctant to sell their horses to abattoirs , many owners mistakenly believe that leaving them to fend for themselves on a patch of land such as a roadside verge â a common practice known as fly - grazing , which is illegal â is the better option
in reality , however , most horses can not survive for long without human care
the problem is that more and more owners are taking on horses without preparation
mother - of - four teresa , from eaton bray , bedfordshire , is the first to admit she was naive about horse ownership â and as a result has been left frantically trying to find a home for her 16 - year - old daughter elise âs irish cob beau , without success
â none of us realised the financial commitment of owning a horse , â says teresa
â we âve at least been lucky that he âs been healthy , so the vet bills have been low , but vaccinations are still Â£ 260 a year , â she says
â so , earlier this year , the family made the reluctant decision to put him up for sale
the mother - of - two has always loved riding her 20 - year - old horse pip , but last year had to stop after being kicked by a cow , leaving her with back pain
â long - time rider melanie , a 54 - year - old self - employed carer from barnstable , devon , says rocketing costs drove her to give away her beautiful 14 - year - old cob , connie and so , like teresa , she had to make the painful decision to get rid of pip , selling him to a family in buckinghamshire
fiona , who runs tower hill stables animal sanctuary in tillingham , essex , is overseeing 50 abandoned or neglected horses
' the thought broke my heart , but i did nât know what to do , â she says long - time rider melanie , a 54 - year - old self - employed carer from barnstable , devon , says rocketing costs drove her to give away her beautiful 14 - year - old cob , connie , who she could nât afford alongside her other horse , flossie
â well - meaning or not , fly - grazing is now heartbreakingly common and many owners do not comply with laws requiring them to microchip their horses , making tracing them impossible
