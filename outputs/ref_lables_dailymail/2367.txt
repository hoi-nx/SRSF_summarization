emily thornberry has come out against david cameron âs pledge to extend the right to buy policy from council tenants to those in housing association homes
but eight years ago she and her husband bought at auction a housing association property now worth almost Â£ 1million
tories said miss emily thornberry , who lost her frontbench job after tweeting a sneering picture of a house covered in england flags and with a white van outside , opposed right to buy but not â right to buy to let â
â housing association chiefs have also been accused of hypocrisy for drawing huge salaries and living in mansions while wishing to deny tenants a foot on the property ladder
davison , of the national housing federation , which represents housing associations , has a Â£ 1million home in fashionable islington , north london
miss emily thornberry yesterday retweeted an article from the federation attacking right to buy
and , in a question - and - answer session last week , the labour candidate for islington south and finsbury criticised the policy directly
the tories would extend this to 800,000 housing association tenants who now have limited purchase rights and to 500,000 who have no rights at all

under the scheme , housing association tenants would receive discounts of tens of thousands of pounds on the market value of their homes
miss davison told the bbc in response to the conservative right - to - buy plans on tuesday that it was wrong to effectively give money to â some of the most securely housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents â
she added : â we are independent organisations and charities â you can no more force a housing association to sell their assets at less than they âre worth than you can force tesco , or even cancer research
