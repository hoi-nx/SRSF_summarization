these adorable abandoned badger cubs have been nursed back to health by a kind - hearted animal lover on a diet of custard creams
nursed originally on milk form bottles custard creams were introduced into their diet slowly to see whether the cubs were ready for food
the 65 - year - old , from somerset , said : ' when they came in eight weeks ago they were 80g , now they 're 1.1kg , you can almost see them growing
' ' they were very very tiny , we start them off giving them milk with a teat on syringe , we ca n't risk any getting in their lungs , but they 're now on normal bottles
' little star came from derbyshire , she was brought into someone 's kitchen by their jack russels dog , it was very lucky he did n't hurt her , she 'd been born two days earlier ; her umbilical was still attached ' the dog brought another one in , but sadly that one had been shaken , so unfortunately it died within 24 hours pauline explained to have two badger cubs picked up by dogs in a short space of time is unusual
the dog brought another one in , but sadly that one had been shaken , so it died within 24 hours the first of the badger cubs , named little star , was half the weight of an apple when it arrived at centre jack russels have an instinct for digging and going down holes and are traditionally used in badger baiting
' then we had another called vogue come up from cornwall , we called her that because was picked up in the village vogue near redruth , ' pauline said
' ' they 're still on bottles now , we 've started putting in custard creams to see if they 're interested , then we might move them on to solids
