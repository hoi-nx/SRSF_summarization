a series of pictures by germany artist jã¶rg dã¼sterwald show body - painted models camouflaged in woodland in many of the pictures , the intricate detailing of the paint on the naked bodies means it is virtually impossible to determine where the person is
the jaw - dropping artwork is the brainchild of jã¶rg dã¼sterwald , a 49 - year - old artist and bodypainter from hameln , germany
the artist places the model next to a tree half - painted and then adds the details to make her blend into the environment some of the models are so well camouflaged that it is impossible to work out where they are the artist is a well - renowned body painter who has used his skills in tv adverts the photoshoots , which take several hours to complete are heavily planned before the artist arrives at the location with the model
as well as his recent forest shoot in brullsen , germany , which took place earlier this week , jã¶rg dã¼sterwald has also painted models into a number of other backdrops
