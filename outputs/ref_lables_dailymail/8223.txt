tottenham hotspur 's new state - of - the - art stadium is due to be ready in time for the 2018 - 19 season tottenham hotspur ' new 65,000 capacity stadium could be better suited to the nfl than the 90,000 - seat wembley stadium if tottenham hotspur press ahead with the proposed stadium design and secure the nfl franchise it would represent a significant blow to the fa , who also see the nfl as a potentially lucrative partner for wembley stadium , their Â£ 757m stadium
