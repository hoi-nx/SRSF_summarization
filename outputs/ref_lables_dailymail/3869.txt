after a year of planning , she fled in november , spending money meant for college tuition on a flight to turkey
from there she fled to syria and , after a month , married an australian jihadist , suhan abdul rahman who was reportedly since been killed in an airstrike by the jordanian military
despite pleas from her family to come home , muthana is resolute and claims it is the duty of all true muslims to join her and wage war on the west
unexpected : muthana is pictured with her classmates to the right in this yearbook photo from 2012 student : muthana studied business at the university of alabama 's campus in birmingham
she dropped courses at the school and spent the refund money traveling to isis - controlled territory she said she enrolled on extra courses at the university of alabama , where she studied business , then promptly dropped them to cash in the refund checks
on the day of the trip she said she had caught the wrong bus home and was stuck in the city - which is when she caught her flight to the middle east
it is the target of regular airstrikes , one of which killed muthana 's husband ' quiet ' : shocked contemporaries of muthana , who studied with her at hoover high school , spoke out when her voyage to syria was revealed instead , she conferred with jihadists online , and posted messages inciting fellow american muslims to murder their countrymen
