while many tattoos hold a certain symbolism to their bearer , the design chosen by someone getting their first ink at the age of 80 must have an incredibly special meaning
abc2 's new show , tattoo tales , follows the journey of some of the customers of bondi ink , a busy tattoo parlour on sydney 's eastern beaches , including jan , who was prompted by the death of her beloved daughter to make a decision that took the rest of her family and friends by surprise
for the past three years , jan has had a new tattoo inked on her shoulder every birthday in memory of her daughter shell , who died of complications from diabetes in jan 's daughter shelley died in 2011 at the age of 56 of complications from her diabetes ' there were reminders of her all around me , and i decided to get a reminder of her on me , ' jan , now 83 , said
when shelley , who was fondly nicknamed shell , died in 2011 at the age of 56 from complications of the diabetes she had lived with for nearly all her life , two of jan 's granddaughters and shell 's husband decided to get tattoos in memory of her
jan said that when she announced her decision to her family , they were quite surprised but supportive the unexpected move from the now 83 - year - old
' shell was just such a gorgeous girl , ' said jan ( left ) of her eldest daughter , with her other daughter lisa ( right ) jan getting her third tattoo , a shell , by tattoo artist shaun ' bones ' from bondi ink jan said that her tattoos are a memorial and a way for her to carry her children with her ' she popped in and asked if they had a spare moment to chat about getting a tattoo
for her 80th birthday , jan had shell 's name inked on her upper arm near her shoulder , along with a cross , and said that she was surprised at how painless it was
in the second episode of tattoo tales , jan gets her third tattoo - a beautiful coloured shell below her daughter 's name
' nobody sees it but me , it 's just my family who knows and the friends i 've mentioned it to , ' jan said
jan got a shell as her third tattoo , in memory of her daughter shelley , who was nicknamed shell ' i do n't know if i 'm a bit tough , but [ the pain ] certainly was n't unbearable , ' jan said of her experience in the chair jan with her daughter and granddaughters at one of their ' girls lunches ' in sydney ' shell did n't have any tattoos but i 'd like to think she 'd have a smile to herself if she saw them on me , ' she said
jan said that she used to not be a fan of tattoos , but that now she does n't assume that people are different simply because they are inked
jan is unsure whether she will continue to go back for more tattoos on her birthday as has become the tradition
the owner of bondi ink , john , said that this year 's tattoo was his ' birthday present ' to jan , and insisted she come back for her gift next year
jan features in episode two of tattoo tales which airs on abc2 on wednesday april 9 at 9.40pm
