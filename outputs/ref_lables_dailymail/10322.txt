flying for business or pleasure is one of the most thrilling experiences in the world , but it remains full of mystery for the average traveller
curious passengers have burning questions every time they step foot on a plane â from whether pilots require a key to start a plane to where flight attendants sleep on long - haul flights
mailonline travel spoke to a number of experts to debunk some of the myths that exist and answer some of travellers â frequently asked questions about planes
â flight attendants eat the same meals that are provided to passengers if the airline bothers to feed them at all is the crew served the same food as passengers ? if meals are provided by the airline , pilots do not eat the same reheated chicken or pasta dishes that are served to passengers in economy
to reduce the risk of food poisoning , the captain and co-pilot usually eat different meals , said mr applegarth
like passengers , the flight crew can bring their own food on board , but the meals provided to them are the same or variations of the meals provided to passengers in business class
caterers will sometimes load meals designated specifically for the crew , said smith , a pilot and author of cockpit confidential
â eating in the cockpit can be messy , so on international flights i usually take my meals in the cabin , on my rest break
â with potential illness in mind , pilots are encouraged to eat different entrees , but this is not a hard and fast rule
â flight attendant sarah steegar , who works for a major us airline , said if â â and that âs a big if â â an airline provides food to cabin crew it will be the same food that is served to passengers
but it âs rare for some airlines to provide meals to flight attendants on flights under 12 hours , she added
â if there are meals left over we can have that
â the airbus a350 has private sleeping quarters for flight attendants on long - haul flights where do pilots and cabin crew sleep and go to the loo ? planes that fly long - haul routes which require more than two pilots usually contain private bunks for the flight crew , said mr applegarth
â the airbus a380 , which is the world âs largest passenger airliner , has private sleeping quarters below its decks which flight attendants use for rest
mr smith said : â flight attendants also work in shifts , and similarly to the pilots their rest quarters can either be a designated block of cabin seats or a separate room somewhere
â many flight attendant rest quarters are located in the far aft of the plane , above or below the main deck , and can accommodate six or more cabin crew simultaneously
â when nature calls , flight and cabin crew on most planes use the same toilets as passengers
â if the toilet becomes full then it is out of action and the flight attendants block out the toilet so it ca n't be used , â said mr applegarth
â pilots monitor multiple frequencies and occasionally chat with other pilots about turbulence do commercial pilots communicate with other pilots during a flight ? mr applegarth said pilots are always monitoring multiple frequencies and occasionally chat with other pilots who are in the air
â the amount of fuel that is consumed depends on the aircraft type , altitude , flight path and weather how much jet fuel is required ? a jet engine typically burns about 2,400 pounds ( approximately 1,100 litres ) of fuel per hour , with planes carrying a lot more fuel than required for the individual trip
â ' not even the world 's strongest man would be able to open ' a plane door in mid-air , said one expert what would happen if a plane âs door suddenly opened mid-flight ? this ranks among passengers â biggest fears , but mr applegarth said it is extremely unlikely , if not impossible , for someone to open the door as the pressure inside the plane is much greater than the pressure outside
â if a door were to open somehow the result would be a very quick decompression , though in all likelihood not a destructive or catastrophic one
