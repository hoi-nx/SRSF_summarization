changes : mark dawe , head of the ocr exam board , said schoolchildren would only have a short time to use the search engine during tests - and compared it to using a calculator in a maths exam an exam board boss has today been accused of ' dumbing down standards ' after suggesting students should be allowed to use google in their gcse and a-level exams
mark dawe , head of the oxford , cambridge and rsa examinations board ( ocr ) , said schoolchildren would only have a short time to use the search engine during tests - and compared it to using a calculator in a maths exam
he said most pupils now learn through search engines anyway â and teachers should test how students interpret answers , rather than how they find them
today chris mcgovern , chairman of the campaign for real education , said the idea would lead to a ' dumbing down of standards '
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme : ' it 's a nonsense
' and here we have the ocr board saying " let 's dumb things down "
row : education campaigners say that this would send standards plummeting and said exams are about knowledge not hunting for information ranking : according to the latest oecd international rankings on education , from 2013 , the uk is behind much poorer countries including lithuania , latvia and hungary ' you can have an exam on how to use google , but that is not the same as having a history or geography exam
' it would damage the board 's credibility , he insisted , because ' sensible people ' want their children to take proper exams
mr mark dawe told the programme that the arguments were the same used in relation to allowing calculators in maths exams
