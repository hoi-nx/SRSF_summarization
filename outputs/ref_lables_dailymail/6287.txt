but researchers have found such a pattern in two apparently unrelated places - cells in human skin , and the mysterious fairy circles in namibian
while the distribution of desert fairy circles may look random , as if the landscape is marked with freckles , the pattern closely matches the distribution pattern of skin cells
researchers have found a similar pattern in two apparently unrelated places - skin cells and the mysterious fairy circles in the namibian desert
the illustration on the left shows the distribution of skin cells , and the one on the right plots fairy circles , which are also arranged in polygons â it 's a completely amazing , strange match , â said professor sinclair , head of the mathematical biology unit at okinawa institute of science and technology graduate university ( oist ) in japan
desert fairy circles are considered one of nature 's greatest mysteries because no one knows how they form
found in namibian , they are large barren patches of earth ringed by short grass dotting the desert like craters on the moon , or big freckles now , professor sinclair and zhang believe they have identified a small , but vital , piece of the puzzle by comparing their distribution to skin cells
the duo compared the number of ' neighbours ' adjacent to fairy circles and skin cells , according to the study published in ecological complexity
they used satellite images of fairy circles and a computer to draw lines halfway between each pair to give them invisible boundaries that look similar to cell walls
the majority of skin cells and fairy circles both had six ' neighbours ' , and similar percentages of other neighbours ( shown in this graph ) the computer then counted how many neighbours surrounded each fairy circle
the experts found that the results were almost identical , in that both the majority of skin cells and fairy circles had six neighbours
and the percentage of fairy circles with four , five , six , seven , eight and nine neighbours was essentially the same as the skin cells
the researchers suspect the patterns might be similar because both skin cells and fairy circles are fighting for space
germany researchers analysed the spatial distribution of the fairy circles and found that they are â remarkably regular â in their distribution , which made them question the termite theory
last year , germany researchers analysed the spatial distribution of the fairy circles ( pictured in the marienfluss valley ) and found that they are ' remarkably regular ' in their distribution
