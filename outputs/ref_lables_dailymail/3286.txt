hillary clinton 's astroturf candidacy is in full swing in iowa
her tuesday morning visit to a coffee shop in leclaire , iowa was staged from beginning to end , according to bird , one of the men pictured sitting at the table with mrs. hillary clinton
bird told daily mail online that campaign staffer price called and asked him and two other young people to meet him tuesday morning at a restaurant in davenport , a nearby city
price then drove them to the coffee house to meet clinton after vetting them for about a half - hour
the three got the lion 's share of mrs. hillary clinton 's time and participated in what breathless news reports described as a ' roundtable ' â the first of many in her brief iowa campaign swing
he interned with president barack obama 's 2012 presidential re-election campaign , and was tapped to chauffeur vice president joe biden in october 2014 when he visited davenport
but then all of a sudden he says , " hey , we have secretary clinton coming in , would you like to go meet her ? " ' ' and then we got in a car â troy 's car â and we went up to the coffee house , and we sat at a table and then hillary clinton just came up and talked with us
price was executive director of the iowa democratic party until a month ago
clinton 's team tapped him last week to be its political director in iowa
bird is a government and community relations coordinator at genesis health system in davenport , iowa , according to his linkedin profile
clinton 's nascent campaign has carefully coordinated her image as a spontaneous , handshaking populist in her first days as a candidate , posing with pennsylvanians at a gas station and venturing into an ohio chipotle restaurant for lunch
scripting supposedly off - the - cuff appearances is common in presidential politics but could hurt clinton especially hard since her gonzo road - trip journey to americans 's broad midwest is designed to counter her image as cold , calculating and politically venomous
astroturf : setting up faux events for news cameras is nothing new in politics , but iowans take presidential contests seriously and could punish clinton for the deception the fixer : bird said troy prince ( left , pictured with vp joe biden ) , who was executive director of the iowa democratic party until he left last month to help clinton 's statewide political effort , recruited him and others to attend the ' spontaneous ' coffee meeting clinton 's campaign has already taken heat for depicting at least three people in her campaign launch video as ' everyday ' americans who were actually partisans with political connections
in leclaire on tuesday , bloomberg and other outlets referred to bird as a ' student ' at st. ambrose university , not as a hospital government - affairs staffer with democratic party street - cred
but bird 's ties to the party are deep enough that his facebook wall includes a photo of him standing in front of joe biden 's limousine in davenport
