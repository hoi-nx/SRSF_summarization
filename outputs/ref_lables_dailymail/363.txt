congratulations to australia for seeing sense and dropping the ridiculous policy of not selecting their best players if they are playing overseas
it leaves england looking old - fashioned and they need to react
matt giteau 's stellar displays for toulon have put him back on the australia radar ahead of the world cup the game is changing and australia have realised that
matt giteau and drew mitchell , for example , are top - class performers for toulon and if england lose to australia with those two playing out of their skins , you know exactly what the headlines will be
toulon âs steffon armitage came off the bench against leinster on sunday and turned the game on its head
toulon 's steffon armitage takes on the leinster defence during the champions cup semi-final in marseille i do nât think steffon armitage would be playing this well if he was still at london irish
if one or two england back - rowers would nât want to see steffon armitage in the squad , then that confirms he should be ! nick abendanon has also become better since he crossed the channel
nick abendanon 's game has drastically improved since the former bath full back made the move to france as england coach you will be judged on your world cup performance , even more so as the home team
when it comes to the big games , the other england players will want to have the best possible squad available
every player , fan and englishman wants england to win the world cup and it starts with picking your best team
england head coach stuart lancaster has remained steadfast in his policy not to select overseas players england players deserve to go on to the field knowing they have been given the best chance of winning
they benefit from a winning england team , especially in a world cup year
