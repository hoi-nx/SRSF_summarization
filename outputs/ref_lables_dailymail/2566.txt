arsenal manager wenger accepted his side were ' a bit lucky ' to beat reading on saturday wenger 's side failed to hit the level seen in recent games against reading at wembley although arsenal did twice hit the woodwork through a header from defender gabriel , which was touched onto the crossbar by federici at full stretch , and a close - range shot by aaron ramsey , the barclays premier league side could not find a winner in normal time
in the end , an error from australian federici proved so costly , the keeper allowing a low , angled shot from alexis sanchez to slip through his legs and roll over the line on 115 minutes
' it was a difficult game against a well organised , resilient , committed and physically strong reading team , ' wenger said
' they really wanted it reading , they were willing to die on the pitch to go to the final and you have to congratulate them for the effort they put in
alexis sanchez 's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of reading goalkeeper federici in extra time it was a routine shot from alexis sanchez but the reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe the ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp ' i do n't think we switched off ( for the goal ) , but after half - time we did not come on with the same intensity
the reading goalkeeper , who had been magnificent until then , left the field in tears as manager steve clarke tries to console him arsenal reached a record 19th fa cup final , and will be looking to overtake united 's mark of 11 victories , with five coming under wenger 's tenure
' now , let 's focus on our next game , we come back here in the final , but we have time to prepare , ' wenger said
