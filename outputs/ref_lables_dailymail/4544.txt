fit or quit ? smartphone health apps have been accused of â fuelling anxiety â they âre designed to make it easier for you to get healthy
but in fact mobile health apps are â fuelling anxiety â and â eroding people âs sense of wellbeing â , warns a senior gp
the â untested and unscientific â apps cause stress by making us worry that we are abnormal or unhealthy , says dr des spence
â my concern with the health apps is they have the potential to fuel anxiety without any benefit
â dr des spence said that manufacturers were more concerned about making a profit than their customers â wellbeing , with apps purposely designed to make people worry about their health so they would spend more money on health technology , diet pills and slimming firms
warning : apps that monitor your heart rate , blood pressure and blood oxygen levels could be causing unnecessary worry , says senior gp and last month the computer giant launched the apple watch , with prices starting from Â£ 300 , which can also monitor users â health and fitness
dr des spence said the majority of apps which just monitor your calorie intake or step count were â harmless â , but are unlikely to offer many health benefits
also writing in the bmj , he said they had â great potential â to reduce death risk by â encouraging healthy behaviour â .
