' he was lucky as animal lover and rescuer sue burger got hold of him and started nursing him back to health
the prosthetic limb is composed of several parts and replacement pieces which comprise his new leg after creating specific design files , a 3d printer was used to manufacture the new limb ( pictured ) ' we soon discovered that it was the same person from the radio
' mr van der walt then gathered up sponsors to help fund what is believed to be the first 3d - printed prosthetic limb for an animal in south africa
