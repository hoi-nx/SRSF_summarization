the continents of south america came together much earlier than previously thought , according to researchers who found evidence in rock deposits from ancient rivers in colombia of the land bridge that connected the long - isolated landmasses
the two continents are linked at panama , but there has been a debate about when this land bridge first appeared , with most experts placing its formation at about 3 million years ago
the new study , published on thursday in the journal science , presents evidence that the panama land bridge formed at least 10 million years earlier
before the isthmus of panama rose from the sea by tectonic and volcanic action , the central american seaway linked the atlantic to the pacific as one great ocean
the various continents , sitting atop huge plates akin to jigsaw puzzle pieces sliding over earth 's mantle , have slowly moved around the globe during the planet 's history
they have separated , drifted and joined numerous times in a process called plate tectonics
until then , a deep water channel called the central american seaway separated the continents
the researchers base their estimate on the presence of small grains of a mineral called zircon unearthed in ancient river bedrock in northern colombia that originated in panama and were 13 million to 15 million years old
' we contend that a bridge , perhaps a transient one , was present since 13 to 15 million years ago , ' said geologist montes of universidad de los andes in bogota , who led the study
they have separated , drifted and joined numerous times in a process called plate tectonics
