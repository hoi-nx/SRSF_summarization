over the past year , more than 1.4 million people were forced to wait longer than the target time â compared to just 353,000 in 2009/10 the figures also show that 113,648 waited longer than four - hours on trolleys in a&e , and 983 over 12 hours
it is now 89 weeks since hospital a&es met their waiting targets
nhs england figures show that 92 per cent of patients spent less than four hours in the week ending march 29
it comes after the department of health last week confirmed the nhs has failed to meet its target every week of the winter , meaning the average for the whole year has not been met
david cameron has overseen a record hump in waiting times to be seen in a&e , official figures revealed this morning labour leader ed miliband , arriving at an election campaign event in bristol this morning , has promised to bin the government 's nhs reforms health secretary hunt has promised to give nhs chiefs ' whatever they need ' after the election
the nhs 's chief executive simon stevens has said the health service needs an extra Â£ 8billion a year by 2020 just to keep standards as they are
' he said : ' after five years of david cameron , a&e waits are at their worst level for a decade and patients are finding it harder and harder to see a gp
' there 's only one person to blame for the a&e crisis and that 's david cameron
' labour leader ed miliband , campaigning in bristol this morning , said one of the reasons behind the problems in a&e was that the coalition policy has led to 600 fewer gp surgeries staying open at evenings and weekends
he said : ' we 've just seen figures today published for waiting times in england 's a&e departments which show that the first three months of this year was the worst period since the four - hour a&e target was introduced over a decade ago
' but a conservatives spokesperson said a&es were struggling because more and more patients were turning up at hospital to be treated
he said : ' a&e units across the uk faced unprecedented demand this winter , but england a&es see 3,000 more patients a day within four hours than in 2009 , and perform better than scotland , northern ireland and labour-run wales , so it is completely wrong for labour to try to turn this into a political football
he said this was a direct contributor to problems in england âs a&e departments , which has seen the nhs breach the target to see 95 per cent of within four hours of arrival for the 26th week in a row
the labour has put the nhs at the centre of its campaign for re-election , releasing a poster today dubbed ' the doctor ca n't see you now ' , as labour claim almost 600 fewer gp surgeries are offering extended opening hours to patients but the tories pointed out that the gp figures dated from 2013/14 â and did not include improvements in gp access since david cameron pumped more money into the nhs last year
