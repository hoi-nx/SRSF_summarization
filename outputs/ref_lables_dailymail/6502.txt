sometimes , putting up a billboard just is n't quite enough - so a group of russian entrepreneurs have come up with a new way to get you message out : on the breasts of a beautiful woman
companies tittygram and titisign have popped up in russian offering the eyebrow raising service and are , by all accounts , causing quite a stir
cleavage : burger king has become one of the first big companies to take advantage of thi type of advertising from the heart of russian : two companies now offer to write on a woman 's cleavage and take a snap burger king 's russian branch posted a picture of a woman with ' i love burger king ' emblazoned across her chest , courtesy of tittygram , on its vk page , the country 's version of facebook
what 's more , as advertising campaigns go , it is incredibly cheap : for as little as $ 6 , or Â£ 4 , they promise to get your message across in a way which is certain to grab attention
versatile : the picture can then be used as either a personal message , or advertising , and cost just Â£ 4 eyebrow raising : but the use of a woman 's cleavage as advertising space has not been universally popular according to the global post , tittygram was set up earlier this year , with titisign following in its footsteps more recently
both offer a similar service , asking people to send their messages in , at which point a model writes the message on her breasts and then takes the requisite photo
