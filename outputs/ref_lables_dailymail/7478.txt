the relationship between the football association and premier league â never great at the best of times â has deteriorated further with the ridiculous clash of fixtures on saturday
both organisations blame each other for their respective rights holders , sky and the bbc , scheduling the marquee chelsea vs united league match against the cup semi-final between reading and arsenal
the cup game attracted a peak audience of 6.9 million , over treble the 2m rating for the premier league game on sky
but both viewing figures would have been higher had they not coincided
arsenal 's cup semi-final victory over reading on saturday clashed with a top premier league fixture with star quality including wayne rooney and eden hazard on show , united 's visit to chelsea took viewers away from the game at wembley , bringing the premier league and football association into another dispute the football association say that the dates of the semi-final were known at the start of the season , while the premier league point to the sky fixtures for the weekend having been set last february â a month before the bbc announced their semi-final schedule
hazard celebrates the only goal of the game in the premier league showdown , but viewers missed out luke shaw , who has had weight problems since joining united , enjoyed one of his better games against chelsea in a season when he rates his own performances as c minus
coincidentally , hard - line united boss louis van gaal has banned his players from stopping at the permanent fast food van on the road leading to united âs carrington training base
luke shaw was in impressive form at stamford bridge , and he might owe his form to a change in diet joe root 's football - style celebration of his two wickets in the first test added some impetus to england âs bowling team , with joe root looking more like the next test captain with every game
it transpired this was a clear - the - air chat between the sensitive pair after alastair cook was upset with agnew for being so positive about kevin pietersen âs world cup stint with the programme
