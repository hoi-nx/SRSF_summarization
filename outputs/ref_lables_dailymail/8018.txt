hearts captain danny wilson ( right ) is a summer transfer target for celtic and could be signed for Â£ 400,000 the defender is out of contract at the end of the season but hearts are in no rush to sell with celtic battling to keep hold of current pairing virgil van dijk and denayer , however , manager deila admits danny wilson is among the potential central - defensive reinforcements being considered
â he ( danny wilson ) is one of many names we are looking at , â the norwegian conceded
that is an important target because of denayer [ denayer ] and also because of the situation with virgil van dijk
â van dijk has attracted the attention of sunderland and southampton while on - loan denayer will return to parent club manchester city after making his full international debut for belgium this week
desperate to hold on to both ahead of champions league qualifiers which could potentially be worth Â£ 16million to the club , deila added : â first of all , virgil van dijk is our player
celtic will face a challenge to keep hold of the services of highly - rated dutch defender virgil van dijk john denayer is expected to return to manchester city after an impressive loan spell in scotland â virgil van dijk is the leader in the defence , so he is vital for us
any money we could get for virgil van dijk ca nât compare with the money we would get from the champions league
â repeating the view that denayer should stay at celtic to play european football rather than risk a return to the manchester city reserves , deila insisted : â i think it âs important for him to play , that âs why we sent liam henderson to rosenborg because he needs playing time
as it is now , he is going to go back to manchester city for pre-season
â psv eindhoven winger zakaria bakkali is another target for the spl champions and is available on a free transfer budge , meanwhile , insisted that hearts â good financial health means there would be no need for them to let danny wilson go on the cheap
â that said , it is a commercial world out there and if someone comes long and offers someone something hugely substantial , then who knows ? â as well as danny wilson , deila admitted celtic are also trying to tie up players on pre-contract agreements
