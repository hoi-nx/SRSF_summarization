following sterling 's interview on wednesday , in which he said he was not ready to sign a new contract at liverpool , blogger david tyrer of live4liverpool gives the view from merseyside
while i hate to use social media as a gauge of opinions , sterling âs interview did nât go down well at all
it was ill - timed and , regardless of what sterling and his agent hoped , he did nât come across very well
obviously , with the caveat that we get our money âs worth ! sterling returns to liverpool training after the international break and shakes hands with manager rodgers sterling risked angering liverpool fans after he said in an interview he was not ready to sign a contract sterling trains ahead of the weekend 's game with arsenal it âs always disappointing when a young player gets his head turned , but there âs a sense of ungratefulness about the whole situation , considering how the club has nurtured him and paid him well throughout
sterling has been linked with a move to arsenal - the team he is preparing to face at the weekend sterling played for england in the 4 - 0 euro 2016 qualifier against lithuania and while i âd be willing to see the club give him Â£ 100k a week â possibly Â£ 120k a week - the club should nât do everything it can to keep him
liverpool fans have a popular mantra : no player is bigger than the club
admittedly , we stretch the rules for truly great players ( suarez , a recent example ) but sterling is nowhere near
frustration over sterling âs situation has been building for a while , and many fans are now of the belief that if he wants to go he âs welcome to
sterling did not have his best game in a liverpool shirt during the defeat at manchester united liverpool fans have a mantra that no player is bigger than the club if sterling was to move to arsenal then it would not go down well with liverpool fans but if he does end up going , he âs worth a lot more than many established players
sure , they âre more financially stable but what â in terms of trophies â do arsenal have to show for the last 12 years ? sterling speaks to the bbc and reveals he is not ready to sign a new contract i think we âre somewhat ahead on that front
people have drawn comparisons with when suarez wanted to leave for arsenal , but the situation is different
sterling is purely potential and , given all the club have done for him ( cliched , as that sounds ) , it makes little sense
it may not necessarily happen at anfield either , but a manager like rodgers will give him the best shot of improving to that level over the next two to three years
