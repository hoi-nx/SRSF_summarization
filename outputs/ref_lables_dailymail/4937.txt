for ronny deila , qualification for the champions league is not all about the money
but there are now 16million reasons for the norwegian to take celtic there by leading the team to a fourth successive title
this week uefa confirmed their â cash cycle â for the next three years of european competition
the last time celtic reached the champions league group stage , in 2013 - 14 when they faced ac milan , ajax and barcelona , they won one match and earned Â£ 12.6m
the same performance â or better â next season would see that sum rise by Â£ 4m
if they reach the last 16 , the figures crash through the Â£ 20m barrier
uefa 's increase in champions league money gives celtic manager ronny deila extra reasons to qualify to the rest of scottish football , the prospect of celtic making more money is damaging to any hopes of increased competition
to ronny deila , it âs a different kind of bind
â but you ca nât think about money
it âs about the experience of the champions league
if celtic participate in the group stages of the premier competition , sell - out crowds of 60,000 â something of a rarity these days â are guaranteed
but for all the concerns about a small elite from the major leagues dominating the competition every year , the champions league remains the superior competition in every way
â the champions league is so important , â added ronny deila yesterday
â we want to win the league and get into the champions league group stage , that âs the main target
â there is even more money now in the champions league
â our prime target is the champions league and we have to do what is best for the club
â towards that end , ronny deila - now a more confident and assured figure than the man who took the parkhead job last summer - will assume personal control of the pre-season programme and argue for the retention of key players
the days of celtic jetting to the east coast of australia and back to play friendlies appear to have gone
if we do nât reach it ( the group stages ) then we will have done everything we can
the most important games of a celtic season now take place in mid-july , before they have kicked a ball in domestic competition
the champions league qualifiers set the tone for the rest of the campaign
scotland play the republic of ireland in a vital european qualifier in dublin on june 13 , when more than a few celtic stars are likely to be involved , while the likes of full - back emilio izaguirre will also be playing for their countries through the summer
by this time last year , celtic had won the scottish title at a canter - allowing former manager neil lennon to grant key players early rest prior to the euro challenge ahead
ronny deila says that wo nât happen this time , even if his side can find a way to shake off challengers aberdeen in the coming weeks
ronny deila admits he is eager to secure a fourth consecutive league title for celtic as soon as possible â we want to win the league as soon as possible , â declared ronny deila
