police are investigating links between the hatton garden gems heist and a strikingly similar raid on a berlin bank two years ago
german detectives have been â closely monitoring developments â in the Â£ 60 million london case and are expected to make contact with scotland yard this week
in particular , they are keen to find out whether any dna was recovered from the scene of the easter weekend raid and , crucially , whether it matches forensic samples found in a tunnel used in a Â£ 8.3 million robbery at the volksbank in steglitz , berlin , in january 2013
the culprits behind the hatton garden raid ( pictured ) may have carried out a similarly audacious burglary just two years earlier in berlin , it has emerged in a case which has strikingly similar traits to the Â£ 60m heist in london , thieves targeted 294 security vaults during a break - in at the volksbank in steglitz , berlin , in january 2013 there has been speculation that the london robbers â who stole jewels and cash from 72 boxes at the hatton garden safe deposit centre â are from eastern europe
one of the five - man gang left a book at the crime scene â a poland translation of american desperado , the autobiography of drug smuggler jon roberts
thomas neuendorf , of berlin police , told the mail on sunday : â we are very interested in the case in england and i âm sure our investigators will get in touch â¦ if dna matching our samples is put into the interpol database by scotland yard we will be immediately notified
â suspects caught on cctv during the london heist were also dressed as construction workers - a tactic used in the berlin raid in a similar fashion to the german heist , the burglars timed their raid over the easter bank holiday , entering after the premises emptied on thursday night and leaving on easter sunday in the german case , the gang spent almost a year building their tunnel before drilling through the bank âs 3ft - thick concrete walls
in both cases , police are investigating the possibility of an insider helping the thieves
scotland yard declined to comment last night
