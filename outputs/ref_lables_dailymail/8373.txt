delhi daredevils the side from the capital are out to prove a point having never won the tournament and never even reached the final
2011 world cup winner yuvraj singh will be out to prove a point after being left out of this year 's india team kings xi after years of just making up the numbers , the kings xi lit up the 2014 tournament on their way to topping the table in the round - robin stage before losing in the final
their indian talent is n't the strongest in the tournament but virender sehwag and murali vijay have both performed on the big stage for their country , and 21 - year - old axar patel is one of the best young talents in india

bangalore have never won the ipl and have missed out on the play - offs altogether in the last three years
but news that world cup player of the tournament mitchell starc will miss the start of the ipl will hurt their bowling attack
virat kohli and chris gayle pictured playing for royal challengers bangalore in the 2012 tournament south african ab de villiers is often hailed as the most innovative batsman in world cricket sunrisers the newest team in the ipl , the sunrisers are set to embark on their third campaign having been founded in 2013 and replaced the deccan chargers

hyderabad also landed kevin pietersen in the auction for what looked like a bargain of Â£ 205,000 after he was released by the delhi daredevils , but the 34 - year - old will not feature in the orange shirt unless they make the play - offs
kevin pietersen reached the agreement with the sunrisers in order to return to surrey in an attempt to resurrect his england career , but the play - offs take place during the same week as england 's first test against new zealand at lord 's
eoin morgan will look to move on quickly from england 's miserable world cup when he plays in the ipl kevin pietersen , here playing for delhi in 2012 , will join hyderabad if they make the play - offs
