a doctor usually deployed to major disaster zones was sent in to a hospital 's under - pressure a&e department as staff were forced to treat patients in the corridor , it has emerged
the medical incident officer joined the team caring for patients at worcestershire royal hospital last friday
the worcestershire acute hospitals nhs trust admitted circumstances were ' less than ideal '
a medical incident doctor , usually deployed to major disaster zones , was sent to help staff at the worcestershire royal hospital 's under - pressure a&e department , it has emerged it came as the weekly national figures from nhs showed it has missed the four - hour waiting time target for the 28th consecutive week , despite a slight improvement
the proportion of patients seen within the government maximum of four hours at a&e departments in nhs is below the target of 95 per cent again - they have not been met since september 28
nhs said 92.5 per cent of patients spent four hours or less from arrival to admission , transfer or discharge in the week ending april 12
a worcestershire acute hospitals nhs trust spokesman apologised for last friday 's incident , and said it was ' working very hard ' to prevent it from happening again
in a damning open letter to the trust , four of the consultants branded the nhs trust a ' disgrace ' and claimed they had been put under ' unbearable stress '
' the trust spokesman said : ' we can confirm that on friday april 10 , west midlands ambulance service paramedics were asked to look after a number of patients in the corridor before they could be transferred in to the care of the a&e staff
' the spokesman said the medical incident officer was brought in after concerns were raised by the west midlands ambulance service
' regretfully these pressures have meant some patients being treated in less than ideal conditions and we accept this is not good enough and are working very hard to put this right
' the trust said no patients came to any harm during last friday 's incident , but mr salmon said the situation was starting to affect patient care
the move came as staff were forced to treat patients in the hospital 's corridors
' but the situation is at the moment there 's just not enough resources gone in , there 's not enough staff , and that 's affecting patients , it 's totally unacceptable
' according to today 's nhs waiting times figures , there were 443,274 attendances in a&e for the seven - day period , up slightly on the previous week when it was 441,099
