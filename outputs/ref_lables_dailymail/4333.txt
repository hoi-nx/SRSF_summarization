but it emerged yesterday that when andy and his new bride had their first dance on saturday night , judy murray was strictly on the sidelines
the former star of strictly â who frequently failed to impress the judges with her efforts â left the newlyweds to it as they took to the floor at their reception in cromlix house hotel , following their wedding at dunblane cathedral in the afternoon
judy murray ( pictured right during strictly ) says she is ' terrible ' at dancing as judy murray âs mother , erskine , 80 , left the venue , she admitted the wedding of andy , 27 , to his long - term girlfriend kim sears , also 27 , had been â fantastic â and â wonderful â
â but neither she , nor andy âs grandfather roy , were able to recall what the couple âs first dance was
â they also confirmed that mrs judy murray did not take to the dance floor first and let the bride and groom lead the evening âs festivities at cromlix house hotel , the luxury hotel bought by andy in 2013 for Â£ 1.8million , and where his brother had also held his wedding reception
the morning after her younger son âs wedding , judy murray had slipped into something more comfortable â her favoured old blue tracksuit after admitting to focusing more on her outfits following her appearance on strictly last year , mrs judy murray , 55 , broke with tradition on saturday by wearing a white coat , the same colour , as the stunning jenny packham gown worn by bride , kim sears
but it was back into the sports gear when she left cromlix house hotel yesterday
in an interview last year to promote her appearance on the hit bbc show strictly , mrs judy murray said that despite raising two tennis stars â her son , jamie , 28 , is a wimbledon doubles champion â she is not a pushy parent
â and although she admitted to being a terrible dancer , she said she â absolutely loved â the programme and being part of the competition.she added : â i âm terrible , i do nât know if it âs my age but i just ca nât remember the steps
