the world âs first cloned camel is pregnant , scientists claim
the mother - to - be , whose name is injaz , was cloned from the ovarian cells of a slaughtered camel in 2009 and born by surrogate mother
injaz is pictured here when she was just six days old dr nisar wani , scientific director of the reproductive biotechnology centre in nad al sheba , dubai , told the national : â we are very excited because injaz is now pregnant and we expect to have a calf from her late this year
â the birth of injaz , whose name means ' achievement ' in arabic , caused great excitement in 2009 and scientists said that cloning would help to preserve the genetics of the camel population
since injaz was born , many more animals have been produced by genetic cloning , including one from the cells of a camel beauty pageant winner
dolly the sheep ( pictured ) was born in edinburgh using dna from an adult cell since injaz was born , many more animals have been produced by genetic cloning , including one from the cells of a camel beauty pageant winner , the bbc reported
it took five years of work before injaz was cloned
the cells were then planted into the egg of a surrogate mother
injaz was confirmed as genetically identical to the camel the cells were taken from , according to united arab emirates newspapers at the time
