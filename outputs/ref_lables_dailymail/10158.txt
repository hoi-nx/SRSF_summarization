but the 355 - foot scientific platform is genuine and has been used by the us office for naval research for more than 50 years
the rv flip does not have its own engine and has to be towed to the location of scientific study , where it turns 90 degrees , leaving just 50 feet above the surface
the reason behind the flip , is that with 300 feet below the surface , the vessel becomes incredibly stable
once the vessel is towed to its location it ' flips ' within 20 minutes by pumping water into several ballast tanks , sinking the front section of the vessel under the waves
inside the bathrooms the designers have installed sinks which are at 90 degrees to each other to cope with the flip process the designers initially considered converting a submarine for this unusual mission but soon decided starting from scratch was better the vessel is more than 355 feet long and has been specially designed to cope with the stress of tipping over by 90 degrees operators flood the ballast tanks to turn the vessel on its tail and then pump out the water using air to re-float it
