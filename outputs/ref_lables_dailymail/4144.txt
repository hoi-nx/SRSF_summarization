what if they come fifth ? man city may have big plans to revamp the team in the summer , with toure and samir nasri among the high - profile casualties , but what if liverpool reel them in over the next six matches ? city are four points clear and have a superior goal difference , which equates to five , yet undoubtedly they are vulnerable
toure ( centre ) has been a shadow of the player who fired man city to last season 's title pellegrini ( second right ) trudges off the pitch after man city were beaten by crystal palace future opponents swansea city and southampton have little to play for â yet neither did crystal palace
the long - term plan is plain : pep guardiola , at his convenience , probably in 2016
the powers that be at man city are waiting for pep guardiola to leave bayern munich for manchester and what if man city are caught and condemned to the europa league ? what happens to this lavish rebuilding plan then ? take away the champions league money and man city âs financial capacity is not really much greater than tottenham âs
pellegrini has performed weakly this season and keeping him on another year while marking time for pep guardiola is a giant gamble
