fifa presidential candidate ali bin al hussein has made a formal rotation of the world cup between the continents one of the key elements of his manifesto and says he can see a tournament being jointly hosted by several different nations
prince ali , a current fifa vice-president from jordan , said he could envisage a world cup being played in different countries - or even in different confederations - in a similar way to euro 2020 which is being played in 13 nations
in his manifesto , which he launched on monday , prince ali has also warned against any decision on expanding the world cup from its current 32 countries , or a re-allocation of places , being taken for purely political reasons to try to drum up votes for the fifa presidency
