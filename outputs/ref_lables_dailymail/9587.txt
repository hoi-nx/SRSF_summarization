austrian designers , maya pindeus , 24 , and johanna pichlbauer , 25 , have created a robot that takes the effort out of applying make - up - by doing it for you
the device applies eyeliner with a long black brush , while an attachment smears lipstick on lips , before lighting up when the process is complete
the machine is composed of three components : a lipstick wheel , an eyeliner applicator , and a mask which illuminates when the ' beautification ' was complete
women were then filmed testing the machine for the two university of vienna students ' art project entitled beautification
the beginning of the video shows the designers setting up and creating the machine 's frame which includes two magnified mirrors
the lipstick robot is slightly more successful than the eyeliner robot , as the user can control how much lipstick is applied next a woman trials the lipstick wand but the speedy circular rotation of the lipstick is n't well aligned to the natural shape of a pair of lips
but maya pindeus and johanna pichlbauer say the robots were n't intended to revolutionise make - up , explaining : ' we wanted to explore the relationship between humans and machines
' the designers found the results of the art project were differed from their initial expectations
' on their tumblr page , the pair explain the inspiration for the project : ' without us paying much attention , many processes and rituals in our lives have been taken over by machines which are said to be cold and unemotional
' the designers added : ' our machines , however , have their own will , their own ideals
