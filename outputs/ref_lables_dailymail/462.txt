mike keen , the labour leader 's cousin , said he was ' officially confused ' over whether or not the ed miliband was actually promising to scrap non-dom rules mr mike keen posted on his public facebook page that he needed someone to explain to him just what the labour policy was non-domicile status allows people living and working in britain to only pay tax on their britain income , but not earnings from overseas
in a speech in warwick yesterday , mr ed miliband said that everyone who has made britain their permanent home should pay full britain tax on all their income and gains
he was backed by mr ed balls , the shadow chancellor , who told bbc radio 5 live : ' we 're going to change it , abolish it and it will raise a lot of money
' but it emerged in a january interview mr ed balls said : ' i think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing britain money because there will be some people who will then leave the country
mr mike keen , a retired gp , posted the image to his facebook page , adding : ' can someone explain this to me please , i am now officially confused
' in january shadow chancellor ed balls warned : ' i think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing britain money because there will be some people who will then leave the country
but tax advisers immediately disputed this , saying driving non-doms away would in fact cost the treasury significant sums
with non-doms paying around Â£ 8billion in tax and national insurance a year , it is claimed that labour 's proposal could in fact create a huge hole in treasury coffers
