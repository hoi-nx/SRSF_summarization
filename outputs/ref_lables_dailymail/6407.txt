mr ed miliband will allow scotland to set a more generous benefits system than the rest of the uk if he becomes prime minister labour leader ed miliband will allow scotland to set a more generous benefits system than the rest of the uk if he becomes prime minister
mr ed miliband will hand scotland mps the unprecedented power to set a higher state pension and more generous dole and disability payments in a desperate attempt to reverse the exodus of his voters to the snp
he will unveil the radical proposals in his manifesto , due to be published tomorrow , as he attempts to fight back in scotland â a key general election battleground
but the move will lead to fears that it could again put the future of the union at risk by setting scotland apart from the rest of the uk
critics fear that it could lead to the snp and scottish labour veering increasingly to the left by promising a more generous benefits system
ahead of tomorrow âs manifesto launch , scottish labour leader jim murphy said : â we will go much further than what is on offer by allowing scotland âs cities and communities more influence and control over the welfare state
