the new adam sandler film ran into a huge problem on wednesday when a group of extras stormed off the set
native american actors appearing in the ridiculous 6 , a spoof of the magnificent seven that stars and was written by adam sandler , left the set after they became offended by the script 's jokes about their race and culture
it was so bad in fact that even the cultural adviser for the movie , which is filming in new mexico , walked off the set
' among the many problems he cited were the costumes that were being used , the way the hair was being styled , and the film 's treatment of women
one character says " hey , beaver 's breath
anthony ( on right with actor saginaw grant ) said the film was offensive towards native american women vanilla ice ( above as mark twain ) with adam sandler in the background in red bandanna were back to filming oin thursday anthony said that though the film is about the apache ( traditionl dress on left ) extras were dressed more like comanche ( traditional dress on right ) , with braids and chokers making matters worse says anthony is that no one felt like they were being listened to by the production team
' the cultural adviser meanwhile asked to speak to adam sandler according to one extra , but was refused , and when that extra , goldie tom , later complained , she was told ; ' it 's in the script and we are not going to change it
' tom later said on her facebook ; ' i 've had some time to sit and think about everything that 's been going on , on the set of this movie the ridiculous six
but after finding out what was in the script and what some of the movie scences portrayed , a group of us left the set upset and with our hearts pounding due to the disrespect of our native people
still and always will represent our people ! ! ! ' the film 's director frank coraci ( above ) with adam sandler on the set blake shelton ( above with cummings ) has a small role in the film adam sandler and his production company happy madison have yet to comment , though netflix , who is producing the movie , did release a statement
' it is a broad satire of western movies and the stereotypes they popularized , featuring a diverse cast that is not only part of - but in on - the joke
' that cast includes taylor lautner , nick nolte , blake shelton , david spade and steve buscemi , among others
taylor lautner has said before that he has distant native american ancestry on his mother 's side , specifically ottawa and potawatomi
producer heather parry ( second from right ) shared this photo from set earlier this month with david vspade , cummings and taylor lautner steve buscemi also has a role in the film ( above with director frank coraci ) other stars in the film include lavell crawford ( top left ) , steve zahn ( top right ) , nick swardson ( middle right ) , will forte ( bottom left ) , and paul sado ( bottom right ) david hill , a 74 - year - old choctaw , did not seem to feel like he was in on the joke as he too left the set
i told the director if he had talked to a native woman the way they were talked to in this movie - i said i would knock his ass out
' filming also went on wednesday after the extras walked off , with frank coraci even posting a selfie of himself in front of the teepees ( above ) the native american extras found so offensive young then explained that , just as anthony said , talking about her concerns with the production team did not work
' despite this , filming seemed to continue on thursday , with vanilla ice , who plays mark twain in the film , posting a photo with adam sandler in the background
