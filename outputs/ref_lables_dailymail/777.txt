first it was revealed that lashings of baby oil were used to keep aidan 's rippling torso looking suitably divine in the hit bbc sunday night series poldark
in images shot to promote another bbc series being human , the actor , who is dating fellow rising irish star sarah greene , appears to have a much thicker chest of hair , suggesting that he 's done away with his natural rug in a bid to really show off the muscles underneath
although it seems the bbc make - up department may have gone for a little gentle pruning rather than offering up the full , shaven reveal in a bid to stay true to the 18th century male grooming that ross poldark himself might have partaken in
aidan 's chest has been the subject of much viewer devotion throughout the series so far , thanks to the actor disrobing in plenty of scenes
fans have taken to twitter to comment on the latest poldark male grooming debate
one viewer , @ aidanturner_fan , remarked that she would rather see her favourite star with a full rug : ' asked to shave his chest hair off ? ! ! i 'd rather he had it all ! ' scythed but not clean shaven ? the brooding star has stubble but not the bearded look the actor appears to favour in real life still brooding but a more natural image : a bearded aidan pictured with his girlfriend sarah greene at the premiere for the hobbit back in 2014 while others have commented that even a smattering is too much
