police are believed to have identified one of the men behind the jewel heist in hatton garden , as it was revealed the gang could have been inspired by similar robberies in la in the 1980s
officers from scotland yard 's flying squad released images of three suspects on saturday , but refused to release a picture of the supposed ringleader , likely because he has already been identified
meanwhile criminologist hoskins said he has identified ' startling similarities ' between the hatton garden raid and novel black echo , by connelly
in the 1986 robbery , the gang tunneled into a bank vault over a long weekend , triggering alarms on the friday that were not investigated , before raiding safety deposit boxes stored inside the vaults
criminologist hoskins noticed ' striking similarities ' between the hatton garden raid and crime novel black echo , which itself is based on two jewel heists in la in the 1980s mr hoskins , who also wrote murder novel the boy in the river , told mailonline : ' there is obviously a lot we do n't know about the hatton garden heist , but on the surface they look very similar
' i think that when the raiders were planning their heist they must have read this book , or researched the robberies in la
' the hole in the ground gang first struck in 1986 , when they tunneled underneath a first interstate bank located along famous sunset boulevard near hollywood , in la
the gang , believed to number around four or five , made a hole in the wall of a storm drain underneath la 's streets , before tunneling 100ft through the dirt , emerging underneath the bank vault
they then used concrete drills and saws to cut a 20ft - by - 25ft hole in the floor of the vault , before clambering through and ransacking the safety deposit boxes
nobody was ever traced for the crime , and in 1987 the same group struck again , this time at a bank of america in another la neighbourhood
in both hatton garden and the la raids , the gangs bored into vaults using heavy drills ( pictured ) , broke in over a long weekend , set off an alarm on the friday that was n't checked out , and raided safety deposit boxes the la raiders became known as the hole in the ground gang , and mr hoskins believes the group who raided hatton garden ( picutred ) must have known about them , or read the book inspired by them again , the group had used heavy tools to cut their way into a bank vault over the course of a weekend , and again they had set off an alarm on their way in
mr connelly told the times : ' the black echo was a fictionalised account of a bank heist that occurred in la in september 1987
