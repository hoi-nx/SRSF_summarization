called riff , it lets you film videos and upload them to facebook and the app. friends and strangers can then film relevant clips and attach them to the end of your video to create a collaborative project
the app was created by london - based developers through facebook 's creative labs
it is available for free on ios and android
the app 's homepage has a row of featured clips , each tagged with a certain topic
each video has a counter that shows how many clips are attached , and which clip in the sequence the viewer is currently watching
' having fun with friends is at the heart of the facebook experience , ' said facebook in a blog post
' today , we are introducing riff , a creative tool to make videos with friends
' once a friend adds a clip to a video , a user 's friend âs friends will also be shown the video in riff and will be able to add to it
' the potential pool of creative collaborators can grow exponentially from there , so a short video can become an inventive project between circles of friends that you can share to facebook , or anywhere on the internet , at any time , ' continued the blog post
