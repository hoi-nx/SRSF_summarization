pietersen battered oxford âs students for 170 off 149 deliveries in his first game of red - ball cricket for 15 months â then insisted the incoming ecb chairman graves has told him everyone has a â clean slate â

pietersen âs only hope of playing for england again is to score lots of runs for surrey â wind , rain or shine

but in front of a crowd of several hundred â almost unheard of in these parts â and with surrey stumbling to 113 for five , he had a captive audience and a job to do
pietersen was careful at first , waiting until his eighth delivery to pinch his first run in red - ball cricket since the sydney test of january 2014 , and not finding the boundary until his 31st
pietersen 's inclusion in surrey 's line - up attracted several hundred spectators and a number of photographers
