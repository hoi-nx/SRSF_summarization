' washington 's horribly broken , ' kentucky paul sen. paul said tuesday , but it came in the midst of a tv interview broken up by prickly moments and interruptions
paul , who launched his presidential campaign tuesday in louisville , kentucky , sparred with today host guthrie about his past foreign policy positions
as guthrie rattled off a list of issues where she said the senator had flipped and flopped â iran , aid to israel and defense spending â a testy and impatient paul cut her off
' why do n't we let me explain instead of talking over me , ok ? ' he griped
prickly : newly minted white house hopeful paul and nbc host guthrie talked over each other on wednesday paul , a libertarian - leaning kentucky senator , launched his presidential bid on tuesday in louisville ' no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no ! ' listen , you 've editorialized , ' paul blasted at guthrie ' before we go through a litany of things you say i 've changed on , why do n't you ask me a question : " have i changed my opinion ? " that would be sort of a better way to approach an interview
' when style gave way to substance on today , paul clarified that when he said in 2007 that iran was n't a threat to the us , the world was different and he was n't yet a candidate for the senate
' you know , it âs ridiculous to think they âre a threat to our national security , ' paul said then of iran
' on the today show , paul the younger avoided taking a stand on the nuclear agreement the white house says it has carved out with tehran 's mullahs
paul was joined by his wife kelley ashby on stage tuesday as he declared that he would campaign to ' take our country back ' ' i 'm going to keep an open mind and look at the agreement , ' paul said , while allowing that ' i do believe that negotiation is better than war
' he mirrored other republicans in questioning the ' sincerity of the iran ' in reaching an agreement with the us and five europeans nations
' the iran put out 500 words , the us put out 1,300 words , the europeans put out 200 words
' he defended his position on foreign aid , saying that even israel prime minister netanyahu has agreed that his country should one day shake off its dependence on us to fund its defense program
' i still agree with my original precept , which is â lem me answer the question ! â i still agree with my original statement from years ago that ultimately all nations should be free of foreign aid , ' he said , ' because we should n't borrow money to do it
