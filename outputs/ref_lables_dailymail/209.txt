brendan rodgers gives instructions to steven gerrard during liverpool 's defeat against aston villa brendan rodgers is set for his third season without a trophy after liverpool were dumped out of the fa cup twitching times can develop when the top clubs go through barren spells - and brendan rodgers â is beginning to enter such a period
during brendan rodgers â time in charge , manchester united and chelsea had spent more than their merseyside rivals - so too have manchester city by a fraction - but each of those have brought home something
arsene wenger has spent Â£ 183m , comparatively little , but managed to win two trophies over the past two seasons
that is less than rivals tottenham , who have spent just under Â£ 200m and , like liverpool , have won nothing

analysis by sportsmail indicates that he has signed 22 players during his tenure , but only seven of those can be considered a success at this current time
like the younger potentials , each of those could still make their mark , but the question is if it does not come together next season - and they remain trophyless again - will rogers still be in charge to reap any of the rewards ? coutinho , balotelli and jordan henderson reflect on liverpool 's semi-final defeat on sunday summer 2012 fabio borini , roma , Â£ 10.5m farmed out to sunderland for the whole of last season on loan then failed to secure a move away from liverpool but has scored just once this season as a bit - part player
verdict : hit fabio borini , pictured in action against newcastle earlier this month , has scored just one goal for liverpool joe allen tackles christian benteke in liverpool 's defeat ; he has proved to be one of brendan rodgers ' best buys oussama assaidi , heerenveen , Â£ 2.4m failed to make a premier league start at liverpool , having more joy in two loan spells at stoke , and was sold to al ahli in january
verdict : miss january 2013 sturridge , chelsea , Â£ 12m who says january transfers never work ? went on to score 11 goals in 16 liverpool games in the second half of the season after signing and has become one of europe âs top strikers
verdict : hit coutinho , inter milan , Â£ 8.5m what a snip Â£ 8.5m looks after the brazilian , still only 22 , has become one of the league âs best players
verdict : hit coutinho and sturridge , both signed in january 2013 , must be considered ' hits ' for liverpool summer 2013 luis alberto , sevilla , Â£ 6.8m the 22 - year - old is currently on loan at malaga after failing to break into liverpool âs first team and is yet to start a league match for them
verdict : miss iago aspas , celta vigo , Â£ 7.2m strikers are judged on their goals and aspas , now on loan at sevilla , has scored only one of those for liverpool in an fa cup match
verdict : hit simon mignolet has endured some shaky spells at liverpool , but when in form , he is one of the league 's best joao teixeira , sporting lisbon , Â£ 800,000 the 22 - year - old has performed well on loan at brighton this season and time will tell if he can break into liverpool âs first team , but he has to be deemed a â miss ' after only one substitute appearance so far
verdict : hit mamadou sakho cost liverpool Â£ 18m and has failed to justify his price tag , while kolo toure joined on a free mamadou sakho , paris saint-germain , Â£ 18m can be a formidable central defender at times but is far too erratic to justify the Â£ 18m price tag
verdict : miss rickie lambert , replacing raheem sterling in liverpool 's win over newcastle , is a bit - part player at anfield lallana , southampton , Â£ 25m lallana has admitted he is yet to repay the liverpool fans for his hefty price tag and has been well short of his commanding displays for southampton in recent seasons
verdict : miss emre can has played with a mature head that belies his tender years since joining from bayer leverkusen liverpool total money spent : Â£ 215.7m trophies won : 0 chelsea total money spent : Â£ 277.3m trophies won : capital one cup manchester united total money spent : Â£ 267.5m trophies won : premier league , community shield manchester city total money spent : Â£ 217.4m trophies won : premier league , capital one cup tottenham total money spent : Â£ 199.7m trophies won : 0 arsenal total money spent : Â£ 183m trophies won : fa cup , community shield dejan lovren , southampton , Â£ 20m another former southampton player who turned in a number of consummate displays on the south coast but has failed to replicate them in merseyside
verdict : miss divock origi , lille , Â£ 10m the belgian is only considered a â miss â due to not playing for liverpool , but if he can replicate his form on loan at lille when he returns , brendan rodgers could have a frightening forward at his disposal
