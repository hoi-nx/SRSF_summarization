research found that gaming boosts the ability to learn a number of tasks more accurately , and possibly puts gamers in an ' expert category ' of problem solving
but the researchers note they are not quite sure if gaming makes people learn skills better - or if people who learn skills better are more likely to become gamers
playing video games ( stock image shown ) may not only improve the ability to perform visual tasks , but also the learning ability for those skills , a study by brown university in rhode island has claimed the research was carried out by scientists at brown university in rhode island
to conduct the study , the researchers pitted nine frequent gamers against a control group of nine people who game rarely , if ever
subjects were shown an on - screen â texture â of either visual or horizontal lines and had to quickly point out - in a fraction of a second - the one area where an anomalous texture appeared
in visual processing research this is a standard protocol called a â texture discrimination task
â prior studies have shown that people can be trained to improve their performance in the task , but if they move on to a second task too quickly , it can interfere with the learning process
and the results showed that gamers managed to improve performance on both tasks , while non-gamers did what was expected
gamers were shown to be more successful when learning both tasks than non-gamers despite the small number of participants , the results proved statistically significant
â when we study perceptual learning we usually exclude people who have tons of video game playing time because they seem to have different visual processing
they are quicker and more accurate , ' said senior author dr sasaki , associate professor of cognitive , linguistic and psychological sciences at brown university
â but they may be in an expert category of visual processing
â the exact neural mechanisms underlying visual or perceptual learning are not yet known , dr sasaki said , but the study suggests that gamers may have a more efficient process for hardwiring their visual task learning than non-gamers
â it may be possible that the vast amount of visual training frequent gamers receive over the years could help contribute to honing consolidation mechanisms in the brain , especially for visually developed skills , â the researchers wrote
importantly , the study does n't prove whether playing video games improves learning ability or whether people with an innate ability become gamers because they find gaming more rewarding
