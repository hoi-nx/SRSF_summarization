in an interview with the daily mail 's weekend magazine in september , suchet appeared to confirm he was in a new relationship with a woman called nula , who has featured in posts and holiday photographs he has shared on twitter
asked about the saddest time that shook his world , he replied : ' watching my wife bonnie suffer from dementia
nula and i both have spouses in end - of - life care with dementia
the bonnie i remember no longer exists
' bonnie suchet ( pictured with suchet ) was described by her husband as ' the love of my life ' suchet began to notice a difference in his wife 's behaviour in march 2004 , and she was diagnosed with dementia in february 2006

' suchet was married with children when he and bonnie â a glamorous us who reminded him of grace kelly â became neighbours in henley-on-thames , oxfordshire
but the pair were unable to resist their mutual attraction , and while suchet was working as us correspondent for itn , bonnie flew out for a secret meeting with him and they made a pact to be together
his marriage broke up shortly afterwards and bonnie left her husband
' in 2010 , he revealed bonnie had been moved to a residential home to be given better care , and described how he had been forced tell her they were going to a lovely hotel for the weekend

' suchet had given up work to care for bonnie when he was forced to put her into the residential home , and so was at a loss when a call came from classic fm
