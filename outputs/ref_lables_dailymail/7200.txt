when floyd mayweather posted a picture of a signed contract for his $ 300 million mega-fight against manny pacquiao two months ago , there was a collective sigh of relief
after more than five years of wrangling and bickering , the richest fight in boxing history was finally set for may 2 in las vegas
floyd mayweather fights manny pacquiao next weekend but officially , no tickets are on sale that 's not to say that nobody has bought one ; seatgeek , which claims to be the world 's largest event ticket search engine , is selling briefs for up to $ 30,000 ( Â£ 20,000 )
the venue for the bout , the 16,500 - capacity mgm grand has the following message on its website : ' details on ticket sales coming soon ! please be aware that tickets for the may 2 , 2015 , floyd mayweather vs manny pacquiao fight are not yet available for purchase
' so why the delay ? initially , manny pacquiao 's promoter arum said tickets would be on sale in the first week of april but that less than 1,000 - priced between $ 1,500 and $ 7,500 - were expected to be made available to the public
manny pacquiao 's promoter arum ( left ) has blamed floyd mayweather 's side for the lack of tickets ellerbe , ceo of mayweather promotions , claimed they would be on sale last week the rest would be distributed by the fighters , promoters , television networks showtime and hbo and the mgm grand
but last week , seatgeek analyst gregoire said : ' it 's bizarre , normally there 's a public sale 10 weeks before the fight
' gregoire went on to say that only a dozen tickets had been sold through the website at an average price of $ 8,000 ( Â£ 5,400 )
another ticketing site , stubhub , are yet to put any tickets on sale
floyd mayweather trains with his uncle roger during a media workout in las vegas last week manny pacquiao is taken on the pads by trainer freddie roach in front of the watching media ' this is going to the governor 's office
i can only surmise the motivation is greed and an attempt to manipulate the tickets , otherwise why the holdup ? i 'm more than a little upset they 're not for sale to the public
' it remains to be seen who will make up the 16,500 - capacity crowd at the mgm grand ellerbe did say that tickets would be on sale last week but there is no sign of an end to the stalemate
nor is there any indication of when the reported 50,000 closed - circuit seats at mgm properties - priced at around $ 150 ( Â£ 100 ) - in las vegas will be available to purchase
' in fact , the only ticket you can buy is for the weigh - in
