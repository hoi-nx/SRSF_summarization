cavani 's slumbering champions league performance against barcelona may well have put to bed any chance of him making a switch to manchester united
for a start , at 28 he would appear to be too old for louis van gaal , who prefers to work with young talent he can mould into his type of player
cavani falls flat on his face during a limp display for psg against barcelona on tuesday night manchester united have been linked with cavani but the striker has n't impressed this season radamel falcao has struggled at manchester united after signing on loan from ligue 1 side monaco and the painful , expensive experience of radamel falcao 's nightmare loan spell will have made the club 's dutch manager wary of seemingly - fading south americans
but manchester united , who have cash to burn and gaps to fill , will have kept a close eye on tuesday night 's events at the nou camp to see if cavani still had what it takes
france 's ligue 1 is not the premier league or la liga and after making the Â£ 55m move from napoli , where he was almost unplayable , cavani has not been the prolific force officials at parc des princes hoped for
louis van gaal prefers to work with younger players and may have been put off cavani by radamel falcao 's spell the uruguayan has n't scored as many goals as he should have done in the france league psg will now concentrate on winning a two - horse race with lyon at the top of the table ( they are currently level on points with a game in hand ) and will look to cavani along with zlatan ibrahimovic to fire them over the line first
