walter smith says mccoist deserves a chance to prove himself as a successful manager at a stable club
the ibrox legend worked closely with mccoist and coach kenny before the duo assumed the reins at rangers during four years of unprecedented turmoil off and on the pitch
charged with leading the club back to the premiership from the bottom tier , mccoist finally resigned and was placed on gardening leave in december and is still earning Â£ 14,000 a week while his 12 - month notice period runs down
walter smith says mccoist deserves a chance to prove himself a successful manager at a stable club kenny , who reluctantly took over as caretaker boss before leaving in march to be replaced by stuart mccall , is also awaiting a final severance deal which would free him up to work elsewhere
yet despite leaving the club under a cloud , walter smith insists that both men have something left to offer in football , and he blames boardroom turmoil under craig whyte , charles green and the mike ashley-easdale brothers axis for contributing towards an unmanageable situation
â people can make their own judgments of how a manager does a job
â the mccoist legacy has drawn unfavourable comments from supporters
some voiced doubts over mccoist âs tactical acumen while others asked why younger players were nât given more of a chance to blossom in the lower leagues
yet walter smith argues that both mccoist and kenny deserve to be remembered for what they did during his own highly successful second spell at rangers , prior to the financial tsunami which plunged the club over a fiscal cliff
walter smith believes mccoist deserves a chance to prove himself a successful manager at a stable club â i am not a miracle person , i could nât run rangers on my own
the people that i worked with there did a terrific job
he had never managed a football club before , and neither had i when i took over
â imagine when you have never managed a football club before , going into rangers and being there for four years under the circumstances that they were in ? â people say : â he will ask walter smith for advice â but i had never been in that circumstance before , so how could i give him any advice in terms of how rangers were being run ? it is an unfair judgement for people to make on him because of the circumstances
mccoist is rangers record scorer but was axed as manager amid speculation surrounding the clubs future â alistair and kenny would take a lot of the training , and i read that he ( kenny ) could nât coach
