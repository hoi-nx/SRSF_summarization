researchers have completed the first comprehensive study of the microbes living on and in and uncontacted tribe from the amazon
they say the results show just how modern lifestyles and diets have changed us - and that the bacteria they found could be potentially beneficial to modern society
researchers sequenced the microbiomes of yanomami people living in a remote amazon village in venezuela who had not had previous contact with non-yanomami
the yanomami are an indigenous ethnic group in the amazon region of south america
the yanomami are hunter - gatherers
the researchers found that yanomami people harbor microbiomes with the highest diversity of bacteria and genetic functions ever reported in a human group
' studying the microbiomes of people in remote areas may hold the key to understanding microbes we have lost through antibiotics , sealed buildings and lack of exposure to the outdoors , ' said study co-author rob knight
in the new study published april 17 by science advances , researchers sequenced the microbiomes of yanomami people living in a remote amazon village in venezuela who had not had previous contact with non-yanomami
this information revealed , for the first time , the species of bacteria that co-exist with people who have never been exposed to industrialized society , including western food and antibiotics
' our findings emphasize the need for extensive characterization of the function of the microbiome and resistome in remote nonwesternized populations before globalization of modern practices affects potentially beneficial bacteria harbored in the human body , ' the researchers wrote
as part of their 2009 visit to this previously uncontacted yanomami village , medical professionals collected samples from the skin , mouths and fecal matter of 34 of the 54 villagers before vaccines or antibiotics were administered
without obtaining the yanomami 's consent , some institutions extracted dna from the blood for genetic tests in the 1990s
' back in labs in the u.s. ( at mount sinai , new york university , university of colorado , boulder and others ) , researchers sequenced dna isolated from the yanomami samples
the researchers then compared these non-westernized microbiomes to the microbiomes of people living in western society and people living in villages in the midst of transition from isolation to urban lifestyles
bacteria isolated from yanomami microbiomes carried genes that confer resistance to man - made antibiotics , despite the fact that they were never previously exposed to antibiotics
' first of all , this study gives us a glimpse of what our microbiomes might have looked like before our modern habits began to impact the beneficial bacteria that call us home
