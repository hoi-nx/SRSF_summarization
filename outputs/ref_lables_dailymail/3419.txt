buchanon was a first - round draft pick for the oakland raiders , and seventeenth overall , when his mother made the request in 2002
' if my mother taught me anything , it 's that this is the most desperate demand that a parent can make on a child , ' he wrote in an exclusive excerpt released to fox sports
former nfl player buchanon ( pictured here playing for the oakland raiders ) has revealed his mother demanded he pay her one million dollars as the cost ' for raising him for the last 18 years ' after he was drafted ' the covenant of having a child is simply that you give your child everything possible , and they owe you nothing beyond a normal amount of love and respect
' but after years , buchanon said he realized that his mother and family members were different - especially when money became involved
buchanon said he followed the ' unwritten nfl new money millionaire ' rule and instead bought his mother a brand new big house , as well as paid for all her finances that did not include food or entertainment
instead of selling her old house , like he advised , buchanon 's mother rented it to his aunt
buchanon asks rookies to consider certain questions before buying their family ' big - ticket purchases ' , such as whether the family member would be able to make the payments if they could n't , or if the family member expected them to pay for upkeep 20 years later
the former football star said his mother never offered him the money she made from her sister 's rent , and later blamed him for ' messing up her life ' after he kicked her boyfriend out of the house he paid for
' buchanon said he bought his mother a house instead , which brought its own set of problems for years buchanon ( pictured playing for the tampa bay buccaneers ) said his relatives also asked him for money , claiming they needed a check to pay for repairs and bills buchanon said he eventually became fed up and told his mother he would stop paying for her new house 's upkeep after he paid off the mortgage
when his mother said the house was too large for her to afford the maintenance , he offered to buy her a smaller house that he would pay for with cash and put in his name , protecting her from loans and giving his brothers and sisters a stable home
instead , his mother asked for $ 15,000 in cash
