however , for one man - whose company requires a sick note even for a single day off - he handed his bosses more than just the usual doctor 's letter
the unnamed worker , from alberta , canada , instead came armed with with a scathing note from his gp , giving the firm - believed to be pizza hut - a ticking off for its office policy ' wasting his time '
a man said to be an employee of pizza hut shared his doctor 's sicknote with a friend , who posted it on reddit a friend of the employee posted the letter on reddit under the title , ' my friends work requires a doctors note if you call in sick ' , and it has now be shared thousands of time online
clearly annoyed at having their time ' wasted ' writing sick notes for common colds , the unnamed canada doctor opens the letter praising their patient for ' sensibly staying home from work '
the gp writes that the patient , ' has had , by their own report , a cold today and sensibly stayed home from work rather than spreading this to his colleagues / customers
' i have no test for the common cold and therefore believe him / her , however you feel his time and mine should be wasted by making him sit in the walk in clinic for hours and me spending time writing a sick note that i could be spending on people who genuinely need my attention
