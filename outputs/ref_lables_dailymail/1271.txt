a couple who chose to forsake their dream wedding in order to pay for one final shot at ivf are celebrating giving birth to twins and even found a way to say their ' i do 's ' becca , 29 , and partner dale , 30 , from gotham , nottingham , were heart - broken when they discovered their savings would only be enough to cover the cost of a wedding , or fertility treatment
desperate for a family , the couple chose to sacrifice their dream wedding and go ahead with ivf , but were over the moon when weeks later they became winners of a wedding competition
becca and dale litchfield decided to give up their dream wedding in order to have one last shot at ivf and have since welcomed twins , darci-mai ( left ) and stanley ( right ) the happy couple said their vows , and were overjoyed when they discovered the fertility treatment had worked - and becca gave birth to twins stanley and darci-mai
we knew that we were n't getting any younger so the best option was to try ivf one last time , and sacrifice the wedding
' it was a risk , because the ivf could have failed - and we 'd have ended up with neither
' but when we won the wedding competition , and then found out i was pregnant , it was unbelievable
although they had given up on the idea of their perfect wedding the couple were blessed with yet another stroke of luck when they won a wedding contest which allowed them to finally get married before they conceived darci-mai ( right ) and stanley ( left ) becca and dale had attempted two rounds of ivf ' now i 've got my dream - the perfect husband and children , i could n't be happier
' becca and dale , first started ivf treatment in 2012 after a year of failing to conceive naturally
the couple spent Â£ 5,500 on two rounds of ivf , keeping back an additional sum of money that they planned to spend on their wedding day
but after two failed attempts , becca and dale were forced to make a decision , becca says that it was an incredibly difficult one to make
' we were spending all of our money on ivf treatment hoping we 'd conceive but after we failed twice i wondered if i 'd ever get pregnant , ' she said
' i 'd always dreamt of feeling my baby kick for the first time and the bond after giving birth , so i knew we had to try ivf one last time
' after winning the wedding competition the couple were able to have the white wedding they had always wanted becca , pictured with darci-mai ( left ) and stanley ( right ) in order to conceive , becca , pictured with darci-mai , had to take three hormone injections a day but she says it was entirely worth it after abandoning hopes of a big celebration the couple decided to at least secure their relationship with a proposal
at the end of the year , dale and i officially became engaged - it was a way to lift our spirits and we thought if we could n't have a big wedding , we could at least get engaged
' but unbeknownst to becca , during their year long wait for ivf , dale , who works as an electrician , entered the pair into a win a wedding competition
becca says that she and dale could n't stop beaming when they discovered they were expecting twins ' we actually came second in the competition , but then the first place dropped out and so we won , ' she said
' after the wedding , the pair changed fertility clinics and had their final round of ivf
the twins were born on 27th september last year becca says that even when the darci-mai ( left ) and stanley ( right ) are screaming she feels lucky to have them ' me and dale sat beaming at each other , we could n't believe we were about to have one baby let alone twins
