nasa has selected a variety of companies to work on projects to create advanced space technologies , including faster methods of propulsion
other projects to be worked on include improved habitats for humans , and small satellites to explore deep space
and one of the companies in the 12 next space technologies for exploration partnerships ( nextstep ) says they have an engine that could get humans to mars in just 39 days
their engine shot to fame a few years ago when it was revealed that it could drastically reduce the journey time to mars from months to weeks - although it may require a nuclear power source
and following the successful test of a prototype in 2013 , it seems nasa is now considering it for use on a future mission to mars
â we are thrilled by this announcement and proud to be joining forces with nasa in the final steps of the technology maturation , â said dr franklin chang diaz , ad astra âs chairman and ceo , in a statement
â over three years , nasa will give the company about Â£ 6.8 million ( $ 10 million ) to get the engine almost ready to fly in space
a previous test in 2013 saw ad astra complete 10,000 successful high power firings of a vasimr prototype
the vasimr engine is seen here being tested
plasma rockets like vasimr ( illustrated ) feature exhaust velocities far above those achievable by their chemical cousins , so their fuel consumption is extremely low the vasimr engine could be part of the entire spacecraft that will ultimately take astronauts to mars
the rocket that will send them on their way will be the space launch system , illustrated , which will complete an unmanned flight in 2019 - and it will have room for some secondary payloads to go to deep space owing to the orbits of earth and mars , there are specific windows of opportunity when a mission can take place
with this and other technologies , nasa said in a statement they want to develop exploration capabilities around the moon , and at mars
â three advanced electric propulsion projects , including vasimr , will develop engines that operate in the 50 to 300 kilowatt range
the other four things needed are a large ' tug ' spacecraft , a habitat , lander and an ascent vehicle - all of which nasa is hoping to develop in the next decade or so nasa is also asking companies to development capabilities to sustain a crew of four for 60 days in cis - lunar space - between earth and the moon - with the ability to scale up to mars missions
and finally , two companies have been selected to develop small satellites - cubesats - to launch as secondary paylods on the first flight of nasa âs huge space launch system rocket in 2019
as the rocket is so powerful , it will give these cubesats a rare opportunity to explore deep space , as opposed to remaining in earth orbit
