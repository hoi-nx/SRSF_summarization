she was diagnosed with melanoma just after graduating from a rhode island college in 2005 started in high school : kohl was an avid tanner starting in high school and would sit in the sun some 40 hours per week every summer while working as a life guard in cape cod in college , she tanned frequently in sun beds kohl was diagnosed with stage iii melanoma after she found a golf ball sized lump in her groin just before graduating from college in 2005 ' no one in our family knew what melanoma was , ' kohl 's mother , colleen , recalled to cosmo ( via elle ) ' we did a lot of crying
physicians would trace the cancer back to a mole kohl had removed years earlier , but which doctors had failed to identify as melanoma
kohl died in november 2008 , three years after her diagnosis -- and her final tanning session
' kohl 's not here to inform people of the dangers , ' colleen told cosmo
less than a year later , kohl found a small lump in her abdomen and was told her cancer had progress to stage iv kohl died in november 2008 , three years after her diagnosis -- and her final tanning session
