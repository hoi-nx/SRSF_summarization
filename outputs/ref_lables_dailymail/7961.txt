aliens are often portrayed as diminutive beings , but in â reality â they could be much larger and heavier than science fiction films suggest
scientist fergus simpson has calculated the minimum size needed for intelligent life to survive , based on the laws of conservation of energy seen on earth
and from this , he calculates that if intelligent extraterrestrials exist they will typically weigh 650lbs ( 300kg ) - the median weight of a polar bear
the cosmologist âs calculations are also based on the idea that there âs a minimum size needed for intelligent life , but do nât factor in an alien planet âs gravity
he said there must be a minimum body size necessary for supporting intelligent life , based on the range of body sizes of intelligent animals such as apes and humans , found on earth
mr fergus simpson said there must be a minimum size necessary for supporting intelligent life , based on the range of body sizes of intelligent animals such as apes and humans , found on earth
and , if they exist , he believes intelligent aliens typically weigh more than 650 lbs ( 300kg ) - around the size of a polar bear ( stock image ) his argument follows that if clever aliens are large , there may be fewer of them , as they will likely live in a society with low population densities to ensure they have the resources they need
but the calculations do n't take into account an alien planet âs surface gravity commenting on the study , forgan , a research fellow at the university of st andrews , told newsweek : â i think the average size calculation is reasonable â
mr forgan also noted that the research does nât take an alien planet âs surface gravity into account
