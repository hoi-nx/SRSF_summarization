items on sale in poundland are sometimes up to 50 per cent more expensive than those sold in supermarkets , new research has shown
the budget retailer last week announced that sales exceed Â£ 1billion for the first time last year becoming europe 's largest single - price discount retailer
the company 's success has been put down to shoppers hunting bargains and taking sales away from britain 's four big supermarkets , asda , tesco , sainsbury and morrisons
the research points out that at poundland shoppers can buy a 250g box of kellogs cornflakes for Â£ 1 , while at tesco they can buy a 750g box of the cereal for the same price
equally two pints of mile cost Â£ 1 in poundland , but shoppers can get four pints in asda for 89p
however , the research does point out that there are still many products cheaper at poundland compared to other supermarkets
however , a spokesman for poundland told the newspaper : ' we conduct price surveys every two weeks against the supermarkets and we believe we are 40 % cheaper or more against 1,000 branded products
back then , shoppers were beginning to desert the high street for superstores , but mr smith and his poundland chain - which he sold in 2000 for Â£ 50million - were a lifeline that helped keep it afloat
