martin vargic , a graphic designer from slovakia , has created a chart that shows how the most famous of the constellations have changed from 50,000 bc to 100,000ce
martin vargic used satellite data to chart how the constellation stars have shifted and will change in the future using data collected by the european space agency on the gradually shifting position of stars , he has estimated how the constellations will change between
it would be less common in more mature stars , like our sun. the big dipper , for example , will change from looking like a plough to something that looks more like duck , while the proud form of leo will mutate into an unrecognisable shape
mr martin vargic 's chart also shows how some of the more abstract constellations , like cassiopeia , were almost unrecognisable further back in human history when our ancestors were still living in caves
mr martin vargic said : ' on a short timescale , stars appear to maintain nearly fixed positions in relation to each other , long term observations show that all stars indeed move and all constellations gradually change over time
this animation shows how the constellation leo changed from 50,000bc to what it will look like in 100,000ce the constellations were initially named after real life objects and mythical figures they appeared to represent and that tradition has continued
this has allowed astronomers to predict the position of the stars thousands of years into the future
mr martin vargic 's chart shows how some of the constellations will become probably need to be renamed
from left to right the image above shows how they changed from 50,000bc , 2,000ad , 50,000ce and 100,000ce this animation shows how leo has changed since 50,000bc and how unrecognisable it will be in 100,000ce mr martin vargic used data from the four year long hipparcos satellite mission , which was launched in 1989 , to collect data on the position of the stars
this animation show the changing face of the constellation cassiopia from 50,000bc to 100,000ce this animation shows how orion 's distinctive shape will change to become headless in the next 98,000 years in fact many stars , including our own sun , are moving through space at thousands of miles per hour
' however , we now know our solar system is moving through the milky way and other stars have their own particular paths
' the big dipper could eventually start to look more like the big duck over the next 98,000 years this animation shows how the crux will shift from being a distinct crucifix to two parallel lines by 100,000ce
