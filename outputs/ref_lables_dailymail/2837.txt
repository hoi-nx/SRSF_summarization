tesco is under pressure to axe 200 stores â on top of 100 already closed or cancelled â after the supermarket giant announced a record annual loss of Â£ 6.38billion
the loss is the largest ever declared by a uk retailer and reflects a seismic shift in shopping habits away from big supermarkets towards smaller budget stores
over the past 20 years , tesco went on a spending spree to build up a vast land bank that was designed to expand its empire of some 3,000 stores
as a result , tesco has been forced to slash the value of its property empire and sell off land cheaply , with the loss of thousands of jobs
uk âs biggest retailer made a profit of Â£ 1.4billion on sales through the tills across the world in the year to the end of february , down by 60 per cent on the year before
this profit was more than wiped out by Â£ 7billion worth of one - off costs , led by a write - down of Â£ 4.3billion on the value of its land and stores
there was also a write - down of some Â£ 570 million on the food and other products sitting in its warehouses and stores , while the company has agreed to pump an extra Â£ 270million a year into its staff pension scheme , which has a deficit of Â£ 3.9billion
the closure of more than 45 stores and its current head office in hertfordshire will cost more than Â£ 400million
the loss of Â£ 6.38 billion â the biggest in the supermarket âs 96 - year history â was even worse than the most pessimistic city analysts had expected
shares in tesco closed down 5.2 per cent on the day , wiping around Â£ 1billion off its stock market value and taking it down to just over Â£ 18billion
here , retail industry veterans , plus mail writers , identify what on earth went wrong
the experts mary portas , retail consultant the problem with tesco is that no one really likes the company
tesco did nât do either
today , people want brands they trust , and the truth is tesco acted in a bullish way â they built where they wanted , when they wanted , they did nât care about the effect on communities
image problem : mary portas says the problem with tesco ' is that no one really likes the company ' sir richard greenbury , former chief executive of m&s when i ran m&s we looked at having a private jet for the board
tesco having four private jets tells you something about the culture of the place
joanna blythman , author of shopped : the shocking power of uk supermarkets i âm no fan of supermarkets in general , but tesco is at the absolute bottom of my list
once upon a time , when we believed tesco was good value and trusted the brand , we tolerated â up to a point â how five or six stores bullied their way into our communities
' too much ' : former m&s chief executive sir richard greenbury blames tesco 's grand expansion plans lord haskins , former chairman of northern foods tesco âs problem is that it tried to be all things to all men
bill grimsey , former boss of wickes , iceland and focus tesco must be clear on pricing â it needs to stop the offers and promotions
if poundland charges Â£ 1 for a cleaner , so should tesco
tesco also needs to rationalise the options of products â its stores have way too many product lines and categories
tom salmon , ran the now defunct hedon salads which supplied tesco tesco âs problem was that it kept screwing over its suppliers
mail writers sarah vine i âve always defended tesco to my middle - class friends
but even i , a stubborn tesco shopper , have fallen out of love with the store over the past couple of years
over the years , i âve flirted with all the supermarket delivery services , but , in the end , i settled for tesco because it always had the best offers on quality dishwasher tablets â and lots of convenient evening delivery slots
there were four reasons i abandoned tesco : rude delivery drivers who were often late ; a slew of items substituted for ones i âd ordered ; too many annoying flash sales ( although ocado is guilty of this , too ) ; and one rotten tomato too many
abandoned : sarah vine ( left ) said one rotten tomato too many made her turn her back on tesco after years as a loyal customer , while libby purves ( right ) said a trip to tesco became a ' sweaty , irritating chore ' libby purves for me , it was the sense of contempt
we had a local tesco we used , in the absence of any good , big supermarkets in a rural area , and it was ok
over the past year or so , uk âs biggest grocer inflated its profits in the uk and ireland by as much as Â£ 326 million , by recording incentive payments from big suppliers that had not actually arrived , while failing to record the costs of some sales
