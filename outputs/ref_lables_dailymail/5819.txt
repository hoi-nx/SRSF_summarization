you could have fried an egg on david cameron âs upper lip yesterday afternoon when he appeared in sunny bristol
the pm was speaking in a rather peculiar building â an almost empty science park on the city âs outskirts , its round atrium area filled with party activists
the space was uncomfortably hot and mr david cameron was looking straight into a merciless , piercing , armpit - moistening sun. the prime ministerial upper lip was soon glistening
attack of the sweats ! david cameron worked up a sweat as he made a visit to poole in dorset and sunny bristol
pictured : the prime minister speaks with lilli docherty and her daughter dakota over lunch in a sun - drenched garden it was such a glorious bank holiday , why on earth did tory high command not scrap their plans , strip down to shirts and chinos and campaign on the beach at weston-super-mare ? they might at least have found some swing voters there
but there is something clinical , immutable , rigid , unspontaneous so far about this tory campaign
mr david cameron was appearing alongside george osborne , chancellor of the exchequer , both of them in weekday suits
mr david cameron had spent the morning in poole , dorset ( where veteran lib dem mp annette brooke is retiring ) and apparently ate a hot dog while he was there
he arrived at the bristol and bath science park at 4.40pm
prime minister david cameron and george osborne make a speech at the bristol and bath science park during his bristol visit , mr david cameron read a speech and said there was a â moral â case for the tories â policies bristol has a handful of seats , local tory mps being chris skidmore , charlotte leslie and jack lopresti
might it not have made more sense to hold a rally underneath clifton suspension bridge â somewhere that at least had a resonance with the city ? a tanned mr david cameron dutifully made his prepared speech , saying that there was a â moral â case for the tories â economic policies
after ten minutes he let george osborne make a speech
george osborne stepped into the glare and you have seldom seen a man look so deathly pale
a brief session of questions saw mr david cameron being asked about recent lib dem eruptions â nick clegg calling mr george osborne â a very dangerous man â and danny alexander alleging that the tories are not interested in helping the poor
mr david cameron said it was inevitable that â you âll find the minor parties saying increasingly desperate things â
