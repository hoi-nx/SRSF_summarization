there will be calls for england to get rid of cook and trott on the back of their failures here but i think they should both play all three tests against west indies before any sort of decision is made
cook , for instance , will end up with one of the greatest of all england records and you have to give people of that calibre every possible chance to show they are worth a place
trott ( left ) and cook head out to open england 's second innings against west indies trott walks past cook after he was dismissed for just four runs by jerome taylor on day three i said after the first day of this test that england âs top order was a bit one - paced which could be an issue but that does not mean i think they should be dropped unless there is conclusive evidence they are in decline
trott will have played all sorts of mind games with himself ahead of this game , telling himself to enjoy it and trying to forget how people perceive him after leaving australia
the trott i remember was almost jacques kallis - like in how still he was
the trott i remember would get to 70 before you knew it and we ca nât judge his comeback on a test where he has received good deliveries in both innings
trott was making his first test appearance for england in 18 months against the west indies he has to tell himself to calm down , stay still and chill a bit at the crease and it will be hard because the duke ball is swinging and he is not accustomed to being an opener
cook is mentally one of the strongest cricketers england have ever produced , an incredible fighter and an incredible bloke who has such a burning desire to prove people wrong
trott leaves the field in antigua following his poor showing on day three of the first test yes , form is a concern â he has nât scored an international century in two years but this is a man who reached 25 test hundreds in record time
cook based his game around three shots â the cut , the pull and clip off the hip â and he would get lots of runs
but the swinging ball is not a new phenomenon , especially to an opener brought up in england , and cook has to score runs against the moving ball now if he is going to prolong his test career
trott was very much in the mould of south africa batsman jacques kallis ( above ) when he was on form cook has now gone 61 combined test and odi innings without making a century west indies will be very disciplined for an hour but their third seamer is jason holder
