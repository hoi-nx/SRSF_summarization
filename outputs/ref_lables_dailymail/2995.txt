a 47 stone woman who was so immobile she needed her husband 's help to go to the toilet has revealed how he prevented her from losing weight
despite being morbidly obese , bettie jo , from houston , texas , lived off a diet of fried chicken and barbecue sauce , and was unable to care for herself , meaning josh had to do everything for her
but josh has admitted he did n't support the 24 - year - old with her bid to lose weight because he feared if she became slimmer , she would n't need him anymore , in my 600lb life , which airs tonight on tlc
shedding 11st means she is now mobile and can stand up on her own bettie jo , who now weighs 35st 8lbs ( 500lbs ) thanks to surgery , reveals on the show that josh had become her ' caretaker ' - helping her go to the toilet and into the shower , and putting powder between her rolls of flesh afterwards to stop her skin from chafing
she said that the pair 's relationship had become ' slim to none '
' my husband josh had to help me take a shower and wipe my butt
' my marriage with josh was really difficult too because my weight prevented me having a real marriage
josh had to be my caretaker
' before her surgery bettie jo was reliant on husband josh to tend her every need josh was in charge of the shopping and meals and kept bettie jo fed with unhealthy foods but despite the deadly weight , bettie jo was living on a diet of fried chicken and barbecue sauce
i was angry and depressed and started eating more
i met josh right after i turned 17
' although bettie jo lived through her suicide attempt , seven years later at the age of 24 , she felt life was slipping through her fingers
bettie jo and josh shopping after her weight loss : she now buys lots of protein and checks labels for calories ' i wanted to have some freedom again and i knew my weight was keeping me from that
' but husband josh now admits he did not help bettie jo 's weight loss
' but bettie jo was determined to make a change
i wanted to have a career , have a baby
' desperate for a solution , bettie jo and josh went to a houston bariatric surgeon
' at 5ft 2in bettie jo 's ideal weight is 8st 8lbs ( 120lbs ) but her doctor predicted that at almost 47 stone ( 660lb ) she was unlikely to get to 30
he set bettie jo the task of losing two stone ( 28lbs ) to demonstrate she was capable of losing weight before he could agree to surgery
he also raised concerns about josh 's role as the feeder in their relationship , which he said would have to change
bettie jo used to love pizza and anything containing potato - chips , crisps and mashed potato ' i needed josh to help me , says bettie jo
' bettie jo and josh moved to houston to be closer to the doctor and set about a weight - loss mission
' josh was a big help â he was careful about the food he bought
but as bettie jo gained independence , josh grappled with the change and worried he was becoming dispensable
' he wanted to be needed - that was his primary concern , ' she said
it took several months for bettie jo to drop the weight and be scheduled for surgery
' the operation went well but my first night after surgery but josh was nât there when i woke up
josh was preparing my meals and did n't necessarily want to follow the doctor 's instructions
five month after the surgery bettie jo had trouble breathing and was rushed to hospital
but it was the wake up call bettie jo and josh needed
the doctor insisted they see a therapist to get the diet on track
josh admits : â i used to take care of her but when she started being able to move around herself after the surgery that really scared me because
in the supermarket with having shed teh wight , bettie jo looks for the ' light ' options it forced bettie jo to confront relationship issue too : â i had nât been touched
it was partly josh 's fault and partly because i did n't want it
' but therapy helped us discover that we still care so much about each other
' now ten months after the surgery bettie jo weighs 35st 8lbs ( 500lbs ) , and is proud of the progress she 's made
i âm also working on my relationship with josh ' josh and i had never been on a date
â i have a long way to go but i now know i can do it because i have josh
