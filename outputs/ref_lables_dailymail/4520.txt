roberts , who hopes to become the mayor of middlesbrough , has bungee jumped off the transporter bridge over the river tees 100 years after his ancestor jumped to his death for a bet worth just a sixpence mr roberts , a 50 - year - old former tv and radio presenter , said ' mcallister , this one 's for you ' as he jumped off the bridge - in reference to his great - great - uncle mcallister who died after leaping off the bridge in 1913 the 50 - year - old former tv and radio presenter , from marton , middlesbrough , said : ' i thought it was going to be sheer terror , but i actually really enjoyed it
' mr mcallister was challenged to jump off the bridge by a friend after drinking in a pub in port clarence in a bet worth a sixpence
newspaper articles from 1913 about mr mcallister 's death ( pictured ) tell how he ' dived to his death ' and drowned following an ' amazing act of bravado ' the cause of death was listed as : ' shock and suffocation from drowning through jumping from the transporter bridge in a spirit of bravado whilst under the influence of drink
' father - of - two mr roberts , who grew up listening to stories about his ancestor , managed to track down mr mcallister 's death certificate , which listed him as a general labourer of washington street in middlesbrough
mr roberts , who was handed a sixpence and a beer after his jump this week , said : ' a century after mcallister was killed , and in a bid to exorcise the ghost of my ancestor , i decided i would have a go at the jump as well
mr mcallister 's death certificate ( pictured ) confirmed his death on may 4 , 1913 , when he was just 30 - years - old mr roberts asked for teesside residents to stump up Â£ 2.50 - roughly what a sixpence would be worth today - to support him and raise money for the mfc foundation which helps children in need following his jump
