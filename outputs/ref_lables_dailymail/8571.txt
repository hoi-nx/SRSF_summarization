the days of filling your car with petrol may be numbered because researchers have boosted the efficiency of making hydrogen fuel from plant waste
us scientists have found a way to use discarded corn husks and stalks to make cheap hydrogen fuel that does n't pollute the environment like fossil fuels
the breakthrough could one day see the fuel being produced locally and drivers stopping to refuel their vehicles at roadside bioreactors instead of pumping petrol into their motor
us scientists have found a way to use discarded corn husks and stalks to make cheap hydrogen fuel that does n't pollute the environment like fossil fuels and it could accelerate the take up of biogas for cars eco-friendly hydrogen cars , which are already a reality , emit only water , but the gas is expensive and is not easy to store , meaning more research is needed for hydrogen cars to become mainstream
now , researchers at virginia polytechnic institute and state university have shown that it âs possible to convert 100 per cent of the sugar in corn stalks and husks â a by - product of farming â into hydrogen gas , which can be used to power vehicles
it âs previously only been possible to convert between 30 and 60 per cent of plant sugar into hydrogen , by using industrial catalysts or fermenting techniques , the independent reported
the breakthrough could one day see the fuel being produced locally and drivers stopping to refuel their vehicles at roadside bioreactors instead of pumping petrol into their motor
â the researchers found that the carbon produced from the kernels could store a â considerable â amount of hydrogen
two scientists developed a process to make more efficient fuel by mixing biomass with a special solution comprising 10 enzymes that turn plant sugars into hydrogen and carbon dioxide
other hydrogen fuel production methods rely on highly processed sugars , but the virginia polytechnic institute and state university team used corn husks and stalks , which are known as dirty biomass , to cut costs and make the fuel easier to produce locally
dr rollin found that the process of breaking down corn husks and stalks into hydrogen and carbon dioxide can use both sugars glucose and xylose at the same time - not one after the other
other hydrogen fuel production methods rely on highly processed sugars , but the virginia polytechnic institute and state university team used corn husks and stalks , ( a stock image of the whole plantis shown ) which are known as dirty biomass , to cut costs and make the fuel easier to produce locally â we believe this exciting technology has the potential to enable the widespread use of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles around the world and displace fossil fuels , â dr rollin said
