the world 's first robotic planet finder is hoped to help in the search for earth - like planets that might support life in other solar systems
all three planets in the system orbit the star , hd 7924 , at a distance closer than mercury orbits the sun , completing their orbits in just 5 , 15 and 24 days
repeated measurement of a star 's spectrum enables astronomers to detect the tiny wobble induced in a star by the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet
automated planet finder observes them every night for months , in search of rocky planets with very low masses , similar to earth
the ultimate goal of extrasolar planet research is to find planets like earth that may support life
' the three planets are unlike anything in our solar system , with masses 7 - 8 times the mass of earth and orbits that take them very close to their host star , ' explains uc berkeley graduate student lauren weiss
while the planets are likely to be too hot to support life , their discovery reveals the powerful capabilities of the automated planet finder ( automated planet finder ) in california
' it 's a bit like owning a driverless car that goes planet shopping
' afp found the star system by tracing out the planets ' orbits over many years using the doppler technique to see shifts in the star 's light
but unlike other telescope , the new automated planet finder facility offers a way to speed up the planet search as it robotically searches for planets every clear night
' we initially used automated planet finder like a regular telescope , staying up all night searching star to star , ' said uh graduate student fulton
scientists have proven the automated planet finder 's capabilities by using the telescope to find a unique a planetary system orbiting a nearby star 54 light - years away
