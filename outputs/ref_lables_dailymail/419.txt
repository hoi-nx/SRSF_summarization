scientists from the university of wollongong are designing ultra-durable condoms they claim could feel even better than nothing at all
the contraceptive is made with hydrogel , a strong and flexible solid which can be made to feel and act like human tissue
the groundbreaking design will eventually offer functions like self - lubrication , topical drug delivery , and even electric conductivity , dramatically changing the capacity of male contraception , reports science alert
scientists from the university of wollongong are designing ultra-durable condoms they claim could feel even better than nothing at all the contraceptive is made with hydrogel , a strong and flexible solid which can be made to feel and act like human tissue the australian team behind the design , led by materials scientist gorkin , won a grant for a next generation condom in 2013 , giving them access to us $ 100,000 to use on research
gorkin , the leader of the research team responsible for the design , said : ' if you make them so pleasurable that people ca n't wait to put them on , then more people will use them ' the team won a grant for a next generation condom in 2013 , giving them access to us $ 100,000 to use on research hydrogel has been around for decades , but it has risen to prominence in recent years , after being used in prosthetics for the likes of eye implants and blood vessels
' hydrogel ( pictured ) has been around for decades , but it has risen to prominence in recent years , after being used in prosthetics for the likes of eye implants and blood vessels the researchers plan to conduct biometric testing to measure the bodies response to the material gorkin is hoping to design the product to accommodate for the around the cultural and social needs for birth control
