a blind man was left ' completely embarrassed and humiliated ' after staff at his local post office refused him entry with his guide dog
roberts , 36 , from chadderton , manchester , walked into his town 's post office and an employee shouted from behind the counter that he would have to leave his guide dog bruce outside if he wanted to be served
even when mr roberts explained his two - year - old golden labrador retriever cross was a guide dog , the employee allegedly still insisted he should be left outside
he said he was left feeling ' angry and shocked ' mr roberts said : ' i was left feeling so angry and shocked
it is unacceptable that i should be made to feel like i had done something wrong by going to the post office with my guide dog
' mr roberts , who had gone to the post office to top up his electric meter with his payment card , was eventually served by the employee after a ten minute standoff
' the post office in chadderton , manchester , where mr roberts was told he had to leave his guide dog outside mr roberts was born with glaucoma , a condition which affects eyesight as a result of pressure built up behind the eye , but in the last 12 months has seen a radical decline in his sight
he now has only 30 per cent vision in one eye which means he ca n't work and struggles with everyday tasks such as cooking and cleaning
' mr roberts said he has ' never experienced anything like this before ' but that he has been told a similar incident with a fellow guide dog user at this particular post office has happened
' so angered was mr roberts by the incident that he went straight to a nearby library and lodged an official complaint with the post office
' mr roberts said : ' i want a written apology from the post office and assurance this will never happen to me or any other guide dog user again
' one gentleman said that if that is the way the post office deals with a disabled person he would never come into the post office again , ' said mr roberts , who has had bruce for seven months and says he 's his best friend
he has called the chadderton post office employee 's response to his guide dog ' outdated '
i think something needs to be done to educate people that if you have a guide dog it should not stop you from getting about and should n't stop you from doing the things that everyone else gets to do , ' mr roberts said
