scientists have revealed a sophisticated new dating technique shows that little foot , an important fossil of an early human forerunner unearthed in the 1990s in south africa , is roughly 3.7 million years old
' the age of little foot has been highly debated , ' said geologist granger of purdue in indiana , whose research appears in the journal nature
the study found little foot , a member of the species australopithecus prometheus , lived at roughly the same time as australopithecus afarensis , the species whose most famous fossil , known as lucy , comes from ethiopia
the species was much bigger and taller than lucy 's , with gorilla - like facial features but fully upright and very strong with powerful hands for climbing
like lucy , little foot was female
the researchers analyzed 11 rock samples from around the nearly complete little foot fossil skeleton from the sterkfontein caves to gauge its age
our species , homo sapiens , appeared roughly 200,000 years ago
earlier members of the human genus , homo , date back more than 2 million years
members of lucy 's species were contemporaries of little foot , although lucy herself lived about 500,000 years later
like lucy , little foot was female
the species was much bigger and taller than lucy 's , with gorilla - like facial features but fully upright and very strong with powerful hands for climbing , according to paleoanthropologists ron clarke and kuman of the wits university in johannesburg
the face of little foot , which has now been accurately dated for the first time
ron clarke and kuman noted similarities in facial structure and some teeth between little foot and the later human relative paranthropus , indicating little foot 's species may have been ancestral to paranthropus or a close cousin
the new date for little foot indicates lucy 's species was not the only one that could have given rise to later members of the human family tree , ron clarke and kuman said
' the fact , therefore , that we have at least two ( australopithecus ) species living at the same time in different parts of south africa , ( about ) 3.67 million years ago , raises the question of how many other species there may have been which have not yet been discovered , ' ron clarke and kuman said by email
some of the other material found at the site : stone tools found at a different level of the sterkfontein caves cave also were dated at 2.18 million years old , making them among the oldest known stone tools in south africa
ron clarke , a professor in the evolutionary studies institute at wits university in south africa holds the little foot skull , among the oldest hominid skeletons ever dated at 3.67 million years old , according to an advanced dating method
the date places little foot as an older relative of lucy , a famous australopithecus skeleton dated at 3.2 million years old that was found in ethiopia
the new findings suggest little foot roamed the earth at around the same time as the famed 3.2 - million - year - old lucy , an australopithecus afarensis - shown in a reconstruction above
when discovered in hadar , ethiopia , lucy was the only skeleton of the species known ; she would 've stood 3.5 feet ( about a meter ) tall
currently , more than 300 individuals of this species , which lived between about 3.85 million and 2.95 million years ago , have been uncovered caffee has since used it to perform analysis for other projects , including those from the sterkfontein caves site
' inrap 's french researcher laurent bruxelles shows little foot , a fossil with both ape - like and human features found in a cave at the sterkfontein caves site , near johannesburg
it is also the site of discovery of the famous pre-human skull affectionately known as ' mrs ples ' , and the almost complete hominid skeleton called ' little foot '
granger 's original attempt was the first time aluminum - 26 and beryllium - 10 radioisotopic dating had been used to determine the age of a fossil
