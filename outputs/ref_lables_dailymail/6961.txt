cameron has admitted johnson is aiming to be the next tory leader cameron has admitted johnson is locked in a behind - the - scenes battle with theresa may and osborne to take over the tory leadership
the prime minister said the london mayor had ' suddenly realised ' after years of mischief making that his main political rivals were those lining themselves up to take over the top job
he said mr johnson now understood the pair were no longer in ' competition '
the admission exposes the battle quietly raging behind the scenes over who will take over from mr cameron
it comes just weeks after mr cameron revealed he would stand down as prime minister before 2020 if he wins re-election next month
mr cameron said : ' terms are like shredded wheat : two are wonderful but three might just be too many
' he named three of his senior colleagues - home secretary theresa may , chancellor osborne and london mayor johnson - as possible replacements as tory leader when he stands down
speaking to his cousin harry mount in an interview with the sunday times , mr cameron also admits that his membership of the infamous bullingdon club at oxford is ' cripplingly embarrassing '
mr cameron denied that he and the london mayor have been political rivals for decades
but he admitted that mr johnson had , until recently , seen the pm as his competition
he said : ' he suddenly realised i 'm not really his competition
' mr cameron said he saw his relationship with the london mayor as ' co-opetition '
' mr cameron said he remembered the london mayor at eton ' because he was so striking '
johnson has ' suddenly realised ' that cameron is not his ' competition '
the prime minister said : ' his competition is people who 'll have a crack at it after me ' chancellor osborne , pictured campaigning in brentford this morning , and the home secretary theresa may were named by the prime minister as potential successors cameron 's 11 - year - old daughter regularly teases him for leaving her in the pub , his wife samantha has revealed
mr cameron 's admission that the london mayor is lining up a tilt at the tory leadership comes after mr johnson was accused of ' breath - taking cheek ' after he set out his vision of ' moral purpose ' in business and politics
the comments by mr johnson , who is standing to be a tory mp in a west london constituency , were seen as an attempt to position himself as a future party leader
in 2004 , mr johnson admitted a four - year affair with the journalist petronella wyatt while he was married to his second wife marina , with whom he has four children
