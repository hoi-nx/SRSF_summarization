the parents of a terminally ill boy have fulfilled his dying wish by getting married at his bedside in hospital
corey , from teignmouth , devon more than anything wanted to see his parents craig , 28 , and jemma , 21 , tie the knot
the five - year - old was diagnosed with a complex congenital heart defect at the age of seven months and since then has undergone eight open - heart operations and other treatments
jemma and craig edwards listen to their wedding vows during their marriage at bristol children 's hospital corey ' job was to hold the rings for his parents during the marriage ceremony the five - year - old is suffering from a terminal congenital heart defect and had often asked his parents why they were not married corey has been on the paediatric intensive care unit at bristol children 's hospital since january and when doctors gave his parents the devastating news that he may not live much longer , mr and mrs edwards decided to get married
they had been engaged for three years but plans to tie the knot were put on hold due to the birth of their daughters , two - year - old isabelle and six - month - old caitlyn , and corey 's ill health
when they learnt of their son 's wish , they felt there was no time like the present and , with the help of staff and friends made at the hospital , they were able to organise the whole service within 48 hours
they made history when they became the first couple to marry at the hospital but had to get special permission from the archbishop of canterbury
but a law dating back to henry viii gives the archbishop of canterbury special dispensation to allow weddings in hospital for ' pastoral reasons '
' when we knew corey 's wishes , everyone on the paediatric intensive care unit and ward 32 , including staff and friends , got together to help us
the edwards had been engaged for three years but decided to fast track their wedding when they discovered their son corey may not live much longer ' we both planned to get married years ago but decided we would n't get married without corey there , so the only way we could do it was in hospital
' the bishop of bristol had to write to the archbishop of canterbury to get special permission for us to marry in the hospital and we are so grateful he agreed
one nurse helped to do jemma 's hair , whilst another two members of staff made the cake and iced it
' getting married is usually the bride and groom 's special day , which it was , but it 's more corey 's special day because he is such a special boy
' it was nice to share our special day with the people who have helped us enjoy corey 's short life
' william booth , the paediatric intensive care unit matron , said : ' it was a privilege to share craig and jemma 's special day with their children corey , isabelle and caitlyn , family and friends
' lots of the nursing and medical teams involved in corey 's care came in over the easter break to share this special occasion with them all
across the back is their mother jemma , reverend stephen oram and their father craig edwards rev oram said : ' henry viii gave the then archbishop of canterbury this special power to by - pass the law
' the newlyweds spent their wedding night at their son 's bedside and later returned to the ronald mcdonald house where they are staying whilst corey is in hospital
