manchester city boss manuel pellegrini believes the club may need to splash out again this summer to keep pace with their rivals
with hopes of retaining the premier league crown looking increasingly forlorn , manchester city have again failed to build on a title success
manchester city manager manuel pellegrini insists his side must splash the cash in the summer manuel pellegrini has said manchester city must sign a ' crack ' player such as striker sergio aguero manchester city are currently fourth in the premier league a return to the heavy spending of the era immediately after sheikh mansour 's 2008 takeover is clearly not an option , for fear of invoking even tougher sanctions , but manuel pellegrini has warned they can not stay idle
manuel pellegrini recently spoke of a need to sign a ' crack ' player - in other words a superstar of the calibre of striker sergio aguero - and has now suggested this summer is the time to do it
the chilean , whose side have slipped to fourth place ahead of monday 's trip to crystal palace , said : ' well , it is just the way of thinking , that big teams need to sign a big player
' given the general disappointments of last summer 's principle signings - fernando , bacary sagna and eliaquim mangala - manuel pellegrini 's words could be perceived as a plea for more cash
manuel pellegrini still believes his manchester city side are capable of retaining the premier legaue title he said : ' i do n't want to talk about ( plans ) for next season because we have to finish this season
results elsewhere have seen manchester city drop two places over the weekend and , although manuel pellegrini has not given up on the title , he clearly can not even take the runners - up spot for granted
