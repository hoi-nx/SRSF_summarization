lucy , the oldest and most complete fossil of an early human ever found , still has a few secrets to reveal
a new look at the ancient hominin 's skeleton suggests one of the vertebrae bones may belong to a baboon despite being uncovered 40 years ago , lucy is still being studied to learn more about our ancestors
currently , more than 300 individuals of this species , which lived between about 3.85 million and 2.95 million years ago , have been uncovered the strange discovery of a baboon bone was made when gary sawyer and mike at the american museum of natural history in new york began work on a reconstruction of lucy 's skeleton ( right ) the strange discovery of a baboon bone was made when gary sawyer and mike at the american museum of natural history in new york began work on a reconstruction of lucy 's skeleton
' mike pointed out that one of the [ vertebra ] fragments , which no one , including me , had really paid close attention to , looked fairly small to fit with the rest of lucy 's vertebral column , ' williams at new york university told the new scientist
the researchers thought one possible explanation was that the fragment was missed up with another , younger member of lucy 's species
the researchers analysed 11 rock samples from around the nearly complete little foot fossil skeleton from thesterkfontein caves to gauge its age scientists have revealed a sophisticated new dating technique shows that little foot , an important fossil of an early human forerunner unearthed in the 1990s in south africa , is roughly 3.7 million years old
the team then compared it to the vertebrae of other creatures living in that region 3.2 million years ago , and found a baboon bone was the closest fit
williams told new scientist that the fossil of a gelada baboon thoracic vertebra must have somehow been mixed up with lucy 's remains
our genus was predated by other species on the human family tree including various representatives of lucy 's genus australopithecus
' even if one fragment of a bone from the spine turns out to be from a baboon it does not alter the larger picture of what lucy brings to the story of human evolution
