note to all managers : if you âre top striker is misfiring , have a word with sherwood
sherwood , albeit for a short period of time , revived emmanuel adebayor âs flagging tottenham career last season ; now he âs replicating the achievement with christian benteke
christian benteke heads villa into the lead against tottenham in the 35th minute of the game christian benteke celebrates the goal that gave sherwood 's team the advantage at the end of the first half christian benteke continued his fine form for villa from tuesday , where he scored a hat - trick in the 3 - 3 draw with qpr christian benteke ( second left ) is mobbed by his villa team - mates after scoring the opening goal against tottenham christian benteke points to the sky as he led the villa attack against tottenham in the premier league his success in rejuvenating christian benteke , who has scored six goals in eight games , will be viewed as , perhaps , sherwood âs most vital contribution if villa win their premier league survival battle
â it âs about strikers applying themselves , â said the villa boss , fresh from his side âs victory over former club tottenham
â like ade , when i gave ade an opportunity to come back into the group at tottenham , he had to earn the right and he did that by the way he trained
villa ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : guzan 7.5 ; bacuna 7.5 , clark 6 ( baker 18 , 7.5 ) , vlaar 8 , richardson 7 ; sanchez 7 , cleverley 7 , delph 8 ; agbonlahor 7 ( cole 70 , 6.5 ) , christian benteke 8.5 , grealish 7 ( weimann 63 , 6.5 )
stat : since sherwood took over at villa striker christan benteke is the premier league âs top goalscorer
in addition to turning emmanuel adebayor and christian benteke back into premier league forces he âs brought his fearless approach to blooding youth players with him to villa park
where would the careers of tottenham pair harry kane and nabil bentaleb be without sherwood âs guidance last season ? and we saw further evidence of the manager âs youth - minded attitude as he handed jack grealish , 19 , only his second villa start at a white hart lane on saturday
villa manager sherwood was visibly ecstatic at recording the win and getting three points upon the final whistle sherwood said : â we âve got good young players coming through at villa
sherwood handed 19 - year - old jack grealish ( left ) only his second villa start at a white hart lane on saturday â he âs got a big future at this football club
you go to tottenham or come to villa
