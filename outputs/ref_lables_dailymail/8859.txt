from the lack of sleep to breastfeeding , becoming a mother for the first time is no mean feat. one new mother decided to start a blog called upfront mama detailing the trials and tribulations of raising her little girl poppy , 14 months , who , she says , is the best and most life changing thing that has ever happened to her
like so many new mothers , nicola bonn , 34 , from london was learning on the job and found the whole experience ' exciting yet utterly petrifying '
one of her blog posts , why we need to stop justifying ourselves , went viral - no doubt thanks to her candid account of bringing up a baby for the first time
here , she shares it with femail ... ' since becoming a mama i âve spent way too much time explaining myself and almost apologising for my decisions and i âve decided that it has to stop

nicola bonn , 34 , wanted to share all the things that she had learnt so that fellow mothers would nât feel as ' clueless ' as she did , and admits that since becoming a mother , she 's spent way too much time explaining herself and almost apologising for her decisions - and she 's decided that it has to stop she believes one of the main hurdles is that everyone has an opinion and they 're often not afraid to air it , which

nicola bonn says that the next time women feel judged for a decision that they have made concerning their child , they should n't explain themselves because , after all , they know their child better than anyone else does ' i âm the first person to ask for advice when i need it and i often do
