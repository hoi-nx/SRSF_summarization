ed miliband this morning launched a furious attack on david cameron and other eu leaders for leaving refugees to drown by stopping search and rescue missions in the mediterranean
the labour leader said it was unacceptable to abandon thousands of immigrants boarding makeshift boats in africa in the hope of making it to europe
he also called on the uk to take a ' fare share ' of refugees fleeing civil war
mr ed miliband 's remarks came amid growing alarm over the number of desperate families risking their lives to escape the raging civil wars in the middle east and africa
speaking in manchester this morning , mr ed miliband attacked the decision to abandon europe rescue missions
' mr ed miliband said : ' the logic is we are leaving people to die because it is a pull factor
' earlier , he said : ' we can not stand by as people drown in europe waters simply to escape conflict in libyan and syrian
if i was prime minister , i would be working with other europe leaders to act
' local residents and rescue workers help a migrant woman after a boat carrying migrants sank off the island of rhodes , southeastern greek , yesterday around 1,300 people are believed to have drowned in the past two weeks while trying to reach europe in boats launched from libyan but senior conservative minister william hague insisted that the rescue missions had not helped
tunisian mohammed ali malek , 27 , was arrested when in sicily last night some 24 hours after his overcrowded boat capsized in the mediterranean killing hundreds of migrants he added on bbc radio 5live : ' let me remind you of something as well , which is that when colonel gaddafi was still in power , there were periods when he simply allowed people to do exactly this , to get into boats and try to go to europe â that was one of the ways in which he put pressure on europe
' the deputy prime minister , nick clegg , said the priority for stopping the migrant crisis had to be to stop people boarding boats rather than stepping up patrols in the mediterranean
' and i think if we can do [ tackle ] that and provide more aid and assistance in africa to encourage people to stay put rather than risk life and limb moving great distances , that it seems to me is a more sustainable solution than coming up with lots of arbitrary numbers about who takes in which number of migrants from africa
