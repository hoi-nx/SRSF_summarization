settling down to a glass of wine and a naughty snack is the ultimate after work treat for many of us
a riesling is the perfect companion to a sausage roll , chardonnay goes great with wasabi peas or pittas and hummus , and merlot is the best glass to compliment a box of chocolates
they even found that different wines match different pizza toppings - with shiraz best for a margherita but a meaty cabernet sauvignon with a pepperoni
meanwhile , sauvignon blanc was found to be the perfect pairing for salted popcorn and a scotch egg goes down a treat with a drop of fiano
the next time you order a cheese and tomato pizza , opt for a spicy shiraz as its spicy fruit flavours can stand up to the strong aromatic herbs , tangy tomato sauce and salty cheese they found sausage rolls are paired perfectly with the riesling due to the ' buttery pastry and rich pork balancing the lime and green apple flavours of the wine '
for pizza , the toppings make a difference to the choice of wine , with a margherita matched with shiraz , thanks to its ' spicy fruit flavours standing up well ' to the herbs , tomato sauce and cheese topping
but if you opt for a pepperoni pizza , you should serve it with a cabernet sauvignon thanks to the ' meaty wine going great with the aniseed kick of the pepperoni '
for scotch eggs , a fiano complimented the flavours well and for salt and vinegar crisps , a shiraz rose was found to be the best match
' britons told us they wanted to know about the best wines to go with snacks like wasabi peas , popcorn and chocolate as well as old favourites like pizza

sausage roll wine match : riesling why it works : the butteriness in the pastry and the richness of the pork is great with the slight acid from lime and green apple in the riseling
chocolate wine match : merlot why it works : the softness of the tannins and slight sweet fruit in the back matches really nicely with rich chocolate salted popcorn wine match : sauvignon blanc why it works : the slightly herbaceous , grassy flavours of the sauv blanc match the salty flavours of the pork scratchings gourmet scotch egg wine match : fiano why it works : the fresh flavours of lemongrass and apricot balance well with the hearty and meaty texture of the scotch egg
