an ancient buddhist meditation practice could be as effective as modern drugs at beating depression , new research suggests
a study published in the lancetfound mindfulness - based cognitive therapy ( mbct ) led to similar outcomes as antidepressants when treating the mental disorder
mindfulness - which teaches people to focus on the present moment â is a growing movement based on ancient eastern traditions of meditation
over two years , relapse rates were 44 per cent in the mbct group compared to 47 per cent in the medication group
this suggests it offers an ' alternative treatment ' for those averse to the idea of taking drugs , said the researchers
a course of mbct treatment typically lasts for eight weeks and mainly relies on meditation but also includes cognitive behaviour therapy and yoga
' the first study of its kind discovered mbct is n't more effective than antidepressants but could offer similar protection - with no significant difference in cost
inspired by ancient buddhist meditation , mindfulness courses were developed in the late 1970s by us doctors to combat stress
' mbct was developed to help people who have experienced repeated bouts of depression by teaching them the skills to recognise and respond constructively to the thoughts and feelings associated with relapse - thereby preventing a downward spiral
the mbct course consists of guided mindfulness practices , group discussion and other cognitive behavioural exercises
professor sarah byford , of king 's college london , said : ' as a group intervention mindfulness - based cognitive therapy was relatively low cost compared to therapies provided on an individual basis
an mbct course could be offered as an alternative to drugs ' in terms of the cost of all health and social care services used by participants during the study - we found no significant difference between the two treatments
' professor kuyken added that although the mbct doid not work any better than anti-depressants , the results suggest a ' new choice ' for the millions of people with recurrent depression on repeat prescriptions
