no other scoreline could have emphasised how seriously this new arsenal team are taking their prospects of winning major trophies again
' one - nil to the arsenal ' used to be commonplace before wenger arrived and made everything more exciting , and you sensed the class of 2015 quite enjoyed travelling north and nicking the narrowest of victories at burnley with a first - half goal from aaron ramsey
it was arsenal 's eighth win in a row , their best run since the invincibles team in 2004 , and kept the pressure on chelsea , who they meet in their next league game at the emirates
only once before this season have arsenal won 1 - 0 but striker olivier giroud feels the hard - fought victory proved there is more to this current wenger team than pass - pass - pass and dissolve when the going gets tough
olivier giroud wants arsenal to continue their premier league winning streak and challenge for the title ' you ca n't play your best football every game
we tried to be focused on not conceding and it 's one more clean sheet , ' olivier giroud said proudly
' if we had been told we would win this game 1 - 0 i would have signed for it straight away
burnley played really tough against us
' aaron ramsey 's 12th - minute strike was enough for arsenal to earn a 1 - 0 victory over burnley on saturday the win was arsenal 's eighth in a row and they kept up the pressure on premier league leaders chelsea if arsenal manage that , jose mourinho might have a far tighter finish to the title race than he could have anticipated a couple of months ago
wenger has even found his own claude makelele in 23 - year - old frenchman francis coquelin who sat in front of the back - four and kept burnley 's chances to a minimum on saturday
wenger 's side face chelsea in their next home game and have an fa cup semi-final to look forward to even if they ca n't catch chelsea this time they will fancy a proper tilt at the premier league next season and by then they might be back - to - back fa cup winners
' francis coquelin was praised for his performance in midfield with thierry henry calling him ' the detective ' 360 - days since arsenal 's last 1 - 0 away win in the premier league
the arsenal manager is playing down chances of overtaking chelsea : ' we have to be perfect ' â but the emirates will still be buzzing in a fortnight when the top two clash
for burnley , it will be matches against hull city , leicester city and aston villa in the next five weeks that determine their premier league survival prospects rather than this result
