who can resist boden âs bright knits and floral prints ? i most certainly ca nât writes clare
well , not when it comes to my seven - year - old , ella , anyway
for years , i âve happily forked out on pricey but irresistibly cute items for her from boden
but when it comes to buying clothes from boden for myself , i âve always steered clear
their traditional and instantly recognisable staples of cotton shifts and â mumsy â jersey dresses , not to mention â jaunty â prints in eye - catching colours , have always been a big no - no for me
clare ( pictured ) admits that she will sometimes fork out for boden 's brightly printed clothes for her daughter but not herself as she does n't want to be labelled a boden ' yummy mummy ' who wants to be labelled a boden â yummy mummy â at 50 paces , and bump into countless other mothers in identical uniforms on the school - run ? for many years , boden â which launched in 1991 â made a success of its appeal to the â sloane â market
but recently , the company has experienced more challenging times
profits plummeted 42 per cent in 2011 and , while they rose again in 2012 , they remained flat for 2013
now , however , boden seems to have finally cracked it , and the fashion world is raving about their latest collections
glossy magazines have praised their spring / summer shoe range for its nods to designer brands
so , can this latest collection keep its core , middle - class customers happy , while appealing to the more fashionable woman ? with the mid-season sale now on , i tried a selection of their latest outfits to see whether this boden sceptic could be persuaded
top trousers colour - block coat , was Â£ 179 , now Â£ 107.40 ; jumper , was Â£ 89 , now Â£ 53.40 ; trousers , were Â£ 69 , now Â£ 48.30 ; suede - heeled sandals , Â£ 119 ( all boden.co.uk ) i usually avoid boden , fearing it will make me look frumpy
3/5 fab ... if i was 20 ! dress , was Â£ 199 , now Â£ 119.40 ; mules , were Â£ 119 , now Â£ 89.25 at first glance , this dress looks like classic â yummy mummy â boden
that âs not because the dress is dowdy , but because it âs too fashion - forward â and i âm too old to be wearing it
it âs hard to work out if this is a miss by boden , or the company taking aim at a younger crowd
the mules are very on - trend , though , and , with their teetering heel , far from the sensible - heeled shoes i associate with boden
2/5 perky print geometric print dress , was Â£ 99 , now Â£ 69.30 ; suede t - bar heels with green tassels , Â£ 119 this purple and tangerine geometric shift is a world away from boden âs usual floral prints
3/5 fifties wonder floral dress , was Â£ 139 , now Â£ 97.30 ; mules , were Â£ 119 , now Â£ 89.25 on first sight , this look screams old - style boden â a cotton shift dress in a flower print
5/5 slimming skirt cashmere jumper , was Â£ 99 , now Â£ 49.50 ; print pencil skirt , was Â£ 89 , now Â£ 62.30 ; suede - heeled sandals , were Â£ 119 , now Â£ 95.20 i would never have guessed this pink and green , diamond - print , cotton pencil skirt was from boden
but will i look like a mumsy frump ? while the skirt is in a traditional floral print , it âs not made from plain cotton , as you might expect from boden , but has a gorgeous organza silk overlay , so it âs floaty and delicate
while the full skirt style is nât very slimming , it âs a fifties shape that âs right on trend and swishes nicely
the blouse is very similar to those made by chic french brand equipment , even down to the breast pocket detail
however , the slingback flats in a pretty aqua are very fashion - forward â designers ranging from jimmy choo to antonio berardi have brought out pointed , flat slingbacks this season
2/5 so , am i convinced ? ok , there âs a lot that will keep faithful boden fans happy , but i âve been reassured there are enough new pieces to make even sceptics like me look past its mumsy bright prints
they âve definitely persuaded me to put in an order .
