researchers at joint base lewis-mcchord in tacoma , washington , concluded that military suicides may be more likely after members leave the service than during active duty deployment , particularly if their time in uniform is brief
new study : researchers at joint base lewis-mcchord looked at military records of 3.9million personnel who served after 9/11 and found no direct link between deployment to a war zone and elevated suicide rates matter of honor : service members with a dishonorable discharge were about twice as likely to commit suicide as those who had an honorable separation the four - year study , the largest of its kind , was published wednesday in the journal of american medicine association psychiatry
in 2012 , pentagon reported 320 suicides by active - duty service members ; another 268 soldiers took their lives last year
to understand the relationship between deployment and self - inflicted death , researchers reviewed military records for more than 3.9million active - duty soldiers and reservists who joined up between october 7 , 2001 and december 31 , 2007
a total of 31,962 deaths occurred , including 5,041 suicides , by december 31 , 2009
there were 1,162 suicides among those who deployed and 3,879 among those who did n't , representing suicide rates per 100,000 person - years of 18.86 and 17.78 , respectively
service members with a dishonorable discharge were about twice as likely to commit suicide as those who had an honorable separation
â this is the first time such a huge , comprehensive study has found an increased suicide risk among those who have separated from service , particularly if they served for less than four years or had an other than honorable discharge , â said rajeev ramchand , a researcher in military mental health and suicide prevention at rand corporation who was n't involved in the study
â leaving the military significantly increased suicide risk , and those who left after just one year were most vulnerable some service members who leave the military early may have had risk factors for suicide such as mood disorders or substance abuse problems that contributed to their separation , particularly if they had a dishonorable discharge , said dr. moutier , chief medical officer of the american foundation for suicide prevention
