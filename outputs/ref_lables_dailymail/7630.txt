heavy - duty : the drill that was used by thieves during the brazen Â£ 60million hatton garden heist this is the drill that was used by thieves during the Â£ 60million hatton garden heist over the easter weekend
the gang used the power tool to cut through the wall of the secured vault where they raided 72 security boxes before escaping with wheelie bins full of precious gems
the photograph of the hilti dd350 drill was released tonight by scotland yard as the officer in charge of the investigation said the crime had been carried out by an ' ocean 's 11 type team '
police are offering a Â£ 20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those involved in the raid
they used the drill to cut through a concrete wall into the bank 's strongroom , where they ransacked security vaults
but , amazingly , the hole used by the gang was just 45cm wide and 25cm high - meaning they would have had something of a squeeze to muscle their way into the basement
safety deposit boxes were strewn across the floor while power tools - including the heavy duty hilti dd350 used to access the vaults - were discarded nearby
scotland yard also described how there was rubbish covering the hatton garden basement , while the wrought - iron cage door had been broken down
an angle grinder , concrete drills and crowbars were found amid the security boxes
breaking in : the gang used the power tool to cut through the concrete wall of the secured vault , pictured caught on cctv : scotland yard previously released several images of the gang as they entered the premises reward : police are offering a Â£ 20k reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminal unaware : the men had their faces covered , but sources have suggested they were not aware of the camera they then opened shutter doors into the basement , before boring holes into the basement wall
' we may well be misled - this is carried out by an almost ocean 's 11 type team , but in essence there are victims behind this and these are callous thieves
' destruction : dramatic pictures released yesterday show the scenes of chaos found by detectives when they arrived at the crime scene in london , where burglars had strewn safety deposit boxes across the floor covered in dust and debris : left , the forced door to the vault and , right , the mess left in the corridor inside knowledge : the gang managed to access the security boxes without damaging the vault door , pictured carefully planned : officers said there was no sign of forced entry to the building and that the thieves had disabled the communal lift on the second floor and then used the lift shaft ( pictured ) to climb down peter kirkham , a former dci with the met police who worked for the flying squad for five years in the mid- 90s , said police photos of the scene supported his belief that the heist was an inside job
friday , april 3 : police have found no signs of forced entry at the premises , but an intruder alarm sounded at the safety deposit business in the basement at 00:21
saturday , april 4 , sunday april 5 and monday , april 6 : the exact time of the raid has not been confirmed , but given the amount of time it would have taken to drill through the concrete wall and opened 70 safety deposit boxes , it is thought to have taken many hours
' releasing the scene images yesterday , scotland yard said forensics had finished examining the scene and that it had taken a ' significant amount of time '
