chokal-ingam claims that he posed as a black man while he applied to medical schools in 1998 because he believed he had a better chance of gaining acceptance the older brother of comedienne mindy kaling has controversially claimed he was only accepted into medical school in the late 1990s because he posed as a black man
writing on his blog , almost black , chokal-ingam says that he felt he had to change his appearance to get into the st. louis university school of medicine and heavily attacks affirmative action policies in the american
' i was determined to become a doctor and i knew that admission standards for certain minorities under affirmative action were , let 's say â¦ less stringent ? ' wrote chokal-ingam
' i got into medical school because i said i was black
he claims in 1998 he shaved his head , trimmed his ' long indian eyelashes ' and joined the organization of black students during the process
' chokal-ingam the indian - american frat boy became jojo the african american affirmative action applicant to medical school , ' he said , claiming that jojo was the middle name he was born with
though his website , almostblack.com , shows side - by - side qualifications and pictures of chokal-ingam as an indian - american man ( left ) and a black man ( right ) , he does n't specify if he went through the same application process as an inidan - american man as he did a black man as an indian-american with a gpa of 3.1 , mcat of 31 and a member of the south asian student association , he did n't think he 'd get into medical school , but with a change of appearance and switch of student organization , he thought he could get in to some of the top schools in the nation
' in all , i interviewed at eleven prestigious medical schools in 9 major cities across american , while posing a black man , ' he added
despite his startling claims , chokal-ingam fails to mention if he applied to the same schools at the same time as an indian - american man
when he was finally accepted to st. louis university school of medicine , he used the acceptance to claim he was only granted admission because he was black and used the situation as an example of what was ' wrong ' with affirmative action
what started as a devious ploy to gain admission to medical school turned into a twisted social experiment
' it 's easier for him to tap dance for the right wing as the brown man who ' gets it ' , while conveniently missing how ongoing racism makes affirmative action absolutely necessary , ' he added
and though he claims he became a serious contender at schools across the nation as a black man , he does n't specify if he went through the application process as an american - indian man
' chokal-ingam seems to have assumed that he would 've gotten nowhere as an indian american applicant and dove head first into this poorly - conceived ' experiment ' before determining otherwise , ' williams wrote
