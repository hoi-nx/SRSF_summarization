comcast is abandoning its bid to buy time warner cable for $ 45.2billion and create a mega-size tv and internet provider , it was reported today
the move comes after fcc decided that merger was n't in the public interest and threw up a regulatory roadblock following fierce opposition from net neutrality activists and content providers like disney and 21st century fox
bloomberg , followed by the new york times , reported thursday afternoon that comcast is planning to ' walk away ' from the deal rather than fight it out with the federal government
comcast and time warner cable declined to comment on thursday
the new company would have spun off or sold 3.9million customers the proposed merger would have controlled 57percent of the broadband internet market and 30 percent of the paid tv market with more than 27million customers across the nation
on wednesday night , the wall street journal revealed that fcc regulators questioned whether the creation of mega-size tv and internet provider was in the public interest
staffers reportedly planned to recommend that an administrative law judge review the deal - a regulatory obstacle that is likely to cost both companies several months of hearings and many millions of dollars
time warner cable 's shares dipped slightly in trading on thursday - though comcast stocks were actually up after the news ' this is one of those deals where the opponents of the merger have been one of the most vocal i can remember , ' said s&p capital iq tuna amobi
the company says it has , except for one circumstance when the fcc found it was n't promoting a stand - alone internet service
al franken , d-minn. , along with five other democratic senators and bernie sanders , i - vermont , this week urged the fcc and the justice department to block the merger , saying it would lead to higher prices and fewer choices
the wall street journal on wednesday said , also citing unidentified people , said that fcc staff recommended that the merger review go to a hearing under an administrative law judge , although no final decision had been made
the fcc would send the deal to a judge if it did n't believe it serves the public interest
' it 's a dead end for comcast , ' said mcdowell , a former fcc commissioner
comcast spokeswoman sena fitzmaurice confirmed that company executives met wednesday with justice department and fcc officials
if the comcast - time warner cable deal falls through , a transaction with charter aimed to smoothing the way for regulatory approval also falls apart
many analysts expect that charter , which lost out on its bid for time warner cable to comcast , to resurrect its effort if comcast is rebuffed
there ' seems to be an antipathy towards comcast at the fcc ' because the agency thinks comcast did n't stick to the conditions of the nbcuniversal merger , he said
comcast wanted time warner cable to bulk up on subscribers as it deals with old rivals dish , directv and verizon 's fios , as well as newer , cheaper online competitors like netflix
