patients who are too fat could be denied routine operations to save money , a survey of health bosses has revealed
more than a third of nhs trusts are considering rationing some types of surgery and other treatments
several have admitted they may impose ' eligibility ' rules which could affect smokers as well as the overweight
more than a third of health trusts are considering rationing some types of surgery and other treatments to save money , according to a new study the criteria for accepting patients for operations would be based on their bmi , which measures obesity
when senior managers at 67 ccg â local health trusts â were asked , 39 per cent said they were planning to ' limit access ' to routine treatment for financial reasons
procedures affected include varicose vein treatment , hip and knee replacement , and breast reduction surgery
others said smokers might be denied some treatments , most commonly ivf
senior doctors criticised the plans and accused health managers of denying patients vital treatment simply because they were considered to be ' undeserving '
dr david paynton , of the royal college of gps , said : ' decisions about whether our patients are eligible for surgery or treatment need to be made on a case - by - case basis and by whether surgery will benefit a patient 's long - term physical and mental health
' it should not be the role of ccgs to impose blanket bans on patients ' access to surgery , nor to decide who is and who is not deserving of potentially life - saving treatments based on their lifestyle choices
obese patients could be denied varicose vein treatment , hip and knee replacement , pictured , and breast reduction surgery , while smokers could be banned from having ivf on the nhs ' of course , some procedures can not be performed on patients who are above a certain weight
' in these cases , a clinical decision needs to be made about whether surgery would be beneficial if the patient lost weight â but this is a separate issue
' a conservative party spokesman said : ' if health bodies stop patients from having treatments on the basis of cost alone , then we will take action against them
a survey by gp magazine last month found that 80 per cent of ccgs ration at least one procedure to patients who are very obese
