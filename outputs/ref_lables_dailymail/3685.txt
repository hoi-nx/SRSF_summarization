when the first ipad launched on 3 april 2010 , opinion was split on how popular the product would turn out to be , and whether the tablet market would grow
now five years - and 225 million sales - later it might be natural to presume that those who doubted the device have been proved wrong
but amid falling sales and a new generation of alternative devices , some industry experts have predicted that the ipad âs days are numbered
five years and 225 million units later , it seems many critics have been proved wrong - for now when steve jobs revealed the original ipad in california in early 2010 , it was met with derision by many technology experts , who failed to see how such a product would prove popular
within the first 24 hours of apple 's launch the company sold 300,000 units , and to date , nine incarnations of the ipad have gone on sale , with the air 2 and mini being the most recent
1st generation : 3 april 2010 2 * : 11 march 2011 3rd generation : 16 march 2012 4th generation : 2 november 2012 mini 1st generation : 2 november 2012 air : 1 november 2013 mini 2 : 12 november 2013 air 2 : 22 october 2014 mini 3 : 22 october 2014 * note : the ipad 2 was the only ipad that had a number after its name ( aside from the air and mini )
considering , at the time in 2010 , smartphones were still by and large finding their feet , the ipad filled a gap in the market that many thought simply was nât there
launches of apple products are often greeted by swathes of adoring fans - and that was none more obvious than with the launch of the original ipad

according to cnn money , sales for the ipad dropped 18 per cent in the final quarter of 2014 alone
â apple 's ipad has widely been heralded as kickstarting the tablet industry , creating a huge new market between smartphones and laptops - and seeing many copycat devices made in the process â there are still flashes of life in the ipad , â martyn landi , press association technology correspondent , told mailonline
â it âs still the fastest selling product in apple history with more than a quarter of a billion sold in five years - and that 's quite something up against the iphone and ipod
â ipad numbers were always going to fall at some point because they had a huge market share to begin with - 75 per cent after the first year of ipad - and that was always unlikely to be sustainable once the competition got involved
the rise of new devices like the apple watch ( left ) and larger smartphones like the iphone 6 plus ( right ) mean the place for the ipad in today 's market is becoming less obvious â to some extent it âs apple âs own fault , â said phil morris , deputy editor for icreate magazine
â apple store staff in central sydney welcome the first shopper waiting in line , alex lee ( centre ) of canada , the moment apple 's ipad 2 became available for direct purchase in australia on 25 march 2011
hundreds of customers lined up outside apple stores for the launch - but will we see such numbers again ? with the release of smartphones with larger screens like the iphone 6 plus , and other devices like the apple watch , the place for the ipad today is becoming less obvious
