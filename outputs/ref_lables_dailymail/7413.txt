lord janner signed over the deeds of his Â£ 2million home to his children at the height of the police paedophile case against him
his flat , in a gated community near hampstead , north london , was transferred free of charge to his two daughters and son in march last year â the same month that police raided his westminster office , and three months after they had swooped on his home
victims and leading politicians accused director of public prosecutions alison saunders of â damaging public confidence â in the justice system with her ruling that lord janner âs dementia made him unfit to stand trial â despite a tide of evidence against the 86 - year - old
but his mental health did not seem to stand in the way of him signing legal documents to transfer ownership of the flat
last night , liz dux , a solicitor from slater and gordon representing several of the peer âs alleged victims , said : â they will be asking how a man who lacks the mental capacity to stand trial has sufficient capacity to give valid instructions to transfer his assets
â peter garsden , a solicitor representing two other alleged victims , said : â obviously it puts obstacles in the way â¦ there must be suspicions about the intention of the transfer
â lord lord janner âs duplex apartment over ground and basement floors , with private off - street parking , is likely to have been the peer âs most valuable asset
in 2013 , paedophile bbc presenter stuart hall signed over the deeds of his Â£ 2million house to his wife just before he was jailed â then offered those he had abused as little as Â£ 2,000 to prevent them claiming compensation

his flat had been owned solely by him since june 1988 , land registry documents show
police raided the property in december 2013 as part of operation enamel into historic claims he molested a string of youngsters
an alleged victim gave evidence to the police in 2002 but it was never passed to the cps
