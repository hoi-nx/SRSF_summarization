an elderly couple has spent four years living in the shadows after being forced to board up their windows because of constant anti-social behaviour
charles kingham , 86 , and partner moore , 68 , have been together for 40 years and bought their home in the quiet lincolnshire seaside resort of mablethorpe for Â£ 35,000 in 1987
they spent two years converting it into their dream home , but it became a ' living hell ' after it was converted into an integrated offender management centre , which deals with persistent criminals
mr charles kingham , who served in the merchant navy and ran his own timber company before retiring , said : ' the biggest fear for me is going to bed and wondering if we are going to wake up if something is thrown through the letter box
' ms moore claimed the problems started when people started selling drugs nearby and would walk up their garden path ' high '
incidents intensified when the couple reported anti-social behaviour in the area
they were targeted on an almost weekly basis , with vandals smashing windows with stones and pelting their home with eggs and golf balls
the thugs even splashed cooking fat across the walls and path , urinated on their flowers and keyed their car
at least they have each other : the couple have been together for 40 years despite ' misery ' caused by thugs every single window of their home has been smashed and the couple eventually got so sick of having to spend time and money replacing them that they took drastic measures
the pair spent Â£ 700 on wood and boarded up the house for protection
retired office worker ms moore sobbed : ' this house was a dream home but our life has been made a living hell
' when they were banging on the windows , charles kingham went down with a chest infection because of the stress
dark days : mr charles kingham has to perform normal daily tasks in constant gloom since boarding up his home ' the trouble started four years ago when the old lady who lived next door died and the house was turned into an integrated offender management centre
keen reader mr charles kingham ( left ) has been forced to read in a dark room since they boarded up the windows ( right ) ' in november there was a big party nearby and at 3am people were banging on our windows and shouting
' we 've had eggs and golf balls thrown at our bungalow and three of our windows are still chipped
' mr charles kingham added : ' we are compiling a full report of incidents against our home but i fear it wo n't make much difference
' lincolnshire police and east lindsey district council confirmed they were aware of the attacks on the couple 's home
' to date in this case , no offences have been identified but police and asb officers from east lindsey district council continue to offer support to ms moore and will investigate each reported allegation
