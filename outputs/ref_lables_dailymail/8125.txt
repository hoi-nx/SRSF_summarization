the large hadron collider was restarted today after being turned off for two years during a major renovation project that cost Â£ 100million
the world 's largest atom - smashing machine is most famous for proving the existence of the higgs boson - but scientists hope it will now unlock even more fundamental secrets of the universe
physicists at cern , the geneva - based organisation which runs the large hadron collider , are aiming to see dark matter for the first time ever thanks to the device 's upgrade
it was shut down two years ago - after confirming the discovery of the higgs boson - so that its energy levels could be almost doubled , allowing scientists to carry out more extreme experiments
the re-opening was delayed by another couple of weeks thanks to a short circuit in the system , but this morning it started operating again at last
ambition : scientists hope the machine will be able to detect and describe dark matter for the first time the large hadron collider , which cost nearly Â£ 4billion , is currently running at a low ' injection ' energy of 450 giga - electron volts ( tev ) , but in june it will increase to a record - breaking 13 tera - electron volts ( tev ) - up from 7 tev at the time it managed to detect the higgs boson in 2013
called ' dark matter ' , this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe
now the physicists operating the machine have their sights on dark matter , the invisible , undetectable material that makes up 84 per cent of matter in the universe and binds galaxies together yet whose nature is unknown
if they are able to detect and describe dark matter , it will mark a huge leap forward in our understanding of the universe
the search for dark matter involves moving beyond the standard model , the all - encompassing theory describing the particles and forces of nature that has stood firm for the past 50 years
inside : the large hadron collider consists of an enormous circular tunnel which is nearly 17 miles long a ' new physics ' model of the universe called supersymmetry predicts that every known particle has a more massive partner - and one of these elusive supersymmetry particles might be the source of dark matter
the large hadron collider 's operating again for the first time in two years and that 's a really important milestone in physics
' you can think of the large hadron collider as the world 's greatest microscope looking into the heart of matter
' it would be absolutely lovely to find a candidate for dark matter
' as well as dark matter , the team is hoping to discover more higgs bosons and other ' exotic particles ' which have never been detected before
but the standard model does not explain dark matter , which is believed to make up most of the universe , nor dark energy , a mysterious force driving the galaxies ever further apart
the large hadron collider might be able to produce dark matter particles for example , which would be glimpsed in the debris of collisions detected by the atlas and cms experiments
' the upgraded large hadron collider will allow us to probe further than ever before , and to explore brand new scientific territory such as dark matter
