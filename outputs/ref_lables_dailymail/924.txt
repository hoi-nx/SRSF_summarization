when ben stokes first turned up at the kensington oval this week someone would have said : â mind that locker , stokesey
â it was here , of course , that ben stokes broke his wrist punching a locker after being dismissed last year and that will be a reminder to him of the need to channel his aggression in the right way now he is back in the england team
ben stokes has forged a reputation as a fiery character in the england cricket team ben stokes ( left ) clashed with marlon samuels during the second test between west indies and england but ben stokes ( right ) responded positively to the row after talking to england coach peter moores only a slight niggle in his back might stop stokes playing here in barbados and i am glad he has fought his way back after what has been a year of ups and downs
peter moores , england âs coach , dragged him to one side after his clash with marlon samuels in the second test and had a long chat with him and if it was to talk about how he should respond then the advice he gave was clearly right
england must make sure they do not quash that natural exuberance and desire to take someone on
what ben stokes must not do is try to live up to his reputation and become pigeon - holed
ben stokes ( second left ) can use his aggression to bring runs and wickets to the england team ben stokes ( left ) congratulates england captain alastair cook after the side won the second test england want to have ben stokes in the team as much as possible to help him hit his full potential let him go a bit but rein him in occasionally
there is an argument here to play the second spinner in adil rashid and if england went down that route in bridgetown the place of ben stokes or chris jordan would come into question but they clearly want both to play as much as possible
