' ms louise nesbitt - who had employed at dragon mountain gold since 2004 - was fired five days after the incident , with her employer saying it was due to ' gross misconduct '
' on the evidence , i am not persuaded that when ms louise nesbitt referred to mr gardner as " a complete d * * * " , it was her sense of humour to exaggerate or , that it was " light - hearted insult " or it should be read in the context of the person it was meant for , ' commissioner dj cloghan said
' it was far from a " light - hearted insult " , it was a hurtful and unpleasant appraisal of [ her employer ] , for whom she earned $ 95,000 per annum
