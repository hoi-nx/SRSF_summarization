the parents of young cancer sufferers now expect to be offered the same treatment as ashya , one of his doctors has said
doctors and nurses who treated ashya have criticised his parents while speaking out for the first time in a bbc documentary
they ignored medical advice and took him to prague for proton beam therapy , ultimately paid for by the nhs after he left the uk
his parents brett , 51 , and naghmeh , 46 , wanted him to have cutting - edge proton beam therapy instead which is thought to be less harmful
the family then went to prague for proton beam therapy , and now say there is ' no evidence ' of a tumour a high court judge approved the move to take ashya to prague for proton beam therapy
the nhs later agreed to fund ashya âs treatment in prague
paediatric intensive care consultant dr peter wilson said it was ' deeply unfair when the nhs is supposed to be about equal healthcare for all â that he had to say no to parents wanting proton beam therapy for their children â at one stage , especially on the monday , our switchboard was basically shut because of the number of phone calls we were receiving ; the number of messages that were left ... vitriolic messages for everybody
â paediatric oncology consultant dr ramya ramanujachar , also involved in ashya âs treatment , warned the case could set a worrying precedent
