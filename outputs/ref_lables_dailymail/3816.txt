police are now urging witnesses of a middle - aged woman 's offensive public transport tirade at a muslim woman to come forward after daily mail australia published video of the incident
eden , 23 , stood up for the muslim woman and her partner after witnessing the ranter ' bullying ' the sydney commuter on an airport line train around 1:40pm on wednesday afternoon
ms eden switched on the video camera on her mobile phone to record the vile rant before rushing to muslim couple 's defence with a fiery spray notably absent any swearing

' ms eden said she became really upset after the woman allegedly branded ' all muslim isis supporters ' and insulted the woman 's husband and headscarf
what 's that got to do with this poor lady ? what 's that got to do with her ? ' ' she was saying some pretty horrible and hurtful things before i spoke up then as soon i started defending them she stopped ' the muslim couple told eden ( left , right ) that they were ' very grateful ' for her stand ' nothing , ' the ranter replied
ms eden then instructed the woman to be silent
' ms eden recorded a short snippet of the incident - not the whole alleged tirade - on her phone , ending with the passenger telling her to ' breathe '
she told daily mail australia the muslim couple and the angry woman alighted the train at airport
ms eden told daily mail australia the couple alighted the train at airport ' i missed my stop because i wanted to stay on and make sure they were ok , ' said ms eden , who was on her way home to mascot ' i missed my stop because i wanted to stay on and make sure they were ok , ' said ms eden , who was on her way home to mascot ' i missed my stop because i wanted to stay on and make sure they were ok , ' said ms eden , who was on her way home to mascot
