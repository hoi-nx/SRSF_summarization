traitor snowden has revealed he did not read all the top - secret intelligence documents he leaked â a move which put lives at risk from terrorists
in a television interview the fugitive squirmed as he admitted only â evaluating â the files stolen from gchq and the nsa
the former america spy also acknowledged there had been a â f * * * - up â when newspapers that were handed the classified material failed to redact sensitive details exposing operations against al qaeda
the 31 - year - old stunned the world in june 2013 â less than a month after the murder of lee rigby by islamic extremists â when he broke cover as the civilian cia worker who stole classified documents
but security chiefs have warned that secret techniques , revealed by snowden âs leaks to the guardian newspaper , have made it easier for terrorists and organised criminals to avoid detection
in sunday night âs interview with british tv host john oliver , for america channel hbo , snowden pointedly avoided saying he had read every document he handed over to journalists
at one point the british comedian asks snowden whether he had read all of the documents he sent to journalists
snowden admitted there had been a â f * * * - up â with the way in which some of the information about the nsa and gchq , british âs intelligence agency , had been released
snowden said such details should have been removed and , in a feeble attempt to defend his actions , added : â in journalism we have to accept that some mistakes will be made
â john oliver tries to get snowden to explain the leak in the context of nude pictures
the ex-cia systems administrator claims the government can see most of the pictures you share it is one of the few occasions in which snowden has been put on the spot over his treachery as he normally speaks only to left - wing media who have published his leaks
lord west , a former first sea lord and security minister , said : â since the revelations of the traitor snowden , terrorist groups have changed how they communicate and talk to each other
â robin simcox , of the henry jackson society security think - tank , said : â this is exactly the danger that those who believe snowden âs actions were hugely irresponsible â and potentially fatal â warned of
â this interview seemed to show how little snowden had thought about the potentially deadly consequences
snowden stole a huge amount of sensitive documents and as a result terrorists and other serious criminals have adapted their methods accordingly
â snowden handed an estimated 200,000 of the 1.7million stolen classified documents to journalists
â this is a transcript of snowden âs interview : john oliver : how many of those documents have you actually read ? snowden : i âve evaluated all of the documents that are in the archive
john oliver : you âve read every single one ? snowden : i do understand what i turned over
' these things happen ' : snowden , above , during his television interview john oliver : there âs a difference between understanding what âs in the documents and reading what âs in the documents
snowden : i recognize the concern
( laughter ) snowden : i think it âs fair to be concerned â did this person do enough , were they careful enough ? john oliver ( cuts in ) : especially when you âre handling material like we know you âre handling
gchq has lost track of some of british âs most dangerous criminals because of the way snowden exposed its operations
â snowden , who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in hawaii , tricked colleagues into handing over passwords so he could copy files in one of the biggest leaks in america history
he claims he had to act because the america government âs policies were a â threat to democracy â
how the guardian changed headline to protect its favourite ' whistleblower ' the left - wing guardian newspaper climbed into bed with snowden when he leaked the top - secret intelligence documents , publishing a string of damaging stories
and yesterday it was still giving the so - called whistleblower an easy ride when reporting on his clash with tv host john oliver on his america show last week tonight
the headline stated : â snowden tells john oliver he did not read all leaked nsa material
it was changed to : â john oliver presses snowden on whether he read all leaked nsa material
â the sub-heading was amended , to the softer : â hbo host posts uncomfortable questions to nsa whistleblower in interview in moscow
â a guardian spokesman said the headline was changed because â an earlier version stated that snowden admitted he had not read all the nsa documents he leaked
