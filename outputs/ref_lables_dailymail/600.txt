this gruesome video shows how a man popped a huge cyst in his arm with a needle , screwdriver and a pair of pliers
the man , known only as jason , from vancouver , uploaded the clip to youtube after his wife filmed the stomach - churning moment
it begins with him explaining exactly how he will pop the grape - sized growth on his wrist
he says : ' we have the pliers , they 're going to hold onto the needle which will then be smashed into my cyst with the end of a screwdriver
' the man , known only as jason , uploaded the video to youtube of his unique way of popping a cyst - using a needle , a pair of pliers and a screwdriver
pictured is his sister in law putting the needle into the swelling as jason 's sister in law hammers the needle deeper into the cyst with the handle of a screwdriver , he emits loud cries of pain first , he lays his left arm down on some kitchen roll on a table so the lump is easily accessible
his sister - in - law then inserts the needle into the cyst and holds it in place with a pair of pliers as he winces
she then begins the horrifying process of hammering the needle deeper into the growth
sharp cries of pain are heard from jason with each hit
astonishingly , though the process seems too agonising to bear , jason says : ' i think we can go a little deeper '
dr ghosh , a private gp in liverpool , condemned jason 's method of popping his cyst with a needle , pliers and a screwdriver
he told mailonline : ' we advise not draining minor ganglions
' it âs wrong to pop a ganglion with a needle and a screwdriver on so many levels
traditionally , ganglions would be ' bashed with the family bible ' , but doctors do not advise this ' from a hygiene point of view you âve got to sterilise your equipment
' that âs caused problems with the fluid going into the wrist joint , causing carpel tunnel syndrome : swelling inside the wrist
' if we did treat it , we âd do a needle aspiration , which means sucking out the glue - like pus
' if you have a ganglion or a swelling you must go to your gp and they will advise whether its ok or whether it âs best to be left alone
' moments later , he takes the needle out and asks the camera to zoom in on his arm
as he squeezes the cyst , sticky , translucent jelly comes rushing out and gathers in a pea - sized ball
unsurprisingly , medical professionals do not advise using jason 's method to treat lumps found on the body
dr ghosh , a private gp in liverpool , explains that jason 's cyst is a ganglion , a fluid - filled swelling that develops near a joint or a tendon
they are made up of a thick jelly - like fluid called synovial fluid , which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate them during movement - and occur when this fluid leaks out and collects under the skin
' a ganglion is a fluid - filled sack
' traditionally , ganglions were treated by being ' bashed with the family bible ' , but this is no longer recommended , as this could cause the fluid to disperse and cause carpel tunnel syndrome - a swelling in the wrist - he added
he told mailonline : ' it âs wrong to pop a ganglion with a needle and a screwdriver on so many levels
' he removes the needle and squeezes the cyst , and a ball of sticky , see - through jelly - like fluid emerges jason rubs his fingers together to show the sticky consistency of the fluid that comes out of the growth , which doctors explain is synovial fluid , which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate them at the end of the video , jason says the cyst will need draining again in three months
but doctors strongly advise against his method - and say ganglions do not normally require treatment if the cyst needs treatment , the fluid should be drained out with a needle and syringe by a doctor , or cut out in a surgical procedure
