neither of them , however , has quite solved the problem of bridging the final void , converting this prized talent into first - team footballers
terry was the last at chelsea , but one or two of this crop are considered to have a genuine chance and jose mourinho has promised 19 - year - old loftus-cheek his opportunity next season
' he will be a first - team player , absolutely ready to play and compete
but to have them all at the same time in the first - team squad is hard
' terry was the last truly successful youth product at chelsea and he has gone on to become captain terry celebrates after chelsea beat manchester united on saturday to tighten their grip on the title strikers brown , 18 , and solanke , 17 , are earmarked for big things , but loftus-cheek , at chelsea since the age of eight , has precisely what jose mourinho wants in his midfield
strikers brown , 18 , and solanke , 17 , are earmarked for big things after the european success loftus-cheek , at chelsea since the age of eight , has precisely what jose mourinho wants in his first - team midfield jose mourinho would like extra muscle in central midfield for the big games
paul pogba would strengthen jose mourinho 's team but what signal would that send to loftus-cheek , and the rest of those striving to graduate at cobham and the give the club something it craves ? the chelsea manager said : ' from that team that won the uefa youth league , four belong to my squad
four are my players , first - team players who train with the first - team every day and develop with the first - team
when they 're not selected with the first - team - and normally they 're not selected - they go back and play there
' their development is easier when they 're training every day with the first - team , doing pre-season , playing some matches , playing 20 minutes or half an hour in an fa cup match , capital one cup match , even a champions league match or in the league now and again
i ca n't have 10 of these young players in my squad but i can have three or four and we did that with loftus-cheek , brown , ( andreas ) christensen and ( nathan ) ake - and solanke a few times
chelsea are set to announce the Â£ 4.5million signing of brazilian wonderkid nathan as part of their recruitment tokyo forward yoshinori muto is another player chelsea are interested in but jose mourinho is not involved ' if the deal is close , i will try to help him , as i try to help everyone , to become a chelsea player
