one can only imagine the gloomy mood that must have collectively descended on the european tour 's headquarters at wentworth last week when reading about the acts of selflessness of the new masters champion , jordan spieth
shortly after being presented with the green jacket , the man who has rapidly become everyone 's favourite texan flew to new york and gave 25 interviews over the course of 24 hours
then , despite the obvious fatigue , he flew to south carolina to keep his promise to play the heritage tournament â his fourth event in a row â because , well , they were good to him on the way up and he wanted to pay them back

local favourite ian poulter , world no 3 henrik stenson and world no 10 sergio garcia have decided not to play
in the past all three have made no secret of the fact they do n't care for wentworth and all three have poor records in the event
but , equally , as jordan spieth at the age of just 21 is effortlessly showing , sometimes it 's simply about doing the right thing
yes , ian poulter and henrik stenson , in particular , can put forward persuasive cases as to how they do their bit for european golf
ian poulter is doing plenty behind the scenes to ensure the relaunched british masters at woburn in october will be a great success ; henrik stenson plays more tournaments round the world than any other top player and the nasty bout of flu that ruined his chance at the masters was a sure sign he needs to cut back
bmw pga championship have done a fabulous job with this tournament
