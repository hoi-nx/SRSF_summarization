at last , some good news for sunderland and newcastle â apparently form goes out of the window in a derby
it is little wonder they have billed this one â the desperation derby â
perhaps â the donkey derby â would be more apt. carver issues instructions to his players during training on friday ahead of sunday 's derby carver put his newcastle players through their paces during the session at st james ' park dick advocaat wraps up warm as he prepares his sunderland side for sunday 's crunch clash sunderland are the country âs most out - of - form side and , unless new boss dick advocaat can reverse what is a sorry slide towards the bottom three , they will be back in the championship come august
newcastle wo nât be , but therein lies the problem
the same can be said of a sunderland side who have won just four times all season
for sunderland , it is about survival
carver is fighting to secure his future as newcastle manager beyond the end of this season dick advocaat was all smiles as he attempts to steer sunderland clear of premier league relegation with trips to arsenal and chelsea to sign off their dismal season , this is one of six winnable matches which will determine their fate
dick advocaat knows as much and hinted on friday that he is working on a six - game rescue plan
for never has relegation come at such a cost given the fulsome flow of the premier league cash - cow
for newcastle head coach carver , it âs about making a point
lose , and the chances of him landing the job beyond the end of the season will take a serious hit
â i have stopped thinking about getting the job on a permanent basis , i really have , because if i keep worrying about everything that âs going on , if i keep worrying about everybody who has been linked with the job , then i wo nât be giving this my 100 per cent , so i do nât even think about â permanent â , â said carver
i am the permanent manager and that âs my mindset on this , so i do nât even think about the summer
â newcastle are not in danger of relegation but their season has faded away in recent months jermain defoe , who has scored twice since his return to england , trains with team - mates on friday dick advocaat , meanwhile , will be gone come june , regardless of which division he leaves sunderland in
â history is at least on dick advocaat âs side
â the pressure is on then , yes ? â laughed dick advocaat
gabriel obertan ( left ) closes in on mehdi abeid during friday 's training session at st james ' park tim krul works on his handling as he prepares to keep sunderland out in the tyne-weir derby on sunday and that is a recurring theme on wearside â a tedious tale of an annual battle against the drop
up the road at newcastle , the club who returned profits of Â£ 18.7million last week are in debt to a fanbase which , mystifyingly , still exceeds 50,000 on a fortnightly basis
throw in jack colback returning to the stadium of light for the first time since his defection to newcastle , sunderland âs adam johnson playing at home for the first time since his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15 - year - old girl , as well as a ludicrous 4pm kick - off in the middle of a bank holiday weekend , and you feel that a potentially poisonous atmosphere awaits
