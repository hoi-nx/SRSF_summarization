it is always revealing to see how players respond to adversity and root has reacted magnificently to being left out of last year âs sydney test
what root has done is have a look at himself , stay quiet and then produce hundred after hundred to ensure he will not be left out in a hurry again
root showed plenty of grit , as well as talent , in yet another big innings for england root has bounced back from a difficult ashes tour to prove himself as a quality test batsman around four years ago i remember sitting next to thorpe on a bus journey and him quietly telling me that the young english batsman to watch out for was root
how right thorpe was , for what root has done since sydney speaks volumes about the character of the bloke
he is as steely as they come , a fierce competitor who loves playing for england
it would be easy in his current run to chip up a catch on 40 or give it away as soon as he reaches a hundred , as samuels did in the first innings here
i love the way root goes big
before his partner was foolishly run out , root showed maturity to bat with the tail on friday in grenada the young batsman has been superb in his middle - order role , and should not be moved up the batting card part of me sees root as a natural no 3 , where england tried him in australia
eventually he will captain england and five is a good place to captain from
it wears them all down in the end and when the day eventually comes that england need a new leader they will have to think about that
his fabulous form should be enough to see root left to do what he does best - score runs for england alastair cook ( right ) has shown the danger of making your best player the captain of the team i have enjoyed the battle between ben stokes and samuels in this test and i like the way the durham lad goes about his cricket
