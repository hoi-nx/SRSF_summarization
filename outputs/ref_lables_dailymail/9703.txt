when keen runner julie creffield was training for a marathon when she was a size 18 , she was often heckled with taunts of ' oi , fatty ! ' as she ran
even her doctor told her she was too big to contemplate running 26.2 miles and should give up on her goal
with stories like this , it is perhaps no surprise that a new survey has found two thirds of women believe they ca n't run - despite being desperate to be fitter and healthier
she completed a marathon in 2012 - and has done numerous other races since
now through her website , the fat girl 's guide to running , she 's encouraging other women to take up the sport regardless of their size and ability
she appeared on today 's morning with sub-three hour marathoner nell mcandrew to launch the itv show 's run for your life campaign
julie creffield said : ' two million more men than women in the uk play sport because women are often too worried about what they look like and fear they will be judged by others , this has to stop
' run for your life will show that anyone can find success with running , and show that women of all shapes and sizes that running can be fun and can be a great way of improving physical and mental health
and if enough women get involved and give it a go , we can really start tackling negative perceptions in our own communities
' i was told by a doctor i was too fat to run , and just three weeks later i proved him wrong by running the brighton marathon , but you do n't have to be able to run far or even fast to benefit from the joys of running , its all about taking part and being inspired â¦ even if you are still a little bit rubbish at it

' a morning poll of 1000 women found that 60 per cent think they ca n't run yet 88 per cent would like to be fitter than they are
seventy per cent have n't been for a run in the last year but more than 75 per cent plan on getting fitter this year
many women are put off running because they fear they are not fit enough and are self - conscious about being seen sweating and panting while out on a jog
julie creffield loves running and has never let her size hold her back
she encourages other women to do the same others believe their size is holding them back so they do n't bother - even though by taking up the sport they could lose weight
the morning project , like the recently launched ' this girl can ' sport england campaign , aims to show women they can run - even if they are currently unfit and overweight
the show will follow three novice runners - shirley hargan-kennedy , 38 , from glasgow , francesca kennedy , 23 , from redditch , and kerrie jones , 37 , from cannock , staffs - as they train for five weeks to run 5k
the show is encouraging viewers to join them on the journey by taking up running themselves
the three women revealed they currently fall into the camp of not believing they can run but want to give it a go to improve their health and wellbeing
phillip schofield hands out new trainers to the three woman sat on the sofa who believe they ca n't run but have agreed to try a five week programme culminating in a 5k race francesca said : ' i 've tried running up and down my close and i feel like i 'm going to have a heart attack
' shirley said she wants to become like the runners she sees out training enjoying the exercise and taking in the scenic countryside when they run off - road
she said : ' i know i have always been fat but finding out i 'm now classed as clinically obese is scary
' i need to do this for my children , it 's not about dress size anymore it 's about health
' julie creffield knows how kerry feels as she weighed 20st when she first started running in 2003
nell mcandrew looked the part as she arrived at the itv studios in her running leggings and trainers she said : ' i 'm not a size 8 and if i can do it , so can you

if you have n't run before , download a couch to 5km programme or app ( there are plenty available for free ) as they advocate lots of walking and running to start with
we women are all so busy and i find it helps to sit down at the start of the week and think about what i have on each day so that i can plan when to fit in a run
