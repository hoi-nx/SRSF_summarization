the dawn spacecraft has captured amazing new images of the mystery bright spots on the dwarf planet ceres , which continue to baffle scientists
in particular , the images show the brightest spot and its companion standing out against the darker surroundings
they reveal new views of the two brightest spots in a crater ( shown )
dawn will begin its first science orbit around ceres on 23 april these latest images were taken on 14 and 15 april from a distance of 14,000 miles ( 22,000km ) from the north pole of ceres
several theories are currently being touted for what these mysterious bright white spots are on ceres
the hubble space telescope has found more than 10 on the surface , but ceres has found that the two most prominent - â spot 5 â - are in a crater about 57 miles ( 92km ) wide
as the spacecraft gets closer to the dwarf planet and moves around it , more and more of the surface is coming into view
the two brightest spots seen in a crater are known as â spot 5 â
this animation , made using new images taken by dawn , shows how the bright spots become visible when they pass the ' terminator ' - the line where the planet is split between sunlight and darkness
several theories currently exist for what they might be , with the favoured being salt flats or ice - both reflecting sunlight nasa 's dawn ( artist 's illustration shown ) made its way to ceres after leaving the asteroid vesta in 2012
it is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt , making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system
ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a ' dwarf planet '

dawn continues to get closer to the dwarf planet and on 23 april it will descend to a circular orbit 8,400 miles ( 13,500km ) above the surface
it will then begin its first mapping phase of the dwarf planet in this so - called science orbit , travelling from pole to pole to image the entire surface
this is lower than the orbital height of the iss around earth â and will allow dawn to snap glorious images of ceres â surface , including its mysterious bright spots
these latest images ( close up view of the bright spots in the crater on the right ) were taken on 14 and 15 april from a distance of 14,000 miles ( 22,000km ) from the north pole of ceres dawn is continuing to get closer to the dwarf planet ceres ( position in the solar system shown left ) , and on 23 april it will descend to a circular orbit 8,400 miles ( 13,500km ) above the surface - its first science orbit
dawn became the first spacecraft to orbit a dwarf planet on 6 march , having left the giant asteroid vesta in 2012
