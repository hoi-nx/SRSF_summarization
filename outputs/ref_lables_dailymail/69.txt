it is probably the most unpleasant experiment you will read about today : what happens when your skin starts to tear
researchers have uncovered the reason why skin is so difficult to tear even when put under extreme pressures , by cutting samples of real skin and attempting to pull them apart
they found that rather than simply tearing , mammalian skin actually has sophisticated stress resistance properties that prevent holes and cuts from expanding
the researchers cut real skin samples and then attempted to rip them by pulling them apart ( shown above ) using x-ray beams they were able to directly observe the microscopic changes that take place in skin to help it resist tearing during their stomach churning experiments
they discovered that the curly fibers of collagen that make up dermis of the skin straighten and stretch in response to a tear to share the load and prevent further damage
scientists behind the research also hope their findings could eventually lead to stronger new materials that do not easily tear that could be used in aircraft , for example
professor ritchie , a materials scientist at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in berkeley , california , who was one of the co-authors of the research , said : ' our study is the first to model and directly observe in real time the micro-scale behavior of the collagen fibrils associated with the skin âs remarkable tear resistance
' collagen fibrils and fibers rotate , straighten , stretch and slide to carry load and reduce the stresses at the tip of any tear in the skin
the researchers , whose work is published in the journal nature communications , then used the x-ray beams produced by the advanced light source at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory , to study the structural changes that took place in the skin
they found the collagen in the dermis , the thickest of the three main layers that make up skin , changed its alignment at the edge of the tear
the researchers found the collagen in the skin dermis changes from being a disordered tangle ( shown left ) to line up in straight parallel rows ( shown right ) when skin is damaged to provide strength and tear resistance dr marc meyers , a materials scientist at the university of california san diego who also took part in the research , said : ' straightening and stretching allow the uptake of strain without much stress increase , and sliding allows more energy dissipation during inelastic deformation
the graphic above shows what happens to a notch in skin when it is stretched ( left ) compared to bone ( right ) unlike bone and teeth , which are also made of collagen fibres but tear and crack when under stress , the collagen in the skin appears to change its structure when placed under stress
