clitheroe , 54 and gary cooper , 45 , from stockport , along with their ex-pat friend neil munro were stopped by police for writing down aircraft registration numbers at fujairah airport
clitheroe 's wife valerie had written to british prime minister david cameron to ask him to intervene in the case , raising concerns about her husband 's health due to his heart murmur and high blood pressure
a spokesman for the british foreign office said : ' we can confirm the release of three british nationals detained in fujairah airport , uae on february 21
mr clitheroe will now be able to return home to celebrate his first wedding anniversary with his wife on may 9
' earlier this month , mrs clitheroe had raised concerns because her husband had run out of blood pressure medication
clitheroe ( pictured with her husband ) said both he and mr gary cooper had been keen plane spotters since boyhood and pleaded for their release the men had travelled to dubai for a four - day holiday on february 18
they drove the 70 - mile journey there on february 21 , but were stopped by an off - duty policeman after they slowed down to note the registration numbers of planes
mr clitheroe has always insisted they never took any photographs
although plane spotting is not illegal in the uae , it is not understood and is frowned upon
mr clitheroe posted this picture on february 19 as he pursued his hobby at the sheraton deira hotel in dubai their case was escalated to a matter of ' national security '
sharing a cell with over 20 others , eating on the floor and forced to stare at the four walls for most of the day , the families were concerned about their welfare - particularly as mr clitheroe needs medication for his heart condition
mrs clitheroe added : ' clitheroe was beginning to think the worse and that they would never be released
the men were held after being seen by police writing down aircraft registration numbers at fujairah airport ' we thought they would be charged with something and fined so it 's come as a shock that there are no charges at all
the families of mr clitheroe and mr gary cooper were helped by charity ' detained in dubai ' to pay Â£ 9,000 for a lawyer to fight their case
