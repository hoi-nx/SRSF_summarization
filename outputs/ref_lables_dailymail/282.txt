google launched a new us wireless service today that switches between wi-fi network and cellular networks google is already the world âs most popular phone software provider , and a pay - tv operator - and now it wants to be your mobile network carrier
google is selling the basic phone service for $ 20 a month and will only charge customers for the amount of cellular data that they use each month , instead of a flat rate
that means a customer could sign up for a plan offering three gigabytes of data and get $ 20 back if only one gigabyte was used in a month
google 's pricing setup makes project fi less expensive than most of the comparable plans offering by the four biggest wireless phone carriers - verizon , at&t , t-mobile and sprint corp
rather than building its own network , google is leasing space on cellular towers built by sprint corp and t-mobile , which are hoping the deals will boost their profits without costing them too many customers tempted to defect to project fi
to use the service , nexus 6 6 owners must sign - up to request an invitation , must have a gmail address , and must live in a us zip code within the coverage area
project fi will be hosted through sprint corp and t-mobile 's networks the service will work only on the company 's nexus 6 6 phones and only in the us project fi will be hosted through sprint corp and t-mobile 's networks
overall , it costs $ 20 for basic service , which includes unlimited domestic talk , unlimited texting , tethering , and access in 120 countries
phone numbers will live in the cloud so that consumers can talk and text on any connected tablet
there is no annual service contract required when you sign up to use the service , nexus 6 6 owners must sign - up to request an invitation , must have a gmail address , and must live in a us zip code within the coverage area
t-mobile ceo legere , whose company already has been cutting its prices and rolling out new options , said it was a ' no - brainer ' to work with google on project fi
for talk and text only , the google carrier will cost $ 20 a month as compared to $ 35 for new partner t-mobile
however the savings really start when 5gb of lte is consider - with the internet search giant 's plan coming in at $ 70 and telecom giant verizon 's costing $ 110 a month project fi initially will only be sold to a narrow us audience that owns the nexus 6 6 , a smartphone that motorola mobility made with google 's help
