it âs the week of the champions league quarter - finals , therefore the manchester city director of football would have expected to be on the move
the thought of begiristain and his favourite coach , pep guardiola , in the same stadium as bayern attempt to turn over a 3 - 1 first leg deficit to porto certainly provides some appropriate imagery
pep guardiola is the man begiristain would like to install at manchester city in the summer of 2016
manchester city are keen for bayern manager pep guardiola to become their new manager in 2016 pep guardiola cut a frustrated figure as he watched his side lose 3 - 1 at porto in the champions league last week pep guardiola ( right ) speaks with midfielder bastian schweinsteiger during bayern 's training session on monday the 44 - year - old will come under more scrutiny if bayern fail to overturn their quarter - final deficit on tuesday despite winning the premier league last season , manchester city boss manuel pellegrini has come under - fire this term manchester city director of football begiristain ( left ) and pep guardiola enjoyed a successful relationship at barcelona these , however , are peculiar times for both men
pep guardiola is facing his first champions league exit prior to the semi-final stages of his coaching career and at the hands of relatively inconsequential opposition too
begiristain , meanwhile , has a decision to make , along with the members of the manchester city hierarchy , about their current manager manuel pellegrini
last week bayern chief executive rummenigge refused to criticise pep guardiola âs team
pep guardiola is facing his first champions league exit prior to the semi-final stages of his coaching career last season âs 5 - 0 aggregate dismantling at the hands of real madrid is still raw in the minds of bayern bayern doctor hans-wilhelm muller-wohlfahrt ( centre ) quit last week after a reported rift with pep guardiola dante , sebastian rode , lahm and robert lewandowski ( l-r ) trudge off the pitch after defeat in porto pep guardiola â whose team are expected to clinch another bundesliga title this weekend and are in the final of the german cup â has only a year left on his contract at bayern
can manchester city really afford to wait for him , though ? with their own squad in need of radical work after the disappointments of this season âs dismal premier league title defence , can they really ask manuel pellegrini to enter the final year of his own deal at the etihad stadium as a sitting duck coach ? history tells us that managers who know they are leaving do not generally perform well in england
pep guardiola only has a year left to run on his current contact at the allianz arena after this season the ex-barcelona boss is on course to win another bundesliga title and bayern are in the german cup final having enjoyed success in first spain , and now germany , pep guardiola 's next destination is set to be england city know all this , of course , but their options are limited
why , though , would manchester city expect their first team players to work for an interim coach any more than they would a man , manuel pellegrini , who has , after all , won a premier league and league cup during his time in manchester ? it is , sadly , a conundrum , without a clear solution
a rather old school course of action would be for begiristain to knock on rummenigge âs door on tuesday evening and offer bayern an awful lot of money to buy out pep guardiola from his contract at the end of this season
if bayern go out of the champions league on tuesday , it may not cost manchester city as much as they think
manchester city 's academy boss patrick vieira âs name has been mentioned as a short - term option to replace manuel pellegrini
