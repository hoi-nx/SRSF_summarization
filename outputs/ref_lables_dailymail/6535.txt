the device , called the illume arclighter , creates a â super high - intensity â electrical arc and contains a rechargeable lithium - ion battery so users will never run out of fuel at a tricky moment again
instead of using a spark and fuel mechanism like traditional lighters , the illume arclighter creates a â super high - intensity â electrical arc between two ceramic electrodes
flameless : instead of using a spark and fuel mechanism like traditional lighters , the illume arclighter creates a â super high - intensity â electrical arc between two ceramic electrodes
its inventors say it lights in any direction and is rechargeable , among other qualities shown above safer ? instead of using a spark and fuel mechanism like traditional lighters , the illume arclighter creates a â super high - intensity â electrical arc between two ceramic electrodes
this means there is no flare ups ( pictured ) like with matches or conventional lighters that can easily burn fingers illume arclighter replaces a traditional flame with a high intensity electric arc that focuses its energy at the tip. it does nât need to be refilled with fuel but is instead powered by a rechargeable lithium ion battery
convenient : the device ( pictured ) has a built - in lithium ion battery and comes with a usb - powered dock ( also shown ) so it can be easily recharged
the lighter has flame - proof ceramic tips with a zinc alloy cover and a plastic body the device has a built - in lithium ion battery and comes with a usb - powered dock so it can be easily recharged
the device costs cad $ 40 ( Â£ 21 or us $ 32 ) via kickstarter including the charger and cable
durable : the device ( pictured ) , called the illume arclighter , contains a lithium - ion battery and can be recharged , meaning that users will never run out of fuel at a tricky moment again
