rodgers insists liverpool âs transfer ambitions will not be compromised by their inability to offer champions league football â as they step up their pursuit of memphis depay
rodgers is hoping memphis depay will choose liverpool as his next destination psv are looking for Â£ 25million for memphis depay , who has also been linked with bayern munich , and while rodgers would neither confirm nor deny liverpool âs interest , he did acknowledge it is players of depay âs quality he is aiming to attract
how , though , will they lure targets from outside the top four ? liverpool âs recent history is littered with moves for big players that collapsed â alexis sanchez are diego costa are prime examples â and taking a backward step this season will not have helped them
rodgers , who saw similar failings hinder his side in a tepid 0 - 0 draw with west brom , accepts there is a big challenge facing liverpool this summer but is confident they will be able to bring in the required quality

â inevitably , there will be players who rodgers would like to sign that wo nât consider joining liverpool simply because they are not in the champions league but the manager believes they have done enough since he arrived to withstand this season âs setback
â if we are not in the champions league , players will still maybe want to come , â said rodgers , who could be without steven gerrard at hull tomorrow night after he picked up a â knock â
