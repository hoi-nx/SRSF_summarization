torin 's housemate ethan bradley said he bought the drugs to ' have a good weekend ' , and that he would use the drug recreationally , but was not addicted to it
coroner walsh today said he was concerned at the ease with which the boys bought the lethal drugs , adding he would be writing to the home secretary jacques was living in chingford , london , at the time with his grandmother while training to be a chef , so travelled to meet torin in manchester , where the pair booked into the pub for the weekend
they did n't know anybody in manchester

' a post mortem on jacques body found he had 6.15mg of mdma per litre of blood in his body - almost six times the ' lethal ' amount of 1.7mg
his brother torin was found to have 7.08mg of ecstasy in his body , while his blood alcohol levels were lower at 87mg
' he added : ' i accept the drugs were obtained by use of the internet and the drugs delivered to him from an unknown source by use of the internet on the dark web
the death of jacques and torin identify a great problem - the dark web
recording a narrative verdict , mr walsh said the issue of the dark web concerned him ' as a father and a grandfather ' ( pictured , torin ) ' the dark web identified an anonymous supplier and the supplier exists behind the veil - a confidential and sophisticated veil
' in the case of jacques and torin i hear reference to stone island and reference to agora
