a union conference heard today that schools are struggling to cope with an influx of children arriving unable to speak english - forcing some teachers to use google translate to make lesson plans in other languages they also said english - speaking children are not getting their â fair share â of attention from teachers because of the additional needs of those from abroad
in a speech to delegates from the association of teachers and lecturers , oxfordshire teacher joy wilson said many staff had little or no training in how to deal with pupils with english as an additional language ( eal )
â she pointed out that it takes some pupils up to seven years to gain adequate language proficiency for academic work - which means their lack of english holds them back
teachers have warned that schools are now having to deal with pupils across the uk speaking up to 300 different languages - but hardly any english she said that it was even harder to deal with those who had â complex needs â such as communication disorders , autism and moderate learning difficulties if they also had poor english skills
around one in six primary school pupils do not have english as their first language , while in secondary schools the figure is one in seven
â the non-eal students do not get a fair share of the teacher âs time
â malcolm st john-smith , from wakefield , said pupils were arriving in schools with english which was â rudimentary to say the least â and not developing their skills at home
how do we expect to be able to cope with that unless we have support from everywhere ? â the teachers â concerns come amid a growing crisis over places in primary and secondary schools , fuelled partly by migration and a baby boom
ofsted chief sir michael wilshaw warned last year that schools needed more help to deal with growing numbers of children who can not speak english
