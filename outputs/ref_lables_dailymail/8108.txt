sentenced : rebecca calder , 24 , who was jailed for a year today , went out drinking on the same night she used her victims ' bank cards to withdraw large amounts of cash , pictured left and right calder posted regular partying pictures of facebook not knowing the family of the victims , a couple in their late 80s who have now died , had installed a spy camera and filmed her taking cash
officers discovered calder had stolen more than Â£ 5,000 from the savings of the elderly couple who suffered from mental and physical disabilities
liverpool crown court was told she had previously been employed by a company called makerfield care - who are no longer in business - as a carer although she was not part of the team who looked after the couple at their home in warrington
caught : the victims ' family saw money coming from their accounts so set up a camera and filmed her taking money police said the victims both suffered from a number of physical and mental impairments due to their ages , with very poor memories and were largely confined to their home
the thefts came to light when the couple 's two daughters became concerned when she noticed on her parent 's bank statements that large amounts of cash , in Â£ 100 , Â£ 200 and Â£ 300 amounts , were being withdrawn from cashpoints almost every other day
the daughters installed a covert cctv camera at the house and caught calder red - handed as she stole cash from the elderly man 's wallet
evidence : the family watched her facebook account and matched clothing she wore in pictures to clothing she wore while withdrawing cash ' it is a heinous and appalling crime , made all the more galling by the audacity to post something on facebook of her enjoying a night out using cash stolen just hours earlier from an unsuspecting and trusting couple
