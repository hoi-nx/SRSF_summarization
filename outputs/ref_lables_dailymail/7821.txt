ipswich boss mick mccarthy hailed the ' belligerent , stubborn and hard working ' qualities of his ' horrible bunch ' of players after a determined 1 - 1 draw at his former club wolves moved town closer to securing a place in the championship play - offs
despite wolves bouncing back to take a point through benik afobe 's 31st goal of the season in the 50th minute after a richard stearman own goal had given ipswich a first - half lead , town 's play - off hopes are now in their own hands with two games remaining
former wolves boss mick mccarthy was delighted with his side 's determined display and he said : ' it was a good performance and a good point
mick mccarthy 's ipswich were denied three points as rivals wolves fought back to draw 1 - 1 on saturday ' wolves were in the ascendancy in the second half but we have had a great , stubborn , belligerent , professional performance - all those horrible words people do n't like in football but i do because you win games and win leagues by doing that
' the first thing i said to the players in the dressing room after the game was what a belligerent , stubborn , hard working , tough , horrible bunch you have turned out to be and i love you and i am proud of you because you need all those qualities to be a good team
' so to anyone who cocks a snook at the way we are doing it i laugh at them and think it is comical because i think what we do we do well and is n't that what having a job is all about ? ' tommy smith 's header ( right ) rebounds off wolves defender richard stearman for an own goal mick mccarthy , who was sacked by wolves in february 2012 after almost six years in charge of the club , insisted that he did not have anything to prove on his second return to molineux
he added : ' i think i am very much liked and respected by the wolves fans and i love the club and the people here so i do n't think i have got anything to prove and i always appreciate getting a nice warm welcome coming back
' although they trailed at the break , wolves needed only five minutes of the second period to draw level when benik afobe stabbed home at the far post and they could have gone on to snatch a winner with nouha dicko carrying their greatest
mick mccarthy hails the ' belligerent , stubborn and hard working ' qualities of his ' horrible bunch ' of ipswich players they could not find a second goal , though , and their play - off hopes are now hanging by a thread
kenny jackett is still hopeful his wolves side can secure a championship play - off spot despite the 1 - 1 draw ' if the door is still open through other people slipping up we have to make sure that we are there
we got a goal back early on but could n't break down a very determined and well organised and resolute ipswich defence
