picture the scene : you come home after work feeling too exhausted to cook - only to find a delicious meal worthy of a michelin - starred restaurant waiting for you
it sounds like a fantasy , but it could be about to come true thanks to a robot chef developed by british scientists
they have come up with a set of robotic arms so sophisticated that they are capable of cooking meals from scratch
the hands move a little slowly , hovering strangely above the work surface whenever they are not busy , but they imitate human movements closely enough that they can do things such as wipe a spoon on the edge of a pan to prevent drips
the device will be sold from as early as 2017 as part of a purpose - built high - tech kitchen , priced at around Â£ 10,000 ( $ 14,000 ) , which includes an oven , hob , dishwasher and sink
engineers at the shadow robot company spent almost 18 years developing the hands , which are each governed by 24 motors , 26 micro-controllers and 129 sensors

people will also be able to train the robotic arms to cook their own favourite family recipes , by demonstrating them a few times while wearing high - tech gloves and wrist - bands
