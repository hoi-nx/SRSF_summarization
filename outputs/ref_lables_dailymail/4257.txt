the two images were taken 18 years apart , the first with the karl g. jansky very large array in new mexico in 1996 and the second by an international team of astronomers led by the national autonomous university of mexico ( national autonomous university of mexico ) last year
a simulated image from 1996 is on the left , and another from 2014 is on the right the star â known as w75n ( b ) - vla2 â is 300 times brighter and eight times bigger than our sun , although it is masked by a black cloud of space dust
but what has most excited astronomers is the change in shape of the violet area of super-hot electrified winds that are being ejected by the young star
the dramatic changes , in a cosmic blink of an eye relative to the age of the universe , is giving an unprecedented look at how young â protostars â develop into fully - fledged stars
the pictures , created by data from 27 radio telescope antennae in the new mexico desert in the u.s. , show the electrified wind expanding away from the star until it is slowed by the black and yellow cloud of dust surrounding it
these images of the star were taken by the ï¿½ ï¿½ karl g. jansky very large array in new mexico
on the left is the star as seen in 1996 , with its dust wrapped tightly around it , while by 2014 in the image on the right , this outflow has been pushed out into an elongated shape this artist 's illustration shows the development of w75n ( b ) - vla-2
on the right right , as seen in 2014 , the hot wind has been shaped by encountering a dusty , doughnut - shaped torus around the star and appears elongated in the 1996 picture there is a relatively small region of space wind surrounding the star
' take a look at the amount of fuel for star formation in the universe , compared to the number of stars , and you 'll notice something strange - there should be 10 times as many stars as there are
' the amount of fuel for star formation outpaces the amount of stars 10 times , so these clusters should be really star - rich , ' said dr michael mcdonald , a hubble fellow in mit 's ( mit ) kavli institute for astrophysics and space research
