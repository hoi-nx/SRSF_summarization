nasa has finalised an ambitious mission to send a spacecraft closer to the sun than ever before
the solar probe plus will carry four experiments into the corona and study the solar wind and energetic particles as they blast off the surface of the star during the closest passes around the sun , temperatures outside the spacecraft will reach nearly 2,500 degrees fahrenheit
the launch window opens for 20 days starting on july 31 , 2018
solar probe plus is scheduled to launch aboard a united launch alliance delta 4-heavy rocket with an upper stage from cape canaveral air force station , florida
the launch window opens for 20 days starting on july 31 , 2018
the spacecraft and instruments will be protected from the sun âs heat by a 4.5 - inch - thick carbon - composite shield
during the closest passes around the sun , temperatures outside the spacecraft will reach nearly 2,500 degrees fahrenheit
how it will get there : over 24 orbits , the mission will use seven flybys of venus to reduce its distance from the sun. the small car - sized spacecraft will plunge directly into the sun 's atmosphere approximately four million miles from our star 's surface
it will explore a region no other spacecraft ever has encountered
the mission - which will fly closer to the sun than any spacecraft has before - reached a major milestone last month when it successfully completed its critical design review , or cdr
an independent nasa review board met at the apl , or apl , in laurel , maryland , march 16 - 20 , 2015 , to review all aspects of the mission plan
apl has designed and will build and operate the spacecraft for nasa
