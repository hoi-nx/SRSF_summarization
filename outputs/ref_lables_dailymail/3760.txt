stewart has occasionally been a critic of hamilton , and not without his reasons , but he was happy to acknowledge on sunday night that the reigning double world champion is â the best out there at the moment â
hamilton âs faultless behaviour extended to the celebratory spraying of rose water â the substitute drink in these religiously more abstemious countries
in place of that unchivalrous act , he acted with total restraint , looking at the grey - suited women at the side of the presentation party but studiously keeping his distance
hamilton âs joy must have been immense though
however well he drives , he may never be a match for hamilton at his greatest the championship dynamic developed in another important way : the ferraris of vettel and kimi raikkonen look set to stay in the hunt
kimi raikkonen was second with a strong drive from fourth on the grid , a place ahead of rosberg , who drove with real gusto but struggled with brake problems
rosberg , in desperate need of a spark to light his championship challenge , dived down the right of the straight , was blocked by vettel , and then overtaken by kimi raikkonen as the second corner swept round to the left
but rosberg harried kimi raikkonen âs red machine until he made his brave â arguably reckless â move going into the first corner at the start of the fourth lap. it worked , just
hamilton turned in a strong display at the sakhir international circuit to win in bahrain for the second consecutive year hamilton leads the early phase of the grand prix from the ferrari pair of vettel , who finished fifth , and kimi raikkonen ferrari team principal maurizio arrivabene was unimpressed , the italian mouthing a few words of pure anglo-saxon
hamilton was soon in but a slow wheel change delayed him â a mistake for which the team apologised over the radio â as vettel and rosberg were now flying around
suddenly , hamilton âs gap had narrowed to under a second from more than five seconds hamilton leads the pack on the run down to turn 1 ahead of vettel and rosberg as sparks fly in bahrain hamilton leads the field round on the pardare lap in bahrain , the fourth round of the championship hamilton is now 27 points clear of mercedes team - mate rosberg as he bids to win his third championship rosberg immediately passed vettel again with another close - your - eyes , hold - on - to - your - hats move
could rosberg conjure something special and catch hamilton ? no. if the opportunity was ever there , it did not last long
hamilton was away , rosberg âs hopes of victory evaporating in an instant
he continued to eat into those in front of him â hamilton and rosberg ( who finally got his place from a sometimes erratic vettel when the ferrari car needed a new nose )
kimi raikkonen could not catch hamilton , but rosberg , suffering brake problems , ran wide and the ferrari went through for second
hamilton crosses the start - finish line to win his third race of the season under the lights in bahrain the briton , who now has 36 career wins , celebrates his victory with an air golf swing after leaping out of his mercedes pastor maldonado and max verstappen battle for position with sparks flying off their cars
