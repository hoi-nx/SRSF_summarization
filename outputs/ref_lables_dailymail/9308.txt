they may not be the most glamourous of scientific instruments , but tampons could help experts clean up polluted rivers
engineers believe the super absorbent properties of tampons could be used to detect pipes that shunt sewage into streams instead of treatment plants
they found that the cotton products absorb chemicals commonly used on toilet paper , laundry detergents and shampoos , which glow under uv light , meaning that they could shed light on previously undetectable misplumbed pathways
engineers believe the super absorbent properties of tampons could be used to detect pipes that shunt sewage into streams instead of treatment plants
professor lerner , who led the study at the university of sheffield 's faculty of engineering , explained : â more than a million homes have their waste water incorrectly connected into the surface water network , which means their sewage is being discharged into a river , rather than going to a treatment plant
â unfortunately , it 's very difficult to detect where this is happening , as the discharge is intermittent , ca n't always be seen with the naked eye and existing tests are complex and expensive â but now his team have shown that tampons can glow in ultra-violet ( uv ) light , because they absorb chemicals found in products containing â optical brighteners â which are used to whiten and brighten colours
experts think tampons ( pictured left ) could be a cheap solution to detecting pollutants in rivers
on the right , professor lerner tests for sewage pollution in a stream in sheffield , uk , using a conductivity and temperature meter - a more expensive but less effective method than using tampons and uv lighting tampons absorb chemicals commonly used on toilet paper , laundry detergents ( pictured with a stock image ) and shampoos , which glow under uv light , meaning that they could shed light on previously undetectable mis - plumbed pathways engineers have shown that tampons can glow in ultra-violet ( uv ) light , because they absorb chemicals found in products containing â optical brighteners â which are used to whiten and brighten colours
the technique was then trialled in the field by suspending tampons for three days in sixteen surface water outlets running into streams and rivers in sheffield and then testing the tampons under uv light
