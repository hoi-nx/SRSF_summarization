the desperate parents of a boy whose head hangs at a 180 - degree angle have admitted they would rather he died than continue to suffer
mahendra , 12 , from madhya pradesh in central india , suffers from a rare condition that makes his neck bend and his head hang from his body
mahendra can just about crawl but needs help to eat and go to the toilet
undiagnosed : mahendra 's parents say they would rather see him dead than suffer the way he is now mahendra 's mother sumitra ahirwar , pictured here with her son , says watching his life is ' devastating ' his father mukesh , 40 , and mother sumitra ahirwar , 35 , who both work as labourers when they can , say they have consulted more than 50 doctors across india but none could diagnose his condition
â i can not see him suffer anymore , ' said sumitra ahirwar
' she added : ' i have to carry him like a baby everywhere but he is 12 years old , how will i carry him when he grows even older ? ' â if doctors can not treat my son it is better that god takes him
â shockingly , members of the community have blamed mahendra 's condition on mukesh 's past sins and believe he is to blame for his son 's disability
sumitra ahirwar , who also has healthy 16 and 10 - year - old sons and a 14 - year - old daughter , did not visit a doctor when she was pregnant with mahendra

mukesh , who earns about rs200 ( Â£ 2 ) a day on construction sites , has borrowed money from his friends and relatives to help find medical treatment for his son
but he said two years ago he decided to stop taking mahendra to see any doctors , adding : ' i took him to all the hospitals that i could afford
' mahendra pictured with his father mukesh ( left ) , mother sumitra ahirwar ( seated ) and brothers lalit ( centre ) and surendra ( second from left ) sumitra ahirwar has now lost all hope of a treatment being found for her son and says : ' if doctors can not treat my son it is better that god takes him ' mukesh added : ' people say bad things about him , and they often laugh at him
