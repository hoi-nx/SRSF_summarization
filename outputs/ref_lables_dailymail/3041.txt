snowden is being â exploited â under a deal he made with the russia to guarantee him asylum , a leading spy analyst has claimed after mr snowden , 31 , revealed himself in june 2013 as the civilian cia worker who stole a vast tranche of classified documents , he fled to hong kong and then russia where he was given asylum
mr soldatov is also an author , investigative journalist and analyst who has been working on the russia security state for a decade
