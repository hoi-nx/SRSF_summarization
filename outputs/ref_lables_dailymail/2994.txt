a narrow two - bedroom home so small it is only 5ft wide in places has been snapped up for a staggering Â£ 750,000
the tiny home is sandwiched between two double fronted properties on a leafy street in islington , north london
the property was put on the market with foxtons for Â£ 750,000 - almost double the price it sold for in 2001
neither its dimensions nor its size put off buyers - with the estate agency yesterday confirming the home was now under offer
' late last year a 34 - bedroom north devon mansion which is 40 times the size of the islington home sold for just Â£ 600,000
