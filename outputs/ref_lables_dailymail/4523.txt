two strange , bright flashes on the surface of dwarf planet ceres may have different origins , according to new infrared images released by nasa
the images , captured by the dawn from 28,000 miles ( 45,000km ) away , show that a pair of mysterious spots on the dwarf planet have different thermal properties
the images were revealed as part of the first colour map of ceres , showing variations in surface materials , and revealing the diverse processes that helped shape it
images taken using blue ( 440 nanometers ) , green ( 550 nanometers ) and infrared ( 920 nanometers ) spectral filters were combined to create the map ' this dwarf planet was not just an inert rock throughout its history
the ' alien ' spots on the surface , named feature 1 and feature 5 , show up in visible light images as bright flashes in comparison to the rest of ceres 's surface
in infrared , region 1 is cooler than rest of surface , but 5 is located in a region that is similar in temperature to surroundings
last month , scientists said this pair of mysterious bright spots could be towering ' water volcanoes ' , but they said they need to take a closer look to confirm this
federico tosi , who works on dawn 's visible and infrared spectrometer , presented infrared images of the two spots , measuring their thermal properties
' what we have found is that bright spot number one corresponds to a dark spot in the thermal image , ' he said at a press conference today captured by the dawn from 28,000 miles ( 45,000km ) away , the images reveal that two mysterious bright flashes on the surface have different thermal properties
the upper trio is region 1 at visible , infrared and thermal infrared wavelengths
in thermal infrared , the spot disappears dawn observed ceres completing one full rotation , which lasted about nine hours
the images show the full range of different crater shapes that can be found at ceres ' surface : from shallow , flattish craters to those with peaks at their centers ceres is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt , making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system
the dawn spacecraft pulled into orbit last month around the ceres in the asteroid belt
but feature five , which appears as two separate bright spots next to each other in visible images , did n't show up in the infrared images
more detail will emerge after the spacecraft begins its first intensive science phase on april 23 , from a distance of 8,400 miles ( 13,500km ) from the surface , said martin hoffmann , investigator on the dawn camera team
recent images from the dawn reveal feature 5 at various angles as the asteroid rotates

the glimmers of light are visible even when they are near the edge of ceres , suggesting that are on a high elevation in relation to the rest of the surface the ' alien ' mark can be clearly seen in images the icy world as the dawn hurtled its way towards a rendezvous on march 6 he noted that at dawn on ceres , the spots shine brightly , but fade as dusk draws in
the leading theory now for the alien spots is that the ice is covered by a thin layer of soil that at times forms into huge ' cryovolcanoes ' due to internal pressure in the asteroid
' now , finally , we have a spacecraft on the verge of unveiling this mysterious , alien world , ' dawn mission director and chief engineer marc rayman , of nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california said
the long exposure made ceres appear overexposed , and exaggerated its size a cropped , magnified view of ceres appears in the inset image at lower left dawn will be captured into ceres ' orbit in march , marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft ( artist 's impression pictured ) ceres orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between mars and jupiter and is very similar to jupiter 's moon europa and saturn 's moon enceladus - both considered potential sources for harbouring life
