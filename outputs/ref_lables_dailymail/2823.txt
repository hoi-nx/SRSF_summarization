israel prime minister netanyahu has slammed the iran nuclear deal , claiming it threatens the jewish state and puts his people in mortal danger
after speaking to president obama on the phone , he said in a televised statement just hours after the agreement was signed on thursday : ' a deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of israel

it prompted netanyahu to urge more pressure to be placed on iran by western powers until a better deal is reached
he said : ' this deal would legitimize iran 's nuclear program , bolster iran 's economy , increase iran 's aggression & terror throughout the me [ middle east ] & beyond
