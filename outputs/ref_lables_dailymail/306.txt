' the informant was present when driver and moran talked with newcomb , identified as the kkk chapter 's ' kkk ' or leader , and recorded many of their conversations
in late 2014 , authorities say driver provided the kkk chapter , called a klavern , with a photograph of the inmate , who 'd been let out on supervised release

the informant recorded all three men making plans to murder the inmate - ranging from shooting him to injecting with a lethal dose of insulin , which newcomb said ' would be quieter
the affidavit said the informant , moran and newcomb went on a trip together to where the inmate lives in palatka
before they made the trip , ' newcomb pointed out that if they could grab ( the inmate ) and take him to the river , he would need to bring a fishing pole to make it look like ( the inmate ) was at the river fishing , ' the affidavit said
