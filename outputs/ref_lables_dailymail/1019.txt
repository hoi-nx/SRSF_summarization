peter morris was devastated when his sister , claire , died in a car crash when she was just 32
only a year before , he had walked her down the aisle to give her away to her husband , webster , from surrey , then aged 33 , who seemed equally bereft at the loss of his wife
peter morris , from gillingham , kent , believed claire had died in a tragic accident that happened in aberdeen , scotland , in 1994
webster had drugged his wife at their home in the scotland village of tarves , where they had settled after their wedding , before taking her for a drive
he then deliberately crashed their car and , after making his own escape , set it on fire so claire had no hope of survival
last year claire 's story was turned into an itv drama starring sheridan smith
and now peter morris has gone in front of the cameras to talk about his grief and to reveal the shocking detail of his sister 's death , which he is still coming to terms with 21 years later
' peter morris said he was shocked and heartbroken when he was told his sister , a qualified nurse , had lost her life in just terrible circumstances
claire and webster pictured on their wedding day in 1993 , the following year he murdered her he had no reason to suspect webster , who claire had met at a party , had drugged and then burned her alive
' he said he and webster consoled one another at the funeral and peter morris believed he was suffering just as much as he was
' for years peter morris continued to believe the car crash had been accidental , and while some officers who investigated the scene of the crash had their misgivings , they had no concrete evidence to suggest anything different
he attempted to kill her in circumstances similar to claire 's death peter morris lost touch with his brother - in - law when webster moved to new zealand - but it was there that his true colours were revealed when he tried to murder again
unbeknownst to felicity , he started faking her signature to take out life insurance polices in her name and also began poisoning her like he had done to claire
then in circumstances similar to claire 's death , in 1999 she was driven by webster to a remote location when she was feeling tired and drowsy
webster pictured in 2011 when he was jailed for life after being found guilty of murder ' we discovered that he 'd opened up a private mail box , he had redirected all of our mail including bank mail which had prevented me from discovering that gradually the account was being fleeced , ' she said
at the bottom of his briefcase there was a total of nine life insurance policies , which collectively was in excess of a million dollars on my death , and they had my signature forged on them
' felicity pictured in 2011 when she gave evidence against webster during the trial in which he was dubbed ' the black widower ' however , it would take years for the police to build a strong enough case to prove claire 's death was not an accident and gain enough evidence to charge webster
in may 2011 , after a long running trial during which he was dubbed ' the black widower ' , webster was found guilty of murdering claire , attempting to murder felicity and attempting to bigamously marry a third woman to gain access to her estate
peter morris , who had to wait 21 years to get justice for claire , said he and his family can now finally move on even though their lives will never be the same again
peter morris says claire 's death nearly destroyed their family but now they are rebuilding their lives he said : ' if anything it taught me that you just have to be a little bit more cautious in life as to who you trust and when you trust them , because we could all be living next door to the next webster
