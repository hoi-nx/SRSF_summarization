heath is holding court at his weekly pre-match press conference , and one of the local reporters wants to talk crossbars
might it be a good idea to raise it a bit so more goals could be scored for the benefit of goal - hungry united states fans ? the well - travelled former everton and manchester city midfielder â now manager of the newest mls team orlando city â responds with good humour
' well , soccer 's being doing quite well for about 150 years now and if you look at the amount of people who play and watch it 's still doing quite well , so i do n't really see a need , ' he replies with a patient smile
heath has been here for eight years now and witnessed the process at first hand , going from the backwoods of the usl to the major leagues that orlando city have been elevated to this season
the years have not dimmed heath 's impish enthusiasm and , now 53 , he speaks of the game 's expansion with an almost missionary zeal
perched in the morning sunshine on a bench at manchester city 's pristine training facility he talks about the upside of salary caps , what frank lampard and steven gerrard can expect , the humility of his star signing kaka and his hopes of an eventual rivalry with david 's troubled miami project
steven gerrard will join la galaxy in the summer after spending 17 seasons at liverpool midfielder frank lampard has signed a two - year contract with new york city the aforementioned names ' imminent arrival is just one reason why the mls is achieving a greater resonance on the other side of the atlantic
' i think england people are fascinated with united states , ' says heath
' heath 's stateside adventure began in the unlikely setting of a pub in his native newcastle under lyme , where he bumped into stoke city director phil rawlins
' his belief that in ten years the mls will be world 's ' third or fourth biggest league ' is fuelled by his daily influx of emails : ' i only have to open my inbox every day to see how many people want to come out here
' orlando city midfielder kaka has the highest salary in mls history while david is still looking for a ground in miami â last month he made an unusually low profile visit in further efforts to resolve the issue â orlando city sold out their opening game last month at the temporary home of the citrus bowl
' it helps having kaka as the club 's marquee signing , a superstar in name but evidently not in behaviour , as heath quickly discovered : ' we went on pre-season to charleston and we hired a few vans to transport everyone around
midfielder heath scored 71 goals in 226 games for everton ' there 's nobody at this club that does n't want to see david get it off the ground in miami
one of things that has helped in orlando city is that it 's a young city and they want to show it has a lot more to offer than disney
' steven gerrard and frank lampard will be coming sooner and , he says , there will be a few culture shocks
frank lampard will be fine and so will steven gerrard because they 've got great football brains
' heath helped everton lift eight trophies during his six years at goodison park and they will find a much more level playing field
' the great thing about the mls is because of the salary cap there is parity and you do n't know who is going to win the league
' nobody is more patriotic than me and i 'm very proud to have played for the likes of everton and manchester city
but the thought that everton might never win another trophy does n't sit well with me
they were level five years ago with manchester city
it 's unthinkable that everton might not win anything again
' heath is that rare bird in england football , the traveller , having also spent a season at espanyol as a player
' now he is doing something very unusual , having to effectively build a team from scratch after orlando city 's ' promotion ' , working all the time within the salary cap
