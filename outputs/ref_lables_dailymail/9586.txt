thousands of women whose breast cancer has become resistant to standard treatment could benefit from a new drug combination , claim researchers
it is hoped the new approach will target cancer stem cells that evade conventional drugs and cause the tumour to re-grow
cancer that has spread and is incurable , known as secondary breast cancer , kills 1,000 women in uk every month
thousands of women whose breast cancer has become resistant to standard treatment could benefit from a new drug combination
it targets cancer cells that evade conventional drugs and cause tumours to re-grow they are testing the drug sulforadex in the most common type of breast cancer , affecting 70 per cent of patients
however , many women go on to develop resistance and the disease comes back , often because cancer stem cells which cause tumours to regrow and spread are unaffected by these treatments
the combination therapy , tested in mice and samples of tissue from secondary breast cancer patients , combines sulforadex with standard hormonal treatments
this targets both the oestrogen - sensitive cells and the remaining cancer stem cells at the same time , says research presented at the aacr annual conference today
â combining tamoxifen with sulforadex resulted in fewer breast cancer stem cells surviving treatment compared to tamoxifen alone , lowering the likelihood of breast cancer returning or spreading to other parts of the body
the new therapy targets both the oestrogen - sensitive cells and the remaining cancer stem cells ( pictured ) at the same time â interestingly , dr clarke âs team has also shown that this combination of drugs reduces the number of cancer stem cells in secondary breast cancer samples
â this means that the combination also has the potential to extend how long tamoxifen treatment can work for women with secondary breast cancer ( cancer that has spread ) , the incurable form of the disease
â secondary breast cancer still kills 1,000 women in the uk every month so research that helps us to discover improved treatment options for women living with this form of breast cancer , or to help prevent cancer spreading , are vitally important
