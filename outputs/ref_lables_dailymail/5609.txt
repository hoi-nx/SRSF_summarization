rejection proof by jia jiang who likes rejection ? whether you are being rejected by a lover , an employer or a barman who serves a newly arrived regular customer before you , it âs galling
and in every case there âs nothing we can do about it
it would take someone exceptionally optimistic and uncynical to propose an alternative thesis , and jia jiang is both of those
born into a family of teachers , jia jiang was so determined to become an entrepreneur that , as a child in china , he dug a hole in the garden , intending to reach america by the shortest route
it does n't matter where it comes from - no one likes being rejected and in each and every case there âs nothing we can do about it ( picture posed by model ) the problem was he inevitably encountered rejection , mainly from potential backers for his project ( another iphone app no one could possibly need or want )
so , having possibly read one self - help book too many , jia jiang decided to embark on his own rejection - proofing quest
instead of avoiding rejection , he would spend 100 days deliberately seeking out situations in which he was likely to be rejected , film them and put them up on his blog
but jia jiang is nât a humorous writer
the security guard said no , and jia jiang almost broke into a run to get away
the cashier said no. but as he continued his quest , jia jiang realised there were ways and ways of asking
and so develops a surprisingly entertaining study of rejection in all its many manifestations
the crucial point is that rejection is unavoidable and it âs how we respond to it that matters
jia jiang âs extreme positivity can grate at times but his message is sound : rejection is only someone else âs opinion , and it may not be the right one .
