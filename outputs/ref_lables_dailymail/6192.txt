jones and ramon luis nicolas were in the middle of a bout when the black phone slipped out from jones ' black and red shorts at the ring in arcadia , florida
but jones later told tmz sports that he was listening to music before the fight on friday and put his phone in his shorts
jones believes the mishap cost him the fight as he kept thinking , ' man , my cell phone just fell out in the ring â and on tv ! ' he has decided that for his next fight he will make sure someone pats him down
