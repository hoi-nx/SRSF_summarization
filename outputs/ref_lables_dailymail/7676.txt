cook insists he is ' refreshed ' by this winter 's enforced sabbatical at home on the farm
cook has had a taste already of what is to come , first of all in three caribbean tests this month and then a decidedly awkward assignment at home to new zealand , before england somehow try this summer to regain the ashes lost 5 - 0 under his captaincy in 2013 - 14

he made 79 in his last test innings , part of a wide - margin and third successive victory at home to india last summer , and will be a record - breaker for the foreseeable future as england 's most prolific centurion
cook smiles while fielding during england 's west indies series with india last summer cook bats during the fifth test against india at the oval last year the speculation over whether kevin pietersen will return to the england fold will overshadow the tour the wonder is whether cook can clear his mind sufficiently to defend his wicket against the new ball , or dispatch a wide one
' cook waved what he hoped would be a brief goodbye to peter moores , less than a week before turning 30 on christmas day , still apparently full of optimism - despite an unsuccessful tour of sri lanka - that he would be retained to complete the task he had been set three - and - a - half years earlier , to lead england to the world cup
cook struggled for form playing for the mcc against yorkshire in abu dhabi last month cook will hope england can regain the ashes when they face australia later this summer the tinsel could barely have been in place around him , wife alice and their baby daughter at their rural home before he discovered he would be staying on well into the new year after all
back to work last week , after england 's world cup embarrassment without him and off his own bat after those two brief innings for mcc against champion county yorkshire in abu dhabi , cook could do little else than try to impart a little positive spin on events
he spelled out in the weeks before england 's first venture of an outrageously hectic year that , should cook 's tourists fail to beat the ' mediocre ' opposition they are set to face in the windies , there will be ' inquiries '
encouraged or otherwise by that , cook is experienced enough to know - especially after england 's disappointments and struggles since they won their last home ashes series - that success will be hard - earned and is no foregone conclusion
