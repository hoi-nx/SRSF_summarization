jack wilshere can be the future of arsenal âs midfield , but his injury record could turn him into another abou diaby , fears club legend parlour
jack wilshere was on the bench against reading at wembley on saturday after five months out through injury

jack wilshere , on the bench next to theo walcott and mathieu flamini , for arsenal 's match against reading jack wilshere , the england international , is pictured in training for arsenal earlier this month â i think he âs the future of the club , â said parlour
â the big burning question is can jack wilshere have a full season without being injured for a long period , like he has nât had for the last three or four seasons
â the 23 - year - old pictured in action for arsenal 's under - 21s against reading at the emirates earlier in april jack wilshere is at the heart of a core of players at the emirates which has now reached the fa cup final for the second year in a row , and are approaching maturity as a group
and although the premier league title may be out of their reach , parlour believes that wenger âs squad , with the right additions , could be ready to finally push for top honours again
parlour , who won three championships with arsenal , has backed jack wilshere to be the future of the club â it âll need a couple of big signings , but if they can get them , i âm sure they âll be a lot closer to chelsea next season in the premier league , and in the champions league they can go the extra couple of rounds and get to the final , ' said parlour , at the boot camp stage of the people 's pundit , championed by carlsberg â the the people 's pundit of the england team and the premier league
parlour , who won three fa cups under wenger , was also full of praise of the gunners ' fa cup final opponents villa , and their boss tim sherwood
the former tottenham boss â who grew up an arsenal fan â has steered villa away from the relegation dogfight and into their first cup final for 15 years , and parlour backed him to be named manager of the season if he triumphs at wembley
parlour won the fa cup under wenger three times , including in 2002 when he scored a stunning goal frenchman abou diaby 's promising career has been hit by a host of injuries â i played with him at england , he always a great lad , always had a good football brain on him , and he âs certainly delivering the goods at the moment , â said parlour
