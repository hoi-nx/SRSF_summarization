abc released a fourth promo video on thursday on the eve of bruce 's sitdown interview with sawyer airing in which he is expected to talk about his gender transition
bruce - the ex-husband of kourtney kardashian matriarch kris jenner - appears somewhat anxious as he tells the sawyer : ' it 's going to be an emotional rollercoaster , but somehow i 'm gon na get through it
the video then shoots to footage of bruce 's older children ; burt , 36 and casey , 34 , ( from his marriage to chrystie crownover ) along with brandon , 33 , and brody , 31 , ( from his marriage to linda thompson ) who all appear in the latest snippet from the show
he says : ' i wan na know how this story ends , you know ? how does my story end ? ' looking to the future : the clip ends with bruce asking ' how does my story end ' abc has kept a tight lid on friday 's much talked about broadcast , only releasing a couple of non specific quotes from bruce
the network is not expected to reveal much more in advance of friday 's program , preferring to give him the opportunity to address the topic in the full context of the interview
she 's scheduled to promote it on abc properties on friday : good morning america , live with kelly and michael and the view
abc news executives also have n't spoken about it , not even confirming publicly until april 6 that the interview had taken place , until this friday 's airdate was set
tight lid : abc has only released snippets with non-specific quotes from bruce , paving the way for his story to air in full on friday 's air date the tight lid enables abc to avoid the touchy issue of potentially ' outing ' a public figure before the person has had a chance to publicly address the topic himself
bessey said they 've done stories on the three 15 - or 30 - second promos that abc has released
abc is expected to address the topic , although the timing precludes it from being raised with kylie jenner
abc is airing it on a friday night , when tv - watching is usually low
friday 's interview likely wo n't approach those numbers , but should certainly exceed the friday 20/20 average of 6.2 million viewers this season
