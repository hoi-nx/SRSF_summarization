elephants are often seeing travelling single file , using their trunk to hold onto another mammal âs tail in front of them
the baby elephant can be seen walking alongside its herd , which travel in a single file line as the first three elephants move from the shot , the fourth â a smaller elephant â is flanked by a baby
the baby elephant stops to dawdle and picks something up from the floor with its trunk it then rather cheekily forces its way into the line at the expense of the huge â and rather understanding â elephant behind it
the baby elephant goes to start walking once more and manages to break the elephant chain with its back â the little baby elephant was constantly stopping or running off to the frustration of the other elephants , it was hilarious to watch him being put in his place
