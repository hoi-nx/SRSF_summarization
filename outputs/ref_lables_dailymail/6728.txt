the founder of bikram yoga , who has been accused of sexually assaulting multiple students , has said women love him so much he would n't need to rape them to get sex
speaking out for the first time since six women filed civil lawsuits accusing him of unwanted sexual advances , 69 - year - old bikram strongly denied the accusations
' bikram , who pioneered the practice of working out in a room heated to 105f , has his name attached to 720 yoga schools in 220 countries
' when asked how his wife of more than 30 years , fellow yoga instructor rajashree choudhury , had responded to the accusations , bikram became emotional
' my wife never look at me anymore , ' he said
' ' targeted ' : baughn , pictured speaking to cnn , said bikram told her they should be together and that she needed to have sex with him if she wanted to advance her career
she no longer practises at work : he pioneered bikram yoga , in which followers practice 26 yoga moves in temperatures of 105f bikram yoga , devised by bikram , is based on regular hatha yoga , but performed in 105f temperatures for 90 minutes
bikram began practising yoga in calcutta at the age of three , spending up to six hours a day perfecting his poses
at 13 he won the national india yoga championship and went on to devise the 26 ' asanas ' ( poses ) and two breathing methods that form the core of bikram yoga
he claims to have been invited to the u.s. in 1973 by president richard nixon to help him improve his health through yoga
he also claims to have taught yoga to ronald reagan and bill clinton and has a legion of celebrity fans including lady gaga , madonna , jennifer aniston and tennis champion andy murray
bikram says bikram works because the heat loosens the muscles , helping them to go further than they would otherwise
since 2013 , six women have stepped forward to accuse him of unwanted sexual advances , and studios have started to drop his name , signalling that his empire is crumbling
baughn , one of his accusers , told cnn that bikram yoga was ' life changing ' and as soon as she took part , she knew she wanted to teach the practice
' struggle ' : he said his wife , rajashree choudhury , no longer looks at him because of the accusations emotional : when asked about his wife 's reaction , bikram became emotional and questioned why he was being accused of sexual assaults after working so hard
' baughn has previously likened the atmosphere in the bikram community to a cult and said she had endured bikram 's sexual assaults as just something that went with the territory
accusers : larissa anderson , left , and lawler , right , have both filed civil lawsuits against bikram ' throughout the sexual abuse , defendant bikram offered multiple explanations and justifications for his behavior , ' her lawsuit said
' the lawsuit states that lawler continued doing bikram yoga for years and that bikram 's abuse continued on multiple occasions , the most recent being in february 2013
at the time , bikram 's lawyers and his yoga college of india said he never sexually assaulted any of the women and that prosecutors declined to bring charges
