the brave man who stood up against a neo-nazi at an anti-islam rally has spoken out about the poignant moment that was captured on camera
during the reclaim australia rallies on the easter weekend , anti-racism protester king was snapped staring into the eyes of a bald man with a swastika tattooed behind his ear
mr king , from melbourne , told daily mail australia he had his arms spread out because he thought the man was going to attack him and his fellow protesters at federation square
anti-racism protester king , from melbourne , had a face off with a neo-nazi at the easter weekend 's reclaim australia rallies mr king was raised in melbourne and says he lived in a multicultural part of the victorian capital where he was exposed to racial tensions the anti-racism protester said he learned islamophobic views from a young age but thankfully managed to ' unlearn ' these views ' ' a few scuffles broke out as a result of those trying to push and fight their way through the picket lines , ' he said
' i remember looking at the bald man from the photo and it seemed to me that he and his group were there solely to be violent and express incoherent hatred , which took away from the already limited opportunities to engage in civilised discussion
my arms were outstretched to keep people back and when the man got in my face i was expecting him to attack me
' mr king said he was born and had grown up in a multicultural part of melbourne , where he had been on the giving and receiving ends of ' racial prejudice and bigoted views '
mr king said he had spread out his arms to protect his fellow protesters because he thought the man and his group was going to attack them wearing a harley davidson sleeveless hoodie , which showed off his sleeve of tattoos , the bald man attempted to start a fight with the protesters against racism , who stood against him in defiance ' i attended the anti-racism rally because i recognise that the issues raised by the rally co-ordinators are a direct result of the scapegoating and fear mongering of muslims and other minorities by many in the corporate mainstream media and government
' numerous images emerged showing fiery scenes around the nation , but the most striking picture was taken by photographer wardenclyffe who captured mr king during the melbourne protest against the ' islamisation ' of australians
the dramatic scenes occurred after reclaim australia , an anti-islam group , organised protests at major cities across australians , which were countered by anti-racism activists who held rallies in the same locations
' it was very intense , ' wardenclyffe told daily mail australia
' the neo-nazi definitely seemed to be instigating , trying to start a fight with the anti-racism group
the other man in the photo stepped in and was trying to keep the peace
' the violent intent of the bald man was proven elsewhere at the rally , when he was photographed with one fist gripping another protester 's shirt and the other raised to punch the man in the face
' it was a very angry atmosphere - it definitely seemed some of the people on the reclaim australia side were there looking to start a fight , ' he said
' violent intent : at the rally , the man involved in the standoff was seen trying to throw a punch at another protester as the scene descended into violence one man appeared to be knocked out cold in the melee and was left lying on the ground the identification of king comes after a federal government mp reported a group ' socialist ratbags ' who were seen burning the australians flag at the rally to the human rights commission
the trio were at a reclaim australia demonstration , the same rally where mr king was photographed
' i have asked the racial discrimination commissioner to investigate the protests to see if they are unlawful under section 18c of the act , ' mr george christensen said
the rally was just one of a dozen which took place in cities across australians on the easter long weekend , organised by anti-islam group reclaim australia
