candy crush saga has been downloaded by more than 500 million people since its launch in 2012 violent video games in which players have to shoot enemies can actually be good for people , a university has claimed - after discovering the games give people a higher pain threshold
a study at keele university found that 40 volunteers were able to stomach pain for 65 per cent longer after playing violent ' first person shooter ' games , than those who had played a non-violent golf game
on average , participants kept their hands in the icy water for 65 per cent longer after playing the violent game , indicating that playing the game increased the participants â pain tolerance but in this man âs , he tore the tendon at its thickest point , which would usually cause pain before it ruptured , he told livescience journalists
this could be because when people play games , they feel pleasure and excitement , and this can cause natural painkillers to be released in the body â similar to when a person experiences a â runner âs high â , he explained
