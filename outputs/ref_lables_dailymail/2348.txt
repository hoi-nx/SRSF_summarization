â i spent most of my career crying , did nât i ? â said radcliffe , laughing at the comparison , â i have done enough crying but i do nât know , i think the marathon does that to you anyway because you are so exhausted by the end of it , emotions are really close to the surface
â world record holder radcliffe says she is likely to cry when she runs the final race of her career sunday 's london marathon will be radcliffe 's final competitive marathon of her career radcliffe joked that she has never been far from tears in her career , as she was at the athens 2004 radcliffe has battled with an injury to her left foot , which made it difficult for her even to walk short distances two months ago , to make it to the start line
she will set off with the masses rather than the elite runners but the memory of her stunning 2hr 15min 25sec world record run in london in 2003 will not be far from her thoughts
almost 12 years later no woman has come close to that mark , but radcliffe insists her remarkable time was not a mixed blessing
the former world champion says she knows she got the best out of her career , despite several injuries radcliffe set the world record in 2003 when she won the london marathon in a time of 2:15:25 â maybe my career was a little bit shorter because i ran so hard to do those times early on
â radcliffe maintained she wanted to finish her career on her own terms and in london
the men âs race features a much anticipated battle between defending champion wilson kipsang â who is aiming for a third win â and the new world - record holder dennis kimetto , who makes his london debut .
