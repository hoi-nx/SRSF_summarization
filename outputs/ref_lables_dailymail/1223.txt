mr danny alexander said the previously dropped plans - including limiting child benefit and child tax credit to two children at a cost of Â£ 3,500 for a family of three - were a clear signal of where the axe would fall
' if they are proposing Â£ 12billion of welfare savings without knowing what they 're going to do , that is highly reckless
' mr nick clegg backed mr danny alexander 's decision to disclose details of confidential coalition discussions saying the conservatives needed to say where their planned benefits cuts would fall
' i share danny alexander 's intense frustration verging on anger that the conservatives think it is okay a week before an election to say that they are going to take the equivalent of Â£ 1,500 off eight million of the most vulnerable families in this country and they ca n't even be bothered to spell out exactly what their plans involve , ' he said on an lbc radio phone - in
' labour leader ed miliband , pictured in dewsbury today , said the future of child benefit and tax credits is ' on the ballot paper next week ' cameron will today pledge to cut taxes for the young as he warns labour would ' reach into your pay packet ' by raising them

' mr danny alexander 's revelations came as the times reported growing dissent in lib dem ranks over the possibility of entering a second power - sharing deal with the conservatives if the general election fails to produce a clear winner
mr danny alexander said : ' for five years i won battle after battle to stop the tories veering off to the right with ideological cuts , and it 's been worth it to get the economy back on track while ensuring a fairer society
' the coalition has delivered savings in a fair way , but the tories now want to balance the books off the backs of ordinary working families and the most vulnerable in society
instead they want to cut Â£ 1,500 for eight million households , singling out middle and low - income families to bear the burden - and asking nothing from the best off
i 'm lifting the lid on this now because the conservatives are trying to con the british people by keeping their planned cuts secret until after the election
' they now ask the british people to trust them when they make unfunded pledges on health and tax , yet wo n't tell us how they will cut welfare for millions of families to pay for their plans
' labour leader ed miliband also seized on the revelation.speaking ahead of an event in yorkshire , he said : ' today we 've learnt that child benefit and tax credits are on the ballot paper next week
