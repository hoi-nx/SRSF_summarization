the Â£ 135,000 was spent trapping and moving water voles from the somerset levels ahead of dredging taxpayers have footed a Â£ 135,000 bill to move 50 protected water voles - at a cost of Â£ 2,500 per animal - to allow dredging of the somerset levels
in january and february 2014 residents on the levels were forced to abandon their homes after record rainfall saw rivers burst their banks following years of insufficient dredging
more than 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland were inundated with quickly rising waters and entire villages were cut off in the wettest january since records began in 1766
but the environment agency says it has a legal duty under eu - backed regulations to protect the water voles as an endangered species
the Â£ 135,000 was spent trapping and moving 55 of the six - inch - long furry creatures from their bankside burrows on the somerset levels ahead of dredging work
and when other costs are factored in , the total bill came to Â£ 135,000
now some somerset levels residents - while anxious to have rivers dredged to avoid the devastating floods from two winters ago - think the scheme is an unnecessary waste of public money
residents abandoned their homes after rivers burst their banks following years of insufficient dredging more than 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland ( pictured ) were inundated with quickly rising waters in late 2013 and early 2014 and entire villages were cut off in the wettest january since records began in 1766 he said dredging often took place across the levels before the environment agency took over , and that in the past it had never appeared to affect the vole population
' money spent on relocating the voles was a small percentage of the Â£ 6 millionspent on dredging five miles ( 8 km ) of the rivers tone and parrett , the agency said previously

following the devastation , which took place between december 2013 and march 2014 , 8,000 metres of river was dredged at a cost of Â£ 6 million
