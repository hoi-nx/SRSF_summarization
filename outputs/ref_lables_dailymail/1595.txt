a bolt of lightning has been spotted soaring from the top of a cloud before looping back on itself and striking the ground in australia
the image was captured over jaibru in australia by an off - duty emergency services officer who dubbed the phenomenon ' looping lightning '
this image was captured over jaibru in australia by emergency services officer scott murray , who dubbed the phenomenon looping lightning '
but storm chaser dan robinson said ' looped ' lighting may instead be a trick of perspective , based on where a viewer is stood , meaning it appears to loop when it 's not the ' looping lightning ' image was taken by scott murray and the bolt appears to shot out and up from the cloud before curving towards the earth
typically lightning is seen from a distance , or from the side , and it is rare to capture an image almost directly beneath a bolt
lightning is caused by the build up of electrostatic charge in clouds
as they develop , air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud , and between the cloud and the ground
upwards lightning is normally caused by a preceding flash moving from the cloud to earth , and involves a bolt moving from the ground to the clouds
positive charge builds up in one area of the cloud , while negative charges build up in the other - typically the top and bottom of the cloud respectively
if this build up of charge reaches a certain level , the insulating capacity of the air breaks causing the negative charges to escape or ' leap ' from the cloud either onto another another cloud - known as sheet lightning - or to the ground
as negative charges gather in the bottom of a cloud , the negative charges in the ground are forced from the surface , leaving it positive
when a so - called ' streamer ' of negative charges leaps from the bottom of the cloud , it is therefore attracted to the ground , which in turn emits a streamer of positive charges from the ground up
this flash temporarily equalises the charged regions , until the opposite charges build up again
lightning can occur between opposite charges within the thunderstorm cloud , known as intra-cloud lightning , or between opposite charges in the cloud and on the ground , referred to as cloud - to - ground lightning
upwards lightning is normally caused by a preceding flash moving from the cloud to earth , and involves a bolt moving from the ground to the clouds
lightning is caused by a build up of electrostatic charges
as they develop , air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud , and between the cloud and the ground
the negative charge ' leaps ' from the cloud either onto another another cloud - known as sheet lightning - or to the ground ( pictured ) when a so - called ' streamer ' of negative charges leaps from the bottom of the cloud , it is attracted to the ground , which in turn emits a streamer of positive charges from the ground up
this is why these stepped leaders typically travel straight down from the cloud ( pictured ) however , the upward movement of the lightning in mr scott murray 's image does n't appear to extend as high as other forms of upward lightning , and storm chaser dan robinson suggests an alternative
he explained : ' sometimes a lightning channel will have the illusion of ' looping back ' on itself or having bright knots in it
this flash temporarily equalises the charged regions , until the opposite charges build up again
upwards lightning is normally caused by a preceding flash moving from the cloud to earth , and involves a bolt moving from the ground to the clouds upward lightning is typically classified into three groups
the upward movement in mr scott murray 's image does n't appear to extend this high , however , and storm chaser dan robinson said if part of a bolt is coming straight at you , it will appear to loop back on itself even when it 's not ' most of the time you 'll view a lightning channel from the side and it 'll appear to travel in one general direction only
' however , if that lightning bolt - or part of the lightning bolt - is coming straight at you , that is , you are looking at it from one end
