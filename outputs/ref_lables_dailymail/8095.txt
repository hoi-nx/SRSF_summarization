missoula : rape and the justice system in a college town , a doubleday publication that was released tuesday , immediately sparked a fierce debate in montana and beyond

â in an effort to shed light on the rape epidemic and spark a national conversation , krakauer had interviewed five alleged victims of rape for his book , among them belnap , who revealed that during her sophomore year at the university of montana , she was gang - raped by four members of the beloved local grizzy football team
speaking to nightline , miss belnap said on the night of the alleged attack in december 2010 , she was playing drinking games at an off - campus party celebrating the end of the finals
explosive : bestsellng author and journalist krakauer released missoula : rape and the justice system in a college town on april 21 she downed up to 11 shots of 99 - proof alcohol within an hour and soon was slipping in and out of consciousness
â belnap argued that it was n't alcohol that crossed a line and ' stuck a penis ' in her face that night - it was four grizzly football players
in the end , missoula prosecutors ruled that there was no probable cause to charge belnap 's alleged attackers
police and prosecutors said that belnap had told investigators the men ' would have likely believed it was consensual sex â - a claim that was repeated by the players and several witnesses at the party
krakauer 's new book also features the story of another young woman , huguet , who was also raped by a university of montana football player whom she has known since childhood
huguet had left montana to attend an out - of - state college but returned to missoula in december 2010 for a party with her long - time friend , beau donaldson
belnap ( left ) claimed four players gang - raped her in 2010 , but prosecutors never charged them citing lack of probable cause ' and i woke up to a lot of pain , and a lot of pressure , and the sound of somebody moaning , and quickly realized it was beau donaldson , â huguet said
as she was struggling to push her case forward in the months following beau donaldson âs arrest , huguet discovered that another young woman , mclaughlin , had accused him of raping her in 2008 but she never reported the attack to police
. in an interview with nightline , mclaughlin said she is filled with remorse because she could have possibly prevented the attack on huguet had she blown the whistle on beau donaldson seven years ago
during beau donaldson 's trial , mclaughlin finally shared her story in court , helping seal the defendant 's fate
changes : the university created a small sexual assault prevention department last year and its athletic department created a new code of conduct that addresses sexual assault the department of justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the missoula police between january 2008 and may 2012 in september 2012 , beau donaldson , the former star of the grizzlies , pleaded guilty to rape and was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison
the disturbing news from missoula prompted the us department of justice to launch an investigation into the university of montana , the local police department and the prosecutor 's office
' missoula is a much safer place for women now than it was when i first started looking at it in 2012 , ' krakauer said
missoula county attorney kirsten pabst on wednesday held a press conference to address the issues raised by krakauer 's latest book
mr krakauer , pictured speaking in 2009 , is the best selling author of works such as into thin air and into the wild while mr krakauer 's story focuses on montana , the book 's scope is more global
missoula is described as ' a typical college town ' and mr krakauer 's website said that rape victims are ' deserving of compassion from society and fairness from a justice system that is clearly broken '
mr krakauer decided to write the book ' after learning that a young woman with whom he and his wife have a close relationship suffered intensely in secret for many years after she was raped by a man she trusted , ' according to usa today
mr krakauer 's book says that it ' cuts through the abstract ideological debate about campus rape '
