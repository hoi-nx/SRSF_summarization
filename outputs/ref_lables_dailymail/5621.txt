left his post : army sgt. bergdahl walked away from the army and was captured by the taliban in june of 2009 the former chairman of the joint chiefs admiral mike mullen knew that army sgt. bergdhal deserted his post in 2009 , claim three of the controversial soldier 's comrades
the men say that mike mullen , who served president obama and then secretary of defense robert gates six years ago , was certain that bergdahl had fled the army and was guilty of desertion
the claims mean that mike mullen was in a position to tell the president his soldier had run away five years before national security adviser susan rice told the world that bergdahl served honorably
' i asked him ( mike mullen ) if he knew about bergdahl and that he deserted and he ( mike mullen ) told me that he knew of the circumstances surrounding his walking off , ' said former sgt. matt vierkant told fox , ' and that they were developing leads and following leads , trying to do everything they could to get him back
vierkrant claims that during an unguarded question and answer session , mike mullen said they could ask him anything
' so matt vierkant asked him , you know bergdahl deserted , what 's going on with that ? and admiral mike mullen said , ' yes , we know all the circumstances surrounding bergdahl walking away from the op ( outpost , ) and we 're still working on getting him back , figuring out where he is and kind of figuring out that whole situation
' scroll down for video admiral mike mullen , former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , allegedly told three comrades of bergdahl that the soldier was a deserter specialist cody full confirmed that this is what mike mullen said as did buetow
' according to former house aides this means it is inconceivable that mike mullen would not have told president obama and raises questions as to the prisoner swap for a known deserter
' if mike mullen knew , and now it 's alleged that he did know , it would be , it would be unthinkable that he did n't pump this up the chain of command , his chain of command , or , tell the president directly , ' said brad blakeman , a former bush house staffer to fox news
' days after his rescue ( right ) , bergdahl ( pictured left in a video released by the taliban in 2010 ) was in stable condition at a u.s. military hospital in germany u.s. president obama stands with bob bergdahl ( r ) and jami bergdahl ( l ) as he delivers a statement about the release of their son , prisoner of war army sergeant bergdahl , in the rose garden at the house in may , 2014 mike mullen spoke to fox news and defended his decisions
' i want to ask him ( mike mullen ) did they brief the house ? who knew about it and why would you still do this trade knowing all the information that you knew ? ' said matt vierkant
' bergdahl is charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy
