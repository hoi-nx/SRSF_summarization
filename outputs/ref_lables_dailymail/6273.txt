a doctor who ploughed into an elderly couple in a 50mph head on crash while rushing to work has escaped prosecution after the police officer investigating the case went off sick
the female driver in a toyota pulled in front of colin kay as he was driving his citroen picasso on the a586 in great eccleston in lancashire last year
the collision was captured on film as mr colin kay had fitted a camera to his dashboard and revealed how he had no time to react and avoid the crash
but despite having evidence recorded on his dashcam , mr colin kay has now been told there will be no further action because the investigating officer went off sick and they could not prepare the paperwork in time
the retired engineer from bacup in lancashire , said : ' i contacted the police because i was keen to see a full prosecution to stop more careless driving
' but nothing has been done because the investigating officer went off sick and they could not prepare the paperwork in time
mr colin kay has taken his case to the ipcc after the driver who ploughed into his car will not face any further action after the investigating officer went off sick ' i think it is disgusting
he says it is disgusting that there will be no action due the case not being picked up by another officer ' my wife and i were very lucky that we were not more seriously hurt and we are very disappointed that no police action has been taken in this case
' after the incident last year , the doctor driving the toyota also had to be cut from her vehicle and was taken to the royal preston hospital by air ambulance
' unfortunately , the officer in the case was off sick and the report was not processed within the allocated time frame for prosecution
