something odd is going on this year in goa - and it has to do with the rows of empty sunbeds
with the rouble in trouble , russian are freezing at home , rather than sizzling in india 's flop - in - the - sun western state
sorry to be mean , but it 's all too good to be true for the rest of us
blissful : agonda beach is one of the many relaxed stretches of shoreline along the edge of goa the beaches are more relaxed , the restaurants and bars quieter , the accessories less shiny
on the beach , goans peddling pedicures and sarongs smile and tell us we are ' very pale ' , adding : ' you wo n't stay that way for long
' even without the russian , the beach is a hive of activity
goa has 11 hours of sunshine a day at this time of year
the ball 's in your court : goa has a famously relaxed ambience , and is a real favourite with tourists you can eat famously here for no more than Â£ 20 a head
which is to say that he hopes the rouble revives and the russian return
