a warming climate may have enabled the earliest humans to venture into europe 1.4 million years ago , a new study suggests
spain researchers say climate change impacted human migration
until 1.4 million years ago it was too cold to inhabit southeast spain
but then the climate warmed to 13 Â° c ( 55 â° f ) and became more humid
this enabled hominins ( stock image shown ) - our distant ancestors - to move to new regions the research was led by dr jordi agusti from the icrea ( icrea )
here , simple oldowan tools have previously been found , linked to the earliest known hominins 1.4 million years ago , reported popular archaeology
here , simple oldowan tools have previously been found , linked to the earliest known hominins 1.4 million years ago the acheulean tool technology period - between 700,000 an 300,000 years ago - followed the more primitive oldowan period
at the time 1.4 million years ago , though , temperatures warmed above 13 Â° c ( 55 â° f ) and humidity increased , allowing hominins to inhabit the region - scavenging carcasses in the region with the help of tools
