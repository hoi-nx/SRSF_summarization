it was , as so often this season , the story of two chelsea rising stars in the form of their young lives
and here , with yet another devastating performance , they put chelsea within touching distance of retaining the fa youth cup , in the process further augmenting their remarkable goalscoring tallies and enhancing their growing reputations
tammy abraham wheels away in celebration as he notches for chelsea away at manchester city in the fa youth cup final first leg chelsea striker abraham opens the scoring against manchester with an impressive right - footed shot into the far corner isaac buckley-ricketts is mobbed by his manchester city team - mates following his equaliser against chelsea in the fa youth cup abraham is congratulated by his chelsea team - mates as his acrobatic effort regained their advantage against manchester city abraham is congratulated by his chelsea team - mates having given the west london side the lead against manchester city after manchester city were put to the sword in this first leg on monday night , the pair âs records for the season stand like this : tammy abraham - 36 goals ; dominic solanke - 35 goals
when dominic solanke had raced through to make it 3 - 1 just before the end , you sensed it was a fatal blow
of course there is a chance manchester city may fight back - nothing is out of the question in youth football - but there was something about chelsea âs dominance here that suggests it is unlikely
â indeed it was and the unfailing right boot of abraham provided a moment to savour after just seven minutes
within minutes , abraham was trending on twitter , clips of his immaculate hit racking up the retweets the world over
by then he had a second , restoring chelsea âs lead on 20 minutes after isaac buckley had briefly restored parity for the hosts
goal no 36 of the campaign was nât quite as memorable as no 35 but it was athletic , abraham hooking the ball home from six yards out after isaiah brown âs header from a colkett corner had been saved by the foot of haug and then headed back into his vicinity
from then , aside from a five - minute flurry late on when manchester city had genuine chances to equalise , chelsea were in complete command

it had actually been a quiet night for dominic solanke but this goal preserves his remarkable record of scoring in every round of this season âs fa youth cup
manchester city , who were watched by manuel pellegrini , vincent kompany , aleksander kolarov and a near - full house at their handsome academy stadium , had levelled within two minutes of abraham âs opener
chelsea were guilty of a lapse in defensive concentration very unlike them and manchester city swept through to punish

edwards was proud of the performance but still exercised a note of caution : â we got the goal on the break , dominic solanke was very clinical and i think that 3 - 1 scoreline does nât overly flatter us because their spell was just a spell in amongst a game we dominated
