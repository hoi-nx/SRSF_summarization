and the latter was all smiles alongside victor valdes as they travelled down to london on friday
falcao is one of several selection dilemmas that van gaal and assistant boss giggs have to make for the trip against chelsea ; in what the dutchman described as â the worst scenario â
michael carrick ( left ) limped off against manchester city while marcos rojo picked up an injury soon after van gaal also revealed in his pre-match press conference that daley blind ( left ) and phil jones are out wayne rooney ( right ) has impressed up front in recent weeks but may have to drop further back into midfield van gaal ( left ) puts his arm round united captain wayne rooney during training this week van gaal ( left ) has revealed that wayne rooney may play in holding midfield role against chelsea 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 : de gea ; valencia , chris smalling , blackett , luke ; wayne rooney ; mata , herrera , fellaini , young ; falcao â i have to tell that we have four injuries who played the last match so that âs not so good for us , â said van gaal
michael carrick is out and marcos rojo is out , but also blind and phil jones , ' the 63 - year - old said at united 's pre-match press conference on friday
â that âs the worst scenario because marcos rojo and phil jones are good players at the left central defender position
blind and michael carrick could play the midfield holding position and i do nât have any other option , or i have to play wayne rooney in that position again
â you have seen that i took phil jones off pitch ( against manchester city ) because of injury , you have seen that michael carrick was off the pitch , you have seen the tackle of kompany against blind
only marcos rojo is a little bit surprising because he felt it the day after the match
blind and phil jones were very close to playing but it was not enough
â van gaal addresses the media ahead of united 's crucial premier league clash with chelsea on saturday luke has n't featured under van gaal recently but should return to play at left back mata ( right ) is closed down by his united team - mates during a training session on friday fellaini will be hoping to continue his impressive form against chelsea on saturday evening fellaini ( centre right ) is embraced by his team - mates after scoring against rivals manchester city last week sports analysts bsports predict that a chelsea win is easily the most likely outcome at stamford bridge asked if luke could return for the first time since being substituted in the fa cup defeat to arsenal last month amid concerns over his fitness , van gaal replied : â maybe you shall see tomorrow [ saturday ]
â with chelsea holding an eight - point lead and a game in hand over third - placed united , van gaal believes it is asking too much for his team to win the title
the fact is that we are behind chelsea
â but , alright , we have to play against them and so do arsenal so we can lay pressure on chelsea âs shoulders
you never know , you âve seen it in previous premier league seasons
â they play at home but i think that chelsea will be satisfied with a draw
of course they will want to beat united and we want to beat them , the question is how long players can play in the discipline
robin van persie ( back right ) has only been training with united for a week but may return to feature â we live for these titles , we are doing this for that
