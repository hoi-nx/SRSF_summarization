szczesny will start in the fa cup semi-final but the future looks bleak for the poland goalkeeper who has been deposed as arsenal âs no 1
wenger confirmed szczesny will play ahead of david ospina against reading at wembley on saturday but offered no further guarantees
â at the moment , i hope yes , â said wenger , after a long , uncharacteristic hesitation , when asked if szczesny had a long - term future at the club
szczesny will start in goal for arsenal for the their fa cup clash with reading at wembley â his attitude is very good
â szczesny is understood to be content with his situation and confident of winning back his place
his arsenal contract runs until 2018 , but he has made just three appearances â all in the fa cup â since an error - strewn display at southampton on new year âs day
arsenal have greatly improved since the defeat at st mary âs when szczesny mix - ups led to two goals
he then infuriated wenger after the game by puffing on a cigarette in the showers
the polish international has lost his place to david ospina after a number of errors this season former arsenal midfielder jensen went on danish television before the smoking revelations and claimed szczesny had been fined and would not play for wenger again
david ospina came in for the next game against hull in the fa cup third round and stayed in goal when arsenal played stoke in the premier league a week later
â they know the rules , â said wenger
the colombian has taken his chance with both hands , winning 11 out the 12 games he 's started in goal â it is important two goalkeepers get competition and he will get that in the fa cup now as long as ospina plays in the premier league
â ospina has won 11 of 12 premier league games since the szczesny chop , but he could not prevent a 3 - 1 defeat in the first leg of the champions league tie against monaco.his unfussy style has solidified a notoriously brittle team
wenger admits that szczesny lost his place to his errors but insists he 's working hard in training ospina is a soothing influence and wenger âs belated decision to grasp the nettle has strengthened the team , together with the unexpected advances of francis coquelin and bellerin
wenger will be aware of this and was reluctant to smother david ospina with the credit for a run of 16 wins in 18 games since southampton
â francis coquelin ( centre ) has been one of the success stories of the season and is a key player for arsenal it was not overwhelming backing for his no 1 and supports the idea that wenger will prioritise signing another keeper in the summer when chelsea âs petr cech will be on the market
the colombian was happy to sign as no 2 and challenge szczesny but that is a different psychological proposition to losing your no 1 status to a big - money signing , despite having performed so well
a move for petr cech has been spoken about but it remains to be seen of wenger will bring in another keeper
