a man who passed out at a friend 's party woke up with more than a hangover when he discovered a guest had tattooed his back
while josh , 24 , slept , his mate rob , also 24 , inked the words ' if found face down call an ambulance ' on his back , using a diy kit
josh , from mossley , near ashton , only discovered the prank the following day after looking in a mirror - and said his partner went ' absolutely bonkers ' when she saw it
josh awoke after a party to find that his friend had tattooed his back josh ( centre ) was tattooed by his friend rob ( right ) who was taking revenge on his mate after josh had attempted to tattoo rob with an at - home kit and it went horribly wrong rob said he carried out the practical joke on josh , who had passed out at a new year 's eve party , in revenge for a tattoo josh did on rob 's leg two years ago - which had gone horribly wrong
starting off with a design for a lizard , josh tried to turn it into a cross , then some hands and a gun - leading to one almighty , permanent mess on rob 's leg and causing his partner to go ' bonkers '
so when he saw josh passed out at the party , rob - who is a father of three - said he ' could n't resist ' the opportunity to execute revenge - and spent 30 minutes etching his own design into his mate 's back
amazingly , the prank has n't harmed the pair 's friendship - and the childhood friends , who are both having their tattoos removed , still see each other every day
but since i found out it was rob it has n't affected our friendship at all - we still see each other every day
' rob , also a support worker , added that he would advise anyone against at - home tattoos
' we had bought a diy tattoo kit online and originally it was a well - intentioned exercise , ' he said
the pair are both getting their tattoos removed by laser technician maria ( right ) and say the incident has n't affected their friendship ' josh started off doing a lizard , then a cross , then some hands and a gun - he did an abomination of a job and every time he tried to touch it up it got worse
' the pair are now getting their tattoos removed with laser treatment - carried out by technician maria at the clinic she runs based at her ashton home
