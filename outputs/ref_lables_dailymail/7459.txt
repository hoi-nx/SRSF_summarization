vitamin and mineral supplements are becoming more and more popular as health conscious shoppers focus on good nutrition , but do we really need pills to optimise our diet ? not according to nutritionist and author sarah flower , who says that cooking with the right ingredients should give you all the goodness you need
' the cleaner your diet - using fresh ingredients and cooking at home - the less likely you are to need to rely on supplements to boost your health
' and while it may seem like common sense to eat more unprocessed and raw foods , ms sarah flower believes we are still not doing enough
' we are living in a society where it is possible to be overweight and deficient in essential nutrients
' a diet rich in oily fish , whole grains , lean protein , fruit and vegetables should provide enough nutrients , ' she said
other factors to consider include your ability to absorb the food - digestive complaints can often impede our ability to absorb nutrients
' pregnancy , ill health and the elderly may need more support , ' she said
and menstruating women may benefit from adding oils ( evening primrose oil ) and a multivitamin rich in magnesium to help alleviate pmt symptoms ( ms flowers recommends magnesium citrate )
always opt for steaming over boiling vegetables and eat as many raw pieces as you can every day ' fruit and vegetables not only contain vitamins but also vital phytonutrients , which have an amazing ability to protect us against degenerative diseases such as cancer , alzheimer 's and heart disease , ' ms flowers said
' children especially need to be encouraged to try a variety of vegetables
' the nutritionist is also a keen advocate of incorporating as much healthy fat as possibly into your diet
' oily fish , nuts and seeds contain vital nutrients so ignore the calorie counts and give your body the healthy food it craves and needs
' healthy fat does nât make you fat ; a diet rich in processed carbohydrates and sugar makes you fat
' a high carbohydrate , sugar rich diet keeps you hungry but also stops you absorbing vital nutrients , causes depression , fatigue and energy dips
