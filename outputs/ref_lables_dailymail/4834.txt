an innocent man who spent more than 30 years on death row for a murder he did n't commit has come face - to - face with the prosecutor who put him there
ford , who was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer after his release last year , was too weak to stand when stroud walked into his louisiana home last week but shook his hand
' i want you to know that i am very sorry , ' stroud said during the somber meeting , which was filmed by nightline
' ' right , ' ford responded , without looking up
ford was released from prison in angola last year face - to - face : the 65 - year - old , who was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer shortly after being freed from prison , shook the former prosecutor 's hand as he walked into his home ' i 'm sorry , ' ford added
' stroud , who wished ford the best before leaving the home , had asked to meet the man after apologizing to him in a powerful letter published in the shreveport times last month
in the letter , stroud admitted that he was to blame for mistakenly putting ford behind bars for the fatal shooting of a jeweler , despite no murder weapon or witnesses placing him at the scene
i was not as interested in justice as i was in winning
' stroud , 63 , wrote the letter after the state ruled that ford was not entitled to receive $ 330,000 in compensation for his time spent behind bars because he could not prove he did not know about the killing before it was carried out
' ford should be completely compensated to every extent possible because of the flaws of a system that effectively destroyed his life , ' stroud wrote
struggle : ford told stroud that he could not forgive him for what he had done as a young lawyer pain : after stroud left , ford was overcome with emotion and was comforted by his carers , pictured ' the audacity of the state 's effort to deny mr. ford any compensation for the horrors he suffered in the name of louisiana justice is appalling
' ford was accused of shooting rozeman , a shreveport jeweler and watchmaker for whom mr ford had done occasional yard work , in 1983 and was convicted the following year
he was sent to prison , where he lived with little light or heat , while stroud , who had been with the caddo district attorney 's office for two years , went out to celebrate by having drinks with his team
regrets : a.m. ' marty ' stroud iii , pictured , wrote a lengthy apology letter to ford last month that was published in a local newspaper
wrongly accused : ford , a father - of - four ( pictured in a booking photo ) , was sent to death row in 1984 ' my fault was that i was too passive , ' stroud said in his letter last month
ford , who is black , also faced an all - white jury
' i apologize to ford for all the misery i have caused him and his family , ' stroud wrote
he is suing the state for denying him medical care for his lung cancer , which is now terminal his lawyers set up an amazon wishlist for strangers to donate funds and items - from furniture to clothing - so ford could start to re-build his life , and he continues to accept donations
ahead of the meeting with stroud , he told nightline he was shocked by stroud 's letter , but that he refused to get angry over his situation
