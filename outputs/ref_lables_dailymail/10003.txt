we may not be able to hear it , but the earth is constantly oscillating and creating a hum that has been likened to the ring of a bell
it 's long been known that earthquakes and their seismic activity contribute to this ringing , but researchers have now proved ocean waves also play a role
as so - called short waves collide near the surface they create weak microseismic waves , which combine with long , more powerful waves dragging across the ocean 's floor to create the constant hum. it 's long been known that earthquakes contribute to making the earth ring like a bell , but researchers have now proved ocean waves also play a role
as short waves collide near the surface they create weak microseismic waves , which combine with long waves on the ocean 's floor to create a constant hum earthquakes shake the planet in such a way that the earth can oscillate for months after the seismic event
a team of japanese and californian seismologists first suggested ocean waves may cause this hum in 2004
using data from 2008 , a french team found that ocean waves colliding generate seismic activity , but these waves only take 13 seconds or less to complete a single oscillation
as these long waves travel over the ocean floor they meet resistance , especially as they pass over the steep continental shelves , and this friction helps create long seismic waves , that oscillate much slower
they began by studying and measuring seismic activity across the globe , including earthquakes , storms and the movement of ocean waves , throughout 2008
' ocean waves provide most of the energy that feeds the continuous vertical oscillations of the solid earth , ' said the researchers
from this , the team could conclude the hum was caused by the storm , and not leftover from the seismic events using seismic readings from 2008 , a french team spotted that ocean waves colliding generate seismic activity , but these waves only take 13 seconds to complete a single oscillation
' motions in all three bands are recorded everywhere on the planet and the team said they can provide information on both the solid earth structure , the ocean wave climate over the past century , and the properties of short period ocean waves
' yet , the use of seismic data is limited because where and how ocean waves rock the earth is not known , in particular for the hum , ' continued the team
' the hum is the least understood part of earth 's oscillations
as these so - called long waves travel over the ocean floor ( stock image ) and continental shelves they create seismic waves that oscillate much slower
this means that earthquakes , colliding oceans and long waves all combine to create the earth 's hum they did n't explain why slow seismic waves - which provide the most powerful bell - like ringing - can last for longer than 50 seconds
as these long waves travel over the ocean floor they meet resistance , especially as they pass over the steep continental shelves , and this helps create long seismic waves that oscillate much slower
this means that all three theories - earthquakes , colliding oceans and long waves - combine to create the earth 's hum. although the majority comes from the latter
mr ardhuin said that by measuring and understanding long , microseismic waves , researchers can learn more about how the earth is structured
