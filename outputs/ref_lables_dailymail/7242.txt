jet - setter : elvis bought both planes in 1975 they 've been one of the biggest highlights of graceland for 30 years
memphis agreed yesterday that hound dog ii and lisa marie â named after the king of rock â n â roll âs daughter â can be moved from his estate to a site nearby
it means tourists to graceland will have to pay extra if they want to see the two jets , which are to form a new , separate museum about the dead singer
graceland visitors can currently buy a ticket that includes a tour of elvis 's home - turned - museum and the interiors of the two planes
they have been at the estate since the mid- 1980s after graceland âs managing company , epe ( epe ) , agreed that the planes â owner , okc , could have a cut of graceland ticket sales
okc spokesman tim mccaskill told memphis this week that the goal was for construction work at the planes â new home to be finished in time for them to be moved there for elvis week in august
the site is on the same street as graceland
big hit : the lisa marie , pictured in the grounds of graceland , was given a major overhaul by elvis hound dog ii : the smaller jet was used by the star during lisa marie 's refit and was also his back - up plane okc has been in a lengthy dispute with epe , which was bought by new york - based authentic brands group in 2013
elvis 's bedroom : the lisa marie had a custom - made , queen - sized bed for the star , who liked to fly at night perfectly preserved : a table and chairs in the plane
the seats are now covered in plastic to protect them lounge in the sky : there are four tvs in total plus a videotape system in the lisa marie hot on design : elvis , who oversaw the plane 's refurbishment , insisted on gold bathroom taps then last september , okc put them up for sale , saying if they could nât stay at elvis âs former home , they would have to be sold
but they were withdrawn from sale , and okc made arrangements to have them displayed on land adjacent to graceland
hound dog ii was bought by elvis for $ 900,000 in september 1975 â less than two years before his death
in november 1975 he paid $ 250,000 for the larger but secondhand plane lisa marie , and spent at least $ 300,000 having it renovated
he would use hound dog ii - a lockheed jetstar - to fly to lisa marie âs hangar to see how the refit was going
the lisa marie was installed at graceland in 1984 and the hound dog ii soon afterwards
