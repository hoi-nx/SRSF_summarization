bath abbey could be linked to the city 's roman water network to heat the vast medieval church using ancient underground springs
the church of england âs ambitious plans involve harnessing the energy of roman bath âs 45 Â° c spring water to power a modern heating system for the building
bath abbey ( pictured ) could have the world 's first natural underfloor heating system sourced from spring water in roman drains
engineers plan to excavate ancient crypts below the church to tap into a roman drain where 850,000 litres of natural spring water empties every day into the ground
plans show how bath abbey will use water from the city 's ancient springs , which heat water used in its roan baths
waste water currently filters out to the avon but could be put to use under the new scheme an artist 's impression of plans for bath abbey shows how the ground will be excavated to create the heating system , new work space and song school today , excavation work is taking place on kingston parade outside the visitor âs information centre to determine the feasibility of installing the system
each day , a quarter of a million gallons of hot water flow through the roman bath from the thermal spring located at the heart of the site
the idea is , that it this waste water was harnessed correctly and converted , it could produce 1.5 megawatts of continuous energy â enough to heat bath abbey and the world - famous roman bath and pump room complex
the church of england âs ambitious plans involve harnessing the energy of roman bath âs 45 Â° c spring water to power a modern heating system for the building
the idea is that waste water from the baths escaping down the great roman drain would enter a hidden thermal heat exchange and heat the bath abbey ( illustrated above ) engineers plan to tap the power of warm waste water from the roman bathing complex ( pictured )
engineers are currently digging 13 ft ( 4 metres ) below the ground to work out what lies in the space and if it could be suitable to house a thermal heat exchanger the plans for bath abbey 's underfloor heating may use modern technologies , but will make use of the same natural spring tapped by the roman
a large quantity of this hot water eventually ends up in the nearby avon ( pictured ) â passing through the great roman drain the modern elements of the system would be hidden underground and an archaeologist will be working alongside the engineers to document any objects that may be uncovered by the excavation
â the abbey lies at the heart of what was once roman bath , and our architects have located a drain where spring water flows
â our plan is to remove the floor of the bath abbey , dig down and divert the drain and then pump the water through an underground heating system to warm the church
' today , excavation work is taking place on kingston parade outside the visitor âs information centre to determine the feasibility of installing the system a new work space could be created beneath the ground under the plans to excavate parts of bath abbey some 850,000 litres of spring water which usually filters through to the avon will be used to heat the bath abbey
