my first trip to new york was with my aunt when i was about 18 and i had been appearing in coronation street for about 12 months
we returned to the city that never sleeps in january 2001 , eight months before the terrible events of 9/11 , and one of the first things my boyfriend sylvain longchambon and i did on my latest trip was to visit the site of the world trade center to see the monument to those who died
coronation street star samia ghadie and boyfriend sylvain longchambon take a selfie in new york there were hundreds of people visiting the memorial at the time but everybody was quiet and extremely respectful
sylvain longchambon and i flew to the us from manchester and spent four nights in the city
we stayed at the marriott where the service was fantastic - when we checked in the concierge desk wanted to know if they could help us to make bookings for shows or restaurants
you do n't get that at a travelodge ! we had a beautiful suite on the 31st floor , giving us panoramic views of central park
we valued the fact that the suite had a separate lounge area , and it came in really handy because during our stay sylvain longchambon 's cousin in new york celebrated his 30th birthday , so lots of people came back to our room for a glass of bubbly
the jw marriott essex house as seen from central park , of which it boasts panoramic views one of samia ghadie and sylvain longchambon 's first stops was to pay their respects to those lost on september 11 , 2001 on the second night of our break , we went on the bateaux new york cruise , which offers an unforgettable three - hour trip along the hudson
we enjoyed cocktails and then a great three - course meal , and after that there was music and dancing
president obama was in new york to address the united nations and as we were in a taxi heading for the pier to board the cruise , we discovered that the police had closed a lot of the streets to let the president 's motorcade through
the couple , who met as partners on dancing on ice , enjoyed a bateaux nyc of the hudson the bright lights and busy traffic of fifth avenue which samia covered extensively during her four - day trip during our break , we saw most of the famous sights , including the statue of liberty , where we took some great pictures
we wanted to have a juicy steak at a proper new york steakhouse
friends had told us about a place called burger joint in le parker meridien hotel - it does n't look very special ( in fact , there 's graffiti all over the walls outside ) but it 's reckoned to serve the best burgers in town
it was sylvain longchambon 's first visit to new york and he absolutely loved it
i calculated that many things were half the price compared with the uk - so how could i resist ? while samia ghadie shopped at famed new york stores such as tiffany , sylvain longchambon worked out in the gym for bargain shopping , samia recommends discount outlet store century 21 for lots of major brands sylvain longchambon was n't always my shopping buddy
a crowd of paparazzi turned out to be for lady gaga , but sadly a selfie with the pop star was n't an option despite our world renown as an ice - dancing couple - we met while we were partners on the itv show dancing on ice - we managed to resist the lure of the rink at the rockefeller centre
for sylvain longchambon , ice skating is too much like work
perhaps the biggest surprise of the trip was when we had stopped to have lunch at a small italian restaurant on central park near our hotel while we were eating , we noticed a crowd gathering - with lots of paparazzi photographers
