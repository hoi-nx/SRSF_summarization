the strange formation was photographed by amateur astronomer gordon ewen , and is a sun spot
the phenomenon is fairly common and the number of spots on the solar surface reflects with how active the sun is
they occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce , making a specific section of the sun stand out from its surroundings
each one can be more than ten times the size of our planet gordon ewen captured the festive photograph using a telescope at the bottom of his garden
sunspots have a temperature of anywhere from 2,700 to 4,200 â° c ( 4,890 to 7,590 Â° f ) , compared to 5,500 Â° c ( 9,930 â° f ) for the surrounding solar material , which is why they are so visible
sunspots are also sometimes the source of eruptions on the sun , namely solar flares no , the picture on the left is not a sun spot ... : the photograph of the chick - like sunspot was taken using gordon ewen 's telescope that focuses on a specific wavelength of light
this allows him to see the details created on the sun 's surface ( another example of his work pictured , right ) mr gordon ewen , 57 , set up the observatory ( pictured ) shed at the bottom of the garden in letchworth , hertfordshire , after he left his job five years ago
i remember i used to love borrowing books about space from the library , ' he said they can have a temperature of anywhere from 2,700 to 4,200 â° c ( 4,890 to 7,590 Â° f ) , compared to 5,500 Â° c ( 9,930 â° f ) for the surrounding solar material , which is why they are so visible
sun spots are also the source of eruptions on the sun , mainly solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , all of which are linked to magnetic fields ( a picture of a coronal mass ejection taken by mr gordon ewen , pictured )
