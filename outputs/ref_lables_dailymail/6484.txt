conservative plans to raise billions of pounds from the ' grubby hands of scroungers ' will not work , clegg warned today as he unveiled lib dem plans to balance the books
the lib dem leader promised to ' spread the burden ' of deficit reduction , with cuts to welfare and whitehall budgets along with tax rises aimed at the very wealthy
car tax would rise by Â£ 25 - a - year
but he scaled back his plans for a mansion tax , amid concern it could cost the party support in key seats in affluent parts of london
but he mocked osborne 's insistence that another Â£ 12billion can be found from the welfare budget
mr clegg warned that it was ' quite simply impossible ' to find savings on that scale without causing ' real pain to millions of families ' and some of the most vulnerable people
the lib dem set out plans to cap rises in working age benefits at 1 per cent to two years
' he added : ' our plan means finding more than Â£ 3billion in savings from the welfare budget

' it emerged that the lib dem have scaled down the amount of money they expect their mansion tax proposal to generate by Â£ 700million
properties valued at Â£ 2 million or more would be subject to the party 's so - called ' high value property levy ' from 2017 - 18 , which they say would collect Â£ 1 billion - down from the Â£ 1.7 billion previously estimated
