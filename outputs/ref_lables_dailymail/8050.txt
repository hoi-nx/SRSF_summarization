rangers boss mccall ordered his side to end their stuttering away form at dumbarton on saturday to ramp up the pressure on play - off rivals hibs
the ibrox boss watched his side drop two points against bottom side livingston in west lothian but insisted the 1 - 1 draw â with myles and marius zaliukas trading goals â could end up being crucial in the quest to finish second
rangers have only won once in their last five away matches and mccall insists nothing less than a victory will do at the bet butler stadium this weekend as his side aim to go four clear in second while hibs face falkirk in the scottish cup semi finals
mccall wants his side to put their away - day blues behind them at dumbarton on saturday â we could be four ahead on saturday night so that might be a very important point for us tonight , â said mccall on a night when rangers fans let off a series of fireworks in the energy assets arena
they are a physical side and hibs and queen of the south have still to come here
rangers dropped two points at championship bottom side livingston in their bid for promotion myles gave livingston the lead early in the second half and threatened to upset rangers â it was a game that panned out the way i expected on a tight park , dry and bumpy
marius zaliukas equalised a couple of minutes later for rangers at the energy assets arena â i âm just really disappointed
and i just feel if we had weathered that then rangers would have run out of ideas
â it was not the best we have played but i felt we more than matched rangers tonight
