a four - year - old boy got trapped in an arcade game after climbing in to the ' claw ' machine when he failed to win a teddy
henry narrowly failed to pick up a despicable me toy as he played the notoriously difficult claw game at his local swimming pool in tamworth , staffordshire
desperate to get to his hands on the teddy , he put his hand inside the machine 's hatch - but when he reached too far , he slipped under the trap door and was stuck inside
she alerted staff at the snowdome leisure centre , but henry was trapped for half an hour as workers looked for the key to the machine
mrs howes , 33 , said : ' he asked if he could have a go on the teddy machine so i gave him Â£ 1 and told him to go with his big brother
' off they went round the corner and then his brother came back and said , " henry is stuck in the machine
" i assumed he meant his hand - i did n't think he 'd be inside the machine
he was completely inside it ! ' he had picked the teddy up with the claw and it had dropped with the teddy 's leg hanging over the edge
struggle : it took workers half an hour to free henry as they searched for the keys to the machine free at last : henry eventually made his way out of the machine - and got to keep the cuddly toy ' he opened up the hatch and reached up to get it and when his bottom got under the hatch door it just flipped down
' henry had previously gone for a swimming lesson with harvey , and was waiting for his sister scarlett , seven , to finish her class when he got stuck in the machine
relief : henry 's mother emma said she could tell that the young boy was unhurt while in the machine venue : henry had just finished a swimming lesson at the snowdome in tamworth , pictured as staff hunted for the keys , mrs howes tried to encourage henry to open the machine from the inside , but he refused because he did n't want to release the teddy from his grasp
