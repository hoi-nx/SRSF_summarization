maloney , pictured at ukip 's spring conference in february , now says that a vote for the party is ' wasted ' maloney has said that a vote for ukip is a wasted vote
the celebrity former boxing promoter , formerly known as frank , is one of the party 's most famous former candidates
but she warned ukip supporters should vote tory to keep miliband and sturgeon out of power
she told sky news : ' if we want to stop labour and the snp i think you âve got to vote tory
a vote for ukip would be quite wasted i believe
' i know ukip are not going to like hearing that , but if they âre honest they would say the same things as well because they âre not going to get enough seats to wield any power
' but she warned how other candidates have given the party a bad image
' the former boxing promoter , who stood as the party 's candidate for london mayor in 2004 , has just undergone a full gender re-assignment
' so the way to stop labour / snp coalition is for labour voters to switch and vote for ukip
she apologised for the homophobic remarks when she addressed ukip 's spring conference in february this year
mr farage last night said he believed ukip could ' smash up ' labour 's ' one - party state ' in the north
in an article for mailonline he said mr miliband 's party ' simply do not understand ' the impact mass immigration has had on people 's lives
ukip âs strategists believe the party could come second in at least 100 seats in the north
in 2010 , ukip took just seven per cent of the vote and labour âs iain wright retained the seat with a 5,509 majority
