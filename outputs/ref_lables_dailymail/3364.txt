yulia , pictured with paul after giving birth , gained less than a stone during her first pregnancy , and took less than two weeks to get back to her starting weight of 8st life coach yulia stuck to a vegan diet consisting of massive quantities of fruit , vegetables and juice ' i would never advise anyone to stay vegan during pregnancy , it 's not only about you - it 's about the baby
' you obviously do nât need to eat twice as much - do nât eat for two ! - around 300 extra calories is fine , but you need quality protein , which is hard to get on a vegan diet
' on top of her healthy diet , she endured hours of running , cycling and lifting weights as dr phd marilyn glenville ( www.marilynglenville.com ) explains : ' eating healthily means eating regular meals of freshly prepared whole foods
