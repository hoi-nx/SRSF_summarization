clegg tonight vowed to block the tories imposing deep welfare cuts as the price of any future coalition deal
the deputy prime minister said he would not allow the liberal democrats to prop david cameron up in power if he insisted on pushing ahead with his plan to slash Â£ 12billion from the benefits bill
in an interview on the bbc , mr clegg also suggested he would veto a new deal unless the tories agreed new taxes on the rich
but the deputy prime minister defended his record in government with mr david cameron
asked if he was proud of his record in power , mr clegg said : ' hell yes
mr clegg 's remarks come after the defence secretary fallon launched an extraordinary attack on miliband last week
mr clegg âs insistence that he will not go into coalition with the tories if they insist on such deep welfare cuts increases the possibility that the liberal democrats could strike a deal with labour party after the election
â in an interview on the bbc tonight , mr clegg said the price of another coalition would be new taxes on the rich and a scaling back of the prime minister âs planned welfare cuts asked by host evan davis if he felt â betrayed â by the prime minister at any stage since 2010 , he pointed to the av referendum
â but mr clegg said the coalition had been â worth â all the pain
