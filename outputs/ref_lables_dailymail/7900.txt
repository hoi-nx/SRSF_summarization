now researchers believe they may have uncovered a possible explanation of what may have contributed to neanderthals eventual demise - they were not very adept at controlling fire
a team of archaeologists at boston university and the university of bath believe this would have meant they lost out when modern humans arrived from africa
neanderthals , like the reconstruction above on display at the natural history museum in london , may have finally died out as they were unable to get as much energy from their food as modern humans who used fire they used computer model the amount of energy neanderthals would have been able to get from their food without cooking it compared to humans that were
they found that without fire , a group of neanderthals would have had less energy - the equivalent 12 reindeer a year - than if they did
modern humans who regularly cooked their food could have then channeled this extra energy into growing their population and searching longer for food during lean periods
they spread through out europe and much of asia , and there is some evidence that they made jewellery and art. some researchers believe that they were also highly intelligent - possibly even as intelligent as modern humans , homo sapiens
there are a number of theories for what caused neanderthals to disappear - but most seem to agree it was the arrival of modern humans in europe and asia that played a role
some archaeologists believe they were unable to compete with modern humans , while others believe humans actively killed them
neanderthals vanished relatively quickly once modern humans arrived in the areas where they were living however , dna evidence also suggests that neanderthals and modern humans also interbred
neanderthals use of fire is still a highly controversial issue , but if they had not used it to cook food as much as modern humans it would have put them at a definite disadvantage
' miss goldfield , who conducted her research with ross booton , a mathematical biologist at the university of sheffield , suggests that with their bigger bodies , neanderthals would have needed more food than modern humans
recent research is suggesting that neanderthals were sophisticated and not very different from modern humans , increasing the mystery behind why they died out and homo sapiens managed to survive she said : ' my real aim was to specifically look at the impact of cooking on metabolism , and whether regular cooking of food might have been an advantage for neanderthals
' using their computer models they were able to simulate how the populations of neanderthals would change depending on their use of fire
they found that if modern humans used fire more often than neanderthals , then their populations would grow
but as modern human populations grew , it would also reduce the number of reindeer available for neanderthals
