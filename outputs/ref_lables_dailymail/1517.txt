rangers interim chairman paul murray insists the actions of previous boardroom regimes were â solely â to blame for the club âs stock exchange removal however , the development has reopened old hostilities , with easdale claiming the shareholder group he heads is considering legal action
the former football board chairman also accused king of making â misleading â statements
trading in rangers shares was suspended when previous nomad , wh ireland , resigned just two days before the march 6 egm that ousted the old board and handed control to king and his allies
it âs understood , however , that they subsequently broke down after the aim hierarchy indicated a wish to dispense with rangers altogether , unhappy at the level of turmoil witnessed since its initial listing in december 2012
rangers now plan to be listed on the isdx market , which arsenal currently use , by the end of next month
â we tried everything within our power to have the suspension lifted but it was clear that we would have to pay a price for years of poor corporate governance and financial mismanagement since the ipo ( in 2012 ) , â said paul murray
â you could say the behaviour of previous directors has poisoned the well with aim but even so we might have expected a little more understanding from certain quarters
paul murray insists the new board âs plans for the future will be unaffected by the stock exchange removal â the investments we expect will still be made and rangers will be rebuilt on schedule
â king had stated the day before the egm that he intended to appoint the nomad he had lined up â immediately â but added the caveat that the firm would have to look â under the boot â at rangers before accepting the position
â on the subject of potential legal action , easdale said he did nât think the group would â be taking rangers to task â but could look â more on a personal basis , with the individuals who misled the shareholders in thinking shares would still be on aim â
we are entirely satisfied that the new board has done everything it could to maintain the aim listing and we are happy that they did not in any way mislead shareholders by stating that they had a nomad willing to work with them
