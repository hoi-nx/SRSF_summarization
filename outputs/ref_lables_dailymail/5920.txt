children as young as three are being asked to sign a contract pledging not to use transphobic language at school
the pledge is contained in a â home - school agreement â which all children must sign before they start at turnham primary school in september
anti-bullying : turnham primary school - led by executive headteacher selina sharpe - sent out an agreement for all new children to sign before they start in the new academic year tick - box bureaucracy : but parents were dumbfounded when it included a demand not to use ' transphobic language ' , as it would mean explaining something many three - year - olds are not even aware exists it is understood that teachers at the south-east london school introduced the document to help stamp out playground prejudice against transgender people and a wide range of disabilities and cultures
this is achieved when all staff , parents and children understand their responsibilities and work together towards the same goals , as detailed in our home - school agreement
â in a list of responsibilities for pupils to sign is a clause which states pupils will be tolerant of â sexual orientation or lifestyle and refrain from using racist or homophobic or transphobic language in school â
â how am i meant to explain it to my three - year - old that he must sign on the dotted line not to do something which he is not even aware exists when he can barely hold a crayon ? this just fills me with dread about what sort of politically correct , tick - box bureaucracy runs this school
â i agree that teachers need to be made aware of transgender issues as it affects a number of children who suffer in silence , but to make three - year - olds sign up to something they do not even know exists is bonkers
â sorry : the school 's chair of governors has apologised for any offence or distress caused to parents or pupils turnham primary school is a foundation school , which means it is funded by the government through labour - run lewisham council , which yesterday refused to comment on the matter
â on behalf of the governing body i would like to sincerely apologise for any offence or distress caused to our parents and pupils
