they came to see the great mccoy deliver the hollywood ending to his record - breaking career , but instead it was left to a jockey previously regarded as a popular journeyman to secure his place in aintree folklore by winning the crabbie âs national
having won last year âs race on pineau de re , 38 - year - old aspell , who once walked away from the sport for 18 months after becoming disillusioned , became the first rider since bryan marshall , who won on royal tan and early mist in 1953 and 1954 , to land the biggest jumps race of the year in successive years on different horses
many clouds , ridden by aspell , jumps a fence on the way to winning the national at aintree mccoy on shutthefrontdoor ( left ) congratulates aspell after many clouds ' victory on saturday while the gelding , whose participation in the race had been in doubt after his disappointing sixth in the gold cup last month , also provided a massive change of national luck for his lambourn trainer sherwood
many clouds passed the line one - and - three - quarter lengths in front of tom george - trained 33 - 1 shot saint are , with 40 - 1 chance monbeg dude running a massive race in third for his trainer michael scudamore and his trio of former international rugby - playing owners mike tindall , james simpson-daniel and nicky robinson
but he never had a chance to lay a glove on aspell and many clouds , who had struck for home well before the home straight
one of the first to congratulate the winning jockey was mccoy
aspell said : â he is as good in defeat as he is when he is winning
i think the only people here happy he has been beaten are me and andrew cooper [ the supremo at sandown where mccoy will now end his career on april 25 ]
â winning jockey aspell holds up the national trophy as the 38 - year - old celebrates a famous victory many clouds won the national for trainer sherwood ( centre ) and last year 's winning jockey aspell if aspell was not fatigued , his mount certainly was and many clouds had to be dismounted on the track on welfare grounds to aid a speedy recovery in the wash - down area
aspell , riding many clouds ( right ) , goes toe - to - toe with second placed saint are ( centre ) along the final straight last year 's winning jockey aspell celebrates his victory as many clouds slows to a halt after the race early exits included al co , one of three to get no further than the first fence , and unioniste , who fell at the fifth
by then the writing was on the wall for well - backed 8 - 1 shot rocky creek , who faded into 17th , and last year âs winner pineau de re , this time ridden to 12th place by daryl jacob
but there still seemed a big chance of glory for mccoy , who had positioned shutthefrontdoor close behind the leaders throughout
mccoy said : â he ran a blinder
winning horse many clouds is doused with water shortly after winning the national in liverpool many clouds ( far right ) leaps over the water jump during the national at aintree on saturday afternoon the mass plunge predicted by the bookmakers on mccoy âs mount did nât quite materialise and his failure to secure the 4,348th victory of his career on the jonjo oâneill - trained 6 - 1 favourite saved the bookmakers up to Â£ 50 million.they had predicted successful mccoy and shuthefrontdoor , carrying the money of thousands of once - a - year punters would cost them in the region of Â£ 50million
â a disappointed mccoy after finishing fifth in his final national before retiring mccoy opens the newly named mccoy 's bar before the race on saturday before racing , mccoy , inducted into the aintree hall of fame on thursday , had been honoured when the bar created out of the old weighing room was renamed in his honour
on saturday may not have gone to script but , for years to come in mccoy âs , they will toast the patron saint of punters and his never - say - die attitude
driving away from aintree last night , the great mccoy will have known exactly how the don must have felt .
