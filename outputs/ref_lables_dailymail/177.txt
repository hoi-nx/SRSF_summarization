an unknown englishman playing in his first pga tour event will have the chance to complete an unbelievable fairytale at the houston open on sunday and earn the most unlikely invitation to the masters
surrey - born kelvin day has only played a handful of events on the subsidiary circuit , the web.com tour but decided to enter qualifying for the houston event
with two excellent rounds of 64 , the 27 - year - old finished tied first to earn his place â and how he has taken advantage
it was a decent achievement in itself to make the halfway cut , and it earned him a third round draw alongside two rather more famous englishmen in casey and justin rose
kelvin day is three shots behind the leaders and remains in with a chance of making the masters day , however , refused to be overawed as he put together a tidy , bogey - free scorecard to match the 68 shot by casey and upstage rose , who shot 72
incredibly , that has left day alongside casey in tied sixth place , just three shots off the lead held , almost inevitably , by the remarkably consistent young american , spieth
realistically , a top ten finish would be a fine achievement for day , which would earn him a place in the field for the tournament after the masters , the heritage in south carolina
but it is worth bearing in mind that a victory would not only earn him a pga tour card but the last spot in the field for augusta
spieth finished runner - up behind bubba watson on his masters debut last year
he just happens to be the monday qualifier who tied day for first place
