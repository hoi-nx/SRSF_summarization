cameron is narrowly winning the battle for floating voters , according to a major poll out today
the comres survey of 4,000 undecided voters found a slim majority have been more impressed with the performance of the prime minister than that of miliband during the election campaign
a separate poll of marginal seats by the former tory treasurer ashcroft suggests that ukip âs vote is being squeezed in key constituencies as election day approaches
a comres survey of 4,000 undecided voters across the uk found a slim majority have been more impressed with the performance of prime minister cameron than that of miliband during the election campaign it also suggests education secretary nicky morgan is set to hold her marginal seat in loughborough
today âs comres survey , for itv âs good morning britain show , found that 37 per cent of floating voters have been impressed with mr cameron âs performance on the campaign trail so far , compared with 31 per cent who think mr miliband has done well
meanwhile , snp leader nicola sturgeon , has impressed 21 per cent of voters on the back of her strong performance in last week âs televised leaders â debate
ms nicola sturgeon appears to have been biting her nails is the pressure starting to tell on nicola sturgeon ? from the look of her hands as she met her party âs candidates in aberdeen yesterday , it looks like the 44 - year - old snp leader has been struck by a bout of behind - the - scenes finger - chewing
mr cameron also suffered less badly from negative appraisals
while 49 per cent said they were â unimpressed â with the prime minister âs performance , 54 per cent said the same of mr miliband
but the poll also shows that politicians have yet to shift many of the undecided voters whose support is likely to be critical in next month âs election
almost a quarter ( 24 per cent ) said they were â completely undecided who to vote for â
floating voters identified the nhs as the most important issue , followed by immigration , the cost of living and the economy
meanwhile , lord ashcroft âs survey of labour - tory marginals suggests mr cameron still has a lot of work to do just to hold on to the seats he won in 2010
mr cameron also suffered less badly from negative appraisals , with 49 per cent of undecided voters saying they were â unimpressed â with his performance and 54 per cent saying the same of mr miliband ( pictured ) lord ashcroft said the study showed ukip âs vote was being squeezed since the same seats were polled last year
â the ukip share had fallen significantly â by up to 10 points â in nine of the ten seats polled , â he said
the decline in ukip support has helped the tories consolidate their grip in blackpool north , pendle , gloucester , kingswood and mrs morgan âs leicestershire constituency
but labour also appears to be benefiting from the squeeze in ukip support in some areas , moving ahead of the tories in harrow east and increasing its lead in the tory - held seats of hove , stockton south , and morecambe and lunesdale
â miliband and miliband on the campaign trail miliband âs wife has revealed how he led her to believe he was single when they met at a dinner party â at the home of the woman he was dating
speaking while she was campaigning in runcorn , cheshire this week , mrs miliband said : â canvassing in the rain always reminds me of falling in love with miliband in 2005
miliband bandaged me up and i fell in love with him
