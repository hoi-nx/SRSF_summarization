the couple that models designer clothes together stays together â or at least that 's what one new york city - based duo hope , having just inked a deal as the first openly gay couple with fusion
john tuite , 22 , and carlos santolalla , 25 , go by the brangelina - like portmanteau jarlos , and have already earned a following in the modeling world and on new york city 's party scene
model couple : carlos santolalla , 25 , left , and john tuite , 22 , right , are the first openly gay couple to be signed together to a modeling agency though the fashion industry seems very accepting of gay people , the couple explains that models are still expected to appear masculine or androgynous
both john tuite and carlos santolalla had to drop their old agencies after they were told to act straight and delete the instagram account they share , where they often post loving images of themselves kissing and hugging
growing fan base : on instagram , the couple goes by the joint nickname jarlos , and they have over 22,500 followers facing obstacles : john tuite and carlos santolalla were told by their previous modeling agencies to act more ' butch ' and delete their joint instagram account , where they often pose kissing and holding hands ' there is an unspoken rule of modeling , at least in new york city â even if you get signed as an out model â the first thing any agent tells you to do is to dress butch and talk about girls so no one " finds out " , ' john tuite added
in fact , when the couple first got together over three years after meeting at a casting call , it was because carlos santolalla became interested in john tuite when he realized he might be gay â which he says was unusual
' looking good : the couple explained that though the modeling industry is filled with well - groomed , well - dressed men , most male models are straight party hard : jarlos is well known on the new york city party circuit and has been pictured with gigi hadid , paris hilton , and harry styles the fact that the pair has become so widely known as a couple made them even more appealing to fusion
