a czech politician says he has created an entirely new country by claiming three - square - mile patch of land along the croatia - serbia border that neither country claims is theirs
jedlicka , 31 , a member of the czech 's conservative party of free citizens , is the self - declared president of ' liberland ' , which is located on the banks of the danube
hope : if liberland is ever formally recognised it will become the third smallest sovereign state in the world , behind the vatican city and monaco mr jedlicka describes himself as a libertarian and says citizens living in ' liberland ' will be able to set their own individual rate of tax , as well as drawing up their own property and personal rights
founder : vã­t jedlicka , 31 , is a member of the czech 's conservative party of free citizens the anti-eu czech politician says the idea for the state came from a desire to live in a country where ' honest ' people could prosper with minimal to no interference from a centralised government
all services - such as medical , fire and refuse - would operate voluntarily , with the overall idea being that the nation 's perfectly capable citizens would eventually work out the correct level of taxation and the right service requirements for a fully - functioning nation , without the levels being set by the state
after extensive research into areas classified as terra nullius , or ' no man 's land ' , mr jedlicka discovered the 2.7 square mile patch of land along the croatia - serbia border
unclaimed territory : liberland is located on the croatia - serbia border , on the banks of the danube the so - called creation of liberland is far from the first time an individual has declared the formation of a new nation state
even if after lengthy legal analysis proves ' liberland ' is a genuinely ' unclaimed territory ' , the world 's new newest nation still fails one of the basic tests for sovereignty
with only one citizen currently living in the country and access to the area strictly limited by croatia and serbia , there is no way liberland is able to protect itself from neighbouring states
czech journalists also tried to visit the territory last week , but were blocked from entering and the ' liberland ' flag that was initially flown over the area has apparently now been taken down
legal experts have also poured cold water on the idea , claiming that although the territory may appear unclaimed , it is almost certainly already part of serbia
this is because after yugoslavia 's break - up , any land in the area not claimed by croatia was automatically absorbed into serbia .
