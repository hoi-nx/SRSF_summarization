noise - induced hearing loss is one of the most common work - related illnesses and members of the armed forces are particularly vulnerable
noise - induced hearing loss is one of the most common work - related illnesses , doctors have warned now , however , scientists at the university of southern california believe they have made a breakthrough in their understanding of the condition
they have identified a gene , named nox3 , found in the inner ear , that is crucial in determining how vulnerable a person is to developing hearing loss
their research , looking at the dna of mice exposed to noise , is the first published genome - wide association study on noise - induced hearing loss in mice
' scientists have identified a gene , named nox3 , found in the inner ear , that is crucial in determining how vulnerable a person is to developing hearing loss while some gene association studies on noise - induced hearing loss in people have been conducted in the past , all were very small and their results unreplicated
