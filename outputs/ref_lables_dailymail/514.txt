since 2013 , dr milton wainwright has been trying to convince the scientific community that he has found aliens in earth 's stratosphere
now the controversial british professor claims he has new evidence of these ' extra-terrestrial organisms ' floating 25 miles ( 40km ) above the planet
he says the organisms test positive for dna , and have masses that are ' six times bigger than the size limit of a particle which can be elevated from earth to this height
' dr milton wainwright has been trying to convince academics that he has found aliens in earth 's stratosphere for several years
his views have been widely dismissed by the scientific community the organisms , he claims , are contained in a microscopic metal globe designed by an intelligent species to ' seed ' alien life on earth
dr milton wainwright announced the discovery in an email to his students at sheffield university , who posted it on reddit
' we sent balloons and a sampler and found no pollen or grass , nothing up there to contaminate , it was completely pristine , ' dr milton wainwright told jason koebler at motherboard

he says the organisms test positive for dna , and have masses that are ' six times bigger than the size limit of a particle which can be elevated from earth to this height ' dr milton wainwright 's research has been widely criticised by the scientific community as being backed by poor and flimsy evidence
' the critics claim that the samples we obtained must have come from earth , that it that there must be a mechanism which can lift these particles from earth to the stratosphere , ' dr milton wainwright told dailymail.com
the idea of directed panspermia , however , suggests that lifeforms are deliberately sent out through the universe by intelligent civilizations professor francis crick , one of the biologists who discovered the structure of dna , examined the possibility of this in a paper in 1973
' if our organisms came from earth they must be contaminated with common earth organisms and they are not
' earlier this year , the astrobiologist revealed an image of what he said was a tiny metal ball spewing out a ' gooey ' substance in samples gathered by a balloon in the earth 's stratosphere
dr milton wainwright said the ball , which is about the width of a human hair , could be an example of directed panspermia
dr milton wainwright said the sphere made a tiny ' impact crater ' on the sampler that was attached to the balloon as it collected dust and particles in the atmosphere
' dr milton wainwright and his team discovered the sphere when examining samples of dust and particulate matter collected by a balloon sent around 16 miles into the atmosphere
dr milton wainwright and his colleagues have published their findings in the journal of cosmology but their conclusions have yet to be corroborated by other scientists
scientists working with nasa recently discovered bacteria living up to five miles above the earth 's surface
but research has shown that microorganisms can survive the intense heat and pressures of entering the earth 's atmosphere from space , raising the prospect that life may have originally been carried here
professor francis crick , one of the team who one a nobel prize for discovering the structure of dna , examined whether it was possible that organisms could have been deliberately transmitted to the earth by intelligent beings from another planet
dr milton wainwright used balloons similar to this one above to collect samples from the stratsophere he eventually concluded that there was insufficient scientific evidence to support such a claim
dr milton wainwright , however , insists his findings may help to provide some of that evidence
