he made the headlines for his plan to travel 20,000 miles on 21 flights in first class ... without paying a penny
now us 28 - year - old scott keyes has revealed his savvy secrets so you too can explore the world without falling into the ticket traps
the think progress reporter reveals his travel hacks in his ebooks how to fly for free and how to find cheap flights , and spoke to mailonline travel about his top tips
he only sign up for cards with high sign - up bonuses and relatively low spending thresholds necessary to get those
the writer makes a point of putting all everyday spending on credit cards in order to hit these spending thresholds
( unfortunately , this is mostly true for us travellers ; european credit cards and elsewhere tend to offer fairly meagre perks
) as long as you can handle credit responsibly and treat your credit card like a debit card , you can work towards a surprising amount of free travel
my favourite credit card is almost always whichever one offers the best sign - up bonus at the time
( for complicated reasons , i probably like the ba card the best , because if you 're flying less than 650 miles , 50,000 miles will get you as many as 11 free flights
keyes uses a number of techniques to travel first class around the world for free , which he has revealed in his two ebooks
keyes poses while rafting down sumidero canyon which is located near the city of chiapa de corzo in mexico check the day before and after for cheaper fares always search one day before or after just out of curiosity , because sometime red - eye flights can technically leave on the next day
these flights leave late at night , arriving in early morning and inside the us these flights are almost exclusively for travel from the west to the east
' i once helped my friend george cut the price of a round trip flight to vegas nearly in half by finding a redeye flight that left just after midnight , making it technically a monday flight and not a sunday flight , ' keyes tells mailonline travel
wading into the waters of hierve el agua in oaxaca , mexico , rock formations and the remnants of old geysers work backwards with your trip if you want the cheapest flights , chase the fare , not the destination
in other words , rather than picking a destination and then looking for the cheapest way to get there , start out by looking where there are cheap flights , and then decide among those where you 'd like to go
