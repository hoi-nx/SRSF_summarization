fernando , candidate for cambridge , was speaking at a hustings event last night when she made the startling suggestion
she said wearing wristbands indicating a person 's condition would help doctors , lawyers and police officers â because people suffering mental illnesses often struggled to explain themselves
ms fernando , a barrister for 12 years , said : ' police , social services or hospitals dealing with people with conditions that affect their ability to communicate can decide they are being obstructive or evasive
' ms fernando 's ' shocking ' suggestion was slammed by the deputy prime minister nick clegg today
' mr nick clegg told mailonline : ' the lib dem have spent many years campaigning for an end to the stigma around mental health ' miriam gonzalez durantez ( right ) , the wife of lib dem leader nick clegg , joined the party 's candidate for hazel grove , in stockport , lisa smart ( left ) huppert , the lib dem candidate and cambridge mp , said : ' i was really shocked at the suggestion that people with mental health problems should be expected to wear wristbands to identify themselves
' political blogger richard taylor reported ms fernando 's comments at last night 's hustings the conservative candidate insisted her remarks were ' distorted ' , adding : ' it was not that they should wear a wristband
that would be draconian ' ms fernando has insisted that her comments were ' taken out of context '
