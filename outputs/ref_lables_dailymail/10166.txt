a mother of a baby boy was arrested 27 years after his body was found wrapped in a blanket inside a sainsbury 's bag floating on a village pond
police exhumed the boy 's body from his grave in norfolk last year after the case came up for periodical review
a dna sample eventually led them to his mother
the woman , who has not been named , was arrested on suspicion of infanticide but the charge was dropped after she explained how the baby had been stillborn and that she had concealed the pregnancy from her family and friends
he has now been reburied at weasenham st peter church , norfolk police said they have ruled out any foul play and the woman remains on bail while the cps decide whether to charge her with failing to register a birth and preventing a lawful burial
during the original investigation , police had been unable to identify the mother and villagers carried out a collection to raise money to pay for the baby 's burial at 13th century st peter 's church in the village
a report in the eastern daily press from 1988 tells how the body was found floating on the pond but after the body was exhumed in april last year , dna taken from his leg bone was put through the national police database which found a match for a possible relative of one of the parents
detectives examined that person 's family tree and identified the woman who admitted being the boy 's mother
a police spokesman said : ' in this case it was not clear how the baby died despite a post mortem examination and the circumstances surrounding the death remained the focus of the investigation
' thanks to advances in dna we were able to trace the mother of the baby and during interview the woman revealed she had concealed her pregnancy from family and friends and delivered the baby by herself
she was arrested on suspicion of infanticide
the boy was originally buried without a name but a support group for parents of stillborn children raised the money for a new headstone giving his name as st peter after the name of the church a second post-mortem carried out on the remains last year found no evidence of foul play
the baby boy was re-buried in the churchyard on june 5 last year - the 26th anniversary of his discovery - he was named st peter after the name of the church
' the grave of the baby was originally marked by a simple wooden cross , which read : ' in loving memory of unknown baby boy
' norfolk coroner 's chaplain chris copsey said : ' when the coffin was exhumed all that was left was a little plaque that said ' unnamed baby boy '
' it seemed terrible to bury an unnamed baby boy so i took the name of the church , st peter 's church
