all eyes were again on james anderson as england on thursday night began their push for victory here but instead the limelight was seized by jordan with his second stunning catch of the first test
a day that featured a fourth antiguan test century in only his ninth match for ballance ended with the leader of england âs attack still waiting for the wicket that will bring him level with sir botham âs test record
so well did ballance and england bat that cook was able to set west indies a target of 438 in just over four sessions that would even surpass their own world record successful test chase
cook , though , will be grateful for the athleticism of jordan and the off - spin of joe root for the wicket that means england remain firm favourites to secure today what would be a highly valuable victory for them
yet when jordan dived to his right at wide slip and grasped the chance offered by bravo âs flailing bat in joe root âs second over a second west indian wicket had fallen and england ended the day with a spring in their step
bravo nicks joe root 's delivery as jordan gets ready to pounce bravo can only watch on as jordan makes a stunning dive to seize the loose ball jordan shows tremendous reflexes to cling on to dismiss the west indies batsman ballance plays a shot during day four of england 's first test against west indies on thursday ballance plays a sweeping shot during his impressive innings at the sir viv richards stadium ballance celebrates bringing up his century following his superb batting display in antigua joe root formed a solid partnership with ballance and made big inroads against the home side joe root salutes the stands after he brought up his half century earlier in the day jos buttler also impressed for peter moores ' side with an unbeaten 59 off 56 balls it is extraordinary , really , that ballance should have been perceived to be under any sort of pressure going into the second innings of this first test
joe root was furious with himself when he again got an inside edge to be bowled when a century was there for the taking but his partnership of 114 with ballance came at a crucial time for england with west indies still in the hunt
other than that it was pretty much plain sailing for england , with jos buttler also returning to form with an unbeaten 59 off 56 balls
stuart broad ( centre ) celebrates with his england team - mates after taking the wicket of kraigg brathwaite joe root ( right ) gets the plaudits from his team - mates after he took the wicket of bravo late on day four the openers , of course , are much more of an issue but a win here on friday would buy cook a bit of time for both him and jonathan trott to get things right in grenada next week and barbados in the final test
with james anderson in the form that saw him take only two of the four wickets he needed at the start of this test to surpass botham âs tally of 383 in the first innings it was left to stuart broad to strike the first blow for england
an absolute brute of a delivery saw kraigg braithwaite fending to short leg and stuart broad quickly pointing to the dressing room to salute the role that bowling coach ottis gibson , who knows west indies inside out having been their coach until earlier this year , played in the dismissal
the west indies side await a decision from the third empire on the fourth day of action in the caribbean he is clearly one of the best slip fielders england have found in years but jordan will be annoyed that he could not get a hand to another sharp chance offered by smith off joe root before the close
