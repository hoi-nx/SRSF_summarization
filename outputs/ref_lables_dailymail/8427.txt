this is the moment a family got a shock after an elderly buffalo escaped being dinner for lions - only to run headlong into their car
moya gerber 's sister odendaal , 24 , who is a teacher at laerskool lothair , located in the village of lothair , began taking pictures of the struggle , before noticing the buffalo was heading for the road
battle : moya gerber and her sister odendaal , 24 , spotted this struggle between two lions and a buffalo in the kruger park in africa , so they stopped to photograph it collision : after a few moments the buffalo managed to escape the lions ' clutches , but headed straight for the road instead before running into the side of ms odendaal 's car while the beast managed to escape being eaten by the lions , it did receive a nasty knock to the head after running into the side of their van
speaking to mailonline , ms odendaal , who uploaded the pictures to her instagram , said : ' we were on holiday
' they got a drink of water and then slept under bushes on our left hand side and then we spotted the buffalo on our right side
' the wind was in the lions favour , they jumped up in unison and walked fast over the road towards the buffalo.they looked really hungry and needed food , that 's when the action started
' the lions stalked the buffalo before one jumped on its back
that lion held on for almost 30 minutes until the buffalo ran towards the cars
life or death : miss odendaal , a teacher from the village of lothair , captured these images of the beasts fighting with one - another before the buffalo crashed into her vehicle explain that to the insurers ! a fully grown buffalo can weigh up to 1,750lbs - about half the weight of a vw golf - and stands six foot tall , meaning it left quite a dent in the car 's door ' just before the lions could bring the buffalo down it punctured the car wheel and then ran into our car taking the mirror off
ms odendaal 's friends also joked about the close - shave on facebook , with jeremy hallett quipping : ' explain that to your insurance ! ' the kruger park spans 7,500 square miles of territory in the north east of africa along its border with mozambique , making it one of the largest game reserves in africa
one of a kind : when miss odendaal 's images were uploaded to website for spotting wildlife in the kruger park , it 's founder said he had never seen anything like it before the park is home to more 12,000 elephants , 1,000 leopards , 2,800 lions , and 27,000 african buffalo , with the climate ranging from savanna scrubland in the south , to tropical in the north
