many popular easter eggs contain more sugar than is recommended in a day by the world health organisation there is nothing as synonymous with easter as chocolate eggs
but while the holiday might be a child 's favourite , a nutritionist has warned too much sugar can lead to obesity , type 2 diabetes and tooth decay
dr sam christie , a nutrition scientist , also warned too much of the sweet stuff can exacerbate polycystic ovarian syndrome and behavioural problems like adhd
the world health organisation recommends 50g of added sugar a day ( roughly 12 and a half teaspoons ) , on top of natural sugars that occur in fruit and milk
dr christie has calculated that many popular eggs contain more than the recommended daily amount of sugar
depending on how physically active the children are , eating too much sugar could trigger insulin resistance , dr christie said
this is where the body becomes de-sensitised to insulin , the hormone that controls how much sugar is in the bloodstream
it actually becomes very hard to lose weight once the body ca nât break down sugar , â she explained
' eating too much sugar can lead to obesity , type 2 diabetes , tooth decay , nutrient deficiencies , acne and behavioural problems , a nutritionist warns this can also lead to other deficiencies as children may fill up on sugar but not eat other , more nutritious food , so they miss out on vitamins and minerals , she added
â if someone takes multi-vitamins , it helps sensitise the body to insulin , so you âre more likely to burn off sugar
' dr christie recommends nature âs best multi-guard balance vitamin supplement , which has added chromium , cinnamon bark and magnesium and claims to stave off sugar cravings and boost energy levels .
