the parents of brown have filed a wrongful - death lawsuit against the city of ferguson over the fatal shooting of their son by a white police officer , a confrontation that sparked a national protest movement
attorneys for brown 's parents , lesley mcspadden and michael brown sr. , filed the complaint at the st. louis county courthouse on thursday and called a news conference to announce that the case would bring to light new forensic evidence and raise doubts about the police version of events
the lawsuit is seeking $ 75,000 in compensation , as well as unspecified punitive damages , and calls for a court order prohibiting the use of police techniques ' that demean , disregard , or underserve its african - american population '
the new lawsuit alleges that officer darren wilson destroyed evidence after he shot brown on the street of the st. louis suburb last august , saying he washed blood off his hands and cleared and bagged the gun used in the shooting
' we expect to put on evidence that you never heard about before , that you have never seen , ' anthony gray , one of the lawyers for brown 's family , said at thursday 's news conference
the civil suit claims brown had his hands up in surrender when he was killed , a claim strongly disputed during the previous investigation
the civil lawsuit names the city of ferguson , former police chief jackson and former police officer darren wilson as defendants
' we expect to put on evidence that you never heard about before , that you have never seen , ' said anthony gray , left , during thursday 's press conference darren wilson ' unjustifiably shot and killed ( brown ) , using an unnecessary and unreasonable amount ( of ) force in violation of ( brown 's ) constitutionally guaranteed right to life , ' the lawsuit states
if it comes to trial , the lawsuit could force a full review of all the evidence in the shooting and bring key witnesses to be questioned in open court , including darren wilson
' lesley mcspadden , the mother of brown , wore a sweatshirt remembering her son during thursday 's new conference , left , while michael brown sr. , the father of brown , as also in attendance brown , 18 , was unarmed and walking in the street with a friend on august 9 when darren wilson told them to move to the sidewalk
that led to a heated confrontation and a scuffle between darren wilson and brown inside darren wilson 's squad car
darren wilson shot brown after the scuffle spilled into the street
some witnesses said brown was trying to surrender , but darren wilson said brown was moving toward him aggressively , forcing him to shoot
brown 's shooting led to sometimes - violent protests and spawned a national black lives matter movement calling for changes in how police deal with minorities
brown was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a white police officer , darren wilson , in a st. louis suburb in august 2014
but a civil jury awarded the brown and goldman families $ 33.5 million in wrongful - death damages
