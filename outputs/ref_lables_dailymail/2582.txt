physical activity can increase grey matter in the brain , increasing the size of areas that contribute to balance and coordination , according to health day news
the changes in the brain may have health implications in the long - term , such as reducing the risk of falling , said the study 's author , dr kujala , of the university of jyvaskyla
dr kujala said physical activity has already been linked to a number of health benefits , such as lower levels of body fat , reduced heart disease risk factors , better memory and thinking , and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes
but he and his team wanted to understand how exercise affects the brain
previous research found exercise is linked to lower levels of body fat , a reduced risk of heart disease , better memory and thinking , and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes the twins who exercised more did a better job of controlling their blood sugar , which reduces the risk of diabetes , a finding which is already well - known
