defeated : napoleon lost at the battle of waterloo in 1815 guests attending a service in london to mark the 200th anniversary of the battle of waterloo have been told not to act in a ' triumphalist ' way â to avoid upsetting the france
invitations to the service at st paul 's cathedral advise that it will avoid glorifying the duke 's historic victory over napoleon in 1815
but last night the move was criticised by politicians , who said it ' took political correctness to an absurd new degree '
the invitation to the waterloo 200 event says : ' the service , although related to a military victory , is not in any way glorifying war , nor must it be seen as triumphalist
' instead , the service â to be attended by members of the royal family and senior political and military figures â will focus on the ' pan-european ' implications of the battle and the century of peace that followed
conservative jacob rees-mogg , who is bidding to be re-elected as a somerset mp , said : ' battle of waterloo was a triumph of good versus evil
what next ? will we ask france to apologise for the battle of hastings ? ' the service of commemoration , to take place on the 200th anniversary of battle of waterloo on june 18 , will be the centrepiece of a series of events to mark the battle
