tunisian skipper malek , 27 , was arrested when he stepped onto sicilian soil last night , some 24 hours after his boat capsized in the mediterranean sea
before leaving the italian coastguard vessel , however , he was forced to watch the bodies of 24 victims of the tragedy being carried off the ship for burial on the island of malta
he was later charged with multiple manslaughter , causing a shipwreck and aiding illegal immigration
prosecutors claim he contributed to the disaster by mistakenly ramming the overcrowded fishing boat into a merchant ship that had come to its rescue
as a result of the collision , the migrants shifted position on the boat , which was already off balance , causing it to overturn
