in her most extraordinary offer yet the nationalist leader called on the labour leader to help her â lock â cameron out of downing street
miss sturgeon âs latest offer came amid continued fallout from claims she told a french diplomat she wanted cameron to remain as prime minister
the report of the conversation , on february 26 , between miss sturgeon and sylvie bermann , the french ambassador , was contained within a scotland office memo leaked to the daily telegraph
the claim was denied both by the french embassy and miss sturgeon
it undermines the snp leader âs claim that she wants to build a progressive alliance with labour to keep the conservatives out of office
in an article for the observer addressed to mr ed miliband she wrote : â if together our parties have the parliamentary numbers required after 7 may , and regardless of which is the biggest party , will he and labour join with us in locking cameron out of downing street ? â ed miliband has ruled out going into coalition with snp but has not rejected the prospect of working with them chancellor george osborne said the prospect of the snp propping up the labour in power was an ' alliance between a party that wants to bankrupt the country and a party that wants to break up the country ' her comments heaped pressure on labour to rule out any deal with the nationalists
labour has ruled out a formal coalition with the snp but has refused to say if it would enter a looser agreement on policy areas to stay in power
tory chief whip michael gove said : â my concern is that if the snp win the number of seats they are projected to , they could hold the balance of power and hold labour leader ed miliband to ransom
former cabinet minister peter hain told radio 4 âs the world this weekend he said : â it is a curious plea being made by sturgeon and the snp : vote anything except labour to get a labour government
â a panelbase poll released yesterday put the snp , on 45 per cent , with labour on 29 per cent
if repeated across scotland , the poll findings suggest the snp would win 29 of the 41 seats won by labour in 2010
