this is the heart - rending moment a teenage boy learnt that he could be adopted by his caseworker two years after making a desperate plea for a family
my commitment to him is for his whole life , ' said going of davion ( above with connie 's daughter carly ) throughout davion 's search for a family , and his years in the system , connie bell , had been by his side - and on wednesday she officially became his mother
' when asked why she wanted to adopt the teenager , connie put her hand on davion 's shoulder and said : ' i 've always loved him , the same as my other children
going said of davion ; ' when it was davion 's turn to speak he remained silent , but did say at the end of the process ; ' thank you all for being my family
' firm family bond : davion , 16 , who captured hearts in 2013 when he made a plea for a family to ' love him forever ' davion plays on the xbox in his bedroom with his mom connie sitting behind him together with her daughter carly , 17 , and her adopted son , taylor , 14 going has admitted that it has not always easy integrating him into her existing family , but she said it was worth it
since august , davion has been spending weekends with connie and her daughters , sydney , 21 , carley , 17 , and with her adopted son taylor , who is now 14
then in december , going took the steps to begin the adoption process and davion moved with the rest of the family into a larger home
' davion became an example of the struggle faced by many teenagers in the system when in 2013 he stood up and told worshipers at his church : ' my name is davion and i 've been in foster care since i was born
' davion only , 16 , has been adopted by his old case worker , connie bell going in florida ( above )
davion had been in the foster care system his entire life davion ( above ) captured hearts in 2013 when he made a plea in front of a st petersburg church congregation for a family to ' love him forever ' most of all , davion said he just wanted a family that would ' love him forever '
millions of people around the country soon heard about davion 's story , and the young boy was even interviewed by barbara walters on the view , which all eventually led to him being adopted by a minister in ohio and his family
davion only ( pictured above with connie going at the church where he made his speech in 2013 ) was adopted by a minister in ohio but sent back into the system a few months later when he fought with one of the minister 's children going says she had begun to call him numerous times , but he always hung up the phone
then , one night last july , davion called up miss connie and asked her the question he had been asking since they first met when he was only a little boy
the 52 - year - old case worker has three children of her own , one adopted and two biological daughters , and was a single mother , but she was no longer davion 's case worker , which made the process easier
from august through december he started spending more and more time with the family , a perfect fit as he was already close to going 's adopted son taylor
then , in december , going got a lawyer and began the process of adopting davion
' i guess i always thought of you as my mom , ' davion said to going last december
' only now i get to call you that for real , right ? ' davion officially became part of the family in february however , when after he and going celebrated their birthdays , which fall on the same date , they went home and sat around the table for cake with his three siblings and signed the court papers
what 's more , because of that day in september 2013 when davion stepped up on the pulpit , hundreds of others have been adopted as well
' i guess i always thought of you as my mom , ' davion ( above in 2013 ) said to going last december
