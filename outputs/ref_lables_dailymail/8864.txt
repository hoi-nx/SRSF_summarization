vaughan has been heavily linked with the newly created role of director of england cricket â and for captain cook the move can not come soon enough if it gets him out of the commentary box
vaughan is currently in the west indies working as part of the bbc 's commentary team but has made no secret in his desire to replace paul downton in the top job in english cricket
but in his role as a commentator for test match special the former england skipper put the ultimate curse on cook by praising him moments before he lost his wicket in the second innings

he said : ' i know it is early and i know they will say it is commentator 's curse , but i am watching his ( cook 's ) movement
you watch his right foot , he goes back with his left foot now ... ' but before vaughan could finish his sentence cook was tempted to follow a jerome taylor delivery outside off stump and squirted a waist - high catch to gully for 13
