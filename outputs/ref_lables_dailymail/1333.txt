around one in seven couples suffer with infertility and an increasing number are seeking alternative therapies in the hope it will bring them a longed for baby
those who can afford it can turn to london 's famous private medical haven harley street , where dr xiao-ping zhai has been helping women conceive for decades using only traditional chinese medicine
dr xiao-ping zhai says she has used chinese medicine to help a thousand women become pregnant ' i 'm a doctor who initially trained in western medicine , then i studied chinese medicine as i realised lots of problems could n't be overcome by traditional western medicine , ' she explains to vanessa engle for the documentary inside harley street , which airs tonight on bbc2
dr zhai 's methods include acupuncture and prescribing a bespoke combination of chinese herbs which must be taken day and night
the herbs may be drunk as a tea or are provided as a vitamin tablet - 12 must be taken in the morning and 12 in the evening
the vitamins contain natural ingredients such goji berries , chinese yan and ginger
dr zhai says as a result of her natural remedies : ' i have brought more than one thousand babies into the world
dr zhai prescribes a bespoke course of vitamins - 24 tablets a day for two weeks - containing chinese herbs to help conception ( file photo ) jane parker , from london , previously told the mail on sunday how she fell pregnant using dr zhai 's methods after two failed cycles of ivf
she only prescribes after she 's been through the results
' in january 2009 , alongside regular acupuncture sessions , i started taking specially prepared herbs , following her advice on which supplements to take and made several changes to my lifestyle ( including giving up alcohol , taking no vigorous exercise and avoiding cold drinks )
i bought a pregnancy test and discovered i was expecting ! i carried on with the acupuncture , herbs and supplements throughout the first 12 weeks of pregnancy
i genuinely believe that if i had nât seen dr zhai , i would n't have my son
she turned to dr zhai after losing a baby she conceived via ivf treatment on the nhs
jane parker had her son rupert in 2009 when she was 41 after having treatment at dr zhai 's clinic she said : ' i got pregnant and i carried through for 11 weeks but then i miscarried a month ago
may pays Â£ 300 a month for tea made from chinese herbs
further check - ups with dr zhai will cost her Â£ 130 , while three sessions of acupuncture at the clinic cost Â£ 350
after a period taking the chinese herbal tea , she is then prescribed a mixture of chinese herbs in a pill form which must be taken 24 times a day ( 12 in the morning and 12 in the evening ) for two weeks , costing around Â£ 150
dr zhai said acupuncture aids fertility because it ' promotes your body 's natural healing response and stimulates natural energy flow ' in her book , how to get pregnant , dr zhai said her methods work for those who ca n't be helped by ivf
' by stimulating the specific acupuncture points , tcm [ traditional chinese medicine ] practitioners are trained to clear blockages in the body 's meridian system , with the aim of restoring balance in the body
' acupuncture involves inserting tiny needles into the skin and is an ancient chinese treatment that is being embraced more widely in the west for problems such as stress and back pain
as well as looking at alternative therapies for infertility on harley street , tonight 's documentary also looks at the other unusual treatments - such as applying leeches to the skin to relieve pain - that people are turning to when traditional western medicine has n't helped them
