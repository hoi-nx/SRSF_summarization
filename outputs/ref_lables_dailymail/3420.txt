the female , named varvara , swam 14,000 miles ( 22,500 ) from the east coast of russia to breeding grounds off the coast of mexico , and back , reportedly without stopping for a snack until now , scientists believed there were two distinct groups of gray whale - the eastern gray whale , which travels along the west coast of us , and the much rarer western gray whale , which journeys along the coast of eastern asia
the researchers used satellite - monitoring tags to track three western pacific gray whales from their primary feeding ground off russia âs sakhalin island across the pacific and down the west coast of the us to baja , mexico
the experts have been monitoring the species living off the coast of russia for years and tracked the record - breaking journey over five - and - half months between 2011 and 2012
gray whales typically do n't feed during migration , which has led researchers to believe varvara did n't eat during the long journey either
they found that varvara , which is russia for barbara , visited the three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales , which are found off north america , according to the study published by the royal society in the journal biology letters

varvarva is a 13 - year - old western gray whale
but instead , she turned up off mexico 's baja instead and mingled with eastern gray whales near their nursery lagoon in mexico
experts tracked varvara to find that she made a swam 14,000 miles ( 22,500 ) from the east coast of russia to breeding grounds off the coast of mexico , and back
the study said : â her 22,511 km round - trip is the longest documented mammal migration and strongly suggests that some presumed western gray whales are actually eastern gray whales foraging in areas historically attributed to wester gray whales
â the previous longest journey made by a mammal was held by a humpback whale , who swam more than 11,706 miles ( 18,839km ) in 2011
the migration from the feeding grounds was also made by two other whales who were being monitored , called flex and agent , who were all tagged seven years ago
western gray whales were thought to have gone extinct by the 1970s before a small population was discovered in russia off sakhalin island
the migration from the feeding grounds was also made by two other whales who were being monitored , called flex and agent , who were all tagged seven years ago
here , experts observe the animals breaching like their western cousins , eastern gray whales were decimated by whaling and listed as endangered , but conservation efforts led to their recovery
the whales learn their migratory route from their mothers , who take them on their first journey from the breeding grounds to more northern feeding grounds and repeat the journey the following year
â the fact that endangered western gray whales have such a long range and interact with eastern gray whales was a surprise and leaves a lot of questions up in the air , â said mate , director of the marine mammal institute at oregon state university and lead author on the study
he said that the gray whales found in russia waters are a part of an eastern population that is restoring its former historical range
â the ability of the whales to navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive and suggests that some western gray whales might actually be eastern grays , â dr mate said
