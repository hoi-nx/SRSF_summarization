an ohio woman has spoken out in a reddit about why she and her catholic husband made the painful decision to have a legal abortion at 23 weeks
when the couple learned that their unborn daughter had a chromosomal defect ' incompatible with life outside the womb ' , they decided that terminating the pregnancy was the best course of action
' i am pro-choice because i am pro-life , ' the woman , who has chosen to remain anonymous , said
' sad decision : after an amniocentesis , the ohio woman found out that her unborn daughter found out that her daughter would n't survive outside the womb , and she chose to get an abortion the anonymous couple was happy to learn that they were expecting last december
but the woman had a gut feeling something was n't right
she was referred to another hospital with a specialized fetal medicine center where , two weeks later , an amniocentesis test showed that the fetus had triploidy , a chromosomal defect that is ' incompatible with life outside the womb '
they learned that their unborn daughter had 69 chromosomes instead of the normal 46 , an abnormality that also resulted in dandy walker syndrome
the fetus was so small that it could have died in the womb without the woman knowing , which could have resulted in an infection
with the knowledge that her health was at risk and her child would be unable to live , the woman and her husband made the decision to terminate the pregnancy
and the woman added that the decision was especially hard for her husband , who grew up catholic
still , he agreed , carrying the child to term was n't worth the risk to his wife 's health
in their state of ohio , abortion is legal until 24 weeks - but that does n't compel all doctors to perform them
but because he practiced within a catholic institution , he had to seek special approval from the ceo and the ethics board , explaining that that the woman 's child would n't survive and that there were dangers in letting the pregnancy progress naturally
after going home for the night , where she experienced cramping , the woman went back to the clinic with her husband the next day to have the 45 - minute procedure under general anaesthesia
' [ our baby ] passed painlessly inside me and was never alone , ' the woman said , adding that their daughter will be be cremated , and the ashes will be spread over garden at hospital
source : webmd the woman said that she and her husband are still grieving and experience bouts of ' spontaneous sobbing '
she wonders how mother 's day , which is on may 10 , will feel and how she 'll cope on the baby 's due date , but she knows that she and her husband made the right decision
' i do n't regret it , ' she said
