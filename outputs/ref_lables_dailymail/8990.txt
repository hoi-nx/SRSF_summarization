it found that children who ate a diet higher in saturated fats and cholesterol had slower reaction times and a poorer working memory
children who ate the fatty diet performed worse when they were given a task - switching game to complete , the researchers said
a new study has found that children who ate a diet higher in saturated fats and cholesterol had slower reaction times and a poorer working memory
a stock image is pictured for the study , scientists at the university of illinois recruited 150 children aged between seven and 10 and gave them a game which involved learning a pattern between a set of shapes and colours
the game was designed to test cognitive flexibility , which is our ability to shift attention , select information and alter our response strategy to fit the changing demands of a task
' children consuming diets higher in saturated fats exhibited longer reaction time during the task condition requiring greater amounts of cognitive flexibility , ' the study says
writing in the journal appetite , the researchers said : â cognitive flexibility is important because it comprises the ability to switch perspectives in daily life â for example , viewing a problem from the point of view of others or from a different direction , and involves being flexible enough to adjust to changing demands or priorities
â following adjustment of confounding variables - age , sex , socioeconomic status , iq , vo2max ( the rate at which the body can use oxygen during exercise ) and bmi , children consuming diets higher in saturated fats exhibited longer reaction time during the task condition requiring greater amounts of cognitive flexibility
