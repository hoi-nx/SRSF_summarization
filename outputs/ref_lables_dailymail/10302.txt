given the choice between ' average ' and ' beautiful ' , which description would you choose for yourself ? that is the question that has been posed to women by dove in a new survey , and the results are shocking
in australian , 83 per cent of women rate themselves as average looking , the study found , while around the world just four per cent think they 're worthy of the glowing epithet
while the statistics speak volumes about australian women 's perceptions of themselves , they appear more confident than the global average
a staggering 96 per cent of women around the world describe themselves as average , leaving just four per cent to admit they consider themselves beautiful
the beauty brand highlighted the survey results with a new video , released this week , that shows women being faced with the choice of telling the world they see themselves as beautiful or average
dove erected signs above doors to public buildings in five cities - shanghai , san francisco , london , sao paulo and delhi - and filmed women 's actions when faced with having to walk through one or the other
the vast majority of participants chose to walk through the ' average ' door , corresponding closely with the survey results
on film : the statistics are highlighted in a new video by dove which shows women having to walk through doors , either marked beautiful or average worldwide : the film was shot in five cities , shanghai , san francisco , london , sao paulo and delhi dove says that feeling beautiful is a personal choice that women should feel empowered to make for themselves every day
are you beautiful ? the global statistic was higher , with a staggering 96 per cent of worldwide respondents answering ' average ' choices : like the survey results , the overwhelming majority of women chose to walk through the doors marked ' average ' unnattainable : ' beautiful , to me , is too far out of reach , ' said one participant who chose the average door another said : ' it was my choice , and now i will question myself for the next few weeks , maybe months
