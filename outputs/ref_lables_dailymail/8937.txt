in monday 's pre-match press conference almost every question asked to madrid coach ancelotti made reference to the fact that in six madrid derbies this season madrid are yet to win a single game â losing four and drawing two as atletico have beaten them twice in the league and in the spanish super cup and the copa del rey
two draws could see them go through so what was the problem ? he said he did n't see barcelona 's slip on saturday night against sevilla because he was at the cinema ' enjoying a film ' and when he was asked about atletico 's threat from set - pieces he responded : ' do n't forget we won the champions league with a set - piece last season

' bale ( centre ) is set to start for madrid after being rested at the weekend against eibar on saturday like ramos , bale was also on target during madrid 's champions league final success over atletico last season the feeling among madrid 's coaching staff is that while bale has been criticised by the madrid press for not being the team player that isco is , his ability to win a big final with a goal or an assist is unmatchable
anelotti added : ' i am not obsessed with atletico , ' mentioning ' attitude ' several times in his positive discourse and admitting that was the key missing ingredient from madrid 's 4 - 0 defeat to atletico in february
atletico fans believe that fight will see them overcome madrid for the seventh time this season and the vicente calderon will be full for what , with their title hopes now gone , is their game of the season
