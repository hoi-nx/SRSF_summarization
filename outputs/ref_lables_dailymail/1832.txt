researchers sketching out a ' wiring diagram ' for rat brains have discovered its structure is organized like the internet
they say the animal 's cerebral cortex is ' like a mini-internet '
the brain operates in a similar way , the researchers found
' the cerebral cortex is like a mini-internet , ' said swanson , professor at the usc dornsife , and corresponding author of a paper on the discovery
' the brain operates in a similar way
two local networks â one governing vision and learning , and another tapped into bodily concerns like muscle and organ function â make up the inner shell of the rat 's cerebral cortex
swanson believes that the database can create an important link between human brain studies â which are largely done as non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging scans â and rat brain studies , which can be more in - depth
' having a wiring diagram for the brain will allow knowledge to flow both ways between human and animal studies , ' swanson said
' this allows us to take theories from human brain scan studies and experimentally verify them in animals , and discoveries made in animal studies are likely to have an analogue in humans
' in the future , swanson hopes to be able to expand the neural - connection map of the rat brain beyond the cerebral cortex , some day mapping the entire nervous system .
