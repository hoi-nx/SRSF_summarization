the father of the little girl who starred in a photograph that sent the internet into a frenzy because of a mystery pair of boots has ' no idea ' what the object could be
martin springall , 38 , photographed his young daughter - who he wished not be named - standing near a rocky outcrop in zushi , japan , in july 2014
' i took a series of them , ' mr martin springall said via email
martin springall ( pictured with his daughter , who he wished not to be named ) said he had ' no idea ' what the item could be a trick of the light or paranormal forces at play ? there is chatter online about what the cause of this apparent black boot apparition is eerie : a pair of black boots are clearly seen behind the little girl - even though her photographer father apparently does not recall a person standing there the reddit user who posted the controversial image online suggested they could be samurai boots - although others are not so sure mr martin springall gave permission for his friend , brian , to post the image to reddit - where it became a topic of ' mostly negative ' discussion - until it resurfaced this week ' i just kind of obsessed over that one photo for a couple of hours that evening and then tried to forget about it
' i really do n't like dwelling on stuff like this , to be honest - it freaks me out
' the photograph has sparked considerable debate on the website reddit , with sceptics arguing whether the picture was modified , if there was a person standing behind the girl or if it was all a trick of the light
mr martin springall insisted there was ' no one ' else in the vicinity - and said it had not been photoshopped , despite sceptics believing otherwise
' she likely would n't even have posed for the picture in that case , because she 's incredibly shy '
in this picture from the same set , no one appears to be standing behind this little girl however , in this other supplied picture , the black boots have returned ' i have no idea what the boots are , where they come from or what they could represent
both martin springall and brian sceptics have noted the presence of a blue piece of fabric lingering behind the little girl he added that he had just been ' speculating ' previously when he said on reddit that the boots appeared to be ' samurai boots '
' i 'm about as skeptical as they come when it comes to the paranormal , so your guess is as good as mine
