jack nicklaus recorded his first ever hole - in - one at the masters on wednesday , as camilo villegas fired two in the space of five holes but still could not win the traditional par - three contest

kevin streelman holds his trophy aloft after winning the par-3 contest on a play - off against camilo villegas kevin streelman therefore became the latest player to be saddled with the ' curse ' of the par - three champion , with no player ever becoming par - three and masters champion in the same year
augusta 's par - three course traditionally hosts the contest the day before start of the major ' it was a really fun day , especially to have ethan with me here , ' kevin streelman said

woods played in the masters par - three contest at augusta for the first time in 11 years that took the 75 - year - old six - time champion to three under par , but he would bogey the fifth and hit two balls into the water on the ninth to end his hopes of an unlikely triumph
former us open champion curtis strange reminded jack nicklaus of the tradition that players who make a hole - in - one have to buy the drinks in the clubhouse when jack nicklaus walked past the espn commentary position
the masters official twitter account shared an image of mcilroy and tiger woods with horan the 18 - time major winner added on espn : ' i never had a hole in one at augusta , in the par three ( contest ) or on the golf course
doing an interview this morning i said all i have to do is go out there , make a hole - in - one and win the par three
' since the contest started in 1960 , nobody has ever become par - three and masters champion in the same week , a fact which sometimes sees players deliberately not shoot the best score possible
most treat it as light relief and invite family or friends to act as their caddies , including tiger woods this year for the first time since 2004
