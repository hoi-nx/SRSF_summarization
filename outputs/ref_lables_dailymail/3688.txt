swift and rumored boyfriend calvin harris spotted together after watching the band haim perform at troubadour club in west hollywood were a record company to write a job description for the next big thing in popular music , certain attributes would surely be high on the list
because he has plenty of reasons for self - confidence
seventy million of them , in fact
that is the fortune the 31 - year - old pop leviathan has amassed since bursting onto the scene eight years ago
no mean feat for an introspective and , by his own admission , curmudgeonly son of a biochemist from the scottish borders who less than a decade ago was stacking supermarket shelves to make ends meet
to put it into perspective , his Â£ 70 million nest egg eclipses the fortunes of household names such as kylie minogue and sir cliff richard
so how has a pasty - faced , gangly geek ( he âs 6ft 5in ) , who decided early in his career to eschew personal publicity altogether , turned into the biggest pop star in british ? the numbers do nât lie
last year alone he earned Â£ 45 million
for one night âs work dj - ing at a party in puerto rico , he was reportedly paid $ 1million
the year before he grossed Â£ 30 million , making him comfortably the best paid dj on the planet , and in the same year his credibility was bolstered by an ivor novello awards for songwriter of the year
holding a pineapple on his head , he bent over and pointed at his buttocks â a bizarre performance which he later explained was a protest against the â frightening stranglehold that simon cowell has got over the entire music chart in the british at the moment â
protesting about x factor âs obsession with fame , he declared : â i âm not a celebrity
he was born calvin harris in 1984 in dumfries
his father , david , now 72 , was the lead biochemist at the local hospital and his mother , pamela , 65 , had been an occupational therapist but became a full - time housewife after calvin harris was born
dj calvin harris performs onstage in east rutherford , new jersey
in 2008 he stormed the stage at an x factor stage performance to protest what he called the programme 's obsession with fame two older siblings went on to become , respectively , an it expert and a marketing executive
as a teenager , he underwent a dance music epiphany while listening to the radio in his bedroom
but instead of heading out to pursue the rockânâroll cliche in pubs and clubs , the cerebral young man shut himself in his bedroom , where he built his own studio and spent the next eight years honing the production skills which would make his fortune
soon his music making had become an obsession
he has said that he so rarely left his room that he experienced a personality change , becoming an anti-social electronic music geek , chained to a keyboard
two years ago , he surpassed michael jackson to become the first artist to score nine top - ten hits from a single album
ellie goulding was an on - off dalliance for years , and he had a year - long relationship with singer rita ora , which ended with a twitter argument
calvin harris had made a career working with some of the hottest stars in pop music , including ellie goulding ( left ) and rihanna ( right ) all of which paints a less than complimentary picture of a petulant star whose life has changed beyond recognition
no longer a the anorak - loving teenager from dumfries , calvin harris owns an Â£ 11 million mansion in beverly hills that was the year he signed a deal to dj at the american superclub hakkasan , taking up a residency in las vegas and buying an Â£ 11 million mansion in beverly hills
in less than a decade he has gone from a nondescript detached house on the georgetown housing estate just outside dumfries , to a mansion with ten bedrooms , 11 bathrooms , two swimming pools and a guesthouse so palatial it comes with its own private garage
last year , he became the first artist to have his music streamed over a billion times on the internet and , at the rate he is going , the dj will have Â£ 250 million in the bank before he hits 40
the hakkasan gig alone earns him Â£ 200,000 a night , while he has been paid many millions more by brands who use his music in advertising campaigns
