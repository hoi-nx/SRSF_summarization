neuroscientists have identified the area of the brain that is the key to picking up on when someone is being sarcastic
they found that people with damage to the right sagittal stratum - a bundle of white matter that lies between the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures in the brain - are unable to detect sarcasm
stroke patients with damage in the sagittal stratum in the right hemisphere of the brain ( shown in the image above ) were far poorer at detecting sarcasm when listening to sentences , according to the new research stroke survivors often suffer damage to this area of their brain and struggle to recognise when family and friends are being sarcastic
according to researchers at john hopkins medical school in baltimore , the level of damage to this area of the brain seems to directly affect a persons ability to detect sarcasm
' percent damage to the sagittal stratum had the greatest weight and was the only independent predictor of sarcasm recognition
the popular blackadder comedy series ( above ) tapped into the british love of sarcasm as a form of humour during their study , which is published in the journal neurocase , the researchers took fmri scans of the brains of 24 stroke patients while they listened to 40 sentences of sincere or sarcastic speech
the researchers found that thsoe who performed least well in the tests tended to have damage to the right sagittal stratum
five of the participants were found to have significant damage here were only able to correctly identify 22 per cent of the sarcastic comments
according to livescience , professor hillis said that in the general population , most people should be able to identify 90 per cent of sarcastic comments
she said the findings could be used to help patients who have suffered brain damage regain the ability to recognise sarcastic cues and help families communicate to their loved ones more effectively
