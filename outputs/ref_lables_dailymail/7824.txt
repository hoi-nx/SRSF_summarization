england could have a separate income tax rate to scotland under radical new reforms which will be introduced within 100 days of a tory election victory , cameron announced today
the prime minister pledged to deliver effective â home rule â for england - giving mps the same powers to set tax rates which have been agreed for scotland following last year 's independent referendum
mr cameron said in the interests of fairness england mps must be given a veto on legislation that no longer applies in scotland
it will mean england , wales and northern irish mps being able to set a separate rate of income tax to that in scotland â where the snp is expected to hold sway after the election â with mps north of the border having no say
mr cameron helps build an industrial fan during a campaign visit in colchester in essex this afternoon the prime minister 's visit came as he courted england voters with an election pledge to create a separate rate of income tax for england the party has traditionally relied on the votes of its army of scotland mps at westminster , which it used to implement tuition fees and foundation hospitals even though they did not apply in scotland
labour âs leader in scotland murphy yesterday claimed mr cameron was â cheap â , â nasty â and an â election agent â for the snp in scotland
but mr cameron , speaking lincoln , said : â we do not support england nationalists , we do not want an parliament , we are the tory and unionist party through and through
â soon , the scottish parliament will be voting to set its own levels of income tax â and rightly so â but that has clear implications
england mps will be unable to vote on the income tax paid by people in aberdeen and edinburgh while scotland mps are able to vote on the tax you pay in birmingham or canterbury or leeds
â other commitments in the tories ' england manifesto ' include a commitment to spend more on the nhs in real terms every year , deliver a â truly seven - day nhs â and keep the cancer drugs fund , which pays for expensive treatments on the nhs
mr cameron added : â my message to people who want these things , who want their own home , more childcare , an nhs protected and their taxes cut , is : there is only one way to guarantee it : vote tory on may 7
