justin rose might just have made the most important pencil mark of his entire career to put himself in contention at augusta this weekend
but it took a neat bit of psychology to rescue his round after a disastrous start as he tried to build on his opening - day 67
rose bogeyed three of the first four holes , finding himself playing from the trees as he recovered from wayward tee shots
and that was where the magic pencil line came to his rescue
justin rose battled back from a nightmare start and is in contention at augusta rose tees off at the 18th as he now sits joint third , seven shots behind runaway leader jordan rose flips his club after hitting from a trap on the 13th during a decent round for the englishman â i told myself to move on and take one shot at a time
and 34 - year - old rose believes the change of fortune can continue into the weekend
â maybe ian poulter could borrow rose âs pencil after a disappointing day in which his putter could nât get going
