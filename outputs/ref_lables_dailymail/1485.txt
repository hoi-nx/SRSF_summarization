a couple bought a beanie baby for Â£ 10 at a car boot sale - and later realised it was worth Â£ 62,500
leah rogers and ryan flanaghan were selling a range of toys at the boot sale in bude , cornwall , when they spotted the purple teddy at another seller 's stall
as a former collector , mr ryan flanaghan , 22 , recognised the bear as a limited edition princess diana di beanie baby - one of the most sought after in the collection which can be worth thousands of pounds
they are now selling it on ebay , with a starting bid of Â£ 20,000 but the builder was stunned to find out that the bear was one of just 100 made around the world - and that another version is currently listed on ebay for Â£ 62,500
the pair are now hoping to sell the bear on the auction site and put the money towards a deposit for a house
miss leah rogers , 20 , a beauty therapist who lives in launceston , cornwall , said : ' we could n't believe it

the range was created in december 1997 - the year the princess died - to raise money for the princess of wales memorial trust
