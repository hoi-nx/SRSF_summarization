among the state of california 's approximately 162,000 inmates , the most dangerous serve their time in level iv maximum - security facilities where it is estimated as much as 97 per cent are gang affiliated
now , all four reside in a sensitive needs housing unit new unit : a former member of an aryan brotherhood gang walks through the prison yard in the sensitive needs housing facility at the cdc , a section of the prison where gang behaviour is banned mixing it up : inmates of different races and gang backgrounds play basketball together in the sensitive needs housing unit yard under the supervision of correctional officers in stark contrast to the segregation that generally governs prison life since 1999 , the cdc has seen a dramatic increase in requests from inmates seeking special protection for dropping out of prison gangs , and as a result has set up several sensitive needs housing units
a sensitive needs housing unit can be found inside level iv maximum - security facilities and is set to protect former members from the gangs , some of the more prominent being the black guerilla family , aryan brotherhood and rival hispanic gangs nuestra familia from northern california and the mexican mafia from the south
the exclusive units inside sensitive needs housing unit provide a safer environment , free from gang activity , and the transition out of gang membership is dramatic
building bridges : an ex-mexican mafia ( southern california ) gang member exercises with former members of the nuestra familia ( northern california ) in the the sensitive needs housing unit
historically , members of these two rival gangs would have killed each other on sight the other side of things : prisoners who still remain in the ' normal ' parts of the prison , outside the sensitive needs housing unit , refuse to exercise simultaneously , inmates alternate their workout routines until members of other gangs race have finished former leader : dimas ' diablo ' deleon , was one of the most feared enforcers for the nuestra familia ( northern california ) prison gang
he now resides in the sensitive needs housing unit , where corrections officers , as well as inmates , report a considerable reduction in racial violence and segregation
although inmates of the sensitive needs housing unit are no longer gang affiliated or validated , the fact remains that they are some of the most hardened and dangerous men behind bars
some racial segregation is still self - imposed by the inmates , and they are routinely stripped and undergo full - body cavity searches for weapons and narcotics
with racial tensions running high at level iv facilities , validated gang members and other residents of administrative segregation housing unit spend their exercise time in 15ftx7ft cages , called ' dog runs
instead , inmates alternate their workout routines , waiting until members of rival gangs have finished
