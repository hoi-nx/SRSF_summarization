researchers have found that twisted bands of magnetic fuel reach the surface of the sun every two years - in addition to its existing 11 - year cycle
and when the seasons combine , the activity of the sun can be amplified , producing mega storms that are even more dangerous to earth than others
scientists in colorado have found evidence for a new solar season cycle
every two years it appears ' bands ' of magnetic field move to the surface
this combines with the existing 11 - year solar cycle , causing even more powerful coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , pictured , and solar flares that can endanger earth the study was carried out by a team of researchers led by the ncar ( ncar ) in colorado
they found that the changes seem to be driven by bands of strong magnetic fields in the sun 's hemispheres which emanate from the solar interior
it was already known that the sun goes through a solar cycle of 11 years , during which its activity increases and decreases
the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the earth 's magnetic field
but this shorter two - year season seems to also play a part in the sun 's activity , on a similar scale to the 11 - year cycle - despite being much quicker
the new solar season occurs when twisted , ring - shaped ' bands ' of magnetic field rise from the solar interior and pass to the surface through the tachocline - a ' transition ' region in the outer third of the sun. ' much like earth 's jet stream , whose warps and waves have had severe impact on our regional weather patterns in the past couple of winters , the bands on the sun have very slow - moving waves that can expand and warp it too , ' said co-author dr robert leamon , a scientist at montana state university
' the result of this motion is that the bands create turbulent regions of activity on the surface , causing solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes )
solar flares are flashes of energy on the surface of the sun , which are sometimes associated with cmes - although their connection is not well understood
the new solar season discovery occurs when twisted , ring - shaped ' bands ' of magnetic field rise from the solar interior and pass to the surface through the tachocline - a ' transition ' region in the outer third of the sun. shown in this illustration are the various different regions of the sun and a sunspot ( top right ) the bands , which appear in each hemisphere of the sun , cause the 11 - year solar cycle to actually become a longer cycle that lasts 22 years
the 11 - year solar cycle sees a periodic change in the sun âs activity - such as the number of ejections - in addition to changes in the number of sunspots , flares and other visible differences
however , the cause of the 11 - year cycle is poorly understood
and according to this new research , when the 11 - year cycle combines with the two - year cycle , the solar storms that pummel earth 's atmosphere can be amplified
the 11 - year solar cycle sees a periodic change in the sun âs activity - such as the number of ejections - in addition to changes in the number of sunspots , flares and other visible differences
the answer appears to be that seasonal changes may cause an upswing in solar disturbances long after the peak in the solar cycle
