and while the dangers of overheating lithium ion ( li-ion batteries ) batteries have been known for some time , researchers have now revealed exactly what happens inside the ' burning ' cells
thermal images show copper inside the battery reaching temperatures of at least 1,085 Â° c ( 1,985 â° f ) causing jets of molten material to burst from its vent
copper inside melted , indicating temperatures of at least 1,085 Â° c ( 1,985 Â° f ) , and it caused molten material to stream from the vent ( pictured ) the footage is the first time the failure of li-ion batteries due to overheating has been recorded
li - ion batteries are vulnerable to a condition known as thermal runaway , which occurs when the rate of heat generation is greater than the rate of heat lost
although battery failure is rare , prevention of thermal runaway presents one of the greatest challenges for the safe operation of lithium - ion batteries
dr shearing and his colleagues subjected two commercial li - ion batteries , known as cell 2 , to external heat
li - ion batteries are vulnerable to a condition known as thermal runaway , which occurs when the rate of heat generation is greater than the rate of heat lost
a li-ion batteries before being subjected to high temperatures is shown left , the same battery after heat abuse is shown right during tests , one cell remained intact during battery failure and as the heat - generating reactions continued , hot gas followed by molten material jetted out through the battery âs vent ( pictured left to right )
by comparison , the rapid pressure rise in a second cell caused the entire cap of the cell to detach cell 1 remained intact during battery failure and as the heat - generating reactions continued , hot gas followed by molten material jetted out through the battery âs vent
li - ion batteries have been known to overheat and are vulnerable to thermal runaway
lithium - ion cells with cobalt cathodes , for example , are not designed to rise above 130 Â° c ( 265 â° f )
