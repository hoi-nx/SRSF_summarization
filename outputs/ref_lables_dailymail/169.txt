a year after he launched his own app and made headlines , grand is still homeless on the night he launched his first app , a homeless man predicted that his life was going to change
' i can work at google , i can work at spacex , ' grand gleefully stated minutes after his carpooling app trees for cars went live
in august 2013 patrick mcconlogue offered grand , the homeless man he saw every day on his walk to work in new york , a deal : he would either give him $ 100 , or he would teach him how to code
grand realized he could go through ' $ 100 in a few days ' and instead jumped at the opportunity to learn something new that he could then ' turn into something more , ' he told business insider in 2013
patrick mcconlogue provided grand with daily lessons , as well as a laptop , wireless hot spot , coding books , a solar charger and office space at the start - up where he worked once it got too cold to type outside
grand , who once said he was n't ' the average homeless person ' and that he considered himself ' eco-friendly ' , came up with an app designed to get more cars off the road
grand created trees and cars after patrick mcconlogue offered him a deal : $ 100 in cash on the spot or daily coding lessons
grand picked the latter , and was also provided a laptop , office space and coding books but grand is still living on the streets
he said the number one question people ask him is why he 's still homeless trees for cars only made grand between $ 10,000 to 15,000 dollars , he said
and patrick mcconlogue has since taken a job in san francisco , although he still meets up with grand every time he 's back in new york
the app is no longer in online stores because grand does not want to pay for its server space
grand instead uses the money he made from the app to pay for his storage space
he insists that he likes living outdoors , although he said he plans to move into an apartment after he makes his second app. grand said if he could do it all over again , he would have made a different app the first time around
he said he only made around $ 10 - 15,000 with trees for cars
