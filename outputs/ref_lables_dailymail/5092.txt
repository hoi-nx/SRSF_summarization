a japan bullet train has broken the speed record for rail vehicles by reaching 366mph ( 589km/h )
the maglev train completed a test run on a track in yamanashi , beating the previous record of 361mph ( 580km/h ) set in 2003
another attempt is scheduled for tomorrow , and engineers at the central japan railway company predict it could reach 373mph ( 600km/h )
the seven - car train was able to go so fast because it made use of a magnetic charge to lift and move it above a guideway
the technology promises a ride that 's smoother , quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high - speed rail
the speeds , however , wo n't be as high when the new line between tokyo and nagoya comes into service in 2027
according to engineers , the trains will travel at 314mph ( 505km/h ) , which will cut the journey time for a 178 - mile journey by more than half
japan is well - established as the world leader in high - speed trains , having developed the first ' bullet train ' in 1964 it is now hoping to bring the technology to the us and has outlined plans for a line between washington and baltimore , which will cut travel times between the cities to just 15 minutes
the first commercial maglev train to come into operation was a relatively low - speed shuttle at birmingham international airport in 1984
it was not until the turn of the century , though , that high - speed maglev would come into commercial operation , mostly in japan and china
the technology promises a ride that 's smoother , quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high - speed rail
the speeds wo n't be as high when the new line between tokyo and nagoya comes into service in 2027 china was the first country to have a commercially - operated hts maglev service
told the los angeles times that maglev trains have proved to be expensive , power - intensive , and potentially unsafe
