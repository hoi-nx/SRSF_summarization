villa deserved their victory at wembley on sunday and there were two players at the heart of it all
jack grealish was fantastic but delph was the best player on the pitch
he looked like the player we all felt he could become when he emerged at leeds
as for grealish , for a young man to play like that on his first visit to wembley was magnificent
jack grealish , delph and christian benteke celebrate as villa reached the fa cup final delph shoots and scores against liverpool goalkeeper simon mignolet to put villa ahead at wembley he is quick but has a languid style , like steve mcmanaman
when he drops his shoulder he sends defenders so far the other way they almost have to pay to get back in
tim sherwood has done a brilliant job with villa
i was at wembley and their fans turned up with a sense of expectancy , something they have not had in a long time
tim sherwood deserves huge credit for that
he has ignited that team and got their passion and excitement back
delph and grealish , pictured with gabrial agbonlahor inside the dressing room , impressed at wembley grealish is quick and has a languid style similar to former liverpool and england star steve mcmanaman foxes home advantage could be key april 25 - burnley ( a ) apr 29 - chelsea ( h ) may 2 - newcastle ( h ) may 9 - southampton ( h ) may 16 - sunderland ( a ) may 24 - qpr ( h ) of the three promoted teams fighting for their lives at the bottom , leicester look the most likely to stay up
that âs why leicester have been able to drag themselves off the bottom of the table
they have scored 10 in their last four , including three at tottenham in a game they were unlucky to lose 4 - 3
now they have won three games in a row - a winning streak only arsenal ( 8 ) and chelsea ( 4 ) can beat
the key for leicester now is that , of their six remaining games , four of them are at home
that home advantage could be the difference between staying up or going down

what better way for one of liverpool âs greatest ever players to depart the club than with an fa cup win ? it is a shame he wo nât be there but he has probably achieved more at liverpool than he would ever have dreamed of
he will be devastated not to make the final but for the club âs sake , not his
gerrard looks dejected after liverpool 's fa cup semi-final defeat to villa on sunday liverpool captain gerrard will be devastated at not reaching the fa cup final but for the club 's sake , not his winning the fa cup would have been the perfect send off for gerrard who is leaving liverpool for la galaxy chelsea just do what 's needed 1 - chelsea have lost just one of their last 13 premier league home games against man united ( 3 - 2 in oct 2012 ) , winning eight and drawing four it 's difficult to be critical of a side like chelsea
they have an incredible record at home and an uncanny ability to win the big games

the pressure will be all on them and they will have to compete with the energy of that villa midfield
arsenal celebrate during the win over reading but will have to be careful against villa in the fa cup final burnley must keep believing april 25 - leicester ( h ) may 2 - west ham ( a ) may 9 - hull ( a ) may 16 - stoke ( h ) may 24 - villa ( a ) for dyche and his side , their season starts now
they have only scored one goal in their last seven games , although that was a significant winner against manchester city
