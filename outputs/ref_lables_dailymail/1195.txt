now , one scientist says this may not be true , and that interactions between particles emitted by a black hole can reveal information about what lies within
for nearly 40 years , physicists have argued that black holes suck in information and then evaporate without leaving behind any clues as to what they once contained
now , one scientist says this may not be true ' according to our work , information is n't lost once it enters a black hole , ' says dejan stojkovic , an associate professor of physics at the university of buffalo
this is an important discovery because even physicists who believed information remains in black holes have struggled to show , mathematically , how this happens
the research marks a significant step toward solving the ' information loss paradox , ' a problem that has plagued physics for almost 40 years , says dr dejan stojkovic
last year , stephen hawking revised his theory by declaring that black holes were in fact ' grey '
the grey hole theory would allow matter and energy to be held for a period of time before being released back into space in the 1970s , stephen hawking proposed that black holes were capable of radiating particles , and that the energy lost through this process would cause the black holes to shrink and eventually disappear
but last year , stephen hawking revised his theory by declaring that black holes were in fact ' grey ' the grey hole theory would allow matter and energy to be held for a period of time before being released back into space
this is a violation of quantum mechanics , which states that information must be conserved
