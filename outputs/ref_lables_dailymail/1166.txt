protesters opposing the construction of a $ 1.4billion telescope on a mountain in hawaii they consider to be sacred were arrested after blocking a road leading to the site
police arrested 12 protesters thursday when they tried to block trucks heading to the peak of mauna kea where one of the world 's largest telescopes is being built
while the hawaiian groups do not oppose the thirty meter telescope itself , they disagree with the location of the construction on mauna kea - the highest point in the state which is considered a home of deities
about 300 people took part in the demonstration and those who were arrested were released after they each posted a $ 250 bail
and scientists believe the site is ideal location for one of the world 's largest telescopes because of its remote and sheltered position , nestled in the crater of a dormant volcano
' all of the highest points in the islands are considered the home of deities , according to pisciotta
some consider the $ 1.4 billion thirty meter telescope project as desecrating the big island 's mauna kea ( on monday protesters formed a road block outside the mauna kea visitors center ) department of land and natural resources officers lead thirty meter telescope protesters from the telescope building site on the summit of mauna kea on thursday work got underway after protesters were arrested and their path was cleared to the summit , sandra dawson , a spokeswoman for the project , said in an email to the associated press
police said they warned protesters after an incident monday that anyone who blocked the road would be arrested
on monday , more than 50 protesters formed a roadblock monday that stopped about 15 vehicles carrying workers up mauna kea , causing workers to wait more than eight hours before making their way down the mountain
' we regret that police action had to be taken to enable our legal access to the project site , ' thirty meter telescope project manager gary sanders said in a statement relating to thursday 's arrests
' the university sub-leases the land atop mauna kea for the telescope project , and it has always maintained that protesters would have free access to the site as long as they were not breaking any laws , he said
