just days after the former australian swimming champion 's unexpected comeback , hackett 's father has revealed that the sleeping pill addiction which ruined his son 's personal life and tarnished his career , was triggered by a death threat
former police inspector neville hackett said that his son had ' his life threatened by a well - known associate of criminals ' two years ago , leading the swimmer to immediately hop on a plane to his parent 's home in the gold coast
it was when his life was threatened and he could n't sleep at night from all the worry , ' hackett senior told the daily telegraph
following his swimming comeback on sunday night , in which he earned a 2015 world titles relay team berth by cruising to fourth place in one minute and 46.84 seconds , hackett reflected on how much he had turned his life around in the past 12 months
former police inspector neville hackett ( centre ) said that his son had ' his life threatened by a well - known associate of criminals ' two years ago the addiction to stilnox which ensued , led hackett 's personal life to fall apart last year
it also began around the time he divorced australian singer candice alley in august 2013 ' if you had asked me 10 years ago if the only thing that got me on the team was on the relay it would be bitter disappointment , ' hackett said
while hackett 's personal life fell apart last year due to his sleeping pill addiction , his professional demons went back as far as his last major meet , the beijing 2008 olympic games , where he was denied a record third straight 1500m gold medal
the dual olympic champion said , following his sunday night achievement : ' if you had asked me 10 years ago if the only thing that got me on the team was on the relay it would be bitter disappointment , but right now , it is one of the biggest achievements of my life ' he made the team after only six months of training following a six - year layoff , with his training schedule now involving 55 - 60km of swimming a week and three gym sessions , according to coach denis cotterell ( pictured ) ' i will be honest
' hackett had been adamant he had not even launched a comeback after entering the 2015 national titles
