bali nine ringleaders myuran sukumaran and andrew chan will today find out if their last - ditch legal appeal against their death row sentence will be allowed to proceed
a jakarta court is due to decide whether the pair âs lawyers can challenge indonesian president joko widodo âs decision to deny the two australians clemency
if it overturns this decision on monday , lawyers will then argue mr joko widodo did not fulfil his obligations when he issued a blanket rejection of clemency to andrew chan and myuran sukumaran , as he plans to do to more than 50 other death row drug offenders
president joko widodo previously rejected the australians pair 's clemency bids the pair are currently being held in isolation on the prison island family members of australians death row prisoners andrew chan and myuran sukumaran leave nusakambangan prison island after visiting the two prisoners on march 9 on sunday , jakarta 's catholic archbishop , ignatius suharyo hardjoatmodjo , told reporters he was saddened by indonesian 's use of the death penalty , which he described as a " failure of humanity "
also distressing for the archbishop was the severe treatment of andrew chan and myuran sukumaran when they were moved last month from their bali jail cells to nusakambangan , which involved a fighter jet escort
