budget airline easyjet has been charging stranded customers a Â£ 10 fee for proof that their flight was cancelled
the charge came to light when customers sought to claim money back from travel insurers after french air - traffic strikes affected flights earlier this month
they were asked to provide an airline letter confirming the cancellation , but easyjet told its hard - hit passengers to pay a Â£ 10 fee
however , a spokesman for easyjet defended the airline âs position , saying : â the administration charge for the letter is applied because each letter has to be individually researched and created for each passenger
â in an email seen by the mail in response to one customer âs request , easyjet âs customer service team said : â we can certainly send you a letter to help you claim on your insurance , that âs not a problem
â there is a small administration fee of 10gbp for the letter , which you should be able to claim back through your insurer
easyjet is french âs second - largest airline and cancelled 588 flights over the two days
