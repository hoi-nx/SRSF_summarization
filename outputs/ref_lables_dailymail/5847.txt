corrales of new jersey claims he was driving with his wife and daughter , 10 , last june near resorts world casino in the queens section of new york city when a car cut in front of him after refusing to let him change lanes
he then claims that when he got out of the car to get the car 's license plate number , he was mowed down by the car , and driven for several blocks at breakneck speed by the driver - a retired police officer with the nypd named muller
corrales then said he got out of his car at a red light to take the license plate number , while muller disputes this and claims the man followed him into the casino parking light
' when he returned to his car however , police arrived on the scene and arrested corrales for menacing behavior , harassment and cracking muller 's windshield
muller meanwhile was let off the hook , claiming it was corrales who jumped on the hood of his car after telling him ; ' get out of the car tough guy
' video footage from the casino does show corrales being driven on the hood of the car , but what happened prior to that is unclear
' instead of deterring mr. muller from future dangerous acts of road rage , the police ensured that he can continue to use his car as a weapon with impunity , ' said corrales â lawyer leo glickman
