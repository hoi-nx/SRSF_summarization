a new hiv treatment pioneered using an antibody to attack the virus could lead to a new vaccine to prevent the infection
the first results to emerge from patient trials reveal the experimental therapy can dramatically reduce the level of virus in a patient 's blood - their viral load
the antibody was designed by researchers to block the key viral protein receptor that is needed to infect human blood cells
as a result patients injected with the neutralising antibody during the trials saw a 300-fold reduction in their viral load
scientists at the rockefeller university in new york believe a new antibody therapy could pave the way for an hiv vaccine after clinical trials revealed the treatment resulted in a 300-fold decrease in the amount of hiv , pictured , in sufferers ' blood in a person infected with hiv , there is an ongoing battle between the virus and the body 's immune system
the team of scientists at rockefeller university in new york now believe that using synthetic antibodies that attached to the surface of proteins on the outer membrane of the hiv virus , could offer an alternative treatment to the anti-retroviral drugs currently used
they hope the breakthrough will result in new therapeutic vaccines
hiv antibodies previously tested in humans had shown disappointing results , but the antibody tested at rockefeller university belongs to a new generation of broadly neutralising antibodies that potently fight a wide range of hiv strains
healthy gay men should be given anti-retroviral drugs to ' slash the number of cases of hiv ' , a groundbreaking study published earlier this year suggested
' the research showed the new antibody therapy was effective against 195 of 237 hiv strains
as part of the new study , uninfected and hiv - infected people were given a single dose of the antibody intravenously , and monitored for 56 days
at the highest dose level - 30mg per kilo of weight - all eight infected people treated showed up to a 300-fold decrease in the amount of hiv virus measured in their blood
