just 13 and in the grip of a terrifying obsession surviving on just one piece of fruit a day , anorexic schoolgirl laura 's body started to shut down
the 15 - year - old , from whitley bay , was left on a heart machine after she collapsed through starvation but has now spoken about pressures put on teenagers to be a ' size zero '
laura became so obsessed with having the perfect figure she would hide food down the side of her bed , lying to her mother about eating and sometimes surviving on just a piece of fruit a day
laura has spoken about her two - year fight with anorexia and revealed the pressures she felt to be thin
' after spending a week on a heart monitor at north tyneside general hospital , laura was finally offered support from eating disorder organisations as she began her recovery
' i was nearly 13 stone and felt like i was too big , ' laura said
laura was living off just one piece of fruit a day and would hide her food down the side of her bed so her parents would n't see it laura continued : ' i would look around at the other girls and they all seemed to be skinny and , of course , i wanted to be like them and fit into all the different types of clothes
everywhere you looked there seemed to be this idea that girls should be a size zero
' laura agreed with mum sue , 48 , to go on a ' sensible diet ' but soon the whitley bay high school pupil became frustrated , wanting to lose more weight , quicker
in february 2015 it was estimated that around 725,000 people were suffering from an eating disorder in the uk - 10 per cent of those were suffering from anorexia
' it was coming off quite slowly , at about 2lbs a week , ' said laura
' lack of food soon took its toll on laura 's health and her heart rate started slowing
' finally after a week of eating virtually nothing , laura collapsed
no happy and healthy laura has made it to the semi final of miss teen gb , the competition aims to stay away from size zero stereotypes sue , who works in sales , said : ' an ambulance was called and she was taken to hospital and put on the heart monitor for a week
' after getting discharged laura began working with eating disorder teams ( edict ) and camhs ( camhs ) to help in her recovery
