a queensland man has opened up about a very special friendship between him and his best mate - a crocodile called ' gregory '
tabone , 74 , who previously owned and ran johnstone river crocodile farm and zoo in far - north queensland first came across the 5.2 metre croc in 1989
rangers had already been trying to capture gregory , who had apparently been killing cattle in eubenangee swamp near mirriwinni , 70 kilometres south of cairns for years , when they asked for mr tabone 's help
tabone and gregory the crocodile shared a strong bond during their 20 year long friendship ' he was on the run for a couple of years , he had been a naughty boy and was taking cows , ' mr tabone told daily mail australia
' the farmer who owned the property where gregory was snatching cattle called in the help of mr tabone and , helped by some ' freak weather ' , they were finally able catch the reptile
gregory was captured my mr tabone in 1989 after he was found stealing a local farmer 's cattle ' three weeks later , water was down to about ankle - deep and i looked hard in the murky water and i said there 's this great big massive animal in there , ' mr tabone revealed
after a huge operation which involved 16 men carrying gregory onto the back of a truck and taking him back to mr tabone 's farm , the creature was finally settled into what would be his home for the next two decades
the 5.2 metre croc and his farmer would spend time together every day , and mr tabone said he was never frightened or felt he was in danger ' greg would brings friends over to have a look at the crocodile named after him
the farmer would then spend time perched on gregory 's back , chatting to him about what was happening on the farm
when asked whether what he was doing was dangerous , mr tabone disagreed saying he never felt unsafe with gregory
since mr tabone had to give up the farm in 2008 after repeated knee problems left him with less mobility than he was used to , the farmer has been back to visit gregory only once
mr tabone previously owned and ran johnstone river crocodile farm and zoo in far - north queensland ' i went down after 18 months and went down to gregory 's cage and he was in the water , ' he revealed
' but mr tabone does n't think he can go back to see gregory again , who he believes has been moved to another farm
mr tabone instead prefers to remember gregory as he knew him , happily sitting with his farmer and best friend sitting on his back , having a chat .
