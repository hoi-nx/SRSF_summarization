a georgia woman is speaking out about her refusal to follow doctors ' advice and pull the plug on her husband of just seven months following a devastating motorcycle crash
danielle says she looked to her faith when she was faced with the prospect of losing her husband brian in 2011 , just seven months after they were married
but she refused to give up and brian was eventually released into her care
danielle would soon come to the painful conclusion that brian had no idea she was his wife
brian tells wtoc that he also had no clue his father was dead or that he 'd been married to begin with
hopeless : brian 's motorcycle was split in two and doctors initially urged his wife to take him off life support danielle refused to give up on brian and took him into her full time care as he was still bedridden and hooked to a feeding tube miracle : eventually , brian started to improve and miraculously spoke the words ' i 'm trying ' one day weeks after danielle took him home with dismal prospects now , he and danielle work on his rehabilitation daily and use yoga to help him sharpen his mind and regain control of his body
while danielle is thrilled that brian has improved to the point he no longer requires medications , she says on a gofundme page started for the cause that the couple is too strapped to pay for all the rehabilitative care brian still requires
as brian continues to make great strides , most recently with his commitment to learning to walk the way he once did , he wants others to know how good they 've got it
' improvements : now danielle says brian is improving all the time and has gone from requiring 20 medications per day to requiring none
