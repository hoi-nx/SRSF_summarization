a five - year - old girl had to have her skull removed , smashed into pieces and put back together like a jigsaw puzzle after doctors discovered it was too small for her growing brain
her mother ciach , from geelong in victoria , had always wondered about the slightly narrow shape of daughter ava 's head
but it was n't until she took ava to a new doctor for a check - up that it was discovered two plates at the front of her skull had fused together prematurely - a rare condition known as sagittal synostosis - restricting the growth of her brain
' she was n't abnormal , you would n't look at her on street and think there 's something wrong with her
' the waiting was just the worst â is this result going to be good or bad ? most were not positive but that 's just what we had to deal with
' ava 's skull post surgery after it was ' smashed ' and put back together again in september last year ava underwent the operation , which involved making an incision from ear to ear and removing her whole skull ava was then taken to a combined clinic at the royal children 's hospital in melbourne with reconstructive plastic surgeon jonathan burge and 14 other neurosurgeons and other specialists to decide the course of action
in september last year ava underwent the operation , which involved making an incision from ear to ear and removing her whole skull
' they removed her whole skull and just rebuilt it from a mixture of screws , plates and fragments of her own bone
' the complex operation took nine hours , and ava was in a lot of pain in the days that followed
ava is pictured , six months after surgery , with her reconstructive plastic surgeon dr jonathan bruge ' it was horrible - you never want anyone else to go through it and see their child like that
' jonathan burge does great work at the royal children 's hospital ; it 's just an amazing , incredible place
' the royal children 's hospital 's good friday appeal is on tomorrow , april 3
