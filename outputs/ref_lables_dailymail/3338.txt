lenin may have been dead for 90 years , but his corpse looks better than the day he passed
this is the claim made by his embalmers , who have developed experimental techniques to maintain the look and feel of the communist revolutionary 's body
this is the claim made by his embalmers , who have developed experimental techniques to maintain the look and feel of the communist revolutionary 's body
pictured is his body in 1997 the gruesome job is the responsibility of a team known as the ' mausoleum group ' which , at its peak , involved 200 scientists working in a lab dedicated to the former leader 's corpse
according to a detailed report by hsu in scientific american , the russians prefer to preserve the body 's shape , weight , colour and flexibility , rather than biological tissue
' they have to substitute occasional parts of skin and flesh with plastics and other materials , ' yurchak , professor of social anthropology at the university of california , berkeley told mr hsu
' the bolshevik leader 's remains were embalmed on stalin 's orders when he died aged 53 in 1924 and kept on display in moscow apart from a period in the second world war the revolutionary 's body is on public display in a mausoleum on moscow 's red square more than two decades after the break - up of the former ussr
but this year russians officials closed red square so that scientists could prepare the body for public display during lenin 's 145th birthday anniversary â which took place yesterday
in his book , yurchak describes how a mild bleach is often used to deal with occasional fungus stains on lenin 's face
one such stain that appeared on lenin 's cheek had the embalmers worried for their lives when they were unable to remove it
every two years and the body is immersed in a bath of glycerol and potassium acetate for 30 days â a technique which scientists say could make the body last for centuries
while lenin 's blood , bodily fluids and internal organs were removed , his eyebrows , moustache and goatee are his own
a material made of paraffin , glycerin and carotene is used to replace most of lenin 's skin
the former culture minister medinsky said it was ' absurd ' that lenin had not been laid to rest 88 years after his death
