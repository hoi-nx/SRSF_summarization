new jersey governor christie was n't looking too presidential tuesday night when he got into a heated debate with a veteran teacher at a town hall meeting
' scroll down for video not being nice : new jersey gov christie ( left ) is being called a bully for the way he interacted with a teacher ( mooney , right ) at a tuesday night town hall meeting that sentiment does n't ring well with christie 's ambitions to run in the republican presidential primaries next year
tuesday night , christie appeared at kenilworth to take questions from a group of citizens , when mooney , a high school english teacher from roselle park , took the microphone
ms mooney , who has been a teacher for 27 years , questioned christie 's motivations behind a legal settlement with oil company exxonmobil which could have contributed drastically to the state 's pension plans for teachers
christie settled the deal for $ 225million , despite the fact that the state had originally asked for $ 8.9billion which mooney described as ' favoring the affluent ' and ' kicking state workers under the bus '
a good deal ? mooney questioned christie 's decision - making behind a $ 225million legal settlement
perhaps the reason why wollmer and his union responded sharply to christie 's town hall meeting tuesday night , is that he blamed the union for their role in the current pension system
' the fact is your union , over the course of time , has asked for significantly higher benefits - more expensive benefits - that your union knew the state could not afford , ' christie said tuesday .
