it was heralded as the world âs oldest musical instrument ; a bone with two holes in it seemingly made by neanderthal to serenade their companions
but now a study says it âs not an instrument at all - but rather , simply a bone chewed by hyenas and left in a cave
the research suggests historians have been fooled by these phoney objects - and , in fact , all such â instruments â attributed to neanderthal are simply chew toys of animals
a researcher says a ' bone flute ' found in slovenia is not an instrument - instead , he says it is simply a bone chewed by a hyena with teeth marks
the bone was discovered on 18 july 1995 in slovenia the latest analysis was conducted by dr diedrich from the paleo-logic independent institute of geosciences
in a paper published in the royal society of open science , he took a look at several â musical instruments â that had been attributed to neanderthal
the claws bear multiple cut marks , notches and signs that they had been polishing by the neanderthal that once inhabited the site where they were found
dr diedrich said analysis of the bone shows the holes are teeth marks , and the shape is just the result of the bone not breaking when it was chewed
the cave bear femur , pierced with two holes , was found in 1995 at the divje babe archaeological park ( shown ) near cerkno in northwestern slovenia the latest analysis says that many bones found in caves can simply be attributed to animals around 30,000 years ago , rather than neanderthal
shown is an exhibit of the life of a neanderthal family in a cave in the neanderthal museum in the northern town of krapina in croatia the first â neanderthal flutes â were discovered in slovenia in the 1920s and , since then , many others have been identified
he also points out that there is no evidence on the bones that tools have been used to make the holes , further cementing the idea they were made by hyena teeth
what âs more , he also said that most of the â bone flutes â do not actually date from neanderthal times - 200,000 to 30,000 years ago
