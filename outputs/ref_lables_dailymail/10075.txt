after nine holes where the ball was struck with impressive authority , woods decided to call it a day
at this place where he can draw upon so many happy memories , woods is going to have an awful lot of goodwill to help him along
by contrast , mcilroy practised at the other end of the day
now he was the one passing on the insight , as he strolled to the tee with british amateur champion , bradley neil
â i was feeling really happy and mcilroy steps up and crunches it 40 yards past me , â said bradley neil
â i just thought : â phew , he âs good , is nât he ? â â just days until 25 - year - old mcilroy âs tilt at the career grand slam and the thing that struck bradley neil was that you would have struggled to tell who was the amateur here to soak up the experience and who was the history man

â do yourself a favour bradley neil , and do nât ever go for this green in two , â said mcilroy
