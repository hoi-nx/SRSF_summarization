siblings will no longer be given priority for school places amid soaring competition because of a booming population , it has emerged
wandsworth council in london has announced that it is set to remove the rule giving an automatic place to a pupil 's brothers and sisters even if the family has moved out of the catchment area
this comes after it was revealed that 80,000 children face missing out on their preferred primary school , with more than 20,000 at risk of being denied any of their preferred choices
wandsworth council has announced that it is set to remove the rule giving priority to pupils ' siblings , pictured is honeywell which has a catchment area of just 182 metres wansdworth , which is an affluent borough , has decided to remove sibling priority from september 2016 in a bid to make the process fairer and give priority to children who live closest to schools
families who move more than 800 metres from their preferred school in wandsworth will lose their automatic entitlement to a place for younger brothers and sisters
a spokesman for the council said : ' a lot of people are getting school places then moving miles away , in some cases cashing in on house prices while retaining the school place
siblings then get priority over children living closer to the school
justine roberts , mumsnet ceo said : ' giving priority to siblings is tricky ; as one mumsnet user says , ' it 's lovely until the kids who live next door to the school ca n't get in '
more than 80,000 children face missing out on their preferred primary school , with 20,000 at risk of being denied any of their preferred choices ' on balance , most seem to think it would be sensible to restrict sibling priority to those families still living close to the school
' wandsworth council announced the decision to consult parents on the changes in september last year
speaking at the time , education spokesman cllr kathy tracey said : ' there has been a growing clamour from parents asking us to look at this rule because of mounting evidence that local school places are being offered to children living some distance away simply because they have an older sibling already enrolled there
this has become commonplace near schools rated outstanding by oftsed and can see kids that live close to a school denied a place in favour of siblings of children already at the school but who do n't live locally
' the proposals show starkly that the on - going baby boom has put unprecedented pressure on school places and local authorities are struggling to cope
councils are due to send out offers to more than 600,000 children for primary school places this september
