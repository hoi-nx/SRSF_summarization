some of our most spectacular views of mars have been presented on small , skinny strips of imagery
the new map allows astronomers to ' stand ' on planetary surfaces and could help explain how water and lava once flowed across the red planet
the warmer colours show a higher elevation the colour - coded terrain models show the impressive height of the meridiani planum region at up to 820ft ( 250 metres ) above the surface , seen in red
this is in contrast to the blue 1,6404ft ( 5,000 metres ) depth of the lower - lying chryse planitia region
the first mosaic , pieced together by the german aerospace center ( german aerospace center ) , comprises 1.4 million square miles ( 2.3 million square km ) of the surface
it covers the vast crater - strewn highland region of the red planet , parts of the ares vallis outflow channel , the chaotic aram chaos region as well as the meridiani planum and chryse planitia plains
the new map allows scientists to ' stand ' on planetary surfaces and could help explain how water and lava once flowed across mars
pictured is a colour - coded perspective view showing the topography of the upper course of ares vallis near the chryse planitia plains constructing a 3d model such as this requires a spacecraft to look at the same surface feature twice at a different angle
' gerhard mercator and carl friedrich gauss measured earth , and with our survey of mars we are following in their footsteps , ' says jaumann , a german aerospace center planetary scientist
hrsc on mars express is the only experiment that can do it with just one pass the data for this wide - area topography of mars was acquired by mars express ' high resolution stereo camera ( hrsc , ) which has been orbiting the red planet since 2003
by around 2018 , the team from german aerospace center , wants to represent the whole of mars as one coherent mosaic
