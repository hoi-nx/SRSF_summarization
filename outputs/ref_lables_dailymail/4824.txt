a sicilian mafia fugitive dubbed the godfather of uxbridge who was set to be extradited to italy will be allowed to remain in the britain after his sentence was dropped
domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven - year sentence by an italy court in 1999 for being a member of the sicilian mafia
in february he lost his year - and - a - half battle against extradition and was told he must return to italy to serve his sentence
but today it emerged that the 65 - year - old 's case expired last october and his arrest warrant is to be withdrawn
sentence dropped : domenico rancadore ( right and left ) fled to britain in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence in italy for his role as a ' man of honour ' although his conviction remains intact , italy law states that a sentence is extinguished once a period of more than double the time of the penalty has passed
domenico rancadore 's solicitor , todner said : ' yesterday the court of appeal agreed to extinguish the conviction of domenico rancadore on the basis that the conviction is too old to sustain a prison sentence
' i am therefore confident that the italy government will now withdraw their application for a arrest warrant and that mr domenico rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings
domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the britain after his sentence dropped domenico rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013
known as the professor , domenico rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven - year prison term for his ' mafia association '
he was convicted for his role as a ' man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo
domenico rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 sicilian mafia indicted
before his arrest in 2013 , domenico rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge there was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into domenico rancadore 's case
' mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ' the purpose of the extradition request was for domenico rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment
' it transpires that as of october last year the italy could not actually legally enforce that sentence
' so certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italy authorities saying : " hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request "
' had the italy said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible
' domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven - year sentence by an italy court in 1999 for being a member of the sicilian mafia asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the ' single - figure thousands rather than anything dramatic '
barrister philip marshall qc said : ' yet more incompetence by the cps in the domenico rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven - year prison sentence expired in october 2014
' there was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of domenico rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today
today it emerged that the 65 - year - old 's case expired last october and his arrest warrant is to be withdrawn sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ' they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple
the american mafia arose from offshoots of the sicilian mafia that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy
' bianchi , head of press at the italy embassy , said : ' when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr domenico rancadore to italy , the cps failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse
' that is key to the release of mr domenico rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire
' it gave the possibility to mr domenico rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired
