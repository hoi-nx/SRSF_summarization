duke was not the only big winner following monday 's ncaa championship game
in an upset even more surprising than the blue devils victory over the slightly favored wisconsin badgers , sam , a 12 - year - old sixth grader from lake zurich , illinois , beat out 11.5million entries to win the annual espn
but not the actual grand prize of a $ 20,000 best buy gift card and an all - inclusive trip for two to the maui jim maui invitational college basketball tournament in hawaii this november
for that prize , valued at $ 30,000 , sam would have to legally be an adult as contest rules state individuals must be at least 18 - years - old to qualify
' that being said , like any enterprising child , sam does have an idea for the folks at espn as it pertains to compensation for his historic fete
' sam 's plan may not work however , as it would have taken a second amazing feat for him to actually win the prize , with the top 1percent of entries being entered for a random drawing , which in this case would put his odds at roughly 1 in 115,000
" ' sam should now be eligible for the $ 30,000 grand prize of a $ 20,000 best buy gift card and an all - inclusive trip to hawaii this november , but is too young he 's got it : with a few minor exceptions , sam picked a remarkably accurate bracket who was , including 100percent correct from the elite eight onward
he only had two teams wrong in the sweet 16 sam is not the only winner going home empty handed either , as under ncaa guidelines college athletes can not accept any forms of payment or gifts , which means the boys from duke also head home with no prize money or xboxes
