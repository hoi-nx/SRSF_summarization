thousands of bacteria colonies were discovered on banknotes and coins chosen at random from scientists â pockets
the experiment , which involved treating the coins and notes in a substance that allows bacteria to grow quickly , highlights how dirty handling money can be
thousands of bacteria colonies were discovered on notes and coins chosen at random from scientists â pockets
this the bacteria found on one five pound note the money was collected from students at the university of surrey
the students found thousands of bacteria colonies living on their money
while most of the colourful blooms and spots of bacteria was found to be harmless , money has been known to carry dangerous diseases
dr simon park , a senior lecturer in molecular biology at the university , said : â the most common types found are skin bacteria but money has also been shown to harbour mrsa and food poisoning bacteria in other related studies
it 's common in soil , so it 's likely someone was gardening before handling cash currency collected from students were submerged in agar - a substance that allows bacteria to grow quickly - and then monitored for three to four days
this image shows bacteria found on a ten pound note thousands of bacteria colonies were found living on the sample of money
but mrsa and food poisoning bacteria have been found on money in previous studies
dr park added : â we found that money , be it coins or notes , harbours very large numbers of bacteria
â while most of the colourful blooms and spots of bacteria was found to be harmless , money has been known to carry dangerous diseases
