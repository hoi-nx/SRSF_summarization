consultant wilson told a bbc documentary ashya âs chances of long - term survival could have been halved by brett and king âs decision to flee abroad with him before he had the treatment he was being offered here
dr wilson , clinical director for child health at southampton , claimed the chemotherapy was essential to reduce the chances of the five - year - old âs cancer returning
â mr and mrs king had accused the hospital of planning treatment which would have left their son a â vegetable â and took him abroad last year for proton beam therapy , an alternative form of radiotherapy
the family then went to prague for proton beam therapy , and now say there is ' no evidence ' of a tumour â there are experts in the country that have already quoted figures of halving survival â so survival going from 80 per cent to 40 or 50 per cent , which is quite dramatic
â dr wilson said there was an â international consensus â of medical opinion that ashya âs form of brain cancer should be treated by surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy
paediatric intensive care consultant dr wilson said it was ' deeply unfair when the nhs is supposed to be about equal healthcare for all â that he had to say no to parents wanting proton beam therapy for their children
