jeremy hunt said a future conservative government would look into the findings ' in detail ' the mail âs revelations sparked outrage last night with all three major political parties backing calls for an inquiry
there was disgust too among frontline nhs staff and patients
the head of the rcn said nurses who had faced five years of pay freezes would struggle to comprehend the six per cent pay rise for their bosses
professor dacre , president of the royal college of physicians , called for an independent review of top nhs pay while professor sir brian jarman , a senior government health adviser , called for a public inquiry , saying bosses were manipulating the system
the main political parties promised an inquiry
health secretary jeremy hunt said : â a future conservative government would ask the department of health to look at the mail âs investigation in detail
labour âs andy burnham said : â labour will conduct a thorough investigation into this , as part of our plan to ensure pay fairness from bottom to top in the nhs
â for the liberal democrats , norman lamb said : â nhs frontline staff will rightly feel that this situation is unfair
â calling for an independent review , professor dacre said : â transparency in the nhs , including transparency of remuneration , is vital to ensure accountability to the patients we serve
an independent review would help to ensure that nhs ceo salaries are fair
she said nhs bosses were signing off their own pay rises and taking advantage of loopholes in the â exceptionally generous â nhs pension scheme
â dr peter carter , chief executive and general secretary of the rcn , said : â at a time when nhs finances are in crisis , it is shocking that some nhs bosses continue to receive such vastly inflated financial rewards
nursing staff will struggle to comprehend that their bosses have had an average 6 per cent pay rise when they are only getting 1 per cent this year , having seen their pay fall further and further behind the cost of living over the last few years
norman lamb for the liberal democrats said frontline staff would rightly find the revelations ' unfair ' â senior managers such as chief executives do important and highly valued work , but they should not be getting disproportionate pay rises and bonuses while frontline staff continue to struggle
â mark littlewood , director general at the institute of economic affairs , said the revelations of â misallocation of money â in the nhs required â serious attention
â it is impossible to justify these ludicrous pay arrangements when patients who are being told they can not have routine treatments on the nhs and are suffering huge waiting times because of stretched resources
â where else could you fail so badly and yet be rewarded so highly , by yourself ? â dave prentis , general secretary of the unison union , said : â staff working in hospitals and health centres up and down the country are right to feel outraged that their pay has been reined in year after year , while their bosses see such huge increases
â and richard murphy , director of tax research uk , and an adviser to the tuc , added : â this is the private sector âs influence on the nhs gone mad
â sue james retired for a day to claim a Â£ 155,000 payout trick one : retiring for a day one of the most lucrative loopholes nhs bosses exploit is the health service âs â 24 - hour - retirement â rule
in the past , the nhs banned employees from retiring to claim benefits and then returning to the same job
nhs board members are now exploiting this , allowing them to claim hundreds of thousands of pounds in lump sums from their huge pension pots when they turn 60
but because they only really â retire â for 24 hours , they can carry on drawing their huge nhs salary afterwards
under pension rules , most nhs workers can claim the retirement benefits only if they work for 16 hours or less per week for a month after â retiring â for 24 hours
under national rules , there are tax benefits applied to pension pots up to a limit , which was Â£ 1.5million until last year and has since been reduced to Â£ 1.25million
when hospital bosses found themselves in this position , however , some received top - ups to their already huge salaries as compensation
south tyneside nhs foundation trust chief executive lorraine lambert withdrew from the nhs pension scheme in 2012/13 as she approached the tax - free pension pot limit
she was awarded Â£ 20,000 the following year on top of her Â£ 165,000 salary
trick four : leaving after pension boost the generous nhs pension scheme is said massively to favour high earners
as a result , staff promoted to hospital boards see their pension - related benefits for the year rise dramatically
many bosses appear to stay in jobs until they get a promotion and a pay rise which boosts their pension , before quitting the year after they have banked the pay out .
