the rest of usa fell in love because of what happened after the winning putt was holed

â so he went back on to the 18th green and formally acknowledged the patrons crammed into every available space
with this victory , spieth must have killed forever the idea that you have to have a cold heart and a ruthless edge to be a winner
there is nothing fake about spieth
listen to phil mickelson , the phil mickelson specialist who cheerfully admitted he had been outplayed by a man who had competed at augusta only once before

along with mcilroy , spieth is going to carry it for the next decade and what an exciting time it promises to be
â sir nick faldo , on usa television , sums up perfectly the feelings of a sport at the end of truly epochal week
listen to jack nicklaus , who posted this tribute : â congratulations to an exceptionally talented young man
spieth is so beyond his years
hardly a day goes by when spieth does not ellie and every time they talk she asks him if he has won yet
when spieth speaks about ellie there is no pity or anything maudlin in his voice , only joy , laughter and pride
â i know she was watching on television and i think she âs going to be a bit jealous of us all hugging round the 18th green , â he said
â golf should not have been spieth âs game at all
but spieth was given a set of plastic clubs at the age of four and took it from there
spieth ( front ) is presented with his green jacket by last year 's masters champion bubba watson spieth kisses his girlfriend annie after a sensational victory at the masters perhaps the only serious criticism he has attracted came when he dropped out of the university of texas after his first year
but why the hurry ? why not complete his education ? throughout his life spieth has known exactly what he wants â from the fact he is still with the girl he met in college to his caddie michael greller
he is a maths teacher by trade but spieth persuaded him to come out on tour after the pair hit it off straightaway
spieth pictured in his younger days playing basketball left - handed it was with good reason that one of our competitors declared on the eve of the masters that england golf had reached the end of an era , with no players ranked in the world âs top 10 for the first time at a major since 2008
as for joint runner - up justin rose , whose 14 - under - par total would have won 74 out of 79 masters , here âs a prediction : over the next five years he will add at least one more major to his 2013 us open win
