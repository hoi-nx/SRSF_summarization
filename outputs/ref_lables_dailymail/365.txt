the grey â stealth â speed traps could be outlawed regardless of which party wins the general election hidden cameras credited with a 25 per cent spike in speeding fines could be banned from motorways within months
the increase has been put down to the introduction of â smart motorways â which use the cameras , known as hadecs , to police speed limits which are varied according to the driving conditions
the conservatives are already moving to scrap the controversial cameras if an ongoing review criticises their use when it reports back in the summer
and labour has pledged to repaint them yellow so they are easier for drivers to spot
the grey cameras are becoming an increasing threat to drivers as the number of smart motorways is due to increase four fold over the next 10 years to stretch across 800 miles
but labour has said if it wins the election , it will issue new guidelines stipulating all motorway speed cameras are yellow and any existing grey ones will be painted
â as the use of smart motorways is extended from current levels of around 200 miles to 800 miles over the next ten years the number of fines is set to rise even more
