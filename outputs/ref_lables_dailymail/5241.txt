don mclean is responsible american pie , the lyrics of which have been puzzled over for decades there has never been a popular song quite like it
for more than 40 years , its lyrics have been an enigma wrapped in an eight - and - a - half minute long rock ' n ' roll puzzle
argued over by generations of geeky fans , deciphered and re-deciphered by code - breaking rock nerds and considered to be poetic reflections on mid- 20th century u.s. social history by even groovier academics , it 's called american pie
and this week its lyrics , hand - written in 1971 by a young folk singer called don mclean , were sold at auction in new york for more than $ 1 million
because , in this age , when song lyrics have all but become meaningless , american pie illustrates , in a series of images , metaphors and allusions , just what can be done within the frame of a melodically straightforward pop song
that was the easy part , of course , for anyone of my and his generation who learned about the death in a plane crash in 1959 of one of the first great singer - songwriters of rock , buddy holly , when we read about it in the morning newspaper
it was a strange , wistful opening for a pop song , but then , as the beat kicked in , the lyrics began to portray the innocence of god - fearing , teenage high school in america
for years , i thought that was something to do with the raised earthworks â levees â that run along the banks of the mississippi in new orleans , until i discovered that a ' levee ' can also mean a party
on the surface , it might seem that american pie â especially the first half , which was the section mainly played on the radio because the record was far too long to be played in full â was just a misty - eyed lament for an untroubled mom and apple pie american youth
but , suddenly , the mood changed as don mclean â jaundiced almost , and certainly disappointed â looked around late - sixties america and saw how the ' jester in a coat he borrowed from james dean ' ( thought to mean bob dylan in his leather jacket ) stole the martin luther king 's ' thorny crown '
and was ' helter skelter in a summer swelter ' a reference to the murders of actress sharon tate and friends by the ' charles manson ' in los angeles in the summer of 1969 ? it has to be
in an absurd defence , murderer charles manson maintained that he had interpreted the beatles innocuous lyrics in their song helter skelter as instructions to go out and kill
charles manson is still in jail
even after all these years , much of american pie is still opaque
when asked to give a few hints as to the meaning of the lyrics for this week 's auction catalogue , he simply said that ' the song was not a parlour game ' , but ' an indescribable photograph of america that i tried to capture in words and music '
to this day , songwriter don mclean has refused to divulge what the lyrics of american pie refer to ' the half - time air was sweet - perfume ' , which probably means that everybody was smoking pot , and wanting to have a nice , quiet time , when the demo was broken up violently by the ohio national guard , who shot four students dead
' and as i watched him on the stage , my hands were clenched in fists of rage , ' go the lyrics of american pie
although don mclean said before the auction of his song 's lyrics that the pages would ' divulge everything there is to divulge ' about this ' mystical trip into my past ' , they clearly do n't
' a bleak ending , yes , but apart from the reference to the holy trinity , is there also perhaps a nod here to john f. kennedy , robert kennedy and martin luther king , whose assassinations occurred in the sixties ? again , don mclean is n't saying
' were the lyrics ' the father , son and the holy ghost ' a nod to john f. kennedy ( left ) , robert kennedy and martin luther king ( right ) , whose assassinations occurred in the sixties ? it seems so obvious , does n't it ? but then you turn on the radio and realise that , with just a few exceptions , an appreciation of good music and lyrics has played little part in the education of so many of today 's songwriters
and he certainly was n't able to ever better american pie
this week 's buyer of the lyrics of american pie unfortunately prefers to remain anonymous , and that suggests to me that 's he 's a billionaire who wants to frame them and stick them on his study wall
i 'd far rather they had been bought by an university so students of u.s. literature and social history could spend another 40 - odd years poring over them , and discussing what can be done with a popular song , and how america was , as it says in the lyrics , a ' long , long time ago ' .
