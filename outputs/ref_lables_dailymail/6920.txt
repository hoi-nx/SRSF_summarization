judges have caused controversy by ordering that the parents of nine children involved in plots to travel to syria should have their identities hidden
they include three terror suspects who have all previously been named but now can not be identified to protect their youngsters from the glare of publicity
also among the parents are a couple who lied to the authorities about losing their daughter âs passport
one case involves a family of nine britons â three men , two women and four children aged between one and 11 â who were caught trying to get into lawless syria from turkey last week
but the draconian orders mean three of the adults must also have their identities hidden even though they are terror suspects
counter-terrorism police have taken over the probe into the shooting of a syria imam in london amid fears he was murdered by a professional hit squad
abdul hadi arwani , a fierce critic of syria leader bashar al-assad , was gunned down in wembley as he sat in his car
they are understood to be examining his links to groups which oppose the syria regime
hannah stuart , a research fellow for security think - tank the henry jackson society , said granting anonymity to the three rochdale terror suspects was â like trying to put a cat back in a bag â as they had previously been named
she also suggested the parents of one girl lied because of the malign influence of radical extremists and their apologists such as muslim human rights group cage , which supported islamic state killer jihadi john
