two maryland parents whose hands - off ' free - range ' parenting got their children picked up by police yet again on sunday are now vowing to file a lawsuit
danielle and alexander meitiv have been cited multiple times for allowing their son rafi , 10 , and daughter dvora , 6 , roam free in their suburban neighborhood
but the meitivs , both of them scientists , say authorities crossed a line over the weekend when they picked up rafi and dvora and held them nearly six hours without food before allowing them to reunite with their parents

the parents danielle and alexander meitiv ( right ) have vowed to sue authorities responsible for keeping them in custody for six hours attorney matthew dowd , of the firm wiley rein , is representing the meitivs and on tuesday sent a ointed letter regarding sunday 's events
rein wrote : ' the actions of cps and montgomery county police violate the fundamental rights parents have in raising their children
the meitivs made headlines just before christmas when police found rafi and dvora walking the sidewalk on their own
picked up again : the meitivs say they were left to panic for hours by cps workers after their children -- who they raise with a so - called ' free - range ' approach -- were picked up by police for the second time in two months while walking down the street alone ' besides the policeman pulling up ... no ' : asked if he was scared during the hours - long ordeal sunday , 10 - year - old rafi admitted he was , but not because he 'd been left alone with his sister free - range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so - called ' helicopter parenting '
free - range parents advocate a more hands - off approach , where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own
the children were picked up by police , who say they followed protocol by turning them over to cps
what 's more , the elder child , rafi , insists the scariest part of the hours - long ordeal was being picked up by police
even then , they say they were n't reunited with their children or even told where they were for hours
parenting style : the meitivs believe in giving children an unusual amount of independence from a young age guarantees : as part of their free - range parenting philosophy , the meitivs make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street â they made us sign a safety plan that says we will not leave them attended at all until they follow up , ' and i âm not gon na risk my kids being snatched again like this by cps
' when questioned , the meitivs say they believe in a so - called ' free - range ' approach to parenting , which encourages independence from infancy
in march , the cps found the couple guilty of neglect for letting the children walk home from school alone
