breakthrough breakthrough by jack with matthew lysiak by jack with matthew lysiak jack is just 18 , yet his newly - published memoir carries a blurb from barack obama
the andrakas encouraged their boys to think about how the world worked : school runs were fiercely competitive as jack and luke tried to solve science questions fired at them by their mother
at school , jack won prizes for science projects , but was ostracised as a geek and viciously bullied when he came out as gay , aged 13
then a close family friend , uncle ted , died of pancreatic cancer
deeply depressed , jack made an unsuccessful suicide attempt
at summer camp , jack met a sympathetic counsellor , and began to channel his grief into the science that would make him a star
initially , he thought of trying to find a cure for pancreatic cancer - an ambitious task , given that he did n't know what a pancreas was
he wrote 200 emails to university science departments - and 199 rejections later dr anirban maitra , an expert in pancreatic cancer at johns hopkins university in baltimore , offered jack a corner of his lab to work in , under supervision
when his test for detecting pancreatic cancer won the top award at a prestigious international science competition in 2012 , his wild celebrations at the awards ceremony went viral
funny , brave and super-enthusiastic , with a healthy dose of adolescent egotism and some comic glimpses of the trials of being jack 's parent , breakthrough is an inspiring story for would - be scientists - just do n't complain when they turn your microwave into a ray gun
