when zayn malik announced he was leaving one direction last week it was amid rumours that he was set to launch a solo career
and the speculation has not abated since a producer known as naughty boy - real name naughty boy - posted a clip ( which has now been removed ) , of what was thought to have been the 22 - year - old 's first single
indeed , the track , entitled i wo n't mind , sent both one direction fans and one of zayn malik 's former band mates into turmoil
while it sounds cryptic , the video is thought to reference the collaboration between the two and angered one direction who are still disappointed at zayn malik 's departure from the group
it also enraged zayn malik 's former bandmate louis
â naughty boy was pictured with simon cowell , the boss of zayn malik 's record label syco , earlier this year at the british asian trust dinner he then wrote : â when ur gettin hate for some thing u did n't do , a bit of love can go a long way , that 's why i retweeted , time will tell the real story guys
' onlookers can only speculate that naughty boy 's reference to something he ' did n't do ' is linked to the fact that he is being blamed for zayn malik leaving the band
when he teased the single off what is thought to be zayn malik 's forthcoming solo album due out in 2016 on syco , he said : ' let the music do the talking guys
naughty boy is well connected in the music industry , pictured here at an event in 2014 with jools holland ( left ) and elton john ( center ) naughty boy attends the ivor novello awards in 2014 with emeli sande who he has previously worked with ' there is nothing but love for what was left behind
' whether zayn malik will be naughty boy 's newest collaborator remains to be seen , but he certainly wo n't be the biggest name he 's worked with
so far he 's worked with cheryl cole , rihanna , tinie tempah , emeli sande and leona lewis and he even helped to produce labrinth 's hit song beneath your beautiful
naughty boy chats to prince charles , his career was started thanks to a grant from the prince 's trust he also wrote a song for one direction in 2014 with the help of emeli and zayn malik himself
naughty boy was able to buy his recording equipment after going on deal or no deal and winning Â£ 44,000 it was ten years ago in 2005 when naughty boy was 20 that he took part on the reality gameshow indeed , it was n't until 2005 when he began to be able to build the business , thanks to a Â£ 5,000 grant from the the prince 's trust
and naughty boy proved to be a lucky boy when , in the same year , he took part on the hit channel 4 show deal or no deal and won Â£ 44,000 which allowed him to buy all of his studio equipment
especially given the circumstances in which the 22 - year - old left one direction
but it does n't look as if zayn malik 's boss syco head honcho simon cowell , is too unhappy about the situation
