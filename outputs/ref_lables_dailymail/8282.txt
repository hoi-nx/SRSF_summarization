exposure to a wide range of bacteria is necessary to prime the immune system early in life , according to the hygiene hypothesis western diets and an emphasis on sterile , germ - free food has made us more likely to allergies , new research suggests
a lack of bacteria in the gut means we are less equipped to deal with germs - meaning that our bodies often overreact when we come into contact with bugs , dust or pollen
according to the â hygiene hypothesis â , exposure to a wide range of bacteria is necessary to prime the immune system early in life
the latest work , published today in the journal cell reports , compared the bacteria in the guts of people from the us and papua new guinea - one of the least industrialised nations on earth
the research , by canada and australian scientists , found that people in the us had far smaller collection of bacteria - called the â microbiome â - than people from papua new guinea
study author walter , of the university of alberta in canada , said : â there are several aspects of western lifestyle that have been hypothesized to alter the gut microbiome and decrease diversity
â the research team found that papua new guinea have vastly different compositional profiles compared with us residents
us lacked 50 different bacterial types present in most papua new guinea
professor walter said : â these findings suggest that lifestyle practices that reduce bacterial dispersal - specifically sanitation and drinking water treatment - might be an important cause of microbiome alterations
a lack of bacteria in the gut means we are less equipped to deal with germs - meaning that our bodies often overreact when we come into contact with bugs , dust or pollen ( file photo ) but they said that western diets may have contributed to increases in some chronic diseases
asthma , peanut allergies and hayfever are examples of allergic conditions that have been linked by previous research to the problems caused by insufficient bacteria in the gut
co-author andrew greenhill , a senior lecturer in microbiology at federation university australia , said : â we can think about how we can reduce the collateral damage of modern lifestyle practices on the gut microbiome without jeopardizing the benefits
