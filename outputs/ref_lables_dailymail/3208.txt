the belief that the most popular antidepressant drugs raise serotonin levels in the brain is nothing more than a myth , a leading professor of psychiatry has claimed
david healy , head of psychiatry at the hergest psychiatric unit in bangor , north wales , said the misconception that low levels of serotonin were responsible for depression had become established fact
he suggested that the success of so - called ssri drugs â which include prozac and seroxat â was based on the â marketing of a myth â
pictured is prozac , one commonly prescribed ssri the emergence of these serotonin reuptake inhibiting ( ssri ) drugs in the late 1980s came after concerns about tranquilliser use to treat depression
even though they were weaker than old - style tricyclic antidepressants , they took off because of the idea that ssri restored serotonin levels to normal , â a notion that later transmuted into the idea that they remedied a chemical imbalance â
in an editorial in the bmj , professor david healy said that in the 1990s , no one knew if ssri raised or lowered serotonin levels but there was no evidence that treatment corrected anything
they warned the controversy might harm depressed patients if they were deterred from taking the drugs , which had been proved to work in trials and the â real world â
â nhs choices , the website which advises patients , says : â it would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels , but a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms
â professor david healy âs editorial says it is important to raise questions about the drugs
professor david taylor , director of pharmacy and pathology and head of pharmaceutical sciences clinical academic group , king âs health partners , south london and maudsley nhs foundation trust , said : â professor david healy makes a forceful but poorly supported argument against something which does nât and has never really existed : the idea that ssri â correct â an â imbalance â of serotonin in the brain
â researchers and psychiatrists alike know that ssri are effective in a number of disorders but no one is sure exactly how they work
other psychiatrists warned the controversy might harm depressed patients if they were deterred from taking the drugs , which had been proved to work in trials and the â real world â â prof david healy fails to mention that ssri supplanted earlier tricyclics largely because of their relative safety in overdose , not because of any conspiracy concerning a theory of serotonin âs involvement in depression
â dr paul keedwell , consultant psychiatrist and specialist in mood disorders , said : â in the real world of the clinic , ssris are undeniably effective in treating individuals with major depression
â david healy has previously claimed that ssri cause dependence or provoke suicide
