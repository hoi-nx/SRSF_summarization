jameela spent Â£ 3,000 on having all her amalgam fillings removed and replaced with white fillings jameela jamil has the dazzling smile that you 'd expect of a television presenter and former model
yet the 29 - year - old broadcaster is convinced her teeth - or rather , the dental work done on them - triggered a host of health problems that plagued her for nearly seven years
' after several months of this , she went to a private doctor who referred her for tests
jameela thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus , an auto - immune condition which can cause inflammation and swelling in the joints and other parts of the body
in fact , the tests suggested she had high levels of mercury
after other potential causes such as diet were ruled out , it was suggested the problem was down to the ten amalgam fillings she 'd had as a child
dental amalgam has been used for more than 150 years , and every year 12 million fillings made from it are given to patients in britain
breathing in extremely high concentrations of mercury can trigger bronchitis and pneumonia and affect the central nervous system , causing muscle tremors
long - term exposure to high levels can affect kidneys
dentists agree that when fillings are being put in or removed , the mercury can release vapour
blood tests showed she had high mercury levels
with nothing else to account for these raised levels , her fillings were pinpointed as the cause but the amounts taken in from fillings is ' minuscule ' , says salford dentist dr atkins
amalgam is ' strong , durable and adaptable ' and there is ' no evidence to suggest these fillings are anything other than safe to use ' , adds stjohn crean , professor of medicine in dentistry and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the university of central lancashire
it is true that mercury can sometimes cause sensitivity and soreness in teeth - 5 per cent of the population react to contact with amalgams in this way - but this poses no risk to health , adds professor walmsley
and yet dental amalgam is banned in countries such as sweden and norway , because of patient concern about the risk
a 2012 review of 106 studies published in the journal of alzheimer 's disease suggested mercury from amalgams could be a contributing factor to the condition
but fillings are n't the only source of mercury
however , some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that could harm an unborn baby or young child 's developing nervous system
that 's why young children and women planning to have a baby or who are already pregnant or breastfeeding are advised to avoid fish that can have higher levels of mercury , such as shark , swordfish and marlin
and yet dental amalgam ( pictured , posed by model ) is banned in countries such as sweden and norway , because of patient concern about the risk but jameela does n't eat fish , so knew the mercury levels could n't be due to her diet
following blood tests , it was discovered that she had high mercury levels
' i read up on this and discovered that not only does it take time for mercury levels to drop , but vapour can be released from the mercury when the fillings are removed and leak into the system
' in fact , i see patients whose gut symptoms , ironically , seem to be caused by the stress and anxiety of thinking that it is their mercury fillings which are causing stomach problems , when there is no physical sign of any gut disorders
' but jameela remains convinced that the mercury was the cause of her problems
' there is so much we do n't know about amalgam fillings
