a device has been created that can scan entire planes for contraband , bombs and weapons
while the radiation emitted by the scanner is not safe yet for humans to be in the plane when it is operated , the company behind it thinks it could become a vital tool in aircraft safety
it uses a cone of radiation to sweep across planes ( shown ) and look inside
the device is accurate enough to find a filament in a light bulb
but the radiation it emits is not safe for passengers yet the roboscan 2m aeria is being developed by romanian company mb telecom ( mb telecom )
on its website , mb telecom says the roboscan 2m aeria is â the very first solution for aircraft security inspection
the company notes that , while passengers and their luggage are thoroughly inspected at airports , there is no such inspection process for jets arriving at small private airports with low security
but with their device , the company says this â gap â in aviation security can be plugged , and it can scan an entire plane in about 20 minutes
the device can be used to detect weapons ( shown ) and other contraband in small or medium - sized jets that land at low - security airports an operator working inside the truck can look inside the entirety of a plane , although currently under regulations some areas of the plane - such as the fuselage and wings - are restricted there are four main components that allow an aircraft to be scanned
it is apparently so accurate that it could pick out keys on a seat or even a filament in a light bulb
