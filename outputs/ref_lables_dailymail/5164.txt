dawn was breaking as we pulled out of calvi station , and the town 's medieval citadel , perched on a headland , was bathed in the rosy glow of the first rays of sunlight
trundling along the coast on the narrow - gauge railway , i was heading deep into the mountains of central corsica for a self - guided walking trip
' are you doing the gr20 ? ' was the question on everyone 's lips as soon as they spotted my hiking boots
the corsican mouflon , or mountain sheep , make easy work of the tough gr20 hiking trail the gr20 trail runs down the mountainous spine of corsica and happens to be the toughest trek in europe i had chosen a much gentler route , or so i thought
i was following the ancient sentiers de transhumance , footpaths used for more than 1,000 years by shepherds leading their animals to summer pastures
the golo valley , where the ancient sentiers de transhumance used for more than 1,000 years begins most of the trails were clearly marked with orange daubs of paint and i was equipped with maps and detailed instructions
accommodation ranged from small auberges to family - run hotels
the water below one of the hiking track 's footbridges proves too enticing to not jump in for a swim sometimes i 'd pause beside little packhorse bridges to dangle my feet in water that was as clear as gin
after trekking through the beautiful spelunca gorge , i caught a cab to the seaside resort of porto where a 16th century genoese tower stands guard over the harbour
