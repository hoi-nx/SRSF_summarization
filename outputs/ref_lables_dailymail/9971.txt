in the aftermath of sunday 's derby disaster the talk among fans was of summer incomings to reboot a blue machine that , all - of - a - sudden , looks as outdated as a commodore 64
then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under - fire manager manuel pellegrini
but the biggest challenge for city this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have
city striker sergio aguero looks on dejected during the defeat by united at old trafford the afternoon started so well for sergio aguero and city when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes sergio aguero celebrates his 99th goal for city with david silva as de gea looks dejected it may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at old trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant sergio aguero that deserves to be recognised
the aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice - cream but the argentine 's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration
sergio aguero netted his 100th goal for city in the 89th minute but there was no cause for celebration the argentine strikes in injury time against qpr to win city the title in 2012 sergio aguero celebrates with edin dzeko after that goal when city scored twice in injury time to win title sergio aguero is settled in manchester and signed a new five - year deal only last august
wilfried bony has only scored once in five appearances since joining city from swansea city in january city 's ageing squad is in need of a major overhaul in the summer juventus midfielder paul pogba is a potential target as the city owner prepares to open the cheque book the former swansea city man , who cost just Â£ 10m less than sergio aguero , has failed to hit the ground running since his january move and has scored only once in five appearances
liverpool contract rebel raheem sterling could also be on any list of summer targets manuel pellegrini is facing the sack even if city qualify for the champions league there are others to ponder
does manuel pellegrini stay ? and what share of the blame do executives ferran soriano and txiki begiristain take ? are they at fault for spending the best part of Â£ 200m since 2012 without really strengthening the team or does manuel pellegrini carry the can ? with financial fair play sanctions hurting , it was essential that city got bang for the buck
it is essential that keeping sergio aguero is top of that ever - growing list or else that ageing blue machine risks heading for an even bigger crash .
