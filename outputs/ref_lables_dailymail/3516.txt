there was a time when the name of juventus would be one to avoid in the semi-final of european competition
when the old lady of turin takes her place alongside bayern munich , barcelona and real madrid on friday , it will appear that massimiliano allegri has returned this great club to the elite level
in reality it will be a clash of cultures as juventus , who have kept nine clean sheets in their last ten fixtures , plot their path to the uefa champions league final in berlin
it will be painful and far from pretty if juventus , who held on to the lead arturo vidal gave them from the penalty spot in the first leg against monaco , progress to the final on june 6
there were scenes of elation as a scoreless draw saw juventus through to their first uefa champions league semi-final since 2003 juventus 's pirlo and tevez react at the full - time whistle as their 0 - 0 result against monaco proved a victory for the italians juventus players celebrate after their 1 - 0 win in turin , courtesy of a penalty from arturo vital , was preserved in monaco the juventus players ran to their supporters with tevez ( third left ) ditching his jersey for the celebrations chiellini ( left ) and leonardo bonucci race towards their fans , before chiellini throws his number three shirt into the crowd veteran juventus keeper buffon punches clear as his defense live dangerously in their second leg against monaco juventus 's midfield maestro pirlo shows his strength as he holds off monaco 's toulalan in their 0 - 0 draw in monte carlo monaco : croatian subasic 6 ; fabinho 7 , raggi 6 , abdennour 6.5 , kurzawa 6 ; joao moutinho 6.5 , toulalan 6 ( dimitar berbatov 46mins , 7 ) , kondogbia 7.5 ; bernardo silva 6.5 , martial 6 ( germain 76 ' , ferreira-carrasco 6.5 ( carvalho 87 ' )

at the final whistle chiellini raced across the athletics track at louis ii stadium to throw his number three shirt into the hordes of juventus supporters celebrating their first appearance in a semi-final since 2003
the reality is that this team is relying on some classic italians traits , with some stubborn defending and the dogged work of tevez , juventus âs only out ball , for some hustling up front
it works , painfully so at times , and they are certainly a long way short of the last juventus team to reach the uefa champions league final at old trafford in 12 year ago
