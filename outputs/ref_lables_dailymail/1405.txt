research revealed that as many as three - quarters of parents whose children are over 18 still have at least one child living with them
but only 42 per cent charge their children rent â with many admitting they feel too guilty and uncomfortable to ask
and even if they manage to ask their offspring to contribute , most charge them just Â£ 150 a month , compared with a typical uk rent of Â£ 750
on top of this , 80 per cent still buy their adult child âs groceries , and 60 per cent cook dinner for them each night , according to the study by website topcashback
half of parents who did charge rent admitted they relied on that money to cover living expenses such as groceries and utility bills
food for thought : eight out of ten parents survey said they still bought their children 's groceries for them in fact , a second study released today revealed that many debt - ridden parents are falling into deeper financial trouble because of their stay - at - home children
