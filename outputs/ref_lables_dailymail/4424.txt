ed miliband has been accused of stooping to a ' shameful ' new low by blaming cameron for the mediterranean refugee crisis
the labour leader used a keynote campaign speech today to suggest the deaths of hundreds of refugees fleeing north africa could have been avoided if the prime minister had done more following his intervention in libya to remove the former dictator colonel gaddafi
in a briefing note sent out before the speech , labour went further - claiming the crisis was ' in part a direct result ' of mr cameron 's foreign policy
the allegation provoked a furious response from the tories who this morning demanded that mr ed miliband apologise for the ' outrageous and disgraceful ' remarks
the prime minister announced the deployment of one of britain 's biggest warships - hms bulwark - as part of beefed - up efforts to prevent more refugees packing onto tiny boats
the vast majority of the migrant boats set off from the libya , which has descended into chaos in the aftermath of the 2011 revolution which saw colonel gaddafi swept from power with the support of france and britain
over 200 illegal migrants were rescued by italian guardia di finanza boat ' denaro ' in the mediterranean this week the refugees will be shipped to the italian mainland after being rescued by italian coast guards mr ed miliband today accused the prime minister of taking his eye off the ball by failing to secure a stable transfer of power in the wake of the uprising
but the suggestion sparked a furious response from the prime minister today
mr cameron said : ' let me be clear about what ed miliband has said
i have learned as prime minister that it is so important in a dangerous and uncertain world that you show clarity , consistency and strength on these foreign policy issues
' accusing the prime minister of causing these deaths - whether directly or indirectly - i think is wrong , ' she told bbc radio 4 's today
' seek and destroy : britain will send one of its biggest warships , hms bulwark ( above ) , to the mediterranean within days as part of plans to targets boats used by human traffickers cameron held high - level talks with italian prime minister matteo renzi ( left ) , german chancellor angela merkel ( top left ) and france president francois hollande ( top right ) at a eu summit yesterday a senior tory source added : ' this takes labour 's relentless negative campaigning to a new low
' the source pointed out that mr ed miliband had supported the intervention in libya which he now blamed for causing the crisis
mr cameron was given a rapturous reception in tripoli in september 2011 after flying into the capital following the nato bombing campaign which allowed rebels to overthrow colonel gaddafi libya rebels overthrew the country 's dictator colonel gaddafi ( right ) with the support of britain , france and us airstrikes but the shadow foreign secretary douglas alexander defended mr ed miliband 's attack â and insisted the prime minister had failed to plan for the aftermath of colonel gaddafi 's downfall
cameron was wrong to assume that libya 's political culture and institutions could be left to evolve and transform on their own
labour leader ed miliband said he supported the action , arguing it was " a just cause , with a feasible mission , and it has international support "
less than six months later , in november 2011 , after western bombing raids allowed libya âs rebel forces to sweep the colonel gaddafi regime from power , mr cameron and nicolas sarkozy flew into tripoli
mr cameron praised the libya fighters as â lions â and described their revolt as the moment â when the arab spring could become an arab summer â in which â we see democracy advance in other countries too â
