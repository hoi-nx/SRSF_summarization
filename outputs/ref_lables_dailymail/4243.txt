president obama and cuba president raul shook hands last night ahead of a historic meeting which may see cuba declassified as a state sponsor of terrorism
the two leaders , who clasped hands yesterday at a brief meeting , are both attending the summit of the americas in panama
the gesture of friendships is an outward symbol of obama 's project to thaw diplomatic relations with cuba , which have been frozen since the 1960s
the white house has set expectations for a ' substantive ' exchange between raul , brother of revolutionary leader fidel , and obama today
that removal would also lift some economic sanctions on cuba
' but the 53 - year - old obama , who was not even born when fidel and raul swept to power in cuba 's 1959 revolution , also said the u.s. is no longer interested in trying to impose its will on latin america
apart from a couple of brief , informal encounters , the leaders of the u.s. and cuba have not had any significant meetings since the raul brothers toppled u.s. - backed dictator fulgencio batista and then steered their caribbean country into a close alliance with the soviet union
last time : obama and raul are pictured above shaking hands at the funeral of nelson mandela , held in johannesburg , south africa , in december 2013 out of the deep freeze : obama and raul are expected to meet again on saturday and talk about their efforts to restore full diplomatic relations and boost trade and travel between the two countries gang 's all here : president obama ( far right middle row ) and cuba 's president raul ( far left middle row ) attend the summit of the americas opening ceremony colombian president juan manuel santos hailed obama 's push to improve relations with cuba , saying it was helping to heal a ' blister ' that was hurting the region
obama , who met with activists from across latin america , including two cuba dissidents , appears to be close to removing communist - run cuba from a u.s. list of countries that it says sponsor terrorism
washington imposed trade sanctions on cuba from 1960 and broke off diplomatic relations in 1961 , but the ensuing freeze did it no favors , said ben rhodes , obama 's deputy national security adviser

while obama 's policy has been widely praised around latin america , this was tempered last month when his administration imposed sanctions on venezuelan , cuba 's closest ally and main benefactor
