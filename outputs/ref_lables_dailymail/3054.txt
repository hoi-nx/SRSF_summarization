a fixed - term starter marriage , in which couples sign a renewable contract - known as a ' wedlease ' - would work better for many couples , argues pease gadoua
a relationship expert has suggested that a renewable marriage contract known as a ' wedlease ' would work better for many modern day couples and avoid increasing divorces in her new book , the new i do , which was co-written with vicki larson , she claims that the traditional marriage model in our modern - day culture ' sets up too many people for failure '
at the end of the stated contract period , the couple decide whether they want to go their separate ways , or continue with the marriage , at which point they should draw up a revised contract
' a starter marriage is a short - term contract for couples to ' try on ' the institution to see if it fits â without bringing children into the mix â before jumping into a life - long contract , ' mrs pease gadoua said
' we have learner 's permits for driving , we have internships before starting careers and we have probationary or modifiable contracts in many other business negotiations , yet the greatest and most in - depth legal contract that most of us will ever enter requires that you commit to one person forever with precious little information about what it will entail
' relationship counsellor susan pease gadoua says that traditional weddings set people up for failure the starter marriage can be an improvement on the traditional marital model because ' each spouse will need to be paying closer attention to his or her actions and stick to what was agreed to , lest his or her partner decides not to renew a few years down the road ' , the 53 year old claims
and if the couple do decide to part , the separation should be more amicable than other divorces might be and reduce the odds of individuals feeling like they have ' failed ' , she adds
' because a starter marriage by its nature avoids the drama that typically goes along with a marital dissolution , you and your former spouse will more likely be able to sit down and compare notes about what worked and what did n't
' if the couple stay together , the new contract could be amended to fit another of the specific marital models that mrs pease gadoua advocates
for example , if they want children , they could sign a ' parenting marriage ' contract ( couples should remain childless while in a starter marriage ' because it 's a bad idea to ' try on ' marriage with young lives in the balance ' ) , with new rules and goals
or if monogamy proved a challenge during the starter marriage , an open marriage contract ' might be an attractive option ' , she said
pease gadoua 's book the new ' i do ' explores alternatives to the traditional nuptials and , the american claims , despite its temporary nature , a starter marriage is not the same as cohabiting
not only does marriage give you more legal and financial protection , couples often have different expectations while living together , and roles can be confused
a starter marriage can ' help couples align expectations , create a plan of what each partner will contribute to the marriage , clarify goals and strategize what will happen if one or both do n't want to renew the contract , ' she said
a typical contract would cover areas such as finances , sex ( amount , and views on monogamy ) , career priorities , and even how free time should be spent ( with specific rules about visiting in - laws )
' having a starter marriage with a contract , however , will
' and it will make you smarter and more prepared for either the renewal of your marital contract or a new marriage with a new partner
' she does admit however , that limited term marriages will be unthinkable for many
' if people are going to continue to see marriage that way , then , yes â a renewable contract is going to create quite a bit of angst for many of them
' but harry benson , research director at marriage foundation , the think - tank which champions marriage , said the idea of a starter marriage ' undermines commitment ' and reduces it to a ' business contract '
' even if a little over a third of marriages fail , most last for life
' the idea of a starter marriage might hold superficial appeal
