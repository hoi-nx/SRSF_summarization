lord fellowes , 65 , has revealed he is to turn trollope 's 1858 novel doctor thorne into a new three - part historical drama for itv
and the situation is made all the more fraught because doctor thorne is harbouring a secret about mary 's parentage which threatens to bring everyone 's world crashing down

tv insiders say hugh bonneville , who plays lord grantham in downton , and lily james , who plays lady rose in the show and who stars in the new disney cinema hit cinderella , would be ideal as thomas thorne and mary
but one source last night said that itv would be keen to ensure that the cast of the new drama was not filled with faces from downton
tv critics want hugh bonneville , who plays lord grantham in downton , to appear in the new television show the tale is considered one of trollope 's best works several actresses , including anna chancellor , who made a guest appearance in the last series of downton , juliet stevenson and janet mcteer could all be likely contenders for the role of the snobbish lady arabella
the project is the realisation of a life - long ambition for lord fellowes , a huge admirer of trollope 's work
he revealed plans for the new drama at a dinner held at athenaeum club in london on friday night to celebrate the bicentenary of trollope 's birth
' lord fellowes revealed that many of the characters in downton and his oscar - winning 2001 film gosford park had been inspired by trollope
he said gosford park 's lady trentham and downton 's dowager countess of lord grantham â both played by maggie smith â were very similar to doctor thorne 's lady arabella , and that gosford 's imperious lady sylvia , played by kristin scott thomas , was a ' classic ' from a trollope novel
