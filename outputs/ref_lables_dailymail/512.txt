europe 's controversial new laws banning ultra-thin models from strutting down the catwalk may be doing more harm than good as models are reportedly going to extreme measures to ensure they clock in at a ' healthy ' weight when they hop on the scale - including stuffing their underwear with sandbags
earlier this month france passed a new law that bars models from walking the runway if their body mass index is deemed too low , in an attempt to combat anorexia
but former model jennifer sky , 38 , from brooklyn , new york , has revealed in an op - ed for the new york observer that the fashion industry has already found a way around the regulations , explaining that thin models are now resorting to wearing weighted spanx in order to cheat the new bmi standards
new kind of pressure : former model jennifer sky , pictured in 2013 ( r ) and 2003 ( l ) , has reported that models are being asked to wear spanx underwear stuffed with sandbags , so they can clock in at a ' healthy ' weight different rules : models can be seen walking down the runway at the masha ma show in march at paris fashion week
france recently passed a law banning models from the catwalk if their body mass index is too low an anonymous model , referred to in the piece as ' lauren ' , told jennifer sky that she participated in spanish fashion week , sometime after the country passed its new weight law in 2006 and recalled being asked to hide weights in her undergarments
' they gave us spanx underwear to stuff with weighted sandbags so the thinnest of girls had a " healthy " weight on the scales , ' lauren said
agencies who employ ' too - thin ' models face large fines and even jail time under the new france law she continued : ' i was not anorexic or starving - i was definitely over-worked
' jennifer sky noted that as a teen with a bmi of 18.0 , she would most certainly have been considered ' underweight ' ; while the exact bmi requirements for models working in france have not been released , the world health organization considers people with a bmi below 18.5 to be underweight and at risk of being malnourished
' model rights activist : jennifer sky spoke with megan alexander ( r ) about trafficking , abuse , and child labor problems within the fashion industry on inside edition in february strict rules : the 38 - year - old , who snapped this ' post fashion week ' selfie in february , noted her bmi would have been considered too low when she was a healthy 16 - year - old model because she had a fast metabolism jennifer sky added that instead of putting restrictions on the size of young models , the france government should ' look to the modeling agencies who freely act as employment agencies without the responsibilities of treating their client - models as working professionals '
sara ziff , who is a model and founder of the model alliance organization , told think progress in march that she is also against the new france law because legislating body mass standards is not the same thing as the fashion industry promoting a ' healthy ideal '
