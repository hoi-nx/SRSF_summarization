human embryos have been genetically modified so that any changes made will be carried on into future generations for the first time , according to scientists
researchers around the world are bracing themselves for the results of a study by scientists in china that has introduced dna changes to reproductive cells
many scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea , for fear it could be misused to allow parents to ' select ' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren
human embryos , like the one above , may have been genetically modified with new gene editing techniques they say that even embryos created in this way for research purposes only could have serious ethical and safety implications
they have described it as ' dangerous and ethically unacceptable '
researchers at the moment say this should only be used for scientific research but it opens up the possibility of using edited eggs to create human embryos that have had heritable diseases removed
' his comments match those made by several leading scientists working with non-reproductive stem cells who have raised concerns over the new technology
modifying the dna of human embryos so that dna changes are preserved in the germline - the sperm and eggs - means such alterations can be passed on to future generations
a number of groups around the world are thought to be working on techniques to genetically modify human embryos
germ line genetic editing alters the dna in sperm and egg cells - meaning the changes can be passed on xingxu huang , from shanghai tech university in china has been seeking permission to perform the technique on discarded human embryos after having successfully using it to modify monkey embryos that developed into live animals
the crispr technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code and could be used to create designer babies
professor church 's own group is also said to be developing techniques that could be used to modify human embryos
last month a leading group of biologists called for a worldwide moratorium on germ line research amid rumours that it had already been used to alter human embryos in china
they wrote : ' it is thought that studies involving the use of genome - editing tools to modify the dna of human embryos will be published shortly ' in our view , genome editing in human embryos using current technologies could have unpredictable effects on future generations
many scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea , for fear it could be misused to allow parents to ' select ' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren ' this makes it dangerous and ethically unacceptable
' at this early stage , scientists should agree not to modify the dna of human reproductive cells
' their fears tap into concerns that such technology could be used to create ' designer families ' where certain traits are selected for
