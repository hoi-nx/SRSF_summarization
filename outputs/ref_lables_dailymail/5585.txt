a taxi driver channelled his inner pavarotti and produced an emotionally charged opera performance to the surprise of his customers
at first the driver lets the radio take command and pavarotti âs distinctive voice can be heard from within side the cab
at first the driver lets the radio play before he begins singing along to the pavarotti song in perfect tune he then begins singing along himself â loudly so that he is audible above the radio and the sounds of the road
while looking around as he drives , the uber worker continues to sing along to the song both in tune and word perfectly
the passengers are amazed as they film the driver who sings along to the opera song word perfectly later , the film maker wrote : â we were heading out to meet some friends at a party in south boston and had a wonderful journey with the uber opera man
