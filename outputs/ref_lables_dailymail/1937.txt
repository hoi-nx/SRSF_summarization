carver has insisted he is enjoying the task of trying to turn newcastle united 's season around despite all appearances
the 50 - year - old has suffered a torrid time since replacing pardew as head coach at st james ' park until at least the end of the season
pardew 's former assistant has managed just two wins in 14 games in all competitions to date and has seen his side lose their last five premier league fixtures , a run which has allowed the chasing pack to close and threaten to drag the club into a shock relegation fight
carver says that he 's enjoying his role at newcastle united and believes he 's getting the best out of the players that , coupled with fury over owner mike ashley 's recruitment policy , has sparked calls for a mass boycott of sunday 's home clash with tottenham , but carver remains upbeat
he said with a smile : ' i 'm enjoying it - you might think it 's strange to say that
newcastle united have won just two games under carver and fans are desperate for him not to be named manager ' but i 'm not a moaner and not making excuses
' carver 's final comment may cause more than a few raised eyebrows with manchester united , everton , arsenal , sunderland and liverpool each having emerged from their recent meetings with newcastle united having banked three points
carver said : ' you ca n't afford to ease off in the premier league
