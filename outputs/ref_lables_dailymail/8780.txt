brain scans on a group of professional comedians has revealed differences in the way the brains of these ' super speakers ' work while talking
the ultimate wheeler dealer , del boy 's gift of the gab came from a difference in the way his brain worked compared to the less silver tongued among us , the super speakers â which also included a barrister and a radio presenter â showed less activity in a key area of the brain involved articulating and comprehending speech
this suggests that this group were putting less effort into the basic mechanics of speech , allowing them to devote more resources to what they were going to say next
dr devlin , a neuroscientist at university college london , told the guardian : ' the fact that they show less activity there reflects the fact that they simply find speech less effortful and i suspect part of that has to do with practice
dr devlin and his colleagues used magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brains of 17 professional comedians , a radio presenter and barrister
they were asked to lie in the scanner while talking for 30 seconds on random topics without hesitation , deviation or repetition â a task based on the bbc 4 panel show just a minute
super speakers were found to have less activity in broca 's region of the brain , shown in the image above dr devlin said : ' one of the participants was given " scotland " and just said " i 've never been there " , and that was basically it
' the study revealed that the same areas of the brain were activated when both the comedians and the students were speaking
market traders are known for their ability to sell almost anything to anyone due to their talent for speaking however , the comedians and other super speakers showed lower levels of activity in an area of the brain known as broca 's region
