thousands of people have signed a petition calling for a controversial weight loss advertisement to be pulled , as katie hopkins slammed those complaining about the posters as ' chubsters '
the bright yellow advert for protein world has been put up in a number of london underground stations and features a model in a bikini with the question : ' are you beach body ready ? '
but the campaign , which promotes the brand 's weight loss collection , has attracted the ire of many social media users and body image campaigners , with some of the posters even being defaced
now katie hopkins has waded into the row , dubbing those who have been vandalising posters ' chubsters ' , and saying they should turn their efforts to exercising instead
katie hopkins , who has been outspoken about weight in the past , tweeted : ' chubsters , quit vandalising protein world ads and get your a * * * running on the road
feminism is nât an excuse for being fat
' ads for â beach body ready â vandalised
katie hopkins tweeted : ' chubsters , quit vandalising protein world ads and get your a * * * running on the road ' katie hopkins has previously been outspoken on the issue of weight , and wrote on twitter that ' society has a huge acceptance for being fat - but masses of abuse for being skinny ' katie hopkins spoke out against those campaigning for the advert to be withdrawn on twitter katie hopkins later declared that she was going on a run , and encouraged ' angry chubsters ' to chase her ' off for a run
the change.org petition states : ' protein world is directly targeting individuals , aiming to make them feel physically inferior to the unrealistic body image of the bronzed model , in order to sell their product
' perhaps not everyone âs priority is having a â beach body â ( by the way , what is that ? ) , and making somebody feel guilty for not prioritising it by questioning their personal choices is a step too far
' a body âs function is far more intricate and important than looking â beach ready â , so in fact it is protein world who have confused their priorities , if anyone
