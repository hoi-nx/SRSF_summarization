a mysterious ' ring of fire ' has been spotted in space thanks to albert einstein 's theory of relatively
the ring , located 12 billion light years away , is an illusion created by the chance alignment of two distant galaxies
the striking circular structure is a rare manifestation of gravitational lensing predicted by albert einstein in his theory of general relativity
the bright orange central region of the ring - alma 's highest resolution observation ever - reveals the glowing dust in this distant galaxy gravitational lensing occurs when a massive galaxy or cluster of galaxies bends the light emitted from a more distant galaxy , forming a highly magnified , though much distorted image
albert einstein 's theory predicts that the gravitational effects of the nearer galaxy will bend the light of the more distant one
the diffuse blue element at the center of the ring is from the intervening lensing galaxy , as seen with the hubble space telescope the highest resolution image of sdp.81 was made by observing the relatively bright light emitted by cosmic dust in the distant galaxy
