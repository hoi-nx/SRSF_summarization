the champions of england were smashed into submission at stade marcel on saturday night , to further expose the vast gulf in clout between the aviva premiership clubs and their rich french rivals
clermont are nigh - on invincible at home and northampton could do absolutely nothing to even fleetingly threaten their dominance in this raucous arena
clermont winger noa nakaitaci ( right ) scores his second try against northampton what unfolded was one - way carnage
france wing noa nakaitaci scoring two tries before half - time and nick abendanon , the ex-bath and england full - back , capped a masterful display with a break - away try from 90 metres out
for northampton and england , there may also be worries over two leading forwards , as courtney lawes failed to reappear after half - time and alex corbisiero went off , apparently suffering pain in his right knee
nick abendanon of clermont dives over to score a try at the stade marcel - michelin it was over as a contest long before half - time
there was so much pressure from clermont that it was just a matter of time before the northampton defence was breached
nick abendanon cast his magic over the saints defence to inspire comprehensive victory the france centre was tackled in the 22 by lee dickson , but the attack continued at a furious tempo and , when noa nakaitaci carved inside off his left foot , he was half stopped , but managed to climb up off the turf , stretch and touch down
jonathan davies made ground in the centre , wesley fofana picked out nick abendanon and he raced into space , drew the last defender and passed back inside for the home no 12 to charge clear and touch down
after the break , james struck another penalty before nick abendanon made his long - range dash to the line in the 55th minute , for another converted try
eventually , with julien bonnaire in the sin - bin , alex waller crashed over to give northampton something to show for all their desperate toil , but it was far too little , far too late
