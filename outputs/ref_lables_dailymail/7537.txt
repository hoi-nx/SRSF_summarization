when journalist gianna toboni traveled to india to explore the country 's rapidly growing , yet unregulated , gestational surrogacy industry for hbo documentary series vice , she did n't anticipate ' how dark ' the story would get
baby business : vice correspondent gianna toboni ( pictured ) traveled to india to explore the country 's booming gestational surrogacy industry shady deal : the journalist from brooklyn , new york , went undercover to meet with an agent in india who offered to get her a baby in two to three months but the heartbreak did not end there
as gianna toboni quickly learned during her time working on the outsourcing embryos documentary , surrogacy in india is a multi-million dollar business , and one which is made all the more lucrative by the high number of american couples traveling to the country in order to use the services provided by one or more of the â embryo outsourcing â agencies featured in the vice documentary
during her time spent undercover posing as one of these people , gianna toboni was informed that , in order to maximize profits and ensure a final product , doctors are encouraged to implant multiple embryos in surrogates , which can lead to the surrogate having to abort one of the fetuses or give birth to multiple babies
there are also issues with couples never making it to india to claim their children for whatever reasons , meaning that the newborn baby is left without a parent
for the most recent episode in the vice series , gianna toboni went undercover to meet with one surrogacy agent who claimed over dinner that she could get her a caucasian baby in two to three months - confirming that there were in fact â extra â babies being sold on the black market
the sale of ' extra ' babies on the black market was just one of the many shocking side effects of commercial surrogacy uncovered by gianna toboni and her team
in the american , surrogacy can cost hopeful parents upwards of $ 100,000 , and gianna toboni explained that ' the reoccurring theme ' when speaking with american agents and experts about couples hiring surrogates from other countries was money
commercial surrogacy in india costs nearly one - sixth the amount it would in the western world
no options : many of the surrogates who spoke with gianna toboni said that they decided to carry a baby because they desperately needed the money dormitory : the women who agree to be surrogates at dr patel 's akanksha infertility clinic have to live at the facility until they give birth tight quarters : two surrogates can be see sitting on the beds in their shared room and while american parents see the surrogacy business in india as being a â cheap â alternative to the services offered at home , the amount of money made by a surrogate in india can vastly change her life , as well as the life of her family
women can use the money to buy a home or send their own children to school , and gianna toboni explained that there are in fact couples who take great efforts to make sure their surrogates are a part of their lives
gianna toboni , who witnessed the high turnover rate first hand at dr patel 's akanksha infertility clinic , in the town of gujarat , in the west of india , was nearly speechless when she saw how rapidly newborns and their parents were whisked away following a surrogate 's c - section
as a whole , gianna toboni said that she thinks some parents may be aware of the ' shadier side ' of commercialized surrogacy , but a ' vast majority â have no idea this dark underbelly exits
gianna toboni recommends that parents who are considering foreign surrogacy options should do extensive research on the agent , the doctor and the surrogate they will be working with .
