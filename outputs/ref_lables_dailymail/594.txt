full back david raven stabbed home the winner to take inverness caledonian thistle to the scottish cup final
but what can we deduce about the state of scottish football from the two hampden semi-finals last weekend ? david raven peels away after scoring the winner for inverness caledonian thistle against celtic in the scottish cup semi-final raven celebrates with team - mate ryan christie as inverness caledonian thistle knocked celtic out at hampden well with scottish 's top club , celtic , taking the decision to embarrass themselves publicly by writing to the sfa crying about a penalty they were n't awarded against inverness caledonian thistle , you can see there are problems
i interviewed goal hero raven and he seemed upset by celtic 's actions : ' for a club that size to write to the sfa is a bit much , it 's definitely taken the gloss off it a little bit for me
i 'm surprised a club like celtic have done that â it 's a bit of an error of judgment for me
well done celtic , your extreme arrogance managed to spoil the highlight of an honest pro 's career
celtic think they are so gigantic they have a divine right to get to the final
celtic are like the brat of a child , over-indulged by parents , and scoffing too many sweets and not sharing any with the other kids because of some superiority complex which is n't backed up by what 's actually going on
whichever way you look at it , scottish football , like an unsafe , stinking high rise on the wrong side of glasgow , needs wiping out and starting again
firstly , celtic need bringing down a peg or two
celtic did n't get a penalty â so what ? inverness caledonian thistle should have had one when sub keeper lukasz zaluska bulldozed into the back of an opponent
as bad losers go , celtic are just about the worst of the lot
celtic striker leigh griffiths complained : ' we were robbed
now that 's being robbed
josh meekings ( centre ) appeared to handle the ball in the box but no penalty was awarded to celtic kris commons appeals for a penalty after meeking 's apparent hand ball but it was to no avail celtic captain scott brown appeals to referee steve mclean - the club have since written to the sfa next the game north of the border must do more to attract supporters to matches
the two biggest clubs in the country â celtic and rangers - regularly have loads of empty seats at home games
where is the passion for football in scottish ? has it disappeared completely ? was it the curling craze that did it ? have rhona martin and all curlers since the olympic gold medallist hit her peak become the new heroes rather than iron bruisers like scott brown ? what about on the pitch : take a look at the three inverness caledonian thistle scorers on sunday : raven i 've told you about ; greg tansey i first saw when he was a teenager at stockport and i was impressed
and edward ofere scored a cracker at hampden , finding the net for the second successive weekend
it 's a great moment for these players and for inverness caledonian thistle , but let 's not confuse that with anything remotely resembling high quality football
large swathes of hampden were empty for both scottish cup semi-finals over the weekend the standard of scottish football has continued to fall and the game needs to be overhauled inverness caledonian thistle manager john hughes , sacked by hartlepool after relegation to league two less than two years ago , has moulded these players into a side that sits third in the scottish premiership table , and favourites to win the scottish cup final
celtic 's pathetic letter should fire the sfa into action
