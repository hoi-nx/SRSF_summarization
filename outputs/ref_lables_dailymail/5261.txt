whether it 's a chocolate bar that no longer satisfies your appetite or washing powder which now runs out before your next shop , many of our big brands are shrinking their products
the latest casualty are boxes of cadbury 's fingers which , it was announced yesterday , will contain two fewer chocolate fingers from now on
they join creme eggs , pg tips teabags and even john west tuna in the ever - increasing list of goods getting smaller
when john west shrunk its no drain tuna steak in brine from 130g to 120g , the price stayed at Â£ 1 in morrisons
it 's seemingly part of a strategy across the retail industry that enables manufacturers to increase profits without putting up prices ( and thus risk losing customers )
it 's now so common , it 's even got a name : ' shrinkflation '
' shrinking products can be an underhand way of raising prices because pack sizes shrink but the prices do n't
f ood industry commentator martin isark believes the shrinking ploy is becoming more widespread
' it 's now common practice among the big confectioners and their argument is that they reduce the size so they do n't have to put the prices up , ' he says
' other confectionery goods that have gone the same way as cadbury 's fingers include mars bars ( down from an original bumper 58g to 48g since 2013 ) , kit kat chunky ( down from 48g to 40g earlier this year ) and in 2011 , the tins of cadbury 's roses chocolates shrank from 975g to 850g , the equivalent loss of 11 chocolates
sometimes , changes are obvious , such as cadbury altering the shape of its chocolate
the new version of tesco 's tomato and mascarpone sauce is a minute quicker to cook - as you get 25g less whoever heard of a pack of five eggs ? it seems cadbury has when it controversially took an egg out the box kennedy , editor of trade magazine kennedy 's confection , says one of the worst examples of shrinkflation was cadbury 's reducing the number of creme eggs in a box from half - a - dozen to five in the run - up to easter ( both sizes cost Â£ 1 at iceland )
' especially when they 're still paying Â£ 1 for a sharing bag of maltesers that 's down from 140g to 120g ( in fact , cadbury 's fingers have gone up from Â£ 1 to Â£ 1.50 in sainsbury 's this year despite the shrinkage )
but at least it 's healthier with less fat and salt ... going down : cadbury has snatched two chocolate fingers from its famous packs â reducing the number to 22 now 114 grams : cadbury chocolate fingers have come down by 11g - the equivalent of two chocolate fingers vince bamford , buying and supply editor of the grocer , says shrinkflation has taken off because suppliers are under pressure to maintain profit margins to keep shareholders happy and believe consumers prefer smaller products to price increases
' when we were in recession , suppliers and retailers were very wary of raising prices , ' he says
