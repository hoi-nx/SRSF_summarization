australian securities and investments commission deputy chairman kell said retailers needed to disclose credit card surcharges
' in aldi stores all credit card transactions and all tap and go payments attract the 0.5 percent surcharge , irrespective of whether customers use a debit or credit card
an aldi spokeswoman said it has always charged credit card surcharges to ' cover the costs associated with the service '
aldi told the regulator it would put up signs at the entrance of stores and at registers to notify shoppers of the surcharge , as well as have cashiers inform customers before payments were made ' however , rather than inflating prices across the board , to compensate for the credit card acceptance costs , aldi prefers customers to make the choice themselves
