former england captain mike gatting believes pietersen should not walk straight back into the international set - up , even if he piles on the runs for surrey this season
pietersen has returned to the lv = county championship in a bid to stake a claim for an england recall , although the 34 - year - old only managed 19 runs against glamorgan on sunday
england were held to a draw in the opening test of a three - match series against west indies last week , and calls for a pietersen comeback continue to linger ahead of the ashes this summer
pietersen scored 170 in his first outing for surrey this season but scored just 19 against glamorgan ' there are a few bridges that still need to be rebuilt , ' said mike gatting , who had just penned a congratulation message to jimmy anderson , england 's leading test wicket - taker , as part of slazenger 's celebratory flag tour
' even if pietersen scores runs there might not be spaces available
' you 've got to have somebody who is n't playing well to get pietersen in
' if people are playing well in the team , why should he just get straight in ? ' pietersen is keen to play for england again after being sacked in 2014 bell and gary ballance both hit centuries in antigua while root also showed signs of good form with scores of 83 and 59
cook 's poor performances saw him removed as one - day captain before the world cup earlier this year and mike gatting admits more questions will be asked of the england skipper if he fails to find runs against west indies
' cook knows what he 's got to do , he 's got to get some runs , ' mike gatting said
mike gatting has signed a giant flag congratulating jimmy anderson on becoming the leading england wicket taker in test matches michael vaughan , andrew strauss and alec stewart have all been mentioned in connection with the post , but gatting is unsure what the point of the position will be
