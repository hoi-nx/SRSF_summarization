old - stager jamie peacock scored a try double as leeds claimed a 20th successive victory over salford
the 37 - year - old rhinos prop had not scored a try for almost 12 months but went over twice in the first half to help the super league table toppers to their fifth win in a row
salford 's last home win against the rhinos was a 21 - 12 regal trophy victory at the willows in november 1993 and their wait goes on after a 28 - 18 loss
jamie peacock broke his try drought with a double for leeds in their win over salford on sunday full - back evalds followed up his two - try show against wigan with another brace with the red devils other touchdown from tasi
jamie peacock crossed for his side 's first two tries before handley , the outstanding burrow and hardaker went in to seal a hard - fought win in difficult conditions
salford , already without the suspended rangi chase and weller hauraki , were shorn of another six regulars but coach harris was not taking the voluntary option to rest any of his players before saturday 's cup tie at leigh
but handling errors by jamie peacock and handley gave salford confidence although leeds had the first chance to go ahead after 16 minutes
the rhinos did manage to go in front after 22 minutes when jamie peacock charged over from close range after salford conceded back - to - back penalties with sinfield tagging on the conversion
then evalds shot through the leeds defence to fire salford into a 12 - 6 lead
