i am not vain , rich or brave enough to face plastic surgery , when my mother rang for her weekly chat and i was feeling ancient after spotting a new wrinkle , i probed her for beauty advice
if i was feeling old , she , with a nearly 40 - year - old daughter , must be feeling ancient - yet she looked great
so they worked ? my mother swore they did
today , however , the go - to expert is carole maggio , the la - based creator of facercise , with a celebrity and royalty - packed client list
' imagine a plumber bent over in low - slung levi 's , ' carole maggio encourages
' carole maggio encourages exercises to form an ' ew ' expression of disgust and hold it to lift the lips the nose transformer this is n't pretty either
it requires me to push up the tip of my nose with my index finger while pulling my upper lip down for a count of 40
all of these exercises are performed while looking at myself so i can see that i resemble a tired - looking miss piggy with a hangover
the burn ! the burn that means it 's working ! the next day , after my first facial workout , i wake up to a face as sore as my glutes were after i took my first spin class in 2004 , but i push on with my exercises
carole maggio 's first foolproof tips seem easy enough to do : sleep on your back without any pillows under your neck and try to avoid carbs after 5pm
the dvd and guidebook then go through a series of exercises that carole maggio promises will take the years off and plump up my ageing skin
i work my way through the exercises without any problems - although it hurts more than i thought it would
facial exercising is not for the lazy - it takes about 20 minutes a day and it really does hurt in places - but after two weeks my husband is convinced he can see a difference , and i feel a bit more plumped up ; more ruddy farmer 's wife than aging , old crone
my upper lip is definitely fuller and for the first time in my life i feel bee - stung enough to try red lipstick
