an eight - year - old boy from layton , utah , ran 33 miles just weeks before undergoing his fourth round of surgery on a malignant brain tumor
even before he was first diagnosed with a rare form of brain tumor - known as a mature teratoma - back in october 2014 , the young man was already running half marathons for charity , even raising $ 1,700 in september for two of his friends who suffer from spinal muscular atrophy
though his diagnosis meant more time in the hospital , often in order to undergo some kind of surgical procedure , the tumor did nothing to stop lota from hitting the trails
' i got this ! ' eight - year - old lota ward had already run several half marathons before being diagnosed with a brain tumor , and still continues to run despite his diagnosis most recently , lota made the decision to attempt the 10th annual antelope island buffalo run just outside salt lake city , with the help of his running fanatic father
' in recovery : lota underwent his fourth brain surgery on wednesday , april 1 , and while the lotatoa ' lota ' ward family remains optimistic , the fight is not over yet ' i like running because it helps me a lot with hard times ' : lota 's hobby has become a source of strength for him in the face of several brain sugeries shortly after his diagnosis last october , lota underwent two initial brain surgeries to help drain spinal fluid and to remove some of the tumor
lota later went to see doctors for his three month check - up and was given devastating news : the tumor that they originally believed to be benign had grown aggressively
a subsequent biopsy lead to a new diagnosis - lota has a non-germinomatous germ - cell tumor , a malignant form of brain tumor
luckily for the lotatoa ' lota ' ward family , the tumor was not untreatable
reaching the peak : lota was running before doctor 's told him of his brain tumor
