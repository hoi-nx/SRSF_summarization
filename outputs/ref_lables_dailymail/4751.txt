on the day of his arrival at liverpool in june 2012 , rodgers struck an emotive theme , telling stories of afternoons at his grand - father âs house in county antrim spent watching the great liverpool teams of the 1970s and â 80s competing in domestic cup finals
on wednesday night at ewood park , he must only hope his modern liverpool side can raise themselves above recent modest levels and take another step towards a wembley final that could yet go some way to rescuing his season
rodgers set his side the objective of winning a trophy and finishing inside the top four liverpool have lost ground in the race for the champions league places and will find it hard to recover steven ( left ) and mario balotelli look on as rodgers give a talk to his players and staff blackburn rovers 's record against top - flight opposition speaking ahead of the replay at blackburn rovers , rodgers would not go so far as to say the fa cup could save this campaign for liverpool
nevertheless , an fa cup final would be more than useful , for all kinds of reasons
i think certainly the fa cup would give us a great boost as a team with lots of young players and players coming into the club
the fa cup would mark a good step forward for us
â coming towards the final part of a season that saw liverpool start badly , improve markedly and then disappoint once again , the problems facing their manager are familiar
meanwhile at the back , familiar failings re-emerged in the 4 - 1 defeat at arsenal on saturday as liverpool defended poorly and were left asking questions â for the first time in a while â of their goalkeeper simon mignolet
liverpool ace kolo toure is expected to start in the absence of the suspended martin skrtel and emre can summer signing dejan lovren may also be given the chance to impress at ewood park blackburn rovers vs liverpool predicted line - ups asked if a defensive repeat would see liverpool lose to a championship side , rodgers said : â i think so , yes
â if it is to happen , liverpool must overcome what should be a stiff challenge from gary bowyer âs team
blackburn rovers did more that frustrate liverpool in the 0 - 0 draw at anfield exactly a month ago
certainly liverpool must lift themselves if they are to prosper
the fact that they have already overcome a similar challenge in round four â winning a replay at bolton â will perhaps encourage them but that was a liverpool team trending upwards in form
liverpool will be hoping to replicate their 2001 fa cup triumph by beating arsenal in the final the obvious beneficiary of all this is the grand old competition itself
with arsenal , aston villa and reading already in the last four , the fa cup is guaranteed to find itself with semi-finalists who desperately want to lift the trophy
deep down , the fa cup will long for an arsenal - liverpool final
