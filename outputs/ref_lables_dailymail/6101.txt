just 11 per cent of research funding from he government and charities into the british âs leading causes of death and disability was allocated to dementia , research has found despite extra cash pumped into the two diseases recently by government bodies , they remain underfunded given the economic and personal impact felt by millions of sufferers and their families , say researchers
researchers assessed central government and charity research expenditure in 2012 into the british âs leading causes of death and disability â cancer , coronary heart disease , dementia and stroke which together accounted for over half of all deaths
the combined amount of research funding allocated by the government and charities to the four conditions came to Â£ 856million in 2012 , almost two - thirds of which was allocated to cancer
around one - fifth was devoted to coronary heart disease , while just 11 per cent was allocated to dementia and 7 per cent to stroke research
the study found a significant shift in funding since 2008 , particularly after a commitment by the coalition to new money for dementia research
research leader professor gray , of the health economic research centre at the nuffield department of population health , oxford university , said overall research funding has not been cut but priorities had shifted
almost two - thirds of research funding allocated by to the four conditions was allocated to cancer overall research spending by government bodies went up 20 per cent over the period , but there was a change in diseases that benefited
â he said research funding was â still way too low â in both diseases , especially for stroke
this means that for every Â£ 10 of health and social care costs attributable to each condition , Â£ 1.08 in research funding was spent on cancer , 65p on coronary heart disease , 19p on stroke , and just 8p on dementia , the researchers calculated
â dr doug brown , of alzheimer âs society , said : â alzheimer âs society has pledged to spend at least Â£ 100million on dementia research over the next decade â more than ever before â but if we âre going to improve the quality of care , develop better treatments and ultimately cure dementia we need politicians to pledge continued commitment and set out an ambition to create a step change in research funding
