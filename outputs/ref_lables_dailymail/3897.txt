an aussie teenager has joined the puffy pout craze by using a shot glass to pump up her lips to ridiculous proportions
violeta , who lives near canberra and already has naturally beautiful voluptuous lips , has joined the # kyliejennerchallenge sweeping social media of placing the opening of any narrow vessel over their mouth and sucking in until the vacuum of air causes their lips to excessively swell
in an attempt to emulate kylie jenner 's bee - stung pout , violeta got the shock of her life when she removed the shot glass and suddenly had such protruding lips that social media users compared her to a duck
' i screwed up , ' wrote one teenage girl along with her # kyliejennerchallenge selfie , while another complained she looked ' gross '
a worrying new trend dubbed the ' # kyliejennerchallenge ' is sweeping social media , encouraging teens to blow their lips up to epic proportions using bottles or shot glasses ( pictured ) ' made my chin look like a hickey a week ago and i 'll say i 've never felt so dumb , ' one disgruntled teen admitted
' i did the # kyliejennerchallenge and my lips turned purple , ' claimed yet another
the method - one this journalist wo n't be road - testing - works by way of the airlock created in the opening of the glass or jar , which increases blood flow to the lips and causes them to swell
the reportedly painful method involves participants placing their mouth over the opening of a cup , jar or shot glass and sucking in until the air vacuum causes their lips to swell up countless teens , both boys and girls , have been sharing the disturbing results of their experiments on twitter and instagram surprisingly , given the sheer number of teens attempting the feat , it appears the results are far from desirable plenty of twitter users have been quick to ridicule the craze
' stop with that kylie jenner challenge it 's so gross , ' one wrote
the method works by way of the airlock created in the opening of the glass or jar , which increases blood flow to the lips and causes them to swell problematically , the results are said to last for hours , even days , with several people complaining that they were stuck with the after - effects for much longer than expected last month , two icelandic sisters attempted the trick by sucking into a hairspray lid , and warned others against it after the stunt went disastrously wrong
' one boy expertly demonstrates just how extreme the effects can be if you try hard enough sore - looking red marks are visible around the lip line of this dejected experimenter as for kylie jenner herself , the 17 - year - old kardashian clan member has recently denied artificially enhancing her lips , despite much speculation to the contrary
people flashback to pictures of me when i was 12 and say " kylie jenner 's so different " but how can i look the same from 12 -18 ? ' plenty of twitter users have been quick to ridicule the craze , labelling it ' dumb ' and ' gross ' ' i screwed up , ' wrote one teenage girl along with her # kyliejennerchallenge selfie , while another complained she looked ' gross ' we can only hope this particular trend dies out as fast as it gained steam
