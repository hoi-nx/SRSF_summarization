they have a tv channel devoted to it , and one show â a sort of bulgaria âs got talent for folk acts â features people of all ages swaying in stately unison
in bulgaria it is genuine : practically every village in the mountains has at least one choir , and their own particular variation of traditional dress , and many hold festivals in the way that english villages stage fetes
when i decided to go to bulgaria i looked for a holiday combining exploring the remote southern mountains with a festival
despite much trawling on the internet , i could nât find a package on the right dates , so instead i combined a group walking tour with an independent excursion of my own
we stayed in a village called yagodina high in the remote rodopi mountains
golden wonder ! the autumnal colours shine on the rodopi mountains in bulgaria apart from the hotel , yagodina was totally devoid of any tourist infrastructure
we walked up to nine miles every day
unlike most of the other members of the group , i did nât have walking poles , so i picked up two sticks and tapped along until i got into a rhythm
yagodina cave in rodopi in part of the trigrad gorge and was the result of an earthquake that made the huge cave in the marble bed of a river on the way down , we walked past fields of potatoes â the staple diet in the mountains â and through muslim villages , a legacy of the ottoman empire
at the end of one walk we scrambled down to the yagodina cave system , its luminescent stalactites and stalagmites dripping eerily as they have done for millions of years
i splashed out on a cheap taxi for the trip across the mountains to the ski resort of bankso ( the one place i do nât want to go back to )
trees covered in a fresh snowfall on todorin vrah , in the pirin fortunately , a woman , who told me in broken english that her daughter was picking tomatoes in chichester , spooned me on to a crowded minibus to the pirin mountains
each village had a stage of its own where its people performed their songs and were awarded certificates for participating
