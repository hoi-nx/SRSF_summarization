gps are the gateway to nhs care â nine out of 10 times , the first contact a patient has with the health system is through their gp
the crisis in a&e has led some to blame a lack of available gp appointments for people heading to emergency departments instead
weekend opening hours for gps has been touted as one solution - by improving access , many patients wo nât need to take up other care services
the crisis in a&e has led some people to blame a lack of available gp appointments , prompting more people to visit the emergency department instead since the summer of 2013 , a number of gp surgeries in london have been piloting seven - day opening , as part of the challenge fund initiative - funding for which was recently increased from Â£ 50 million to Â£ 100 million
through the challenge fund , gp surgeries were asked to bid for funds for extra opening hours , but this was solely for set - up costs , for example , the sharing of medical records
weekend opening hours for gps has been touted as one solution to relieve the mounting pressure on a&e departments - by improving access , it is thought many patients wo nât need to take up other care services based on these findings , we calculated that this eight per cent fall would translate into two million fewer visits to a&e each year if weekend opening was made available nationally
given that the average cost of a gp consultation is about Â£ 27 , while that of an a&e visit is Â£ 114 , two million fewer a&e visits would imply a cost saving of Â£ 194 million for the nhs
from research carried out by thomas cowling and colleagues , we know that there is an association between gp access and the number of non-urgent a&e visits
in 2010 - 11 , the gp surgeries that were most accessible also had lower a&e non-urgent visits compared to the gp surgeries with the least access
a one point increase in the percentage of registered patients who seek gp appointments within two week days increases non-urgent visits by 0.7 per cent
in a survey of gp patients conducted in 2014 , three - quarters of respondents said that they found opening hours convenient
but among those who found gp opening hours inconvenient , 74 per cent wanted surgeries to be open on saturdays , 71 per cent late hours ( after 6.30pm ) and 37 per cent wanted them open on sundays
david cameron has promised to introduce seven - day access to gp services by 202 , while ed miliband has vowed to introduce a 48 - hour target for gp appointments as one gp put it : ' longer opening is a fine idea but the problem is that the people who see us the most - young children and elderly - are the ones that do nât have a problem with appointments on a monday afternoon
labour has promised a 48 - hour target for gp appointments ( at a cost of Â£ 100 million ) , while the tories have promised a seven - day access to gp services by 2020
