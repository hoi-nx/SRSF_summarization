britain 's biggest banks earmarked billions of pounds for ' remediation costs ' and fines over the last three years britain 's biggest banks have racked up a Â£ 39billion bill in just three years to pay for their financial scandals
the bill has been driven by the payment protection insurance scandal , with banks setting aside Â£ 4.7billion last year to compensate customers
another Â£ 2.3billion was earmarked by banks including barclays , rbs and hsbc to pay fines for rigging foreign exchange markets
the total charge for wrongdoing last year â Â£ 9.9billion â was only 8 per cent less than the previous year
barclays is also braced for a huge fine for rigging foreign exchange rates , having put aside Â£ 1.25billion so far to cover the bill
but the britain âs strengthening economy has driven a 72 per cent drop in losses from bad loans , with write - offs falling to Â£ 5.2billion last year
this compares with an Â£ 8.1billion charge in 2013
