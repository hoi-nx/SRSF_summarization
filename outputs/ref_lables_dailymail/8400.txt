on tuesday , spacex came incredibly close to landing its falcon rocket booster on a barge in the middle of the atlantic
now , leaked footage reveals just how close musk 's firm came to success , with a close - up view of the daring attempt shot on a gopro camera a deleted tweet by musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from ' stiction in the biprop throttle valve , resulting in control system phase lag
as a result , the actions from rocket 's computers could n't be acted upon in time to correct the tilt of the booster caused by a gust of wind
the video , which appeared on reddit , reveals how the rocket overcompensates for its extreme tilt

earlier this week spacex has released its own dramatic footage of its third attempt to land a rocket booster on a barge in the atlantic
soon after the launch , billionaire spacex founder , musk , tweeted : ' ascent successful
' the unverified video shows the rocket drifting into view in slow motion and floating onto its target before a gust of wind topples it over pictured is the moment of impact
spacex once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand
despite being destroyed , the booster 's flyback marks another step in the company 's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown , potentially slashing launch costs
the falcon is on now its way to deliver 4,300lb ( 1,950 kg ) of food , clothing and science experiments to the iss - including an eagerly awaited espresso machine for astronauts
the supplies today arrived at the iss the rocket was was due to take off on monday , but the launch was scrubbed due to bad weather
the video , taken from a plane on tuesday , shows the the falcon booster lowering itself onto the platform , before a gust of wind sways it to one side on board the dragon capsule was an experimental espresso machine intended for iss astronaut cristoforetti of italians
spacex , meanwhile , hoped to transform the rocket business by landing the first - stage booster on a platform floating a few hundred miles off florida 's northeastern coast , near jacksonville
the company appears to have timed the announcement to overshadow spacex ' launch of falcon , which today hoped to prove that reusable rockets are viable
the aim of both spacex and ula is to end us dependence on russian - built rocket engines , but the technology has so far proven difficult
ula 's plan is to skip returning the whole booster , an approach favoured by rival spacex
the booster managed to land on the barge but musk said that ' excess lateral velocity ' caused it to tip over musk tweeted this image of the booster coming back down to earth
the images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month 's attempt
