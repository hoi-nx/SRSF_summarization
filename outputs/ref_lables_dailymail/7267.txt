at 11:20pm , former world champion ken doherty potted a final black and extinguished , for now , the dream of evans to become the first women player to play the hallowed baize of sheffield 's crucible in the world snooker championship
in every other respect however , 29 - year - old evans , a single mum from dudley , was a winner on thursday night
she advanced the cause of women in sport no end and gave ken doherty the fright of his life in an enthralling and attritional match that wo n't be bettered in this year 's qualifying tournament
snooker 's governing body had been criticised in some quarters for allowing evans a wild card to compete alongside 127 male players for the right to play in the sport 's blue - chip event on april 18 - something no female had achieved
evans shakes hands with ken doherty following his 10 - 8 victory at ponds forge evans plays a shot during her world championship qualifying match against ken doherty ken doherty , who won the world championship title back in 1997 , took out the first frame 71 - 15 evans had ken doherty in all sorts of trouble before the former champion closed out the game 10 - 8 those critics and the bookies who made ken doherty a ridiculously short - priced 20/1 on favourite were made to look foolish as evans had her illustrious opponent on the ropes before finally bowing out 10 - 8
a gracious ken doherty admitted afterwards : ' she played out of her skin
i do n't know how i won that final frame
' evans , cheered on by her eight - year - old daughter lauren at the ponds forge sports centre in sheffield , admitted she was exhausted after a match of unfamiliar intensity for her
a 10 - time ladies ' champion , evans had led twice during the opening session before ken doherty went 5 - 4 in front the 10 - time ladies world champion collected just Â£ 400 as prize money for winning the title in 2013 , and this was a completely different environment against a player who beat stephen hendry to be crowned the best player in the world in 1997
i think i would have won if i 'd taken it to 9 - 9
' the presence of television crews and snooker star o'sullivan underlined what a big story evans ' participation was
evans eyes up her move during an enthralling game with ken doherty in sheffield she lost the first frame convincingly but the nerves did n't show after that
she reeled off three frames in a row , led 4 - 3 and once ken doherty went in front , pegged him back to 5 - 5 and 6 - 6
it lasted 45 minutes with evans rattling off the first 59 points and ken doherty the next 74
it took ken doherty to a 9 - 7 lead but evans came roaring back in the next frame
ken doherty , now ranked no 46 in the world , showed his experience to close out the contest he has two more qualifying rounds before he makes the crucible but it 's doubtful he will face a tougher opponent
