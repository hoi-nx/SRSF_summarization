researchers believe those who lived at the rising whale site may be part of what scientists call the ' birnirk ' culture ' as a result , these two artefacts give the best and least ambiguous evidence to date that non-ferrous industrial smelted metals were arriving in alaska via prehistoric trade across the bering strait

the latest discovery of bronze artefacts backs up earlier evidence for trade between alaska and other civilisations prior to 1492
livescience notes that anthropologist berthold laufer published an analysis of texts and artefacts in the journal t'oung pao in 1913 , in which he found that the china had an interest in obtaining ivory
among menzies other claims are that the first inhabitants of the western hemisphere did n't come over land from the bering strait , but instead were china sailors who first crossed the pacific ocean 40,000 years ago
most scientists believe that humans arrived in the new world 15,000 years ago by crossing the now - flooded land bridge that had formed across the bering strait
cape espenberg , where the discovery was made , is a cape located on the seward peninsula in alaska , on the chukchi sea coast
