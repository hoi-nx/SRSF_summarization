fresh from his masters triumph , spieth made a visit to the observation deck of the empire state building on monday , and of course the augusta record - equalling champion was still proudly sporting his green jacket
spieth broke several scoring records on the way to his four - stroke victory , including equalling the 18 - under total set by woods in 1997 and becoming the championship 's second - youngest winner of all time
and the magnitude of his achievement still did n't seem to have sunk in yet as spieth took in the press attention which included his trip to the top of the 25th - tallest completed skyscraper in the world which was lit up in green and yellow later in the evening
fresh from his masters triumph , spieth visited to the observation deck of the empire state building the augusta record - equalling champion was still proudly sporting his green jacket as he snapped a selfie ' it 's all run together
it all happened quickly , ' spieth said
he watched bubba watson celebrate another masters title , and all the perks and celebrity that came with it
' so you get reminded of it all the time , because when you 're masters champion , it 's a different legacy , ' spieth said
' he was runner - up in the texas open and lost in a playoff at the houston open before arriving at augusta
the world 's media were keen to get even more footage of the augusta champion after his big weekend it was the disappointment of last year that ultimately carried spieth to victory and the legacy he craved ' so the combination of the two allowed me to keep my head down , not worry about anyone else in the field except myself and to play a golf course that is my favorite course in the world , ' he said
on the ninth hole , spieth 's shot came up a fraction short and tumbled down the front of the green and back into the fairway , leading to another bogey
bubba watson birdied and suddenly was two shots ahead , and spieth did n't have the power or the putting to catch up
his lead down to three shots , spieth made a simple birdie on the eighth hole
he was runner - up in the texas open and lost in a playoff at the houston open before arriving at augusta bubba watson presents spieth with the green jacket after his 18 - under total secured him the victory there was only one shaky moment after that
spieth was four shots ahead and looking at a two - shot swing on the 16th when rose had 15 feet for birdie and spieth faced an 8 - foot putt for par. rose missed
but that friday at augusta , when spieth shot 66 and built a five - shot lead , felt a lot like friday at congressional when mcilroy began to bury the u.s. open field in 2011
mcilroy is currently world no 1 and while spieth is far behind at no 2 , golf is craving a top rivalry mcilroy was not ready to think about a rivalry , even though he stated his goal very clearly that he wants to be no 1
