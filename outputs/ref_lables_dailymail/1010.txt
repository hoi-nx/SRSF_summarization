known only by the name gulnaz , the kabul - based woman was only 16 - years - old when she fell pregnant with the child of her depraved attacker asadullah - who is also married to her cousin
even though a rape led to her pregnancy , gulnaz 's brothers insisted she would not be allowed to return to her ' shamed ' family as she was unmarried and a kabul court sentenced her to two years in prison for ' adultery by force ' , later increased to 12 years following an appeal
just over two years after gulnaz married asadullah , the couple agreed to a joint interview with cnn 's nick paton walsh
victim : known only by the name gulnaz ( left ) , the woman was only 16 - years - old when she fell pregnant with smile ( centre ) - the child of her rapist asadullah ( right ) agonising decision : gulnaz said that she had married the man who had attacked her because she did n't want to ruin her daughter 's life gulnaz said that her decision to marry the rapist was purely based on the fact her daughter , smile , would have been unable to live a normal life in the afghan capital without a father
tragic : gulnaz said that her decision to marry the rapist enabled smile to live a normal life ' i did n't want to ruin the life of my daughter or leave myself helpless so i agreed to marry him , ' she said
asadullah is still married to his first wife - gulnaz 's first cousin - with whom he has five children
when the case came to court gulnaz was sentenced to two years in jail , which was later increased to 12 years on appeal

although there was no longer a legal obligation for her to so , gulnaz later approached the rapist 's family to arrange the terms of marriage and give smile the best chance of a normal life
