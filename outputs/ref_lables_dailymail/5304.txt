duncan burton was taken into custody on wednesday on one count of sexual assault and if convicted will face a maximum sentence of 20 years
uber spokeswoman , debbee hancock said on monday that duncan burton had passed all the firms background checks before they allowed him to work under their name
however , according to uber 's official background check policy they only review sentences passed down up to seven years ago
that means because duncan burton was sentence 14 - years ago , his drug offense did not register or raise a red flag
indeed , duncan burton served 14 years of an 18 year sentence for trying to distribute five kilos or more of cocaine according to the us bureau of prisons
he was convicted in houston and served time in louisana and georgia before his 2012 release which was commuted because of good behavior
according to houston regulations someone with a drug conviction is not eligible for a city permit to drive cabs
duncan burton did not have a city permit to drive a cab and had never applied for an exemption
this week in denver , a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger 's home
lifeline ? sullivan , 46 , will leave his role as facebook 's security chief to help uber defend safety concerns these claims , among others , follow a data leak last may , which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain
it is hoped sullivan , the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high - technology crime , can protect uber from potentially crippling ramifications
though his experience lies in digital protection , uber ceo travis kalanick has also entrusted the 46 - year - old with tackling physical security
