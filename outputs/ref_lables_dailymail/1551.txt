a mother of four has pledged to remove her children from school to attend an ancient maypole festival - despite facing fines or even prosecution
james , 32 , has vowed to defy the school 's ban on taking her children to the ' obby ' oss celebrations - claiming the rituals are part of her ' religion , culture and heritage
mrs james pictured with her son ethan ( far left ) , piran ( centre ) and sophia ( right ) at last year 's maypole festival but mrs james said she would be willing to take the consequences of any police action to take her children ethan , 11 , piran , 5 , sophia , 8 , and four month old baby faith to the event
the annual may 1 celebration is a centuries ' old tradition , involving music and dancing through the streets , believed by some to be an ancient pagan fertility ritual which heralds the arrival of spring
held every year in padstow , cornwall at midnight on may 1 , it consists of parades and celebrations throughout the town and into the following day
mrs james , who moved from padstow to st austell , cornwall , eight years ago , said : ' i think it 's ridiculous that i 'm being told i ca n't take my children to the event
' it 's part of our heritage , our culture and our religion
if i wanted to take children out of school for some other religion i think it would be a different story
' i do n't expect the st austell schools to close , but i do think that any school in cornwall should be sensitive to the needs of people from padstow to return to their home town on may 1
' mrs james , 32 , has vowed to defy the school 's ban on taking her children to the ' obby ' oss celebrations
under the current system , parents who take their children out of school without permission could face a Â£ 60 fine per child , rising to Â£ 120 if it is not paid within 21 days
but leaders at bronescombe school in st austell would not authorise mrs james ' request for her children to join them
mrs james said : ' for padstow residents the day is a massively important part of their cultural heritage
' just because i do n't live in padstow any more does n't mean i ca n't celebrate my religion
mrs james said the festival was part of her family 's religion , culture and heritage but the government insists that local head teachers still have the discretion to approve up to ten absences a year ' in exceptional circumstances '
in padstow , where children are an integral part of the festival , the school closes so pupils can take part in the early - morning dances
' mrs james , who is currently on maternity leave from her job as a pa , said that she has attended the event every year since she was born and for residents of padstow it was more important than christmas
