the earth could be suffering from shifts in its biochemical balance similar to those believed to have wiped out half of all life 200 million years ago
this is according to a british study that has discovered a catastrophic condition called ' marine photic zone euxinia ' took place in one of the prehistoric oceans
this happens when the sun - lit surface waters of the ocean become devoid of oxygen and are poisoned by hydrogen sulphide
life of the triassic met a choking end in a runaway greenhouse climate , heating the seas into warm stagnation , according to a new study
the study authors fear that the planet today could suffer similar consequences hydrogen sulphide is a by - product of micro-organisms that live without oxygen and is extremely toxic to most other lifeforms
the study authors fear that the planet today could suffer similar consequences caused by the amount of carbon dioxide being created through the burning of fossil fuels
the rocks are now exposed on the queen charlotte islands , off the coast of british columbia , canada the experts found signs of bacteria which had suffered severe oxygen depletion and hydrogen sulphide poisoning which would have been caused by massive volcanic rifts in the earth 's tectonic plates
' as tectonic plates shifted to break up pangaea , huge volcanic rifts would have spewed carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , leading to rising temperatures from the greenhouse effect , ' said professor whiteside
' she explained that although the earth was very different during the triassic period , the rate of carbon dioxide release from volcanic rifts are similar to those we are experiencing now through the burning of fossil fuels
professor whiteside added : ' the release of co2 was probably at least as rapid as that caused by the burning of fossil fuels today , although the initial concentrations were much higher in the triassic
triassic - jurassic mass extinction - 201 million years ago there were two or three phases of extinction that made up the triassic - jurassic mass extinction event
