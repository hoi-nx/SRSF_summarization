still , vonn appeared worried as she watched woods flash his notorious temper on a couple of errant shots as he struggled to prove he 's still no. 1 worldwide -- and not no. 111 , where his rank plummeted following back surgery last year
vonn appeared to sweat it out along with tiger woods after he yanked his tee shot into the adjacent first fairway and let the club fall from his hands in disgust while he stood frozen , staring incredulously at the flight of his ball
