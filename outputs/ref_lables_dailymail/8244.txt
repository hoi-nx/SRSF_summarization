conman : moore was on remand at wandsworth prison when he sent fake email posing as court clerk a ' hedonistic ' conman who escaped from prison after sending staff a fake email saying he had been granted bail has been jailed for seven years
moore , 28 , was on remand at wandsworth prison in south - west london for a Â£ 1.8million fraud when he emailed wardens posing as a court clerk manager at ' southwalk crown court '
it allowed the fraudster to brazenly walk out of prison on march 10 last year , an escape motivated by moore 's fear he would be harmed by fellow inmates after striking up a relationship with a transgender individual at wandsworth prison
moore 's escape only became apparent three days later when his solicitors attended the prison for a conference with him and discovered he was gone , london 's southwark crown court heard
the judge , recorder david hunt qc , described the escape as ' sophisticated and ingenious '
' while behind bars moore set up a website , using the address and telephone number of the royal courts of justice on the strand , using an ' illicit ' mobile phone that was used widely in the prison
' moore 's partner kristen ( left ) leaving london 's southwark crown court mr hunt said : ' i accept that you may have had a troubled early life as a result of your sexual orientation , but that can be no excuse for committing fraud
when moore 's grandfather died he left him an amount of money which he frittered away partying , the court heard
it was this relationship that ultimately led moore to make his escape from prison , after they were both sent to wandsworth prison , it was said
mr femi-ole said : ' he ( kristen moore ) and his partner were remanded into prison , wandsworth prison
' the court was read a letter from moore in which he described feeling suicidal at the time of the fraud offences

all charges against moore 's partner were later dropped
moore , from ilford in essex , admitted eight counts of fraud , and one count of escape from lawful custody , and was jailed for a total of seven years
