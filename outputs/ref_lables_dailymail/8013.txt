the mother - in - law of one of one of the boston bombers has taken to the stand to tell how her daughter was converted to islam by her husband , as lawyers try to argue the other brother out of being put to death
judith russell , whose daughter katherine married tamerlan , one of the two mass murderers who set of bombs at the 2013 boston marathon , spoke at a court in the city today
her words came as jurors decide whether tamerlan 's brother , dzhokhar , 21 , should be put to death after being convicted of a host of crimes in connection with the massacre
she told how her daughter katherine , left , converted to islam after meeting dzhokhar 's brother tamerlan dzhokhar , pictured three months after his arrest for the boston bombing , flipping off a camera in his jail cell
his defense team argued on monday he is a ' good boy ' and should be spared the death penalty for killing three people and injuring several hundred in the 2013 terrorist attacks tamerlan himself was killed in a police firefight a few days after the bombing , which he masterminded

russell was brought before the jury as a defense witness - and told how tamerlan met her daughter and got her pregnant before gradually becoming more radical in her views
russell told jurors she drifted from her daughter as a result of the relationship - and that at some point was shocked to find her wearing the veil and a new convert to her husband 's faith
dzhokhar , an ethnic chechen , was found guilty earlier this month of killing three people and injuring 264 as well as fatally shooting a police officer
david bruck delivered the defense 's opening statement in the penalty phase of dzhokhar 's trial , claiming that no punishment tamerlan can be given is equal to the suffering of the victims

david bruck focused heavily on tamerlan 's brother , tamerlan , who died after a gunfight with police four days after the bombing , saying he led the plot and provided the ' fuel ' to drive the plan
he said tamerlan was ' consumed by jihad ' and had ' power ' over dzhokhar , who admired his older brother
david bruck contrasted tamerlan with dzhokhar , saying tamerlan was loud and aggressive , got into fights , failed at everything he did and never held a steady job , while dzhokhar was a good student in high school , was loved by his teachers there , had many friends and never got in a fight
one of the first defense witnesses to testify in the penalty phase described an incident at a mosque when tamerlan became angry and interrupted prayer services

fucarile said he has had more than 60 surgeries , and it is still unclear whether his left leg can be saved in a sharp contrast to the last phase of the trial , when the defense took just two days to call four witnesses , the court has scheduled about two weeks ' worth of testimony as tamerlan 's lawyers make the case to spare his life
the tamerlan brothers shot dead massachusetts institute of technology police officer sean collier three days later .
