sterling first came to the attention of the wider world in a tv documentary charting rodgers â early days in charge of liverpool in the summer of 2012
in footage from a pre-season training session , the liverpool manager is seen rebuking sterling â then a talented but largely untried teenager â for answering him back
now sterling is a 20 - year - old england international and a cornerstone of liverpool âs first team
on wednesday he was back on tv again but this time he was attempting to call the shots
sterling has turned down a new deal with liverpool and put off contract talks until the summer sterling has come a long way since being lectured by rodgers during being liverpool the winger was just 17 years old in 2012 when he was told off by rodgers for answering him back at training sterling , pictured celebrating a goal for england , says he does not want to be seen as a money - grabber sterling has attracted interest from clubs including real madrid , bayern munich , manchester city and arsenal sterling arrives for training at liverpool 's melwood training ground sterling arrives at training ahead of liverpool 's game with arsenal sterling âs message to liverpool , and indeed rodgers , would appear to be clear
as such , regardless of a Â£ 100,000 - a - week contract offer , he may choose to leave
as a piece of pr , wednesday 's bbc interview was of questionable value
at one point during his chat , sterling admitted supposed interest from arsenal is â quite flattering â
â i do nât want to be perceived as a money - grabbing 20 - year - old , â said sterling , but the denizens of the kop may perceive precisely that
sterling 's current Â£ 35,000 - a - week deal at liverpool has two years to run at the end of this season sterling has confirmed that he rejected an offer of Â£ 100,000 - a - week to stay at liverpool sterling says that he would have signed a less lucrative deal if he had been offered one at this stage last year sterling takes on lithuania 's georgas freidgeimas during england 's euro 2016 qualifier at wembley neil ashton broke the sterling contract story on monday - click here to read full article at liverpool on wednesday the club âs hierarchy were aghast
not only did they know nothing of sterling âs chat with the bbc until other journalists rang to ask them about it , they are understandably suspicious about the timing and motives
rodgers and his players are coming off a sobering home loss to manchester united , in which sterling played poorly , and now face arsenal in the premier league and blackburn in the fa cup â games that will go a long way to determining whether this current season is marked success or failure
now , rather than draw a line under talk about his contract , the subject of sterling and his future will dominate the next few days
was this the whole point of the arrangement made by sterling âs management with the bbc ? liverpool are asking themselves this question , and , regardless of the answer , sterling âs standing at the club has inevitably changed
at training at melwood on thursday , sterling will be treated no differently by rodgers , just as luis suarez was dealt with evenly in the wake of interviews in the summer of 2013 in which he criticised his manager
there are other similarities with luis suarez , though , that are less palatable for the latest liverpool player to wonder if he would be better off elsewhere
luis suarez said in summer 2013 that he wanted to leave liverpool but was eventually convinced to stay rodgers will deal with sterling in training at melwood on thursday in the same way he did with luis suarez there will be no shortage of suitors for sterling should he leave liverpool - in the premier league and europe sterling insists that he is focused on winning trophies and becoming the best player he can be liverpool âs owners will view this episode dimly
will they move to spain with him ? luis suarez was a well - travelled football gun for hire when he took liverpool on - but can sterling cope ? liverpool boss rodgers must convince sterling to sign a new deal and remain at anfield sterling should not be blamed for his ambition
