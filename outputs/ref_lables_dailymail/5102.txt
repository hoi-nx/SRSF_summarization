stevie mccrorie has been crowned the winner of voice 2015 , after beating fellow contestant lucy o'byrne in the final
the very job she was hoping to leave behind when first auditioning for the show series one winner leanne mitchell , mentored to success in 2012 by sir tom jones , blew everyone away with her version of whitney houston 's i would run to you in the live final
some , including the script frontman and former voice coach danny , believe leanne mitchell did n't have the right work ethic
when asked last year about leanne mitchell 's flop , he said , ' i was told by tom jones , and by the label as well , that leanne mitchell just did not want to work as hard as you have to work to be a pop star
' leanne mitchell won the public vote in the final of voice uk 's first ever series , but her debut single , a cover of whitney houston 's i would run to you only just managed to scrape into the top 50 after being released leanne mitchell has now returned to her previous employment , singing for holiday campers at potters leisure resort in hopton-on-sea , norfolk , after failing to make her mark on the music industry after being dropped by her label decca , leanne mitchell is now working in the job she thought she 'd left behind - singing for holiday campers at potters leisure resort in hopton-on-sea , norfolk
but can the same be said for series two winner , andrea begley ? former voice uk coach danny criticised leanne mitchell for not working hard enough after winning series one of the bbc talent show , but has failed to make his own winning act , andrea begley , who was crowned champion of the second series in 2013 , into a household name either partially sighted irish singer andrea begley was determined to avoid the mistakes of her predecessor leanne mitchell , but despite enjoying more chart success amd holding onto her record deal , she too has failed to equal the superstardom that comes with winning other tv talent shows like simon cowell 's x factor the partially sighted singer from pomeroy , northern ireland , now 29 , won the public vote in 2013 after being mentored by fellow irishman , danny
andrea begley 's album , the message , released in october 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts , but compare that to the success of most x factor winners , and you soon understand the singer 's disappointment but while andrea begley is still fortunate enough to have herself a record deal , her success has n't been the chart topping megastardom that winning a rival show like x factor might bring
andrea begley 's album , the message , released in october 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts , but compare that to the success of most x factor winners , and you soon understand the deflation in the andrea begley camp
will.i.am won the third series of voice uk with jermain jackman , a young singer from hackney , london 2014 voice winner jermain saw his debut single and i am telling you , a cover of the broadway number made famous by jennifer hudson in musical dreamgirls , chart at just number 75 hot on the heels of andrea begley was jermain jackman , who won last year 's series with coach will.i.am
compared with x factor 's 2014 winner ben haenow , whose debut single landed the christmas number one spot , jermain 's success has so far been what you could call limited despite various public appearances , once with amy winehouse ( pictured centre ) at a charity event in the name of his late daughter amy winehouse , jermain 's debut album this month has landed at number 42 the glitter falls from the ceiling ... but the real hard work is just beginning for stevie mccrorie so can stevie mccrorie break the curse and become the first ever success of voice uk ? his debut single will be lost stars , a cover of adam levine 's hit from the film begin again , which was nominated for an oscar this year
when asked if he 's worried about the growing number of voice uk flops , he simply replied , ' stevie has n't won it before
' so now it 's all eyes on you stevie ! no pressure ... though it 's not always the winners who reap all the success ( steve brookstein , case in point ) , the x factor has produced far more chart successes than voice uk
