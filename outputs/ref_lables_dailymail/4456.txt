' pacquiao works up a sweat shadow boxing during preparations for his clash with mayweather with his eyes closed and grimacing with effort , pacquiao ramps up his shadow boxing routine yet he warns floyd jnr that if does beat pacquiao and wants to go on to eclipse marciano 's historic record of retiring as undefeated world champion after 49 straight wins , then he should ' stay away from our own amir khan
' hatton , who talks from the painful inside knowledge of having been knocked out by the men currently considered to be the two best pound - for - pound fighters in the world , says : ' we all know mayweather has this brilliant defence but one of his greatest strengths is his ability to adapt in the ring
it is that boxing brain which is pacquiao 's big problem
he 's a fast southpaw , which is what gives mayweather trouble
' hatton , pictured at his gym earlier this year , says pacquiao has the style to beat mayweather it was a vicious left hand from pacquiao that left hatton on the canvas in las vegas in 2009 pacquiao takes on mayweather six years to the day after knocking hatton out at the same venue hatton also says having trainer freddie roach ( right ) in his corner gives pacquiao a huge advantage mayweather snr trained hatton for his fight with pacquiao and the hitman says : ' i do n't want to knock him but i was shocked that he could n't do southpaw pads

' amir khan could cause him even more problems than pacquiao
' and with mayweather dipping slightly at 38 â probably not at the peak he was when he fought oscar de la hoya and me â amir khan could be the one who 's even faster than floyd
' amir khan 's right to keep kell on hold while he waits to see if he can get the winner on may 2
