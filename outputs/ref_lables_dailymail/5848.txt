paul casey , pictured in action last month , is the 99th qualifier in the field of 99 due to play at the masters â i was very relieved and now i am just so excited , â said paul casey , who made the last of his eight masters appearances in 2012
paul casey finished sixth on his masters debut in 2004 and actually led in 2007 after five holes of the final round it âs a stupid rule that has subsequently been changed and paul casey said , smiling : â it would be nice to wind the clock back , would nât it ? it did affect me for a few holes and i fell away ( he finished 10th )
meanwhile , there âs still no word on whether tiger woods will play the masters , although he did at least declare his intent by pitching up for a practice round at augusta on tuesday .
