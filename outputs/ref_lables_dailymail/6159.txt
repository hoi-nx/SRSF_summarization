at her largest , when she weighed 27st 10lbs ( 388lbs ) and was a size 32 , she dreamed of pulling off skimpy outfits
but now , weighing just 8st 9lbs ( 121lbs ) and wearing size 6 clothes , she says she would give anything to get back her fuller figure back and be able to eat normally again
she developed crohn 's disease and lost 18 stone in 20 months to become a slim size six ( right )
but rather than being delighted at her new figure , she describes her situation as a ' nightmare ' her condition leaves her in constant pain and she can barely keep food down , so she can never enjoy eating or go out for dinner with her friends

miss jane harris says her ' dream body ' is actually a nightmare as she can not eat and vomits daily by the age of 14 , she was dubbed ' fatty bum bum ' by playground bullies
' as my waistline expanded , my confidence shrank and it was n't until i left school - and the bullies - behind me that i stopped worrying about my size
' at college , i ate what i wanted and although i reached nearly 28 stone , i still made an effort with my clothes , hair and make - up
' with the humiliation of her school days behind her , miss jane harris gradually started to embrace her size 32 frame
' within 20 months i 'd lost more than 18st
