al-qaeda in iraq leader baghdadi has been seriously injured in an air strike and is no longer in control of the terrorist group , according to an iraqi source
the source said that he was wounded by an attack from the us - led coalition while travelling in a three - car convoy in march in nineveh , iraqi
he is slowly recovering but does not have the reins of the organisation , according to the guardian
two officials confirmed to the paper that the strike on the convoy did indeed take place , on march 18 in the al-baaj district of nineveh , not far from the syrian border
news of the attack follows contradictory accounts of al-baghdadi being killed in air strikes in november and december another , an iraqi expert on al-qaeda in iraq used by the government in baghdad in an advisory capacity , revealed that he had in fact been wounded
he said : â yes , he was wounded in al-baaj near the village of umm al-rous on 18 march with a group that was with him
raffaello pantucci , director of international security studies for defence think tank the royal united services institute , told mailonline that it âs entirely plausible that the infamous leader had been hit , but warned that it might not have a long - term impact on the group if he did n't survive
he escaped death in december when us jets attacked a two - car convoy on the outskirts of mosul
among the dead jihadists was also abu muslim al-turkmani , a former iraqi army lieutenant colonel considered baghdadi âs number two and the most senior is militant in iraqi
baghdadi , 43 , was the head of al-qaeda in iraq before founding the islamic state in iraqi in 2010 , while he was declared head of the islamic state in iraqi and syrian in 2013
