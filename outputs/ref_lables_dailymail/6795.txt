an ingenious british designer has come up with the ultimate environmentally - friendly way to create stunning household furniture - by letting mother nature do all the hard work
using this method he 's already created several prototype pieces and has a field in derbyshire where he 's currently tending a crop of 400 tables , chairs and lampshades which he hopes to harvest next year
' furniture farmer : munro with a prototype wooden lampshade grown into shape using his ingenious technique botanical manufacturing : a light shade being grown , left , and as a finished article , right working together with his wife alice , mr munro mainly uses strong , fast - growing willow for his designs but is also experimenting with ash , sycamore , hazel , crab apple , sessile oak and red oak
remembering an old over-grown bonsai tree in his mother 's garden when he was child which resembled a throne , he decided it would be faster to grow furniture directly rather chopping a mature tree into bits
the field in derbyshire where the unusual crop is growing
mr munro hopes it will be ready to harvest next year form and function : the technique creates furniture which is not just beautiful to look at but extremely strong too ' it means you do n't have joints which come lose like with a traditionally made chair so they should last a whole lot longer
mr munro , who has named his company full grown , has already harvested chairs , a table and lampshades and is currently working on more complex designs including a bookshelf and a chest of drawers
but it 's not simply a matter of setting up the molds and sitting back and letting the trees grow into shape
mr munro hopes to have them on sale in 2017 priced at Â£ 1,000 and Â£ 1,500 depending on the size but the munros recovered and weather - permitting they hope to have their first big crop harvested in 2016 and ready for sale in 2017
