much like their season as a whole , the hammers started strongly against stoke city before wasting their efforts with a lack of concentration late on
â the early part of the season is about the players achieving great heights , â allardyce said
' among the new arrivals on saturday was former ipswich town left back cresswell , who scored with a brilliant free - kick before marko arnautovic âs 95th - minute equaliser
hammers had dominated early on and aaron cresswell âs curling effort from a free - kick gave them the lead diafra sakho is among those said to be struggling with the tail end of the season , and he limped off but stoke city grew into the game as the home side waned and marko arnautovic had two goals ruled out for offside either side of mame biram diouf hitting the inside of the post with a header
super stat : hammers have lost more points from goals scored in the 90th minute or later this season ( seven ) than any other premier league team
