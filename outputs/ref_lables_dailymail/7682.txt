being underweight in mid-life could increase your risk of dementia , claim researchers
a new study shows you are a third more likely to be diagnosed with diseases such as alzheimers 's than those of a healthy weight

a new study shows underweight people are a third more likely to be diagnosed with diseases such as alzheimers 's than those of a healthy weight ( file photo ) study author , professor stuart pocock , from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , said doctors and policymakers may have to re-think how to best identify those at high risk of dementia
he said ' we also need to pay attention to the causes and public health consequences of the link between underweight and increased dementia risk which our research has established
' ' however , our results also open up an intriguing new avenue in the search for protective factors for dementia - if we can understand why people with a high bmi have a reduced risk of dementia , it 's possible that further down the line , researchers might be able to use these insights to develop new treatments for dementia
' other experts said more research was needed , and the way gps used to diagnose dementia may have skewed the results
a healthy score is between 18.5 and 24.99 â above is overweight and obese
after nine years follow - up , 45,507 people were diagnosed with dementia
researchers found people who were underweight in middle age were 34 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than those of a healthy weight
the findings contradict many previous studies which have suggested that being fat â with a high bmi ( bmi ) - could raise the risk ( file photo ) as people 's bmi increased , the risk of dementia fell , with very obese people having a bmi greater than 40 less likely to develop the condition than those of normal weight
