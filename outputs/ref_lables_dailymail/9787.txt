a young star wars fan , who wrote a heartwarming note to the movies â creator george lucas asking whether he would allow knights to marry in the future , was elated to receive a reply granting his request
seven - year - old colin gilpatric , an aspiring jedi , was devastated to learn that achieving his dream might mean never being able to marry , as forming emotional attachments is said by the rules of the fictional order to lead jedi to the ' dark side '
desperate for a solution , colin , who has autism , went directly to the man in charge : star wars director and writer mr george lucas
plea by post : seven - year - old aspiring colin sent a letter to george lucas asking him to change the rule that bans the knights from marrying as character anakin skywalker 's marriage to princess amidala led him to become a villain - and lord of the malevolent sith , darth vader wanted to avoid the same fate , and pleaded with the star wars creator to make a change to the rules
' with darth vader , he was obsessing about it , ' colin 's mother peggy gilpatric told inside edition : ' finally , i was like , you know what , write to george lucas and tell him how you feel and that 's all that you can do
' ' dear george lucas , ' colin wrote in his letter
' i do n't like that a jedi can not get married
' when you find someone that you can connect to in a selfless way , then you are on the path of the light , and the dark side will not take hold of you
there âs a dark side and good side
