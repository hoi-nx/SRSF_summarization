for the parents of children living with cancer , there is often so little hope
now , a ground - breaking television documentary filmed over two years follows three children and their families through such a situation
battler : chloe during her treatment
she is one of three children featured in a ground - breaking tv documentary in the film they reveal with heroic honesty why they are willing to risk their lives as they become the first children in the world to go through a pioneering treatment called immunotherapy
and it is a necessary part of the process that discovers new treatments that ultimately offer hope to other young cancer patients
sophie , 12 , fabian , nine , and chloe balloqui , three , are patients at great ormond street , london , the leading uk centre for treatment of child cancers , and are the youngsters featured in the documentary
tragically , although for one of them , treatment is successful , two do not survive the radical procedure
immunotherapy involves powerful drugs being given to kill off all a patient âs cancer cells and destroy their bone marrow
the 12 - year - old was two when she was diagnosed with leukaemia and entered the immunotherapy trial after her fourth relapse this allows a transplant of new bone marrow containing immune system cells , harvested either from the patient or a donor
these cells are genetically modified in a laboratory so they are better at attacking cancer
the toxicity of the immunotherapy means children often have to be sedated and given strong painkillers such as morphine , to cope with the treatment , and many end up in intensive care
â some 30 children a week are diagnosed with cancer â that âs more than 1,500 a year â and 250 of them will die every year
but for some , standard treatment does nât work and the cancer comes back , which is why clinical trials such as the one for immunotherapy can be a lifeline â they offer families their last hope
during filming , the toddler has surgery to remove the tumour as well as chemotherapy so strong it could kill an adult , in preparation for the immunotherapy
her father admits the pain of â seeing your child in discomfort , seeing the side effects of what we are doing here to try to kill the cancer â
the child was given modified cells taken from his 14 - year - old sister cassia to battle his cancer sophie , the third child , was two when she was diagnosed with leukaemia and entered the immunotherapy trial after her fourth relapse
â â â the youngster had two options : take drugs to fight the pain , and allow the cancer to progress to its inevitable end ; or take part in the trial
â there are currently 36 child cancer medical trials open in the uk â 22 of which are funded by charity cancer research
some 15 of these are studies into new treatments for relapse patients such as those highlighted in the documentary
earlier this year the mail on sunday reported that cancer experts had hit out at eu red tape that is denying hundreds of terminally ill children cancer drugs â because a legal loophole means pharmaceutical companies have to test new treatments on adults only
if firms opt out of testing new treatments on under - 18s during clinical trials , doctors are then barred from using them on youngsters because they are cleared for adult use only
only half of 28 cancer drugs trialled between july 2007 and june 2012 were tested on children
they have to answer to their shareholders and they are therefore risk - averse to trials with children , so child cancer trials have to be funded independently through organisations like us
the itv film captures the poignant moment her pink coffin leaves the family home near heathrow
â unfortunately the bone marrow transplant never worked so she never had the chance to have the modified cells
like sophie , fabian , who received letters from the duchess of cambridge after meeting her in hospital in 2011 , was determined to look to the future and was given modified cells taken from his 14 - year - old sister cassia
he says : â the good cells fight the bad cells and destroy them , and as soon as they are destroyed i wo nât be ill any more , which is a good thing because i want to stay well , not in a coffin and then , like dead
despite these tragedies , clinical trials have transformed outcomes for cancer patients and particularly in children , as three - quarters of those with cancer are now cured compared with about a quarter in the late 1960s
in a whirlwind six - week campaign , an appeal raised more than Â£ 100,000 to pay for further experimental treatment scheduled to begin early this year
