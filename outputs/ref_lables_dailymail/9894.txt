an eight - year - old boy has been tested for every std including hiv after he put a used condom in his mouth thinking it was a balloon
the boy picked up the unwrapped condom in his school playground at bennett elementary in bennett , colorado last week
his mother , who was only identified as alicia to protect her son , said it would be a year before her son had the all - clear from his std testing
the mother received an email from the school informing her of what her son had come across in the playground
