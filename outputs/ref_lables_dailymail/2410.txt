the price of olive oil is expected to rocket as forestry officials in southern italy yesterday began cutting down thousands of olive trees infected with a deadly bacteria
the xylella fastidiosa bacteria has ravaged olive trees in the puglia region and contributed to a 35 percent drop in the region 's olive oil production last year
its spread has so alarmed the eu that france announced a boycott of puglian fruit and vegetables , while its effect on production will mean shortages in the supply of olive oil and is likely to lead to higher prices for shoppers in britain and around the world

several dozen protesters tried unsuccessfully yesterday to block the first seven trees from being felled in oria , near brindisi , even climbing the branches and shouting ' assassins
many of italy 's oldest olive groves , some dating back 500 years , have been infected by the bacterium , which causes plants to shrivel , leaving them incapable of bearing fruit
puglia , a region in the heel of italy , produces about 11million tons of olives a year , more than a third of the national crop , and they are used to make some of the country 's best oils
it is feared that unless drastic action is taken to fell the groves , the bacterium will spread to other olive - producing regions of italy such as tuscany and umbria , and even to other mediterranean countries
naturally it is very painful for the growers but it is necessary to remove all the affected trees , it is the most effective measure
