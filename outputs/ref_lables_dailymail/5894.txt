for 120 years it has been a great british institution , bringing world - class performances of classical music to the public
but now the bbc has been accused of dumbing down the proms â by holding an ibiza - style dance party

pictured right is cartoonist pugh 's take on the ' dumbing down ' of the proms it will take place on july 29 , coinciding with the 20th anniversary of radio 1 's broadcasts from ibiza , and will reinterpret ' club classics ' such as music sounds better with you by stardust and rhythm is rhythm 's strings of life
proms director edward blakeman said it was a ' natural ' move , adding : ' these 20 years of dance have been a huge phenomenon on radio 1 so why not celebrate it in a proms way with a big orchestra ? we do now live in a world , thank god , where you can like all kinds of music
' live music at the so - called pete tong prom will be played by the jules buckley heritage orchestra , which has worked with pop stars such as arctic monkeys , professor green and basement jaxx
the proms moved to the albert hall in 1941 after the queen âs hall was bombed
' the pete tong prom is not the only surprising addition to this year 's line - up at the albert hall , which runs from july 17 to september 12
more traditional fare includes the complete beethoven piano concertos and sir simon rattle conducting elgar 's the dream of gerontius
the dj 's selection is the latest bizarre choice for the proms ( pictured at albert hall ) , which has previously been accused of ' dumbing down ' rapper fazer ( left ) and pop singer paloma faith ( right ) have played the proms in recent years in an attempt to appeal to a younger audience
