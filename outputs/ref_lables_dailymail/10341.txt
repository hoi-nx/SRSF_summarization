images revealing the shocking extent of gender stereotyping in toy shops have been posted online under the hashtag # notanaprilfools
the pictures show a wide divide between the aspirations set out for girls and boys , with females offered pink beautician 's outfits while males are offered doctor 's uniforms
products intended for infants are equally polarised , with babygros for girls emblazoned with a slogan that reads : ' i hate my thighs '
the fancy dress options for girls and boys hint at very different future careers babygro reading ' i hate my thighs ' and ' i 'm super ' left customers in one store feeling cross by contrast , the boy 's effort offers up the much more pleasant : ' i 'm super '
the # notanaprilfools feed , which was launched by campaign group let toys be toys , is based on the idea that the toys are so ridiculous that they must be a joke
now about learning gender stereotypes ? ' other examples included separate cookbooks , with boys getting to make gourmet burgers and giant chocolate sundaes , while girls make small pink cupcakes
girls ' cookbooks include recipes for delicate cupcakes , while boys are encouraged to make burgers pink has become the colour of choice for companies marketing products for girls many more of the boys ' words evoke action and bravery whereas the girls ' ones focus on looks and fluff let toys be toys , a campaign group set up by a group of british parents two years ago , is petitioning retailers to end the practice of labelling products by gender
one of the campaign 's founders , tricia lowther , 46 , a self - employed copywriter from durham , told mailonline : ' it does bother a lot of parents , we seem to have tapped in to a huge and growing sense of frustration with the way toys are promoted according to outdated , illogical and sexist stereotypes
' boys will be learning to draw warriors while women draw faces and flowers wizards and werewolves are favourite subjects for boys ' books - but not for girls many parents responded to the images of the sexist toys by posting pictures of their children playing with ' the other gender 's toys '
the campaign has gathered momentum in response to what toys be toys describe as the increasing gender stereotyping of toys and the dearth of neutral playthings
' of course , there 's always going to be evolutionary differences , but so many more toys aimed at girls have to do with being pretty and looking a certain way , whereas those all about having fun and action heroes are for boys
parents sharing pictures of their ' princesses ' playing with ' boys ' toys ' # caringboys is pics of little boys playing with baby dolls and pushing them around in prams ( playing dad ) dr linda says any activity that dispels the idea that a girl 's value lies just in the way she looks is positive
