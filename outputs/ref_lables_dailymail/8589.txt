the common ancestor of humans may have had tentacles , a scientist has claimed
organisms that lived in the sea 635 to 541 million years ago , from which humans and other animals evolved , likely had flexible appendages and a complex nervous system
a russian scientist says the distant ancestor of humans had tentacles
they lived more than 540 million years ago and used them for food
it 's likely they also had a complex nervous system like we do today the latest research was conducted by dr temereva from the department of invertebrate zoology at the faculty of biology of the lomonosov moscow state university
however , our distant ancestors hundreds of millions ago were not , with many of them thought to be worm - like creatures that swam in the seas or walked on the seafloor
a warming climate may have enabled the earliest humans to venture into europe 1.4 million years ago , a new study suggests
one theory suggests that our common bilaterian ancestor was a worm without appendages and just a simple nervous system
and , she says , they also had a complex nervous system
lingula anatina is one of the oldest brachiopods having survived to the present day , originating in the early ordovician era 500 million years ago
