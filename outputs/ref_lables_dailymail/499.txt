a massive extension of lady thatcher âs landmark right - to - buy housing policy will be announced by david cameron today
he will pledge discounts of up to 70 per cent to allow all 1.3million families in housing association properties to buy their home
â the next tory government will extend the right - to - buy to all housing association tenants in this country â 1.3million extra families â a new generation given the security of a home of their own , â he will say
original plan : the right - to - buy scheme became lady thatcher âs most famous single policy launching his party âs election manifesto , the prime minister will urge voters not to risk a change of government : â let âs not waste the past five years
â the pledge to extend right - to - buy , which was introduced in 1980 but has now been stopped in its tracks by labour in wales and the snp in scotland , will delight the tory faithful , who were buoyed last night by a six - point poll lead over labour
the original right - to - buy saw more than 1.5million council homes being sold off at discounted rates
the coalition government has already increased right - to - buy discounts for council homes , meaning more are moving into the private sector
promises : the prime minister , pictured posing for a selfie as he campaigned in alnwick on monday , will pledge discounts of up to 70 per cent on housing association properties , should the tories win the election currently , taxpayers subsidise the housing costs of many unemployed and lower paid workers who live in housing association properties
the 1.3million housing association homes are occupied by 2.75million people
â some labour figures , including former welfare minister frank field and former cabinet minister alan milburn , have previously championed the idea of extending the right - to - buy to housing associations
ruth davison , of the national housing federation , which represents housing associations , said : â extending right - to - buy to housing associations is the wrong solution to our housing crisis
while extending right - to - buy will see some people being able to buy their own home with help from the taxpayer , these are people already living in good secure homes on some of the country âs cheapest rents
â how does right - to - buy work ? introduced in 1980 , it gives council house tenants discounts to buy their home
what has the coalition done ? it has sought to reinvigorate the scheme , cutting from five to three the number of years tenants need to have been in a home before they can buy it and upping the discounts to a maximum of Â£ 77,000 for most areas
are housing association tenants covered ? housing associations â autonomous , not - for - profit bodies that receive public money and loans from the private sector to provide low - cost homes â are largely exempt
what are the tory proposals ? they would legislate to give all housing association tenants full right - to - buy
the new properties would be more affordable , probably in less expensive locations , and could be built either by a council or housing association
another slice of the proceeds would be used to fund the new right - to - buy discounts for housing association tenants
