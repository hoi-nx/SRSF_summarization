when fiorentina 's season ends next month , micah richards wo n't be jetting off on his summer holidays
his contract at manchester city expires at the end of the season , when he becomes a free agent
micah richards has found playing time hard to come by during his loan move to italy side fiorentina richards joined the serie a side after being frozen out at manchester city - and will be on the move again this summer he knows it , too , choosing to delay any holidays until his next destination is finalised
unable to hold down a regular place in vincenzo montella 's starting xi this season , richards has had ample time to reflect on his career so far
tipped as the future of england 's defence , richards ' career has been on steady decline
but at the age of 26 - year - old , there 's time for richards to buck that recent trend
richards celebrates with yaya toure and gael clichy at his boyhood club , where his contract ends this year ricahrds is set on a return to the premier league , shown here in 2011 skipping past arsenal 's gervinho he 's enjoyed his time in italy ; he likes the lifestyle
the possibility of a permanent reunion with mancini , who nurtured richards ' career at manchester city , this summer is a real one for the defender
on paper , a move for richards this summer is a no brainer
