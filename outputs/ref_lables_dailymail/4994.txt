crawling commando - style underneath an open - sided land rover , i came virtually nose to nose with a 4,500lb horned rhino
i tried to slow my breathing as she looked straight at me
there were three other rhinos with her and , let 's be honest , they 're not called a crash of rhino for nothing
the luxurious ulusaba game reserve is in south africa 's sabi sands and is sir richard branson 's private reserve thankfully the female found my scrawny presence of absolutely no consequence , and instead wandered off in search of tastier herbivorous options
my mum â sky tv presenter kay burley â was sitting statue - still on board , having adopted her best nonchalant expression , but she was n't fooling either of us
the holiday at ulusaba , sir richard branson 's private game reserve in south africa 's sabi sands , was my reward for graduating
alexander kutner came face to face with three rhinos , along with documenting the roar of a bush lion , the yawn of a hippo and the prowl of a glorious leopard just the day before , we had tracked the crash of rhino on foot
with 1,000 rhinos killed by poachers in south africa last year alone , they are increasingly difficult to view
the lioness , who could have taken any one of us out with a casual swipe of her front paw , looked in our direction , checked her cubs and allowed us to stay
heading back to the luxury accommodation at cliff lodge , a two - bedroom apartment within rock lodge ( mum described it as glamping but with solid walls , luxury furnishings , soft sheets and a chef to conjure up our favourite food ) , we talked about all the other animals we wanted to see , if possible
alexander kutner with mum , sky tv presenter kay burley , at ulusaba , sir richard branson 's private game reserve in south africa 's sabi sands trevor said he and danny would try but could n't promise anything
nevertheless , given the conservation , ecology and anti-poaching work being carried out by ulusaba and adjoining camps , we were feeling confident
alexander kutner said a lioness looked in his group 's direction , checked her cubs and allowed them to stay trevor started up the engine and we moved on
they made their way into the water and proceeded to perform for us â a photographer 's dream ! we returned to the lodge to relax and sort through the hundreds of photos we 'd captured
chef served up kudu burgers for lunch
ulusaba means ' place of little fear '
that 's because the koppie where rock lodge sits provided the ancient shangaan warriors with the perfect lookout point trevor wondered what else we 'd like to see
