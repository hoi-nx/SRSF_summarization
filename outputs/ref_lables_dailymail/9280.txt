tiny babies are more sensitive to pain than adults , according to a study of infants â brains which overturns the medical consensus
until now doctors have assumed that the brains of very young babies are not developed enough to feel pain
but the new findings , revealed by oxford university doctors , suggest that not only do babies feel pain , but their pain thresholds are even lower than those of adults
it overturns the medical consensus that newborns have a high pain threshold ( file picture ) in the first study of its kind , the researchers showed in brain scans that infants â brains react in much the same way as adults when given even mild pain
dr slater , of oxford university âs department of paediatrics , said : â obviously babies ca nât tell us about their experience of pain and it is difficult to infer pain from visual observations
â in fact some people have argued that babies â brains are not developed enough for them to really â feel â pain , any reaction being just a reflex â our study provides the first really strong evidence that this is not the case
the research , which was carried out by doctors from oxford university ( pictured ) overturns the medical consensus that very young babies do not feel pain and do not need painkillers , even for invasive procedures the nhs guidelines , updated in january 2015 , advise that when the tongue is sliced from the mouth âs floor , infants do not need medication
â our study suggests that not only do babies experience pain but they may be more sensitive to it than adults
the researchers found that 18 of the 20 pain regions in adults â brains also â lit up â in babies â brains
scans also showed that babies â brains had the same response to a weak poke as adults did to a stimulus four times as strong - suggesting their pain thresholds are lower
