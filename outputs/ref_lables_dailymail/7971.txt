fighter ace : douglas bader 's story is to be told in a hollywood film dubbed â great escape â the story of how douglas bader recovered from having both legs amputated to become one of britain âs greatest fighter aces is remarkable enough
but now another astonishing but little - known chapter of his war career is to be told in a hollywood film being dubbed â great escape â
douglas bader â who lost his legs in a flying accident in 1931 â was shot down over france in august 1941 and ended up in a german prison camp in warburg
it was there that the officer , who always made light of his disability and refused to even use a stick , was involved in a mass break - out that pre-dated the break in 1944 immortalised in the great escape starring steve mcqueen and richard attenborough
this latest look at his exploits is based on a book on the warburg escape by historian mark felton called zero night
the great escape : douglas bader 's story predates the break in 1944 immortalised in the film starring steve mcqueen and richard attenborough ( pictured ) douglas bader was among those recaptured but was such a nuisance to the german that he ended up in the â escape - proof â colditz and remained in captivity until the end of the war
while the great escape relied on its famous tunnels , the warburg mass break out saw the men boldly leap over the huge perimeter fences using wooden ladders
douglas bader âs life story has been the subject of 1956 film reach for the sky starring kenneth more ( pictured ) a series of makeshift ladders propped against the prison camp 's perimeter fence were made from wood plundered from a wrecked hut
the escape was codenamed operation olympian because it involved troops from across the britain , australia , new zealand and south africa
the rights to dr mark felton âs book ( pictured ) have been bought by production firm essential 11 usa as the night of the breakout loomed , the ladders were disguised as bookshelves to fool the guards
douglas bader later ended up in colditz and had his tin legs taken away to ensure he remained in captivity until the end of the war
but now their story could trump the great escape after hollywood bosses snapped up the rights to turn military historian mark felton 's book about the escape zero night into a blockbuster
the rights to dr mark felton âs book have been bought by the makers of 2013 âs saving mr banks with tom hanks
dr mark felton said a number of ' a-list ' hollywood stars were queuing up for roles and essential 11 had invited him to help cast the leads , although he could not reveal who was interested
