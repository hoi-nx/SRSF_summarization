the gel contains platelet - rich plasma ( prp ) - a concentrated mix of substances in the blood that play a role in healing
it is made by taking a small amount of blood from a patient 's arm ( amounts vary depending on wound size , but typically no more than a couple of tablespoons ) and then processing it in a machine that spins the blood at high speed until it separates into its various components
platelet - rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and is also used in some cosmetic procedures that claim injecting it into the face can rejuvenate skin - nicknamed the ' vampire facelift '
the researchers also hope using platelet - rich plasma will address a common problem with burns , which is that they often continue to get worse hours or even days after the original injury
platelet - rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and for cosmetic procedures this is where there is damage to the third and final layer of skin - the subcutis , which contains larger blood vessels and nerves , and regulates the temperature of the skin and body
it 's hoped the platelet - rich plasma will allow the wound to start to heal before it can deteriorate
previous research suggests that the high concentration of growth factors in the platelet - rich plasma helps stimulate growth of new blood vessels and skin tissue
for the latest study , at the university of utah and other burns centres , about 40 patients will have up to 18ml of the platelet - rich plasma ( about three teaspoons ) applied on to a partial - thickness burn within 72 hours of the initial injury
platelet - rich plasma is already being used by orthopaedic surgeons with some amazing successes
' meanwhile , a combination of platelet - rich plasma and stem cells is being tested as a treatment for knee arthritis
