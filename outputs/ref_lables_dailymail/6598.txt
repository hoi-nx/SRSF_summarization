a supporter waits the best part of an hour for five seconds with taylor
there is a quick picture and good - luck message ahead of sunday 's tyne-wear derby
he is , evidently , one of the few players genuinely respected by newcastle 's disillusioned fans
taylor scored the winner at the stadium of light three seasons ago , affording him a terrace tribute â ' taylor , over the wall ' â as well as a place in black - and - white folklore
but there is more to the newcastle 's admiration than one free - kick against the enemy
a working - class scouser who came through the ranks at tranmere and made 100 appearances by the time he was 21 before beating three career - threatening injuries , taylor ' gets ' the proud principles of the north east â appreciation , hard graft , honesty and enjoyment
he has himself been a fan in the crowd during three of the last four derby defeats - he watched the other from a hotel room in america after undergoing surgery on the second of the cruciate ligament injuries which kept him out for 26 months
newcastle utility player taylor ( right ) shields the ball from arsenal forward danny welbeck taylor scores with a superb free - kick against sunderland to win the game 1 - 0 at the stadium of light taylor is congratulated by newcastle defender steven taylor in the club 's last victory over sunderland newcastle supported him through that long rehabilitation , something for which taylor will always be grateful
but with his current contract at st james set to expire this summer , the 30 - year - old does not know what the future holds
he accepts , though , that this could be his final taste of the fixture which has guaranteed him lifelong worship
' i have to be realistic , this could be my last derby , ' he told sportsmail
' taylor returned after more than two years of painstaking gym sessions alone for october 's 2 - 0 win at city in the league cup
in the next game , at home to qpr , st james ' was stunned into silence when , after half an hour , a tearful taylor sat himself on the turf clutching the same ill - fated knee
taylor 's injury record at newcastle has severely limited his first - team appearances over the past few years the 30 - year - old is incredibly grateful to newcastle for sticking by him and hopes to repay them on sunday ' i thought to myself , ' why me ? ' , ' he reflects
' on the subject of dark days , both newcastle and sunderland are horribly out of form going into what has been billed as ' the desperation derby '
the sunderland could be in the relegation zone by the time kick - off arrives , while newcastle have lost their last three under john carver
to suffer another loss in the derby could prove unforgivable in the eyes of supporters whose last victory arrived courtesy of taylor 's right boot in august , 2011
' the good thing is we 've got a cracking game now and if anything can rally us for the rest of the season then this is it , ' says taylor , who will start at right back
my first premier league goal â for wigan against newcastle â was from that exact position , so i fancied it
taylor is one of the most popular players at newcastle for his consistent and hard working performances ' dan gosling â one of my best mates â went through on goal in the last minute
looking back , i 'm probably relieved he did n't score to make it 2 - 0 ! ' i did n't realise at the time how big scoring the winner was and how much i would be remembered for just one goal
' taylor adds : ' i 'll always be a newcastle fan
' what 's going to happen on sunday ? ' taylor is asked
taylor is out of contract at the end of the season and admits he does not know what the future has in store
