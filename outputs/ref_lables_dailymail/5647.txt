an old bailey judge has blasted his junior colleague for â taking his eye off the ball â and passing an ' unlawful ' sentence when letting a bt manager dodge jail for a Â£ 28,000 expenses scam
wheelchair - bound christopher starrs , 50 , was allowed to go free from court with just a suspended jail sentence in january after admitting his part in a two - and - a - half year con against his employer bt
christopher starrs , along with fellow bt openreach manager tamplin , invented clamped cars , overtime hours and damage to home owners â property during broadband installation , and paid off engineers to help them make the fake claims
blasted : judge nicholas cooke qc ( left ) blasted his junior colleague stuart trimmer qc ( right ) for ' taking his eye off the ball ' when he sentenced christopher starrs in january this year both christopher starrs and tamplin , 53 , who made Â£ 124,000 from the con , admitted submitting the string of bogus expenses
tamplin was jailed for two years at january 's sentencing hearing , but mr recorder stuart trimmer qc spared christopher starrs jail as an â act of mercy â - although he ordered him to repay the money he took and pay a Â£ 1,500 fine
however , senior judge nicholas cooke qc has now said the sentence was â unlawful â - and added christopher starrs should have been sent to prison for his crimes
â he was mercifully dealt with , sadly by a judge who did nât have his eye on the ball
â the judge told mark haslam , defending : â the sentence was wrong but that âs a matter of personal opinion
â no one appears to have noticed that the sentencing imposed on mr christopher starrs was unlawful
â fraud : wheelchair - bound christopher starrs , 50 , was a manager with bt who admitted defrauding the company of Â£ 28,000 over two years the recorder , who is the head of 4 bream buildings chambers and took the silk in 2006 , gave christopher starrs a 16 - month jail sentence suspended for two years and ordered to pay a fine , and allowed the confiscation proceeds to continue
after the judge heard the cps will now drop the confiscation proceedings , he said the original sentence will stand , quipping : â he no doubt thanks his lucky stars
â christopher starrs , of northolt , middlesex , who had worked at bt since 1988 , was excused from sitting in the dock because he is in a wheelchair
