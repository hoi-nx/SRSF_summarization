at a visit to the age uk in plymouth yesterday , cameron appeared weary with bags under his eyes and disheveled hair
in one day this week the tory leader travelled to all all four home nations in his bid to secure votes ahead of the may 7 election
on thursday mr cameron was been forced to defend michael fallon after the defence secretary claimed ed miliband would stab britain âs national interest in the back in the same way he did his brother to gain the labour party leadership
the prime minister was also dealt a blow as ed miliband overtook him as the most popular political leader for the first time
the tory leader has spent the day campaigning in devon , where he must win several seats if he is to stand any chance of winning a majority
