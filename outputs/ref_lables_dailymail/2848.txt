ever fancied driving the tumbler straight from the big screen and into your street ? or perhaps you 've always yearned to take the ghostbusters ' cadillac for a spin ? well now it 's possible to do both thanks to brothers marc and shanon - who have designed and built a fantastic fleet of movie - inspired vehicles
among their wonders on wheels are lifelike versions of batman 's tumbler from the dark knight film trilogy and the much - loved ghostbusters car - or ecto - 1 as the spook - hunting team call it
the brothers have even made an optimus prime truck , based on the most recent transformers movie , as well as a tron - inspired motorbike
' take bat ! the brothers ' impressive version of the tumbler , batman 's car in the dark knight trilogy attention to detail : the number plate and interior are very similar to the original tumbler real deal : the tumbler in the 2005 movie batman begins , which was directed by christopher nolan the car - crazy brothers from port canaveral , florida , started building versions of the vehicles they most loved for their own enjoyment four years ago
' i do n't know what it cost to build - i 'd probably cry if i looked into it - but as far as value , it 's one of the most expensive vehicles we own
' prime mover : a truck made to look like autobot optimus prime in last year 's transformers : age of extinction neat fleet : marc ( left ) and shanon show off their tron - inspired bike and other vehicles at their workshop he and shanon , 44 , have now turned their hobby into a business - called parker brothers concepts - and they hire out their movie - inspired cars and motorbikes to fans
marc said : ' shanon thinks if he can draw it , i can build it - but it 's more difficult than that
' he knows very little about mechanics so he 's not limited like a lot of designers who have engineering degrees - there 's nothing holding him back when it comes to design
' in the beginning we fought because we come from different realms but now it 's a back - and - forth process
the parkers ' version has a 43 - inch ( 109 - cm ) front wheel - the largest ever wheel on a three - wheeled motorbike - and is powered by a harley davidson motor
