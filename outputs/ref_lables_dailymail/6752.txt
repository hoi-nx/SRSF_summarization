' rory mcevoy , the royal observatory âs curator of horology , added : â what we âve seen here is something approaching a perfect clock , but we are not there yet
he has since been the subject of dava sobel 's bestselling book longitude , as well as a film with the same name starring michael gambon ( right ) and jeremy irons ( left ) john harrison was a carpenter born in 1693 in lincolnshire
