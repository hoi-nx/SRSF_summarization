the stray dog was hit by a car , clubbed in the head and left for dead in a ditch in wash
days later , the one - year - old bully breed mix showed up sickly and covered in dirt at a nearby farm
the dog , theia , survived being run over , beaten with a hammer and buried , and now needs surgery heroic : theia , a 1 - year - old bully breed mix was hit by a car and then struck in the head with a hammer and buried , but she managed to dig herself out hanging on : a driver hit the dog with a car -- and that person proceeded to strike the dog
the dog appeared to be hit with hammer in a mercy killing
then things got worse : someone cracked her in the head with a hammer and placed her in a box in a farm field
she named the dog theia
recover : theia is scheduled to go into surgery in a few weeks time after raising money through crowdfunding new lease of life : theia , who truly rose from the grave , rarely stops wagging her tail back on all fours ! theia 's injuries include a dislocated jaw and multiple bone fractures around her nasal cavity , which makes it difficult for her to eat and breathe but it looks as though she is truly on the mend ' considering everything that she 's been through , she 's incredibly gentle and loving , ' mellado told the associated press
' theia is receiving care at wsu 's veterinary teaching hospital in pullman
a ct scan of her skull revealed a condition that constricts the nasal passages , restricting air flow into the lungs , said veterinary resident sundholm , who 's assisting with theia 's treatment
help out : mellado has raised more than $ 12,000 towards the dog 's surgery using the crowdfunding website gofundme
so far , contributions have come from moses lake , wsu and elsewhere ouch ! x-rays of theia 's skull show the damage that was caused by everything she went through the veterinary hospital 's good samaritan fund awarded $ 700 to help pay for theia 's early treatment
