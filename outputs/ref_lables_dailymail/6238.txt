it sounds idyllic , but perhaps is not the way you might imagine poulter prepares to win the masters
but poulter promises this break , just weeks before the first major of the year , means he will be fit and fresh for his latest assault on augusta
the downtime ensured plenty of opportunity to dream about feeling that green jacket draped over his shoulders , and what meal he would choose for the champion âs dinner the following year
â i hate tempting fate , â he says while reclining on a lounger in his luxury holiday apartment in new providence
but i âm not telling you ! â poulter lines up his putt for birdie on the 18th hole during the first round of the arnold palmer invitational these are certainly not the words of a man who feels he is taking things too easy in the build - up to the most eagerly - anticipated week of the golfing year
â i âve had two weeks off before ; i âve played [ tournaments ] during the run - in ; i âve tried going to augusta several days before masters week to get some extra prep in
â so this year poulter , who has two top 10 finish at the masters in his 10 attempts , has simply said to hell with it , let âs have some fun
sharing his holiday with the world on twitter comes third , of course
poulter celebrates during the fourball match on the second day of the ryder cup golf tournament by now , however , the serious work has begun
the ryder cup defines poulter , gets his juices flowing , his eyes and veins popping like nothing else
but at the age of 39 , and with mcilroy leading a new breed of power hitters ready to clean up the majors , poulter knows he will not get too many more chances of claiming either prize
poulter plays into the 13th green during the final round of the 2014 turkish airlines open so , if push came to shove , would he take a green jacket over a claret jug ? â that âs a very unfair question , â he says
despite poulter âs ryder cup heroics , he has still never won a strokeplay event on us soil
he came close to victory in the honda classic last month but a final - round collapse featuring five balls in the water extended that duck
poulter admits the prospect of retiring without a major victory would leave him unfulfilled
english golfer poulter admits retiring without a major victory would leave him unfulfilled â yeah i âd feel incomplete [ without a major ] but i âd feel very content living the rest of my life knowing that i gave it a good go
â two top - 10 finishes at augusta in the last five years suggests there will not be too many who can be confident of beating poulter next week
going for the career grand slam at the age of 25 is simply â incredible â , but even if this is not the week that feat is achieved , poulter insists the northern irishman is already the equal of gene sarazen , ben hogan , jack nicklaus , gary player and tiger woods
poulter smiles during practice ahead of the 2014 ryder cup on the pga centenary course at gleneagles â we knew years ago when he burst on to the scene this kid was going to be good , â he says
â but for all the effusive praise , poulter rates watson as the man to beat this year , not mcilroy
mcilroy hits his tee shot on the third hole during the first round of the arnold palmer invitational the defending champion will be chasing his third masters win in four years and poulter reckons the huge - hitting left - hander âs game is so well suited to augusta , even the world no 1 might not be able to match him
six left - handed winners in the last 12 years â mike weir , phil mickelson ( three times ) and watson ( twice ) â is clearly playing on poulter âs mind
he would not be alone among the players in wondering how they can compete on what poulter admits is a â bomber âs course â
â so how can poulter compete with watson , mcilroy and the other monster hitters ? â that course lends itself to a cut , or if you âre a right - hander a draw
â if that plan comes to fruition , there âs a fair chance poulter might spend more than just one week living it up in the bahamas
