dubai is renowned as the playground of the rich and famous
it is a melting pot of decadence in the middle east with year - round sunshine , some of the best hotels on the planet , and shopping opportunities to seriously damage the credit card
dubai : it 's still ' bling ' but the natural habitat of the mega-wealthy has a developing cultural underside because of this , i have always regarded this uae state as the natural habitat for the types of mega-wealthy who like to splash their cash ; premier league footballers , nightclub owners , rappers and reality tv stars - the rooneys and the cast of the only way is essex will continue to flock to dubai
lily allen was in town in november with the verve 's richard ashcroft to perform at dubai 's first - ever party in the park at the media city amphitheatre
and although lily allen was ordered to censor her lyrics - ' they told me to cover up and not swear ! ' she announced on stage - punters said the relaxed atmosphere , cool crowd and outdoor , grassy setting made the festival feel like dubai 's answer to glastonbury
lily allen performed at dubai 's first party in the park there is now the annual dubai international jazz festival
and work is also under way to build dubai 's first opera house in lagoons area
and with western shopping meccas bloomingdales and harvey nichols now established , and us emporium macy on the cards to open in the next few years , the retail scene also caters for more sophisticated customers
according to cressida meale , deputy editor of fashion magazine grazia middle east , there is even an underground fashion scene emerging in the city 's industrial area , al quoz
' there are also several trendy art galleries in this area
firstly the party scene has relocated an hour down the road to abu dhabi , thanks in part to the launch of the abu dhabi grand prix and ferrari world ( the world 's first theme park devoted to the italian motors )
now art , music and fashion events are near - weekly fixtures on the calendar
of course , all this has not stopped the partying - there 's just a more sophisticated crowd of revellers
branches of western nightclubs lead the way , starting with mayfair 's most famous one , mahiki
art exhibitions are on the rise such as the mojo art gallery in al quoz district in duba ( above ) since the club opened its doors in jumeirah beach hotel three years ago , movida and pacha have arrived too
