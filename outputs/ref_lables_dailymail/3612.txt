a new diet could more than halve a person 's risk of developing alzheimer 's disease , according to new research
the ' mediterranean-dash intervention for neurodegenerative delay ' ( mind ) diet includes at least three daily servings of wholegrains and salad â along with an extra vegetable and a glass of wine
the new diet could more than halve a person 's risk of developing alzheimer 's disease , new research has found , and even has an effect when a person does n't follow it meticulously these ' brain - healthy foods ' lowered the risk of alzheimer 's by 53 per cent in those who stuck to the diet rigidly
professor martha morris , a nutritional epidemiologist of the rush university medical centre in chicago , said : ' one of the more exciting things about this is that people who adhered even moderately to the mind diet had a reduction in their risk for alzheimer 's disease
wine is a ' healthy brain food ' , researchers said 10 healthy brain foods : green leafy vegetables other vegetables nuts berries beans wholegrains fish poultry olive oil wine 5 unhealthy brain foods : red meats butter and margarine cheese pastries and sweets fried or fast food some researchers have found that the two older diets provide protection against dementia as well
the mind diet has 15 components , including 10 ' brain - healthy food groups ' â green leafy vegetables , other vegetables , nuts , berries , beans , whole grains , fish , poultry , olive oil and wine
it also has five unhealthy groups that comprise red meats , butter and stick margarine , cheese , pastries and sweets , and fried or fast food
it also involves snacking most days on nuts and eating beans every other day or so , poultry and berries at least twice a week and fish at least once a week
dieters must limit eating the designated unhealthy foods , eating less than one tablespoon of butter a day and eating cheese , fried or fast food to less than once a week
limiting these foods is essential to have a real shot at avoiding the devastating effects of alzheimer 's , according to the study
the diet suggests 10 brain - healthy foods including wholegrains , salad , vegetables , berries , nuts , beans , olive oil , poultry and fish the mind diet was not an intervention in this study , however ; researchers looked at what people were already eating
participants earned points if they ate brain - healthy foods frequently and avoided unhealthy foods
the one exception was that participants got one point if they said olive oil was the primary oil used in their homes
the diet advises limiting butter to one tablespoon a day and limiting cheese , pastries , sweets and fast or friend food to once a week a total of 144 cases of alzheimer 's disease developed in this group of people
' in other words , it looks like the longer a person eats the mind diet , the less risk that person will have of developing alzheimer 's , professor morris said
' she added that the study did not establish a cause and effect relationship between the mind diet and a lowered risk of alzheimer 's
