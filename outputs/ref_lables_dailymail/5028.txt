wilfried zaha has admitted he felt â worthless â during his two - year spell as a manchester united player after his dream move to old trafford turned sour
the 22 - year - old winger was signed by then old trafford boss sir ferguson in january 2013 from palace for Â£ 10million
but the terms of the transfer saw him loaned straight back to the palace for the remainder of the season and he did not arrive at old trafford until the summer , by which time ferguson had retired and been replaced by moyes
wilfried zaha has rediscovered his form at palace this season during a disastrous campaign for the club under moyes , zaha made just four manchester united appearances before playing out the second half of last season at cardiff
zaha made just four appearances for manchester united in two years with the club â if you have played the game then it âs â well done â or â you should have passed here or there â
eventually he spoke to new manchester united boss louis van gaal , who confirmed that he was n't part of his first - team plans and so he headed back on a season - long loan deal to palace , where he flourished under alan pardew , and the deal was made permanent in february this year
