pouting and playing with her mother 's pearl necklace , sweden 's princess leonore looked distinctly out of sorts during a visit to the vatican
cradled in the arms of her pregnant mother , madeleine , 32 , the little girl was instead whisked off to meet pope
displeased : princess leonore looked less than impressed with her trip to the vatican madeleine , who wore a traditional lace mantilla for the occasion , is thought to be around six months pregnant with her second child and will give birth this summer
but before that happens , she has a busy schedule of events in and outside of sweden to complete - many with her british businessman husband christopher o'neill , 40 , by her side
the couple have recently returned to sweden after years spent living in new york , where princess leonore was born just over a year ago
the birth is likely to coincide with another big royal event , the wedding of madeleine 's older brother , prince carl philip , 35 , on the 13th june
hug from daddy : not even the ministrations of father christopher o'neill could raise a smile playing with pearls : leonore did find at least one distraction though - her mother 's pearls his bride - to - be , 30 - year - old sofia hellqvist , is a former glamour model - a career that was the source of controversy when the couple 's relationship was made public in january 2010
cheerful : princess madeleine was all smiles as she made her way into the vatican still cross : the baby was carried in for the audience by her father next in line : prince carl philip will marry fiancee sofia hellqvist in stockholm on the 13th june the relationship was controversial for a time , as queen queen silvia apparently did not entirely approve of the match
