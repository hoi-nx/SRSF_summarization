in 2018 , nasa will launch the orion spacecraft using the largest , most powerful rocket booster ever built ; the space launch system ( space launch system )
tucked inside the stage adapter - the ring connecting orion to the top propulsion stage of the space launch system - will be 11 self - contained small satellites , each about the size of a large shoebox
now , the space agency has revealed three missions that will use these small satellites during the test flight to help develop technologies for astronauts travelling to deep space
' the first is a nea ( nea ) scout , using solar sail propulsion , will fly by a small asteroid , taking pictures and making observations
biosentinel will use yeast to detect , measure , and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond low-earth orbit near - nea ( nea ) scout , using solar sail propulsion , will fly by a small asteroid , taking pictures and making observations
biosentinel will use yeast to detect , measure , and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond low-earth orbit
' a solar sail works best when deployed in deep space and space launch system will get us there , ' said les johnson , principal investigator for nea scout at marshall
lunar flashlight will use a large solar sail , similar to the nea scout sail , to reflect sunlight and illuminate the moon 's permanently shadowed craters and then the science instruments will measure the surface water ice
meanwhile , biosentinel will use yeast to detect , measure , and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond low-earth orbit
the biosentinel mission will be the first time living organisms have travelled to deep space in over 40 years and the spacecraft will operate in the deep space radiation environment throughout its 18 - month mission
the experiments will be launched by houston - based nasa in 2018 during a test flight of the orion spacecraft using the largest , most powerful rocket booster ever built ; the space launch system the missions are a key part of the historic test flight , dubbed exploration mission-1
they will essentially piggyback on the space launch system flight , providing what otherwise would be costly access to deep space
