by the time he reached 17 , there was no room for geoff johnson at home
his mother started compulsively hoarding when he was a young boy , refusing to trash anything ; unable to fix anything
now , two decades later , he and his younger sister jennifer mcshea have returned to the family home in omaha , nebraska - and nothing has changed
geoff johnson , 37 , had visited his mother but only stood outside before picking her up to spend time elsewhere
jennifer mcshea , also 37 , returned just twice , on the advice of her counselor , to confront the deeply - embedded shame she felt
but when their mother passed away following a 12 - year battle with breast cancer in 2013 , the house was handed to them
finally returning to the meticulous havoc , they were inspired to create a moving photo - series with their own children to document the reality of being a hoarder 's child
he did this by superimposing shots of his son onto images of the trash - ridden home in omaha ' no place for a child ' : his younger sister jennifer mcshea , also aged 37 , joined him as they confronted their past after their mother died of breast cancer in 2013
jennifer mcshea 's four - year - old daughter is superimposed onto a shot of the bathroom which has not been touched since they left in 1993 geoff johnson , a photographer , wanted to picture his son and jennifer mcshea 's daughter going about their daily lives among the trash - as they had done years before
but the crumbling house is so unsafe , and their feelings still so raw , that they opted to use photoshop and superimpose the children onto the images
regardless , the highly realistic results strike an uneasy feeling that geoff johnson says was so difficult to come to terms with
' it is difficult to describe the feeling of shame , the fear of embarrassment that you have growing up with a hoarder , ' geoff johnson , who is still based nearby in omaha , tells dailymail.com
hoarders have a deep - rooted sense of attachment to things and it seems crazy but they have a sense of order
' it 's a complex issue ' : geoff johnson said people have since asked him why they did n't just throw things away
he said the issue was deeper than that and his mother had a deep - rooted attachment to every little piece of the havoc
but as a child it was difficult to understand ' sense of perspective ' : jennifer mcshea said the pictures have helped her to see that the home she felt so uncomfortable in was no place for children jennifer mcshea 's bedroom : jennifer mcshea made clear that she did not want the children to enter the crumbling house , which is filled with mold , as it is unsafe and also occupies a difficult emotional space for her
it was the hardest thing i had had to do in my life up until that point and i could n't take it any more , ' he said ' things would break and never be fixed
we did n't have a working refrigerator - we would leave food on the back porch in the winter , and get a cooler in the summer , but that would break too
' jennifer mcshea was already long - gone by that point
just 19 months younger than geoff johnson , she left when she was 15 in 1993 , to live with their father in the same village
feeling of shame : in this image ( left ) geoff johnson is recreating the way he would hide behind the door when people came to visit , and never let people come to visit
jennifer mcshea returned to the house when she finished college on the advice of her counselor to confront the feeling of shame unmoved : they photographed the scene completely untouched when they returned to clean it up after their mother passed away the moment they returned together was important for them , they said
