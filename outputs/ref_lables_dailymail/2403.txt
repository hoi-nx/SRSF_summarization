if the team with momentum hold an ace card heading into the play - offs , then watch out for wolves
jackett âs team moved into sixth place in the championship with a fourth successive victory after edwards , the substitute , headed home two minutes from the end of an unpredictable and thrilling game
pre-match results had offered wolves a prospective route into the play - off zone , with brentford and ipswich town dropping points unexpectedly , and jackett reflected the burgeoning confidence within molineux by naming an unchanged starting line - up from the side that prevailed 2 - 1 at nottingham forest on friday for a third successive victory
wolves substitute edwards races away in celebration after scoring a late winner edwards is congratulated by his wolves team - mates following his 88th - minute winner against leeds wolves striker afobe slides on his knees after scoring his side 's third goal of the afternoon wolves ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : ikeme ; iorfa , batth , richard stearman , golbourne ; henry ( van la parra 78mins ) , mcdonald , jack price , sako ; afobe , dicko ( edwards 70 ) subs not used : kuszczak , doherty , doyle , ebanks-landell , hause booked : golbourne , batth goals : dicko 19 , 45 , afobe 48 , edwards 88 leeds ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : marco silvestri ; scott wootton , bamba , cooper , berardi ; murphy ; byram , phillips , mowatt , taylor 11 ; antenucci ( sharp 82 ) subs not used : taylor 11 , ngoyi , cani , doukara , sloth , del fabro booked : wooton , byram , bamba goal : taylor 11 , batth og 65 , mowatt 74 referee : david coote attendance : 25,169 with a day less to recover , leeds had also been on a decent run before saturday âs 3 - 0 home defeat by blackburn rovers topped another distressing chapter in their tumultuous recent history
still , it was leeds who struck the first blow , courtesy of a poor defensive clearance from mcdonald who , penned back towards his own corner flag by debutant phillips , attempted a loose clearance that cannoned off richard stearman , his own team - mate , for charlie taylor to sidefoot under ikeme
mowatt looks delighted after putting leeds back on level terms by scoring his side 's third goal wolves goalkeeper ikeme dives in vain as mowatt makes it 3 - 3 before edwards ' late winner leeds attempted to disrupt wolves â rhythm with some fiercely competitive tackling , phillips receiving one caution for fouling mcdonald then fortunate not to be dismissed for a foul that ripped holes in the former sheffield united midfielder âs sock
the home side started to put together the pieces of their flowing passing game as half - time approached however and , in stoppage time , leeds conceded at what appeared to be the worst time
sako kept play alive , dropping the ball back for batth , whose shot hit dicko but fell back for afobe to smash in his tenth goal for wolves
leeds looked as if they might capitulate at this stage before wolves offered them a lifeline back into the game in the 66th minute
