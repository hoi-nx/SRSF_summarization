after almost 70 years working in the gossip and entertainment industry , legendary writer and columnist smith is naming names
the 92 - year - old , who started her career in new york city when she was just 25 , is sharing a few big scoops that were too scandalous to print over the course of her storied career at papers including the post and new york daily news
the gossip columnist claims she advised diller , the chairman of media company iac , against it , telling him ; ' no , diller , david geffen needs to come out
' the ' women ' smith was referring to is actually just woman : famed fashion designer and creator of the wrap dress , diane von furstenberg , whom smith says diller ' worships
barbara walters ( above ) was a good friend claims smith , but lost interest in the gossip writer when her newspaper column at the post was cut smith , a lesbian , has been with her partner iris love ( above ) for years this outing of diller comes as a bit of a surprise , especially after smith herself was outed by new york city publicist bobby zarem , who once mailed invitations to members of the media and social register alike announcing that she and longtime partner iris love were tying the knot
the rumors became so prevalent following smith 's blind item that winfrey eventually did publicly come out - as heterosexual
it seems smith also has somewhat tense relationships with even her closest friends , including iconic television news journalist barbara walters
' well , it turns out barbara walters can do without me , though i still consider her a friend , ' reveals smith
but when i lost my column and my power , she kind of lost interest in me
' smith says that two of her closest friends were former texas governor ann richard ( left ) and broadway legend elaine stritch ( right ) smith has a few hollywood friends , among them renee zellwegger , helen mirren and winfrey - but it is three women who are no longer alive that she seems to have been closest to
elizabeth taylor and smith became friends at the beginning of their respective careers
smith , who says she ' loved ' elizabeth taylor , also became close with the actress ' longtime partner richard burton , and she credits that relationship and the access it allowed her with helping to catapult her career
her other two lifelong pals were texas governor ann richard , who smith said ' elected herself to be my best friend , ' and broadway legend elaine stritch
' none of her relationships however may be more interesting then the one she shares with fellow new york city bette midler , and which began when the young singer called her up to let her know how upset she was that smith had revealed she was dating an up and coming artist barry manilow
' she called me up , furious , saying , " i do n't want to be in your f * * * ing column ! " which was an odd thing to hear from someone just starting a career in show business , ' says smith
smith 's pal bette midler ( above ) used her pull to get a new york city park named after the writer and while that is all well and good , smith is still a little steamed from what she perceives as one very major slight
lee radziwill , known by most as the sister of jackie kennedy but some as the mother - in - law of real housewives of new york star and author radziwill , landed on smith 's bad side when she refused to help their friend truman capote after he was taken to court by vidal
radziwill had shared the story with truman capote , one of her closest friends , but refused to acknowledge that during the trial
as for radziwill , her response to it all was ; ' oh , smith , what do we care ; they 're just a couple of f * * s ! they 're disgusting
smith names lee radziwill ( left with sister jackie kennedy ) as one of her least favorite people after she called their friend truman capote ( right ) a ' fag ' the current crop of hollywood stars are also of little interest to smith , save taylor swift
