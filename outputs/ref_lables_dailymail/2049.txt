the woolly mammoth became extinct as a result of crippling bone disease that left them unable to fend off predators , according to startling new evidence from russia
but now a new theory is set to re-write the history books after the examination of more than 23,500 mammoth bones found them riddled with osteoporosis and lacking in calcium
dr leshchinsky , the head of the laboratory of mesozoic and cenozoic continental eco-systems , said : ' in some collections that we examined almost 100 per cent of the bones ( pictured ) had signs of osteoporosis ' the major mineral deficiency - which came from the impact of rising temperatures on soil and water - resulted in them breaking their limbs and spines , and left them unable to walk
in turn it meant the giant animal , which stood 10ft ( three metres ) high , eventually collapsed to the ground and could not forage for food , or flee hunters
he spent a decade analysing bone and teeth samples from mammoths that roamed western europe and russia between 10,000 and 30,000 years ago
until now it was thought that the woolly mammoth simply died out from post-ice age climate change and being hunted to extinction by early man ( analysis of bones at mammoth ' graveyard ' pictured ) one mammoth graveyard where many bones have been found is in lugovskoe , russia shown is a young mammoth jaw riddled with bone disease
according to the siberian times , the new evidence was uncovered by dr leshchinsky , from tomsk state university the deficiency in calcium - which came from the impact of rising temperatures on soil and water - resulted in mammoths breaking their bones ( example pictured ) limbs and spines , leaving them unable to walk since the 1700s scientists have debated what caused the demise of mammoths
one popular theory , bolstered by this study , is that ice age people hunted most of the mammoths out of existence
other researchers argue that an impact of extraterritorial objects in north america 13,000 years ago , led to rapid climate change , eventually wiping out the mammoths
but now a new theory - osteoperosis - might need to be added to the list
however , others say they lived long past this era and were finally hunted to death by early humans , with remains found in the russia arctic showing they existed just 3,700 years ago
the research , if proven true , would provide a somewhat unusual explanation for how woolly mammoths died out experts spent a decade analysing bone and teeth samples from mammoths ( ' graveyard ' pictured ) that roamed western europe and russia between 10,000 and 30,000 years ago dr leshchinsky , who wrote about his findings in the archaeological and anthropological sciences journal , added : ' the articular surfaces of the limb bones in some specimens were not just damaged , they were mutilated with disease
