john helm was commentating on bradford âs game against lincoln when the fire broke out and still struggles to listen to his description of that fatal day
here he gives his insight into what caused the blaze
it was a day i have often tried to forget , but it was the one i must always remember
approaching the 30th anniversary of the bradford fire , it was inevitable i would be asked to recall the horrific images from a match i was commentating on for yorkshire television
what i did not expect was for someone to suggest the fire may not have been an accident , as martin has done with his book fifty-six , the story of the bradford fire
the tragic fire at bradford 's valley parade stadium claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on may 11 , 1985 martin lost three generations of his family and has a right to speak his mind â any bitterness would be understandable â but from everything i have been told there is nât a jot of evidence to suggest the blaze was caused deliberately
on the contrary , i remember the coroner telling me it was obvious how the fire had started
there is nât a shred of evidence to suggest anything other than a terrible human tragedy
â a memorial at valley parade pays tribute those who died in the devastating blaze almost 30 years ago we all have our memories of a day that still sends a shudder up my spine
