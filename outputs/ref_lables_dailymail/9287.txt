archaeologists have uncovered a ritual burial of 2,000 - year - old human skulls - sparking the theory they could be the remains of boudicca 's rebels - as the crossrail excavations continue
the latest discovery of cremated human bones packed neatly into a cooking pot and set off at the side of the historic river walbrook , in crossrail , has experts questioning whether they were part of a gruesome ceremony
when about 20 skulls were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary in 2013 it had been thought that they had got there down stream after being eroded out of a roman cemetery to the north - but new evidence suggests otherwise
a piece of roman figurative pottery ( right ) was also dug up during searches of the site digging for history : a cross-section of the roman roadside ditch uncovered at liverpool street station the estimated age of the human remains and the way they appear to have been disposed of has led to the suggestion that the bones could even be boudicca 's rebels
scientific tests are continuing on the cremated remains , with the possibility the grim ritual theory may be confirmed and that most of the seven skulls found so far are heads of executed criminals and rebels
' the boudiccan revolt raged from 60 - 61ad and saw uk tribes , under boudicca of the iceni , unsuccessfully try to defeat the roman army
boudicca was queen of the iceni people , a uk tribe who lived in what is today norfolk and parts of suffolk and cambridgeshire

the crossrail team spokesman said a connection was not currently being made between the skulls from 2,000 years ago and boudicca 's rebels but the possibility has not been ruled out
work to excavate 3,000 skeletons from bedlam burial ground , at the site of the new liverpool street that will serve the cross-london rail network , has now been completed
it took a team of 60 archaeologists four weeks , working six days a week , to remove the remains and record evidence for what may prove to be , in archaeological terms , crossrail 's most valuable 16th and 17th century cemetery site
among the skeletons discovered at the burial site - used from 1569 until at least 1738 , including the great plague in 1665 - were a mother a her child buried side - by - side
