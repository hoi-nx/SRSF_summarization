sterling is earning less than mario balotelli
in fact he 's earning less than half of what mario balotelli is on at liverpool
for rodgers ' sake whoever is in charge of sorting out sterling 's new contract this summer needs to get it right
sterling 's contract negotiations have dominated the headlines in the past fortnight sterling shares a laugh in training ahead of liverpool 's fa cup replay with blackburn on wednesday mario balotelli earns more than double sterling at present despite failing to perform in a liverpool shirt sterling 's agent has been accused of giving him bad advice
apparently what people want his agent to tell him is that he 's not particularly good , he 's too young to earn big money , and he should sign whatever contract liverpool offer him because he should be grateful just to even be there
it 's that liverpool , through rodgers , have repeatedly told the press and the fans that there would be no problem and sterling would sign the new deal
liverpool boss rodgers has always insisted that the sterling talks would be concluded soon sterling has been linked with a move to arsenal , admitting he was ' flattered ' by their interest rodgers has repeatedly insisted that sterling will not be moving anywhere this summer liverpool find themselves seven points adrift in the race for the champions league places rodgers has said things there he had no right to say , but those assurances he gave have now served to make sterling and his agent out to be the bad guys
the ' incredible ' deal was actually an offer which put sterling on a par with mario balotelli
liverpool should be embarrassed by that offer to sterling , a player who kept quiet last summer when he watched adam lallana , dejan lovren and mario balotelli all walk through the door and sign deals worth more than double what he was on
adam lallana has been hindered by injuries since he arrived at anfield from southampton last summer dejan lovren also arrived at liverpool from southampton in the summer and earns more than sterling the departure of gerrard to the mls this summer will free up space on liverpool 's wage bill meantime rodgers said there would be no issue with sterling signing again , so when it turned out there was a problem , sterling was instantly the bad guy , along with his agent
' if people want to believe all that it 's up to them , but it wo n't alter these facts : gerrard and glen johnson are set to leave this summer which will free up a huge amount of the wages budget at anfield
philippe coutinho would provide an alternative should sterling depart anfield in the summer the emergence of teenage winger jordon ibe also suggests there could be life beyond sterling at liverpool sterling should be playing champions league football - something liverpool may not offer next season gerrard knows all about contract situations not being addressed , and that 's why he said two months ago that the club need to sort out the futures of sterling and henderson ' before it 's too late '
ramping up the hate towards a young english player who wants to play in the champions league and wants to earn significantly more than a total waste of space like mario balotelli will hopefully now be seen for what it is â a way of deflecting from the real issues at anfield
seriously - imagine if real madrid do want sterling this summer , as liverpool prepare for a europa league campaign
