boss tim sherwood backed christian benteke to fire aston villa to safety after the striker 's crucial hat - trick saved a point against qpr
the forward 's treble - his first in two years - clinched a pulsating 3 - 3 draw with their drop rivals as aston villa edged further clear of the bottom three
aston villa are three points above the premier league drop zone and denied qpr the chance to leapfrog them in the table
christian benteke scored a stunning hat - trick as aston villa drew 3 - 3 against qpr manager tim sherwood said that christian benteke can fire aston villa to premier league safety defeat would have left aston villa in the relegation zone and behind qpr but christian benteke struck a 25 - yard free - kick with seven minutes left to save them and complete his treble
the belgium international has seven goals in seven games under tim sherwood and the boss hopes he can maintain his form to keep aston villa up
' but tim sherwood insisted aston villa should have won after christian benteke 's first - half double , cancelling out matt phillips ' opener , gave them a 2 - 1 lead at the break
he said : ' it 's disappointing when you dominate a football match like that , the ref should have stopped it at half - time
qpr were only ahead for three minutes in the first half after christian benteke equalised for the hosts at villa park christian benteke drove beyond rob green from the edge of the box to net his seventh goal of the season early on ' i thought we tired in the second half but that 's to be expected and two of those back four have trained about four times in eight weeks
' qpr hit back after the break through clint hill and austin , the latter netting with just 12 minutes left
they have taken four points from their last two away games after winning just once on the road this season before saturday 's 4 - 1 win at west brom
christian benteke 's added two more , including this wonder free - kick - much like jason puncheon 's on monday night ' i thought we could ( hang on ) but a free - kick is a free - kick , at that stage most of their attacking options had been exhausted
' qpr were seeking back - to - back away wins in the top flight for the first time since 1995 but ramsey targeted home victories to keep them up
