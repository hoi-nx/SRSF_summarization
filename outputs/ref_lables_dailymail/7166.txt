temple 's bitter ex-husband tried to derail her appointment to a diplomatic post by calling her ' emotionally unstable ' during her fbi background check john agar told an agent in 1969 to think twice because temple would ' overreact if she did n't get her way '
his efforts were unsuccessful as dozens of other people including reagan came to temple 's defense and called her a ' very courageous woman of the highest morals '
the couple married when she was 17 and were photographed ( above ) two years later the claims were revealed in fbi files obtained by daily mail online through freedom of information requests
temple was a child star whose career began at three ; she became the biggest actress in american in the 1930s and raked in an unheard of $ 50,000 a film after the success of movies like bright eyes and curly top
her career ran until she was 22 at which point she began doing charity work and became well known for her republican views , running unsuccessfully for a house seat in california in 1967
in 1969 president richard nixon wanted to appoint her to the post of american representative to the un so the fbi carried out a full background check , which included everything from her credit history to interviews with former teachers
among those the agents spoke to was john agar , temple 's first husband who she married at 17 and divorced in 1950 at the age of 22 after they had a daughter together
when the fbi agent came to speak with john agar , the file states he told them that he had not been in contact with his ex-wife at all since they split up two decades before
president reagan , who was governor of california at the time , gave a statement through his assistant that temple was a friend of his for 25 years and that she had served on the state advisory hospital council
political : richard nixon had known temple long before he was president
richard nixon was running for president and temple a staunch republican loyal : temple with her second husband charles black
fbi background reports said that they had a strong marriage and that she was a committed patriot rescuer : reagan had appeared alongside temple in that hagen girl in 1947
he was california 's governor when he and others endorsed her for office during fbi background checks , unlike her ex-husband he said that he had the ' utmost trust and confidence ' in her abilities and that he considers her ' loyalty , morals , character , reputation and associates to be beyond reproach '
friends : temple was a friend of richard nixon , who nominated her for the american ambassadorship to the un , and of j edgar hoover , whose agency was asked to investigated her background family life : temple became a full - time mother to her children ( from left ) susan agar , whose father was her first husband , and charles jr and lori , by her second husband charles black ( right ) devoted : temple and her second husband charles black
the fbi file is very much a product of its time and calls temple an ' unemployed housewife except when she worked as an actress '
the file claims that temple and fbi director j edgar hoover were friends and says that agents were not to conduct neighborhood surveillance on her ' unless the need arises ' , and only with approval of their superiors at the bureau
she died last year aged 85 having been married to her second husband charles black until his death in 2005
