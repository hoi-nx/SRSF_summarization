carver has called on the advice and support of former newcastle managers alan shearer and alan pardew as tensions grow between the club and its fanbase
supporters are planning to boycott today âs game at home to spurs in protest at what they see as a lack of investment and ambition from owner mike ashley
carver was in the dugout alongside alan pardew at the end of last season when fans again expressed their discontent during a 3 - 0 victory over cardiff
alan pardew was booed every time he ventured to the touchline amid a toxic atmosphere inside st james â park
newcastle boss carver is under pressure and has asked for advice from some of his predecessors alan pardew was in charge of newcastle from 2010 to january this year , when he left for crystal palace former newcastle striker alan shearer , the club 's record goal - scorer , also had a brief stint as manager newcastle fans are planning to protest against owner mike ashley for a perceived lack of ambition sunday 's protests will take place outside of the stadium , but carver â who , in fairness , has been left with a depleted and disinterested squad - could nonetheless find himself the target should his side fall to a sixth straight defeat
carver , though , accepts that he must take criticism and has spoken to the likes of alan pardew and close friend alan shearer , who was relegated as boss in 2009 , for words of encouragement
â carver , meanwhile , does not expect a repeat of the poison of 12 months ago when they take on spurs
