an iowa lottery worker is accused of manipulating the system to try and collect a $ 14.3million payday
eddie raymond tipton , 51 , of norwalk , iowa , was originally charged with two felony counts of fraud when he was arrested in january for illegally playing the lottery and having a friend collect his prize , but now prosecutors say he used an intricate system to make sure he would win
they argue he installed a self - destructing hack program to make sure the random number generator selected his number in december 2010 , and that he tampered with security cameras in the building so he would not be caught installing the program
authorities had been trying to identify the winner of the $ 14.3 million hot lotto ticket since a new york lawyer tried to claim the prize shortly before the one - year deadline in 2011
as for why he is never seen on the security camera installing this kit , prosecutors claim the cameras were programmed to change the way they record that day , and that eddie raymond tipton was one of five people that could do this
robert clark rhodes , who tried to claim the ticket , was arrested in march and also charged with two counts of fraud .
