afoa , 33 , of puyallup , washington , was operating a tug to push aircraft at seattle-tacoma international airport when the brakes and steering failed , causing him to crash into a luggage lift
the incident , which took place at 2am on december 26 , 2007 , left afoa unable to use his legs or right arm
afoa went on to sue port of seattle - which owns and operates the seattle-tacoma international airport - in king county superior court , saying that the company failed to maintain a safe workplace
closure : an airport worker has been awarded $ 40 million in compensation for a freak runway accident which left him paralyzed from the waist down more than seven years ago but for years the case was locked in the courts because the port of seattle claimed it was n't liable for what happened as afoa worked for a private firm
in a bid to move things forward , the state supreme court finally ruled in 2013 that the airport had a ' duty ' to provide a safe working environment
on tuesday a king county jury awarded afoa $ 40 million because of what the incident has done to his life
