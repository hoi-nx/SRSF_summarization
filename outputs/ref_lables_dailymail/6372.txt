u.s. authorities suspected that uk man sarao ( circled ) accused this week of causing the 2010 ' flash crash ' was making illicit trades back in 2009 u.s. prosecutors believe mr sarao used special computer software to manipulate the market on wall street ' flash crash ' : sarao is accused of causing the wall street ' flash crash ' on may 6 , 2010 , when Â£ 570billion ( $ 850 billion ) was wiped from the value of u.s. 's biggest companies in five minutes sarao was warned about his trading in 2009 by officials at the self - regulatory cme ( cme ) , where he was making transactions
however , he continued his alleged manipulation well into this year
he said : ' how this continued for six years when the cme appeared to know about it , it kind of boggles my mind
' edgar perez , author of knightmare on wall street and the speed traders , meanwhile , asked : ' why would regulators let sarao operate in the markets and engage in similar trading strategies as in the flash crash eight more times ? ' sarao allegedly triggered â from his home computer in hounslow , west london â the wall street ' flash crash ' of may 2010 , in which almost a trillion dollars was wiped from global share prices , using a series of fake transactions
trader sarao , 36 , is shown here at westminster magistrates ' court after being arrested over illicit trading a flash crash is a sudden plunge in stock prices
but , by 3.07pm , the market had miraculously regained most of the 600 - point drop â making the flash crash the second - largest point swing ever recorded
however , manipulation was n't identified as the cause of the crash in a september 2010 report , suggesting that regulators did not see his activity at that time
tim massad , the head of the cftc , which oversees the trading of futures and swaps , said on wednesday that it took so long to charge sarao because of the size and complexity of u.s. derivatives markets
' the agency , which oversees self - regulatory bodies such as the cme , brought civil charges against sarao alongside criminal charges by the department of justice
the many years it took for the cftc to come out with its findings , and the fact that manipulation was n't mentioned in the 2010 report , suggested that the help of a whistleblower was essential in bringing the charges , one lawyer said
