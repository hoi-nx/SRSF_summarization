come the end of this season , mackay âs tenure at wigan might just be remembered as one of the costliest appointments in the history of english football
and after failing to secure a single win at home in six months in charge â culminating in a woeful 2 - 0 defeat by derby on monday â mackay would certainly shoulder much of the blame for that
mackay 's tenure at wigan came to an end on monday following a 2 - 0 defeat by derby sportsmail revealed in august mackay was being investigated over ' sexist , racism and homophobic ' texts whelan ( right ) appointed mackay ( left ) as manager of wigan in november 2014 despite the warnings 19 - points taken from mackay 's 24 matches in charge of wigan - five wins , four draws and 15 defeats 0 - number of home games won by mackay 's wigan from 13 attempts - 10 of these ended in defeat 20.8 - mackay 's win percentage with wigan since taking over in november but whelan will also have to accept that his misguided decision to appoint the controversial scot in the first place has cost him his reputation and seriously harmed the image of a fine football club too
but whelan demonstrated how little regard he had for an fa investigation into an exchange of racist , sexist , homophobic and anti-semitic messages between mackay and his former cardiff colleague , iain moody , by not only appointing him but then trying to justify the decision with some deeply offensive remarks of his own
wigan are eight points from safety with only five games remaining , after all
this is how sportsmail 's chief sports reporter matt lawton revealed the investigation in august 2014 sportsmail led the way with the exclusive story about mackay and his cardiff colleague iain moody mackay was appointed manager of wigan in november 2014 but has arguably harmed the football club whelan 's appointment of mackay did little good for the club as they face relegation from the championship how the championship table currently shapes up but it might have become an awful lot more uncomfortable before it got better , irrespective of where wigan finish up in the championship
as sportsmail revealed last month , an fa investigation first launched last august â with the publication of the textgate scandal messages in this newspaper â was close to being concluded in february
the fa had already spent months wrestling with the issue of private and public communication , and whether they could charge an individual when the emails and text messages were exchanged between mackay and iain moody in their capacity as manager and head of recruitment at cardiff
reports that suggested mackay and iain moody were likely to escape punishment prompted more witnesses to come forward , however , with individuals mackay might have considered allies among those to have submitted fresh information
and hours before the scot was sacked he talked up wigan âs chances of championship survival , despite overseeing a 10th home defeat in 13 matches
