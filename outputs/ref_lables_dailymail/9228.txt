last week mr andy erlam led four ordinary voters who defied threats , financial â ruin and official apathy to have lutfur rahman unseated from office by an electoral court
lutfur rahman - who police afraid of being branded ' racist ' failed to charge - was found guilty of rigging his election for mayor in may 2014 by a systematic campaign to steal votes
yesterday mr andy erlam , 64 , a retired film maker , said : â ' since last week , many people have asked me to stand
' unless someone stands up to it , there is a danger that lutfur rahman 's cronyism and corruption will just continue in another form
â rahman , branded a ' pathological liar ' and cheat who ' played the race card on every occasion ' by electoral judge richard mawrey qc , diverted millions of pounds from groups like the alzheimer 's society to muslim organisations , some with extremist links
he was branded a ' pathological liar ' and a cheat happy to ' play the race card ' at every turn andy erlam ( centre ) was one of four petitioners including angela moffat ( left ) and azmal hussein ( right ) who accused lutfur rahman of electoral fraud
' mr andy erlam has criticised the met for ' not investigating election fraud properly , protecting lutfur rahman and for its failure to , even now , launch a serious investigation at the town hall
' â in court last week , the judge hailed the â enormous courage â of tower hamlets residents mr andy erlam , 64 , angela moffat , 47 , azmal hussein , 63 , and debbie simone , 44
