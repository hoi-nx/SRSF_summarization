britain bucked the trend of western nations by increasing spending on foreign aid last year while others imposed savage cuts
more than half the members of a group of 28 industrialised nations reduced their aid budget between 2013 and 2014 , a report found
britain 's failure to follow suit â thanks to a target imposed by cameron â means that its overseas aid spending of 0.7 per cent of national income is double the average level of the other nations in the group known as the dac
a target set by cameron ( pictured at a rally this week ) has left britain unable to follow other countries in reducing their aid budget between 2013 and 2014 out of every Â£ 100 spent by these western nations on overseas aid , no less than Â£ 14 now comes from the britain
despite this , the britain increased its spend by 1.2 per cent to Â£ 11.7billion in 2014
australia cut its foreign aid by 7.2 per cent to Â£ 2.5billion , while cash - strapped spain cut its funding by 20.3 per cent to Â£ 1.1billion
the britain 's aid budget is now nearly double france 's and ten times the level in spain
in total , 15 members of the dac cut foreign aid , including belgium , italy , norway , poland and portugal
' britain 's aid budget may need to rise by at least Â£ 500million in future years , because changes in eu accounting rules make it harder to meet the 0.7 per cent target
the oecd report , 2014 global outlook on aid , shows that britain is one of only five members of the dac to meet the target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income on aid along with sweden , luxembourg , norway and denmark
in monetary terms , the britain now has the second highest aid budget in the world behind the us which spends Â£ 19.6billion
max lawson , of oxfam , praised britain and criticised countries which have cut their aid budgets
