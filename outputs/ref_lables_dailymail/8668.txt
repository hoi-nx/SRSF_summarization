it is just 12 weeks since bold claims were emanating from an ultra-confident united dressing room that this season could yield an unprecedented domestic treble
â i believe we can win all three trophies , â trumpeted goalkeeper radoslaw cierzniak
â on wednesday night against united at dens park , however , those carefree early january days seemed so long ago as radoslaw cierzniak âs grip of the ball for stewart âs opening goal proved as tight as his grasp on footballing reality
united manager mcnamara is under pressure following his side 's recent slump united failed to get their hands on the league cup as they fell to a 2 - 0 defeat by celtic premiership outfit united have failed to win any of their last 10 games as united slumped to a first derby defeat in 11 years , the loss at dens park saw mcnamara âs team make it 10 matches without a win
yet as united have dropped like a stone from early - season table - toppers to potentially even missing out on europe , the fallout has come amid an increasingly acrid war of words surrounding revelations about mcnamara âs entitlement to a cut from outgoing player sales
those close to tannadice speak of a series of damaging schisms developing on all sides between fans , board and manager ; cumulatively casting increased uncertainty over mcnamara âs future
ahead of the annual general meeting of influential supporters â group arabtrust , one leading fan told sportsmail of â overwhelming unhappiness â with mcnamara âs bonus , while his recruitment and tactical nous are also being questioned
there is , he added , a growing belief among fans that the manager âs position is â untenable â
as furious fans pointed out , had nât thomson used the eve of last may âs scottish cup final defeat by st johnstone to declare tannadice finances to be their finest since 1986 and vow there would be no player exodus , as occurred after the scottish cup win in 2010 under peter houston ? united sold armstrong ( left ) to celtic during the january transfer window mackay-steven also sealed a winter move to celtic on transfer deadline day the tannadice supremo even went as far as name - checking armstrong along with gauld and robertson as players he would like to keep for â at least another year â to help â compete â with celtic
yet parting with armstrong and mackay-steven just 48 hours after reaching a league cup final against a celtic side thompson had vowed to â compete â with proved particularly painful for the rank and file
â i thought it was a strange decision , i must admit , â said former united defender and bbc analyst mark wilson recently
â united were in touching distance of celtic and if you are serious about challenging , then you can sell him in june
â i read mcnamara saying he wanted to keep both players but that they needed to balance the books
â at first , united closed ranks to slap down their detractors , reacting with an almost weary derision to anyone questioning the wisdom of selling key players at such a crucial part of the season
indeed , it was argued that , together , the duo started just three of united âs first nine games of the campaign , of which mcnamara âs side won seven , drew one and lost one

united continue to deny the figures in question but eventually made the bombshell confirmation that mcnamara was indeed entitled to a cut of player transfers
amid this poor run , st johnstone defender frazer wright recently claimed that if mcnamara âs men fall behind , â it gets in their heads â and they â argue amongst themselves â

not least heffernan , who , as a hibs player , was impressed by united in a thrilling 3 - 3 draw at easter road in the league cup in october before mcnamara âs side sneaked through on penalties
â i âm sure the fans would love us to finish above united â and it âs all to play for , â said the irish striker , who scored the third in united âs 3 - 1 win at dens on wednesday night

â ending that run against united was a big motivating factor â and i felt that was the best i âve seen us play , â said heffernan
but , for the sake of the fans who have nât witnessed a win over united for such a long time , it was really important
