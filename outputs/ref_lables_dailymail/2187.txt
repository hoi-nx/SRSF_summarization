creamer has called for a masters tournament for women at augusta
creamer , who won the 2010 women 's us open , first floated the idea on twitter following jordan spieth 's stunning victory at the masters on april 14 stating : ' i hope masters will consider a women 's masters soon
fastest area of golf growth is women ! # 6majors ? ' in the lead up to this week 's swinging skirts lpga classic in northern california , creamer suggested a women 's event could be staged the week following the men 's showpiece in april
creamer plays her third shot on the 14th hole during the lpga lotte championship on april 17 ' i think the patrons and everybody would love to have two weeks there , two tournaments
there 's no reason why we ca n't do that in women 's golf
definitely women 's golf deserves something like that
