blue bell announced friday that it has suspended operations at an oklahoma production facility that officials had previously connected to a foodborne illness linked to the deaths of three people
last month , the company and health officials said a 3 - ounce cup of ice cream contaminated with listeriosis was traced to a plant in broken arrow , oklahoma
' we recommend that consumers do not eat any blue bell brand products made at the company 's oklahoma facility and that retailers and institutions do not sell or serve them , ' the u.s. cdc said late friday
officials determined at least four drank milkshakes that contained blue bell ice cream
listeriosis , also known as listeria , is a life - threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called listeria monocytogenes the disease primarily affects pregnant women , newborns , older adults and people with weakened immune systems
the cdc also said friday that it has identified six patients with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 that was indistinguishable from that found in the 3 - ounce cup ice cream product traced to the oklahoma plant
the one patient for whom information is available reported eating ice cream in a texas hospital before developing listeriosis and the texas department of state health services reported the hospital had received blue bell brand ice cream cups , the cdc said
