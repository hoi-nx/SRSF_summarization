simon wood , 38 , from oldham won masterchef last friday wannabe chefs with their eye on a career as the next gordon ramsay or jamie oliver should take note - it does n't have to cost a fortune
the new winner of masterchef simon wood , who won the title last friday , has n't been on a single cookery course or even had one lesson
everything the 38 year old knows about cooking is self - taught - learnt form reading recipe books or watching television shows
he told mailonline : ' it âs all self - taught
' i also found out a lot from watching chefs when i go to a restaurant - you go into a lot of restaurants these days and you can see straight into the kitchen
' while simon wood , who lives in oldham , learns about his cooking from reading and watching programmes , he sharpens his skills by practicing on his four children - liam , 20 , alex , 18 , cameron , 16 , and charlotte , seven
the lucky children are often on the receiving end of their father 's culinary masterpieces - in the simon wood household lunchboxes can become works of art. he said : ' they only get fancy stuff in their lunch boxes when i âm practising
' all of my kids like different things , so it can be like a gourmet buffet sometimes when you âre at my house
' everyone wants something different , someone wants fish , and someone else wants shellfish - if it âs in the fridge or freezer it âs likely to come out at some point or another
the couple met while working at mcdonalds and when he was just 19 , they had their first child - liam
simon wood as an eight year old after winning the chance to spend a day in a hotel kitchen the hours that chefs do are notoriously antisocial and so simon wood decided to take up a career in it instead
his children are over the moon that their father is now following his dream though and they watched the masterchef final on tv together last friday , when they learnt for the first time that their father had won - because it had to be kept a secret until the programme aired
he said : ' when we watched it together , it was the first time that they found out i had won and it was emotional , it was pretty overwhelming
' simon wood has come a long way since the beginning of the show - in the first episode he was so terrified that greg , who is one of the judges on the show , pointed out that he was actually ' shaking in his trainers '
simon wood said : ' when you first go in there on day one , when you see john and greg for the first time , they âre practically idols of yours and you âve not met them before that
' but simon wood managed to overcome his nerves and was noted as one of the contestants who had grown the most over the course of the show
he won the final with a starter of octopus , with chorizo crisps and a cannellini bean and chorizo salad ; his main course was pigeon with carrots , pommes parisienne and a cassis jus ; and for the pudding he produced a lemon posset , with citrus tutti - frutti
simon wood was noted as one of the contestants who had grown the most over the course of the show he said : ' you grow so quickly when you âre down there
' for anyone looking to follow simon wood 's success , he has one simple tip - enjoy it
' simon wood has n't always been this good , even masterchef winner 's have the occasional cooking disaster
as a young man , he learnt the hazards of absent - minded cooking after he tipped and entire stock he had worked on for hours down the sink
' simon wood is now hoping to open a restaurant of his own while he enjoys fancy cooking , one of the simplest culinary pleasures for simon wood is a meal that can be rustled up in under ten minutes - a plain omelette
' but anyone looking to sample some of the cooking that netted simon wood the masterchef prize can expect something much more intricate when he succeeds in his dream of opening his own restaurant
