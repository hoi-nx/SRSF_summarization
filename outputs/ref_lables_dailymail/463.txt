the hunt for proof of the nessie 's existence may be over - and it does n't lie in a blurry photograph
fossils of a creature bearing a ' striking ' similarity to depictions of nessie have been found in a 19th century collection
as part of research for the upcoming science festival , museum and festival teams went hunting for the origins of the fossil , belonging to a species known as pterichthyoides milleri - or ' pessie ' as it has been christened
now researchers have revealed that ' pessie ' may have lived at the bottom of the lakes that would later become loch ness
the fish ancestor roamed earth 's freshwater lakes during the paleozoic era , between 542 million and 251 million years ago
great - great grandma ? pterichthyoides milleri ( illustration pictured ) roamed earth 's freshwater lakes during the paleozoic era , between 542 million and 251 million years ago the name ' pterichthyodes ' refers to the creatures ' odd wing - like appendages - ' pterichthys ' coming from the ancient greek for ' wing - fish '
cait , curator at the museum said : ' if you think of the picture that most people have in their heads of the nessie , our fossils pretty much meet what they would expect
' pterichthyoides milleri lived at the bottom of freshwater lochs and had flippers to help it move around
' we always said that the first sighting of the monster was by st columba 1450 years ago - now we can say her family has been living in the area for 360 million years
' ' for the first time , visitors to loch ness can be guaranteed to see a real nessie , notwithstanding that it 's one that 's a few years older than her relative that lives in the loch today
' no one is sure of what nessie actually is and the popular view is that she 's some sort of dinosaur - maybe she 's actually pessie after all ' ' pessie ' is available to view in the museum in inverness but visitors will have the chance to actually hold her during a lecture on the origins of the nessie on 7th may 2015
