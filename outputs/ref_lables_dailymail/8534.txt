british scientists are developing a treatment which could significantly boost patients â ability to fight off cancer , they revealed last night
a team led by imperial college london has already applied to patent the therapy , which they say could be ready for human trials within three years
the scientists discovered a protein which helps boost the body âs immune system ten-fold , an astonishing effect which could help patients fight off cancers and viruses
in a chance discovery in mice , it was found that a previously unknown protein - which they named the lymphocyte expansion molecule or lem - dramatically boosted the body âs number of t - cells
cytotoxic t - cells are an important component of the immune system , but when faced with serious infections or advanced cancer , they are usually unable to mobilise in large enough quantities to fight the disease
in a chance discovery in mice , it was found that a previously unknown protein - which they named the lymphocyte expansion molecule or lem - dramatically boosted the body âs number of t - cells by screening mice with genetic mutations , the imperial college london team discovered a strain of mice that produced ten times as many cytotoxic t - cells when infected with a virus , compared with normal mice
in further experiments the scientists went on to show that the lem molecule had a similar impact on the human immune system
a team led by imperial college london ( pictured ) has already applied to patent the therapy , which they say could be ready for human trials within three years study leader professor philip ashton-rickardt of imperial college london , said : â cancer cells have ways to suppress t - cell activity , helping them to escape the immune system
the treatment would be relatively expensive because it would effectively be personalised each time , relying on an extraction of the patient âs own cells â if all goes well , we hope to be ready to carry out human trials in about three years
â further investigation in animal models is needed before human trials can commence , but there is potential for a new type of treatment that capitalises on the immune system âs innate ability to detect and kill abnormal cells
