this is a type of urticaria , or hives - where a raised , itchy rash appears on the skin at the slightest pressure
dr zoe waller , 31 , is a university lecturer and uses her own skin to teach her students about new drugs and molecules , as she suffers from the skin condition dermatographia whenever dr waller draws on the skin , her condition means raised red weals appear and she can create designs
she uploads them to social media and they are making waves across the university however instead of hiding away her condition , dr waller is using it as a teaching aid

' some people look at my arm and think i 've been self - harming but it does n't hurt at all
' dermatographia or ' skin writing ' is a type of urticaria , or hives - where a raised , itchy rash appears on the skin
in this type of urticaria , itchy weals occur after friction such as rubbing or stroking the skin
' antihistamines block the effect of histamine , and reduce itching and the rash in most people , but may not relieve urticaria completely
she noticed her skin was itchy and irritated but the doctor could n't remember the name of the condition he thought she had and sent her away with anti-histamines
inspired by ariana , dr waller set to work on her own project - creating science molecules and compounds for her students using her skin
her students and fellow professors often ask her for requests which she happily draws on her skin
people across the university have began to make requests for designs they want dr waller to draw on herself ' however , antihistamines may not relieve the symptoms completely in all cases
