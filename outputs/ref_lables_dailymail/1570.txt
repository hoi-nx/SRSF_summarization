a scientology - backed organization is facing a bizarre land use battle over its plans to turn a patch of secluded in woods near the presidential retreat camp david into a drug rehab center
lawyers hired by drug rehab network narcocon have argued that trout run , a property in frederick county , maryland , has historic significance because president herbert hoover once caught a fish at the site
opponents view the proposed designation as a trick to circumvent current zoning laws for the 40 - acre plot of land and create a drug rehabilitation program that some call dangerous
narcocon , a scientology - affiliated drug rehab network , is trying to prove that a patch of land near camp david is historic enough so that they can build a center for twelve patients a scientology - back real estate company bought trout run for $ 4.85million in 2013 , and has been trying to change its land designation so that it can build a center that uses saunas and vitamin therapy for addicts narcocon , which uses sauna sessions and the teachings of scientology founder l. ron hubbard , has been sued in the past for wrongful deaths
narcocon officials , who run more than 120 centers around the world , deny that the program tries to convert addicts to scientology , though the group prominently features a quote from l. ron hubbard on its website
its maryland center would house 12 patients , with eight staff living there and eight living off - site
however , the current zoning laws for trout run , which includes a collection of stone cottages , classify it for resource conservation and do not permit any medical purpose for the site , according to the washington post
though narcocon says that it is non-religious and does not try to convert people to scientology , its website features the religion 's founder l. ron hubbard ( pictured ) prominently placing the property on the county register of historic places would allow narconon to conduct its program
an aide of herbert hoover bought the property in the late 1920s and the president went on fishing trips there , the frederick news post reported
narcocon hired a consultant whose history of trout run said that herbert hoover ' reeled in a fine one - and - one - half pound trout ' during a visit
president dwight eisenhower and other washington elites also fished at trout run during his time in office
frederick county 's historic preservation commission ruled that the site is eligible to be voted onto the register because of its early 20th century architecture
social betterment properties international , a real estate company tied to scientology , bought the land in 2013 for $ 4.85million from a government official who had long been trying to sell it
narconon has been working on building its center since
celebrity scientologists such as john travolta and tom cruise have repeated narconon 's message about how it saves 75 per cent of addicts
