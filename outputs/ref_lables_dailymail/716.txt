england are in danger of losing their fourth champions league spot in the coming years , as poor performances from premier league clubs in european take their toll
this season , for the second time in three years , there were no english clubs in the quarter - finals of the champions league , while none of our clubs have reached the last eight in the europa league either
if juventus , napoli and fiorentina win all their remaining games possible , italy will go into next season within 0.1 points of england
even if italian clubs fail to reach finals , a repeat of this season would see them overtake england in third place next season
germany is guaranteed to move ahead of england at the end of this season , while if italian clubs continue to perform well this season and english clubs fail to reverse their slump , the premier league could end next season out of european 's elite
that would see england reduced to three champions league places for the 2017/18 season , with serie a taking the extra place from the premier league

with juventus in pole position to reach the semi-finals of the champions league , napoli all but into the last four of the europa league , and fiorentina in with a chance of joining them , italy are likely to out - score england by at least four points this season , and that margin would grow if all three italian clubs reach the final of their respective competitions
with real madrid and barcelona still in the champions league that may not be very likely , but any more italian success will narrow the gap - and if the difference is less than four points , the english clubs will be nervously looking over their shoulders
and even if next season does n't see england slump to fourth , without a significant reversal in the fortunes of premier league and serie a clubs in the next two years , the season afterwards would see england in major trouble
