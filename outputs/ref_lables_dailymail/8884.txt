sales of a burberry poncho carrying a personal monogram and costing more than Â£ 1,000 have helped boost profits the poncho originated as a rather humble garment worn by south american tribes and later featured on the back of clint eastwood in the spaghetti westerns
however , sales of a designer - label version carrying a personal monogram and costing more than Â£ 1,000 have been central to a sales boom at the very british prestige brand burberry
the ponchos - together with heritage trench coats and scarves - have boosted burberry sales by 10 per cent over the winter
famous names including victoria beckham , rosie huntington-whiteley , sienna miller and sarah jessica parker were all seen sporting the ponchos , each monogrammed with their initials
the basic asking price was Â£ 895 , while 70 per cent of sales went to customers who wanted their initials monogrammed on to the weave at the cost of an extra Â£ 200
the firm said its scarves and trench coats were a hit with customers and â investment and innovation in ponchos drove exceptional growth â
â the british brand has become a global success with sales up 10 per cent for the six months to the end of march compared to the year before , taking from up to Â£ 1.42 billion

around 70 per cent of the burberry bottles were monogrammed , a service the brand offers for free , suggesting personalisation of luxury products is a huge draw for consumers
