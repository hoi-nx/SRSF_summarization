it 's normally steffon armitage who triggers it , but this time it is abendanon âs doing
he played so well for clermont last weekend â again â that england âs policy against picking players based abroad is back in focus
for the umpteenth time , the rfu and stuart lancaster are being urged to invoke the â exceptional circumstances â get - out clause
stuart lancaster , his assistants and his employers are being stalked by calls for steffon armitage to be called into the national squad , as befitting his supreme exploits for toulon
former bath full back abendanon was outstanding for clermont as they tore saracens to shreds toulon flanker steffon armitage has been one of the standout forwards in europe in recent seasons harlequins director of rugby conor o'shea believes the ' exceptional ' clause could cause major problems england hooker tom youngs also thinks the clause could create tension in the current international set - up this is not to decry a quality flanker who has excelled among the galacticos at his club , but this situation can not go on
england are being held hostage by their own edict , so why not just ditch the â exceptional â clause and end the out - cry ? critics of the union âs stance over-look the consequences for the club game in this country if there is no restriction in place
â leicester âs england hooker , tom youngs added : â i do nât know how well it would go down with the team
does he want to disrupt it ? â the ' exceptional ' clause rule has continued to heap pressure on stuart lancaster and his coaching staff fair point

it would be clearer still if the rfu and england really had the courage of their convictions and abolished the clause entirely

the england coaches will back themselves to mould him to their vision , given three months to do so
last weekend , the cacophony at stade marcel michelin â for clermont vs northampton â was on a different level to anything experienced here
in this observer âs opinion , the noise and colour at stade felix mayol the next day , as wasps took on holders toulon , was similar , if not quite as relentlessly raucous
munster 's home stadium thomond park is another fortress that generates a unique atmosphere but clermont lead the atmosphere league table
the northampton prop did nât feature for england during the recent six nations and was forced off during the saints â thumping defeat at clermont last weekend , apparently suffering discomfort in his right knee â which has been a problem area before
