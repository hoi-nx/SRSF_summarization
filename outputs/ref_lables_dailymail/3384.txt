the first signs of dark matter interacting with a force other than gravity may have been found
until now it was thought that dark matter did not interact with anything other than gravity , earning it its â dark â moniker and making its detection incredibly difficult
but the discovery of a â clump â lagging behind a galaxy suggests that it may not be as oblivious to our universe as we thought
durham university scientists studied a ' clump ' of dark matter that appears to be lagging behind its galaxy - suggesting it interacts with itself
the distribution of dark matter in the cluster is shown with blue contour lines dark matter is confusing because it interacts with nothing - including itself
this is despite seeming to account for 85 per cent of the universe âs mass and having an observable effect on galaxies : without dark matter , our galaxies would â fall apart â as they spin
aside from gravity , though , dark matter seemed to just pass through the universe without interacting with any other mass , such as humans , planets or stars
now an international team of researchers at durham university has found a clump offset from a galaxy by 5,000 light - years , suggesting that is not the case
called ' dark matter ' , this substance appears to make up 85 per cent of the matter in the known universe
astronomers have found that the total mass / energy content of the universe is split in the proportions 68 per cent dark energy , 27 per cent dark matter and 5 per cent ' normal ' matter
if the particles collide with each other , the friction from the collisions would cause the dark matter to slow down , and fall behind the galaxy
â we used to think that dark matter just sits around , minding its own business , except for its gravitational pull , â dr massey from durham university said
â but if dark matter were being slowed down during this collision , it could be the first evidence for rich physics in the dark sector - the hidden universe all around us
the mass of dark matter around the colliding galaxies severely distorted space - time , deviating the path of light rays coming from the distant background galaxy - and distorting its image into characteristic arc shapes
' our observation suggests that dark matter might interact with forces other than gravity , meaning we could rule out some key theories about what dark matter might be
this result follows on from recent findings from the team which observed 72 collisions between galaxy clusters and found that dark matter interacts very little with itself
this latest study follows research by the same team last month that found dark matter interacts with itself very little - but the fact that it interacts at all is very exciting , said dr massey
