on monday , a judge sentenced harris to four years and two months but osage county attorney jones said pursuing the more serious charge posed challenges because of problems with evidence and key witnesses
a former girlfriend testified a year ago that harris told her he shot gerety in the stomach , tortured him for two days , then cut off his head
prosecutors allege harris kept gerety 's head for months for some type of religious practice , identified earlier as voodoo
' what 's that tell everybody on the wrong side of the law ? ' other than a portion of the victim 's skull , prosecutors did not have the victim 's body , the murder weapon had not been recovered , not all of the prosecution 's witnesses were available , and prosecutors faced ' credibility issues ' with a major witness , jones said
henderson , an attorney who handled gerety 's social security payments , testified at a march 2014 preliminary hearing that he reported gerety missing in april 2011 after he failed to pick up his payments
williams , harris ' former girlfriend , testified in court that the defendant told her he killed gerety using a guitar string , disposed of the body , but kept the head in a bag for himself
then , harris is said to have put gerety 's torso , arms and legs in a barrel and burried it on land owned by his father , jeff harris in osage county
