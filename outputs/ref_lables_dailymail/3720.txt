the official word from arsenal is that wilshere is not for sale at the end of the season
wilshere is one of arsenal âs own , a product of the fabled hale end academy and an example to young recruits that it is possible to make a first - team breakthrough
the reality is that wilshere will sit with his influential father , andy , at the end of the season to discuss whether a move to man city would enhance his career and not just his bank balance
wilshere takes on stoke 's charlie ward during the arsenal u21s game at the emirates on tuesday night wilshere was making his first appearance for the gunners since recovering from ankle surgery wilshere has not featured for the first team since he was injured against manchester united on november 22 the england midfielder lays on the old trafford turf dejected after he suffered an ankle injury whatever manager arsenal wenger has to say before arsenal âs clash with burnley on saturday , wilshere to man city , as revealed in sportsmail on wednesday , is undoubtedly in the works
wilshere has always maintained that he wants to remain at arsenal for the rest of his career
man city , though , offer a fresh start and it is possible that wilshere needs a change of environment after another frustrating season on the sidelines
england manager roy hodgson has preferred to deploy wilshere in a defensive role for the national team man city have snapped up several players from arsenal in recent times , with varying degrees of success
gael clichy transfer fee : Â£ 7m
arsenal : 1 premier league title ( 2003 - 04 ) , 1 fa cup ( 2005 )
verdict : decent deal it is also a well - trodden path for arsenal players in recent seasons , with emmanuel adebayor , samir nasri , gael clichy and bacary sagna leaving the rhythmic , first - touch football at the emirates for super-sized salaries at man city
it is not an easy decision , particularly with the vulgar salaries on offer at the etihad and the inevitable accusations of being a mercenary , but this is key moment in wilshere âs career
the midfielder is already paid handsomely â Â£ 130,000 a week all in when he starts for arsenal â but injuries are a constant source of frustration for wilshere
he has not played a first - team game for arsenal since november 22 , when he was substituted 55 minutes into the 2 - 1 defeat by manchester united at the emirates with an ankle injury
in the past , wilshere has been built up too soon , championed as a future arsenal and england captain when he has yet to even make 100 starts for his club in the premier league
â the truth is that wilshere needs time , room to breathe again after being championed ever since he scored that magnificent goal for arsenal âs reserve team against west ham at barnet âs underhill stadium in 2008
gael clichy ( left ) and samir nasri are just two gunners who have left for man city in recent seasons arsenal wenger 's side are currently second in the premier league and face burnley on saturday since then wilshere has made the grade with the first team , an established member of a core group of players who are enjoying the club âs soothing possession football
during the victory parade , just hours before he joined up with the england squad to begin preparations for the world cup in brazil , he mischievously grabbed the microphone to ask the fans : â what do you think of tottenham ? â the answer was well - publicised at the time , but the more pertinent question is whether wilshere can reclaim his first place in this developing arsenal team
with mesut ozil , alexis sanchez , santi cazorla and aaron ramsey the favoured attacking players behind olivier giroud , this is not an easy team for wilshere to get into next season
