the perfect script for this first test saw jimmy anderson taking the four wickets he needed to become the most prolific bowler in england âs history in his 100th game with record holder sir ian botham here and waiting to crown his successor
but west indies made jimmy anderson wait on an attritional day that was in sharp contrast to the excitement provided by the first of this crucial series
certainly jimmy anderson would not have expected to play a more significant role with bat than ball on the second day of this first test as west indies did much to make up for their profligacy in the last two sessions of the first
when jimmy anderson , watched by his wife , two daughters and parents , strode out to bat england had lost five wickets for 20 runs and were in danger of wasting the initiative handed to them largely by ian bell âs century
then it was a question of whether this unassuming lancastrian could move from 380 wickets to 384 and overtake ian botham , who was on hand apparently with a nice bottle of red wine waiting to celebrate , at the top of england âs test tree

jimmy anderson could make no further inroads and was surprisingly limited to just four overs after tea as the other england bowlers were forced to share the load and three more wickets
stuart broad , who has not been at his best since returning from injury at the world cup , had earlier ended marlon samuels hopes of extending his purple patch against england and west indies were on the back foot at 99 for four

west indies finished on 155 for four having had the better of the second day and leaving england with much to do if they are to secure the win here that would be so important to them

when he fell and england had slumped to 361 for nine the test was back in the balance but jimmy anderson and chris jordan kept england âs noses in front until the wait for jimmy anderson âs big moment began
