sydney grandfather mutty ( pictured with his wife , debbie , and grandchildren ) has had a travel ban placed on him after he served time for alcohol possession , which is illegal in saudi arabia while other expats who had committed the same crime in the past were deported , mutty was ordered to serve jail time according to the islamic calendar and received 28 of the 75 lashes he was sentenced to have
the 57 - year - old was sent to thoqba prison in the al khobar eastern province on october 19 and was released on march 19
but since he walked free , mutty has been unable to leave saudi arabia or work as he has been banned from travelling out of the country without any explanation as to why this is happening mutty 's situation has turned so desperate that he and his wife , debbie , have reached out to family to help them by donating money
he was jailed for six months and 75 lashes , but only received 28
mutty says he received little assistance from the australian embassy in saudi arabia the sydney grandfather does not deny he committed the crime , but he has grown increasingly frustrated with the australian embassy who he claims have not been taking his case seriously
' the australian embassy , who made contact late in the piece with the [ saudi arabia 's ] foreign ministry , said i would not receive lashes but i did
' mutty said the embassy should have helped him try and find out which department had placed the travel ban on him
' we do n't know who put the travel ban in place
' that âs what we 're expecting the australian embassy in riyadh to do for us
after speaking out about his situation to the australian media , mutty was now receiving assistance from the embassy when asked why he had run the risk of getting caught , mutty answered frankly : ' because you get complacent
' despite his brush with the law in saudi arabia , mutty said he would be willing to return and work in the country
' the embassy is in contact with mr mutty and his legal representative about having the current travel ban lifted so that he can depart saudi arabia
