but nothing quite feels the same as bringing a genuine european superpower to its knees and porto and their rapturous supporters went home knowing that they now have a more than a decent chance of squeezing through to the semi-finals of the champions league when the teams reconvene in bavaria next tuesday
porto earned an impressive 3 - 1 champions league first leg victory against bundesliga champions bayern on wednesday night bayern goalkeeper manuel neuer brings down porto striker martinez to concede a third minute penalty the bayern players surround referee carlos velasco carballo following his decision to award porto a spot - kick the 31 - year - old forward had no problem slotting the ball past manuel neuer to give his side an early 1 - 0 advantage germans star manuel neuer dives in the wrong direction as quaresma calmly slots away the spot - kick with just three minutes on the clock porto : fabiano 6.5 , danilo 6.5 , maicon 7 , martins indi 7 , alex sandro 7 , hector herrera 7 , casemiro 7 , torres 7 ( neves 74 ' 6 ) , quaresma 8.5 ( evandro 84 ' ) , martinez 8 , brahimi 7 ( hernani 78 ' ) subs not used : helton , quintero , reyes , aboubakar booked : alex sandro , casemiro , danilo goal : quaresma ' ( p ) & 10 ' , martinez 64 ' manager : julen lopetegui 8.5 bayern : manuel neuer 6 , rafinha 6 , jerome boateng 5 , dante 5 , bernat 5.5 , philipp lahm 6 , alonso 5 ( badstuber 73 ' 6 ) , thiago alcantara 6 , muller 6 , robert lewandowski 5.5 , gotze 6 ( rode 56 ' 5.5 ) subs not used : reina , pizarro , gaudino , weiser , lucic booked : manuel neuer , bernat , philipp lahm , rode goal : thiago alcantara 28 ' manager : pepe guadiola 6 mom : quaresma referee : carlos velasco carballo 6 ( spain ) att : 50 , 092 bayern , it must be said , were wretched
yes , bayern were without sebastian schweinsteiger , arjen robben and franck ribery but porto are a team with little recent champions league pedigree
as kick - off approached you could find odds as long as 4 - 1 on a home win
no doubt expecting a bright start from porto , bayern simply had to ride it out
alonso dithered under pressure from martinez on the edge of the penalty area and when the spanish referee deemed the porto forward âs challenge legal the colombian eased clear and was felled by goalkeeper manuel neuer
porto playmaker quaresma , meanwhile , moved forwards to put the penalty to manuel neuer âs right
an awful start for bayern and perfect for porto , the pattern continued and in the tenth minute the visiting team contributed another absolute horror show
this time it was the brazilian central defender dante who erred , giving the ball away to quaresma 40 yards from goal , allowing his opponent to race away and score comfortably with the outside of his right foot as manuel neuer advanced

as the first half had worn on they had begun to impose themselves a little and it was therefore no great shock when jerome boateng âs low cross from the right was driven in by thiago alcantara from close range at the far post in the 28th minute
bayern started the second period almost as badly as they had started the first and would have slipped two behind once more had manuel neuer not produced the save of the night , acrobatically turning over hector herrera âs close range shot

throughout the whole of the second half , bayern hardly created an opportunity and when what could yet be the decisive third porto goal arrived with 25 minutes left it represented another act of self - harming from the visitors
the long ball down the inside left channel really should nât have caused bayern any problems but jerome boateng for some reason chose not to head it clear and martinez then displayed a terrific turn of speed to round manuel neuer â who left his line as slight favourite - and score from a tight angle
porto 's alex sandro ( centre ) looks to get the better of spanish midfielder alonso during the european encounter colombian striker martinez rounds manuel neuer with ease before slotting into an empty net and putting porto 3 - 1 ahead manuel neuer was unable to stop martinez as the colombian made the most of a mistake from bayern defender jerome boateng martinez celebrates putting porto into a commanding 3 - 1 lead as bayern have a night to forget in portugal martinez ( left ) celebrates his goal in front of the porto faithful as alonso and manuel neuer look shell - shocked dante ( left ) leaves the estadio do dragao pitch with his team - mates as bayern suffer a shock 3 - 1 defeat bayern captain philipp lahm reacts after his side lose only their second champions league match of the 2014 - 15 campaign
