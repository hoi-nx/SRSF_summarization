if austin played for a big club he would be in the england team by now
if we think a squad should contain four strikers , who should roy hodgson drop to make way ? wayne rooney , the captain , poised to overtake sir bobby charlton as the greatest goal - scorer in england âs history ? danny welbeck , the top scorer across this championship qualifying round , with six goals in five games ? harry kane , english football âs leading goalscorer â or daniel sturridge , the man whose partnership with luis suarez almost propelled liverpool to the title last season ? austin is yet to receive an international call - up despite scoring 17 premier league goals for qpr austin scored in qpr 's 3 - 3 draw with fellow premier league strugglers aston villa on tuesday night harry kane ( left ) and wayne rooney ( right ) started in england 's recent 1 - 1 draw with italy every few years an england manager must ride this accusation of big - club favouritism
he will probably move on from qpr at the end of the season and may even earn an england call - up then
austin has had an excellent year but england have goal - scorers who are in even better form , or have earned their place in the squad
