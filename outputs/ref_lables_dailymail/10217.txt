a historic spacex launch that could change the way man gets to space blasted off today from florida under perfect conditions
within minutes of liftoff , the california company was making its third attempt to land the leftover booster on an ocean platform
spacex once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand
despite being destroyed , the booster 's flyback marks another step in the company 's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown , potentially slashing launch costs
' this might change completely how we approach transportation to space , ' spacex vice president hans koenigsman told reporters during a prelaunch press conference
musk had put 50 - 50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year the booster was programmed , following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff , to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed ' just read the instructions ' in the atlantic while the booster landing did n't go to plane , the launch was successful
it took place at 4.10 et from florida under perfect conditions , after a attempt had to be scrubbed on monday due to lightning the 208ft ( 63 metre ) tall falcon 9 rocket , carrying a the dragon capsule , thundered off its seaside launch pad at cape canaveral air force station at 4:10 p.m. the falcon 9 is on now its way to deliver 4,300lb ( 1,950 kg ) of food , clothing and science experiments to the iss - including an eagerly awaited espresso machine for astronauts
the supplies should arrive the six space station astronauts on friday
on board the dragon capsule is an experimental espresso machine intended for iss astronaut samantha cristoforetti of italy
spacex , meanwhile , hoped to transform the rocket business by landing the first - stage booster on a platform floating a few hundred miles off florida 's northeastern coast , near jacksonville
the dragon - the only supply ship capable of returning items intact - will remain at the iss until around may 21 at liftoff time , the orbiting lab was soaring over australia
the delivery of food and equipment will arrive friday soon after the launch , musk tweeted : ' ascent successful
rocket landed on droneship , but too hard for survival ' the dragon , the spacex supply ship , holds more than 4,000 pounds of food , science experiments and equipment for the six space station astronauts musk 's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world , to reduce launch costs
the booster was programmed , following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff , to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed ' just read the instructions
during a previous landing attempt in january , the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins , causing it to crash into the platform

as well as the espresso machine , the dragon capsule supply ship also holds experiments for nasa 's one - year space station resident scott kelly , who moved in a couple weeks ago
spacex is one of two companies hired by nasa to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles
