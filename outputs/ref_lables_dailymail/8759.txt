david cameron will say if miliband repeated the economic mistakes of last labour government there will be a risk to jobs mr david cameron , who dismissed the projections , will today launch a conservative ' jobs manifesto ' setting out plans to bring about ' full employment ' â meaning everyone who wants a job has one
claiming mr miliband represents a threat to jobs , he will add : ' you know what makes me really angry ? it 's when our opponents still go on about ' you tories â the party for the few and not the many â¦ ' excuse me ? ' this is the party that 's taken three million of the lowest - paid workers out of income tax altogether ; that 's cut the taxes of 26million working people ; that 's seen 1,000 jobs created every day â jobs that are giving families security , putting food on tables , helping people out of poverty
' so if miliband repeated the economic mistakes of the last labour government â that he was a part of â he risks a million more people joining the dole queues
the tax break , which helps smaller businesses take on new workers by freeing businesses from at least the first Â£ 2,000 of employers ' national insurance , has already been taken up by 856,000 firms
