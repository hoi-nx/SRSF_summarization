shaving , waxing , plucking - many of us spend hours getting rid of body hair
but this week , singer miley cyrus decided to challenge convention and leave her underarms unshaved - perhaps she 's onto something , as there may be health benefits to having an ample covering of fuzz
here , with the help of experts , we explore why being hairy may be good for you
singer miley cyrus this week shocked fans with this photo by challenging convention - and leaving her underarms unshaved how body hair helps your skin heal hair anywhere on the body is important for maintaining skin health , explains tobin , a professor of cell biology at the university of bradford
' each hair follicle [ the tiny structure that sprouts hairs ] is not just producing a hair fibre , but also has masses of blood vessels , nerves and fat around it
' hair follicles are also rich in stem cells - cells that never lose the capacity to renew themselves - which help the skin heal
' if you compared a wound on the outside of a man 's arm , where the hair follicles are larger and more numerous , with a wound on the inside of the arm , the one on the outside would heal better , because of the increased stem cells and blood supply , among other factors , ' says professor tobin
as we age , follicles shrink and while people who lose hair will still have some stem cells , their healing capacity may be reduced
the good news is that removing hair through shaving or waxing wo n't reduce these benefits because the hair follicles are still intact
... and provides sun protection body hair harks back to our prehistoric ancestors - it was our only garment , keeping us warm and protecting us from environmental impact such as sunlight , explains nick lowe , consultant dermatologist from london 's cranley clinic
while few of us have dense enough hair to serve this purpose now , someone who 's particularly hairy may have an extra degree of sun protection , he says
another historic function of body hair was to keep us warm , says professor tobin , who is also director of the centre for skin sciences
' we do know bald heads lose more heat , and that when we 're cold , our body hair stands on end to trap warm air closer to the surface of the skin
' body hair harks back to our prehistoric ancestors - it was our only garment
now , experts have revealed the various ways in which being hairy may be good for us - despite our constant attempts to remove it do n't pluck your nasal hair unsightly as they may be , hairs in the nostrils do have a role - to prevent foreign material , such as dust , getting in to the nose and lungs , says murty , an ear , nose and throat consultant at university hospitals of leicester
does a hairy chest imply intelligence ? those who are particularly hairy - such as the actor tom selleck ( pictured ) - may have extra sun protection an ample chest rug has long been seen as a sign of masculinity and good health in a man
so when a man has a good smattering of chest hair it could be a sign that he has healthy levels of testosterone , says nida chammas , a consultant endocrinologist at bmi the clementine churchill hospital , harrow
hairy toes may mean good circulation losing the hair on the feet - and also the lower leg - can be a symptom of peripheral artery disease it 's rarely considered an attractive feature , but hair on your toes could be a sign that your circulation is in good working order
hair follicles need a good blood supply for nutrients and oxygen
' if you get a blockage in the circulation in the legs , it means less oxygen will reach the bottom of the leg - far away from the heart - so the hair follicles there will suffer the most
' it 's only a sign of poor circulation if you had hair there in the first place , ' says mr kyriakides
leaving underarm hair intact may help disperse the odours that attract us to a potential partne think before you prune your ears hairs in the outer portion of the ear canal prevent dust and other particles from entering the ear
lovelorn ? hairy armpits may help another argument for leaving underarm hair intact is that it may help disperse the odours that attract us to a potential partner
as professor tobin says : ' in other mammals , body hair is very important for dispersing odours , such as pheromones - chemicals that can help to attract mates
' whether humans have them too is a controversial area , but shaving your underarm hair could mean that odours are not dispersed into the air so quickly
