the cost of a daily lunchtime takeaway can be crippling and yet instead of making lunches at home the majority of british workers still pop to the high street to grab their midday meal
the ' meal deal ' ( which is not always a meal , or a deal ) has seen us stave off the hunger pangs with soggy sandwiches , slimy salads and salty soups , spending an average of Â£ 1,840 a year
but we could save up to Â£ 1,300 a year if we just prepared our lunch at home

make something complicated like stuffed dumplings ( left ) or keep it simple with a toast tartine ( right ) hannah petertil has some inspired combinations which include cheddar , apple , and bacon jam ; mozzarella and prosciuotto or manchego and dried apricots

workers could save up to Â£ 1,300 a year if they prepared their lunch at home instead of buying pre-packed sandwiches and snacks from shops , research by vouchercloud.com revealed
more than 60 per cent of british who buy their lunches out spend an average of Â£ 1,840 a year , based on 46 working weeks , the research reveals
in comparison , those who prepare food at home spend just Â£ 552 over the same period - a saving of a whopping Â£ 1,288
the startling difference came to light following a poll of adults across the british , which found that a fifth of british choose to purchase their work - time lunches as opposed to making them at home
pita bread is also another wonderful lunchtime option and can be stuffed with any number of fillings , from hard boiled eggs , smoked meat and charred vegetables
experiment with flavour combinations ; stay mediterranean with aubergine with chickpeas and coriander or keep it british with thinly sliced roast chicken , crisp lettuce and sweet baby tomatoes
remember , anything you can put into a sandwich can be stuffed into a pita
still sound too complicated ? try turning toast into a tartine
spread with butter or mayonnaise and top with thinly sliced vegetables ( radish and chicory , dressed lightly in lemon juice and olive oil work really well against crisp , hot toast ) or layer slices of ham , chopped up dates and a salty cheese to make something a bit more glamorous
the site also has more complicated options for those who have time on their hands and want to experiment
steamed pork buns , which are traditionally eaten as a breakfast food in china are self - contained dough parcels which can be filled ( bao ) or unfilled ( mantou )
jenny xu from food52 writes : ' your first option is to go with the basic , unfilled mantou dough , then customise it to your heart 's content
' steamed chinese buns ( bao ) are usually stuffed with meats such as roast pork and stir - fried mushrooms you can stuff your bun with anything you like including pork , vegetables and even mushrooms , before you steam them
buns or banh mi not doing it for you ? stuff some dumplings instead
i tend to lean towards two of my favorites : pork and chives for my meat option , and chives , egg , and vermicelli for my vegetarian option -- but these are only two out of numerous recipes out there , ' betty liu of food52 writes
