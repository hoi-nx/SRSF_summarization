unwilling to reveal the cost of his furry investment , the fighter did confirm that he had bought the tiger cub from a small village , near the syria city of aleppo , where he has recently been based

the surprising news comes just a month after the 28 - year - old revealed on social media that he was looking to buy an exotic pet to keep him company
unwilling to reveal the cost of his furry investment , the fighter only confirmed that he had bought the tiger cub from a small village , near the syria city of aleppo
unusually it was n't just the tiger cub that seemed to be the big talking point from new photo
keen to hide his identity , the former bond university student posted an obscured photo of himself stroking a four month old lion
the fighter recently showed off his war booty of $ 525 and a kalashnikov rifle , possibly explaining how he managed to pay for the tiger cub
one user cheekily wrote on shaheed 's ask.fm page : ' is that u holding the tiger ? cause the beard should be longer to appear for someone who been there more than year and a half lol ' with his ego bruised , the 28 - year - old militant swiftly replied back , insisting he was looking up at the sky for any potential incoming fire from jets
deputy commander of rebel group jaish al-mujahideen wal-ansar , abdul karim krymsky , was pictured holding a young tiger last month
shaheed is believed to be a former bond university student , who reportedly left his home in sydney and traveled to syria to join the al qaeda affiliated group jabhat al-nusra
' it is possible that shaheed has joined another rebel group in the aleppo liberation , based around the broken city of aleppo
