but today , mr boris insisted that labour could not take power without the support of the scottish nationalist party , and claimed the prospect was ' actually deeply alarming '
he said mr ed would have to take help from the scottish party ' crouching on his back like a monkey ' - making it impossible for him to govern in the interests of the whole uk
the london mayor added : i am not saying that your brother had to present himself at a&e with a dagger in his back ... [ but ] he [ ed ] would do more damage to this country than he did to his brother , and that is the key point

do you really think that is a fair approach to somebody who is standing in an election ? before mr boris could speak , mr ed said : â he does nât believe it
