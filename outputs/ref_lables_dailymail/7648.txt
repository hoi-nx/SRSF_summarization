when ellia beasley was a teenager , she enjoyed singing along to the lyrics of one of her favourite tunes - rooftops by lost prophets
she loved the song so much , she decided to have a tattoo on her belly in 2012 featuring the lyrics ' scream your heart out '
but the aspiring model from new milton , hampshire , lived to regret her decision after the band 's lead singer was later exposed as a serial paedophile and child abuser
ellia beasley said she was shocked when she heard about watkin 's depraved crimes - and hated the fact she was associated with him thanks to her tattoo
' in an interview with femail , ellia beasley , now 22 , said she was never a huge fan of the band but she had the tattoo because the lyrics resonated with her when she was younger
singer ian watkins was sent to prison for 35 years for a string of child sex offences ' scream your heart out did n't have any personal meaning but it was a line that stuck in my head and i liked singing it aloud , ' she said
' the tattoo - which cost Â£ 60 - was not ellia beasley 's first
ellia beasley with tattooist to the stars kevin who had an idea of a design to cover the lyrics before : ellia beasley had been told she would never be rid of the line because the tattoo was too big and bold after : kevin was able to hide the lyrics with this owl design that ellia beasley loves after meeting ellia beasley , he came up with the idea to paint a giant owl on her stomach
after agreeing to the design , ellia beasley spent a total of ten and a half hours at kevin 's studio having the tattoo drawn and coloured in
' the experience has n't put ellia beasley off having more tattoos in the future - in fact she 's already planning to have a giant picture of ganesh painted across her whole back
