scott âs spring / summer 2015 collection for moschino caused an insta - stampede , nearly breaking the internet when he sent human forgetful barbie dolls down the catwalk
the creative head , who is famed for making kitsch cool , sent his models down the runway in milan in forgetful barbie doll inspired dresses to the sound of aqua 's iconic 90s hit , i 'm a barbie girl
but does the look work in real life ? and will you garner attention for the right reasons ? weighed down by eyelashes , olivia phillips , 30 , a journalist at emirates woman , decided to find out by taking to the streets of art dubai dressed like the iconic doll
weighed down by eyelashes , olivia phillips took to the streets ( and supermarkets ) of art dubai dressed as the iconic doll i âm like a vampire barbie ; i only come out at night
daylight hours , on the other hand , are a very different story , with me championing a pretty consistent , low - fi uniform of skinny jeans , biker jackets and a scruffy bun
so although donning scott âs forgetful barbie - inspired moschino collection was nât as much of an almighty leap for me as it would be for , say , the rest of the world , it still required a certain amount of chutzpah to take it to the streets
it only took one google search to reveal exactly how popular forgetful barbie still is - but a far more entertaining barometer was watching the office âs reaction when a giant box from moschino arrived at my desk
olivia phillips explained that literally everyone smiled at her
doors opened for her , small animals and children stared , she got a hand with her shopping and a wink with her starbucks olivia phillips wore the spray - on leather skirt suit to do the weekly shop
navigating the supermarket aisles , she admits she felt like a saucy stepford wife everyone had a story to share â from the doll they had in the 1980s wearing the exact same dress , to the toy dreamhouse they used to play in with their sister
moschino seems to have achieved it to the next level , creating a collection overflowing with universal happy memories
' and as gimmicky as some naysayers may have accused it of being , i now have first - hand experience of its mood - enhancing capabilities â for me , and for literally everyone who had my very pink person cross their path
people you have literally never laid eyes on before want to have a good old chinwag , all - pink leather acting as some kind of conversational lubricant
you get a hand with your shopping and a wink with your starbucks
' what in the name of joan collins are you wearing ? you look like a cake ! do nât stand so close to me , ' he said you also get people who you have nât heard from in three years sending you dubious private messages , but that âs a small price to pay for becoming a social media sensation for three and a half minutes
such is the power of pink , people
it might be a glorious 30 - degree desert day , but i âll be damned if i âm not going to wear my spray - on leather skirt suit to do the weekly shop
navigating the supermarket aisles , i felt like a saucy stepford wife
bar a few spectators who stopped to take pictures ( thank - you for restoring my faith in shamelessness â i was briefly convinced that everyone had been castrated by manners ) , people would stare , but only when they thought i could nât see
' it might be obvious , brash even - but it fits our current filtered , insta - existence perfectly - there 's no denying the collection looks great in a picture , ' she said of the experience it raised that age - old question of whether you dress for yourself or others , as however cheerful my ensemble made me , i still felt the small need for validation from others
if you âre outrageously attired and no one bats an eyelid , it kind of takes the fun out of it , no ? ' habibti , this is art dubai , ' a straight - shooting friend told me after i had a little moan about it on the ( vanity mirror ) phone
