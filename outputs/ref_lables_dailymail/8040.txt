the sru have clinched the biggest shirt sponsorship deal in their history after agreeing a Â£ 3.6million contract over three years with bt
sportsmail exclusively revealed last year that bt had agreed to pay Â£ 20m over four years for the naming rights of murrayfield stadium â and that the telecommunications giant would follow that up with a deal to have their trademarks on the famous dark blue jersey
the sru insisted the combination of the initial bt investment coupled with the new cash injection from the strip deal had already started to transform scotland rugby
the scotland shirt , worn here by david denton , will have bt on it rather than rbs from the summer â i am delighted bt will be the new strip partner of the scotland teams and although i can not confirm how much the deal is worth as it is commercially sensitive , i can confirm it is the largest ever shirt sponsorship deal we have done , â said mckay , the sru âs director of commercial operations , communications and public affairs
â bt is now very much under the skin of scotland rugby and their cash has allowed us to invest in a way we have not been able to ever before
â all form of jersey advertising is banned during the forthcoming world cup in england later this year but scotland will have bt branding on their training tops
the sru say that the scotland under - 20 side will be the first team to run out with bt on their jerseys when they compete in the world rugby under-20 championship in june and the senior side will first wear the logo on their jerseys during their world cup warm - up fixture against italy in august
the scotland women âs team will also wear the national jersey with the bt logo on it as will all age - grade sides
