ariana miyamoto says it was often punishing growing up as the only black girl in her class in the port town of sasebo near nagasaki , where the us has a naval base and where her african - us father met her japan mother
the 20 - year - old was born and raised in japan , speaks fluent japan , and was last month chosen to represent her country in the miss universe pageant
as a youngster ( right ) she grew up in japan some critics of ariana miyamoto 's win have complained she is a mixed race ' hafu ' and not japan enough but the beauty queen had to use her first television appearance after her selection to apologetically explain to reporters that while she does n't ' look japan ' on the outside , on the inside there are ' many japan things about her '
many in the country have expressed hostility to ariana miyamoto 's title win as they expected the award to go to a ' pure ' japan woman and not a ' hafu ' , meaning half japan , which has echoes of the discredited term ' half - caste '
' is it okay to choose a hafu to represent japan ? ' one commenter typically wrote online after ariana miyamoto 's win
but i am japan - 100 percent
i am japan - 100 percent ' ariana miyamoto will represent japan at miss universe having fought her way to the top despite racial prejudice the beauty queen grew up in sasebo near nagasaki but spent two years with her dad in the us as a teenager from his home in jacksonville , arkansas , ariana miyamoto 's father bryant stanfield , 43 , said his face hurt from non-stop smiling since his daughter scooped the miss japan award from a line up of more ' typical ' looking japan women earlier this month
' divided from the asian and russian land masses by fierce currents , many japan have long believed in a myth of racial purity , although the islands ' inhabitants are a result of a hodge - podge of different migrations mainly from korea , china and the south seas
the only ' native japan ' are the caucasian - looking ainu people , pushed to near - extinction to japan 's northernmost reaches
miss japan has said there was ' pretty much a spasmodic vomit of racial abuse heaped upon me ' growing up ariana miyamoto with her japan mother and a male friend
her father says she is ' proud of both ' her heritages ' one of the ways in which japan think of their own society as ' unique ' is to emphasise the homogeneity of japan society and indeed by lots of comparisons , japan is certainly a much more homogeneous society than say the us , ' bestor told columbia university 's asian topics
' the election of a mixed race japan is a first for one of the world 's most ethnically homogeneous states the election of a black miss japan might be a step away from that misconception and mr bryant stanfield agrees that the choice of his daughter represents some kind of progression in japan
it was an encouraging sign that the japan judges picked a mixed race miss japan , he agreed , showing the progressive aspects of a country that still has the death penalty and where one tourism minister described his own ' one - race ' countrymen as ' not keen ' on immigration or foreigners
there are always some people here who do n't like you because of the way you look or because you are different so i 'm proud of her sticking it out in japan and doing what she did - becoming miss japan
' as a young man , miss japan 's father 's life reads like that of the us lead in madame butterfly , where a handsome naval officer falls in love with a japan geisha before finally leaving japan and his japan bride and their daughter behind
he met ariana miyamoto 's japan mother while on duty in the us navy at nagasaki in the 90s
' we moved stateside for a little while but her mother actually wanted ariana miyamoto to be born in japan , ' he said
ariana miyamoto 's father bryant stanfield , 43 , says people in japen will ' never be as proud of her as i am ' ' after that my duties meant i could n't be in japan for any length of time and slowly her mother and i drifted apart
' not until ariana miyamoto was a teenager did she renew her bond with her father
after mr bryant stanfield remarried and had three more children , they were joined by ariana miyamoto more permanently three years ago when ariana miyamoto stayed in arkansas for two years to learn english and attend us high school
after returning from the us , ariana miyamoto started a career in modelling in japan
it is a pastime often considered too ' showbiz ' by a traditionally - minded country , and one where beautiful half - japan ' hafu ' offspring dominate
ariana miyamoto 's father is in little doubt she is proud of both heritages
' she 's aware of both sides - the black side and the japan side , ' he said
' please tell japan to just accept her , and just be be proud of her
