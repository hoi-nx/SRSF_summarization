davis would love to see jimmy white and reanne evans light up the crucible stage but admits his own swan song hopes look forlorn
reanne evans saw her task made all the more intimidating when she was drawn to face 1997 world champion ken doherty on thursday , in the first of three preliminary rounds , while jimmy white will tackle fellow veteran james wattana in his opener on saturday
davis will attempt to qualify for this year 's world championship at the crucible but davis , who will also attempt to qualify , expects both would relish the challenge if they fought their way through to the first round in sheffield
he calls 29 - year - old dudley potter reanne evans ' a great player ' , and said of the 10 - time ladies ' world champion : ' it 's a real tough battle out there against players who are playing for their livelihoods
' reanne evans is more like the jimmy white or the ronnie o'sullivan of the women 's game
it 's hard enough for me and jimmy white
' if me or jimmy white qualify for the crucible , it 's arguably as big a win as we 've ever had
' i 've got a little bit of a desire to do it , but jimmy white would certainly love to get back to the crucible
' reanne evans takes on ken docherty for a place at the world championships in sheffield reanne evans is a 10 - time ladies champion who previously competed on the main tour for the 2010 - 11 season
jimmy white , who lost six world championship finals , last appeared at the tournament in 2006 , and has fallen short in qualifying every year since
while 52 - year - old jimmy white is in the autumn of his career , for davis these are the winter years before his match cue is finally laid down
jimmy white will take on fellow veteran james wattana in qualifying on thursday ' i was still practising hard even when i was n't getting to the latter stages of the crucible , and in the end you have to say , ' yeah , i 've tried , but the price is too much investment of time '
' davis won six world titles in the 1980s and rolled back the years with a mesmerising return to form at the 2010 tournament , but the 1985 ' black - ball final ' defeat to dennis taylor stands over and above all memories
dennis taylor in action during the memorable 1985 world championship final against davis the second autobiography of his career - 34 years after the first - meant davis having to trawl over the emotional wreckage of that night again
