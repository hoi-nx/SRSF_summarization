avid users of msn messenger and other instant messaging services that were popular before facebook and twitter will remember the â away â message
and years after it was popular , facebook is bringing back short updates in a new form â the â sidebar status â
the feature lets users post a short message about what they are doing in a sidebar added to the social network âs mobile app , complete with an illustrative picture , but it 's currently only available to selected people for testing
facebook 's sidebar status feature ( pictured ) will let users post a short message about what they are doing in a sidebar added to the social network âs mobile app , complete with an illustrative picture the sidebar can be accessed by swiping right on the screen and brings up a user âs most messaged friends
a facebook spokesman told mailonline : â millions of people already use the sidebar to quickly find and contact their friends
facebook is testing the service in taiwan and australia , where from today , users of the app will see short status messages under their friends â names , the verge reported
they can just be seen in the sidebar and expire after 12 hours â allowing only the person who posted them to access them again
the comparison of the old â away â messages has been drawn because of the small square images and the fact they will be sent to only close friends , despite the fact that we are rarely away from phones and computers now - a - days
for many people , facebook âs main news feed hosts information from a large number of contacts and brands as well as friends , and the social network has heard from its users that people want a place to see and share smaller updates too
