a jobless alcoholic has boasted of fathering 40 children who have cost the taxpayer more than Â£ 4million in benefits and care costs
shameless holpin â who at 56 says he wants more children â claims he had them by 20 women and admits he would not recognise many of his offspring in the street
now engaged again , the three - times married man keeps track of their names with an ever - growing family tree tattooed on his back
' i wo n't stop ' : father of 40 holpin , left and right with his fiancÃ©e diane , says he wants more children because it is ' god 's will ' his relationships have broken down because of his drinking and womanising , and the recovering alcoholic says 16 of his children have been taken into care at some stage in their lives
if they had completed just one year in care each , it would leave the taxpayer with a bill for Â£ 2.4million
mr holpin or the children âs mothers would also have been able to claim at least Â£ 500,000 in child benefit and a further Â£ 800,000 in child tax credits
yet the feckless dad , of ebbw vale in south wales , said : â i âll never stop [ having children ]
in the bible , god says go forth and multiply
â keeping track : mr holpin , from ebbw vale in monmouthshire , shows off his family tree tattoo - which includes his children and grandchildren he was the subject of a channel 5 documentary this week , but last night former friends said holpin âs claim to 40 children â aged between three and 37 â was nonsense
mr holpin , who lives in a council house and claims benefits , said he was a changed man who no longer drank alcohol
â family : holpin says that he loves sex and wo n't use contraception - even though 16 of his children were taken into care taxpayers â alliance chief executive jonathan isaby said : â it is the lack of shame that really sticks in the throat and taxpayers will be furious
â but former friends say mr holpin âs boasts are off the mark , and that he has fathered as few as 16 children with three women
â offspring : holpin admits his lifestyle led to 16 of his children being taken into care but says he wants to make it up to them mr holpin and his family are infamous in the former mining town of ebbw vale , where locals have launched petitions to stop him moving into their street
â dream : mr holpin says being reunited with his huge brood would complete him and make his life perfect day out : holpin and diane with some of the children at their local bowling alley new life : the father - of - 40 lives with his fiancÃ©e diane morris , ten years his junior , and they live in a two - bed council house in south wales
â it would nât surprise me if he had 40 children , the way he carries on
