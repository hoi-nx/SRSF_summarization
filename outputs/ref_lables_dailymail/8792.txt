as the election race hots up , labour leader ed is getting a small taste of what it might be like to be a member of one direction
a group of female fans , who 've dubbed themselves the ' milifans ' , are rallying support for the opposition leader on social media using the twitter hashtag # milifandom
led by twitter user @ twcuddleston , an as levels student by the name of abby , the unlikely fan club has prompted hundreds of tweets from fellow users who share their admiration for the labour leader
my heart belongs to ed ! the labour leader ( pictured in manchester yesterday ) has been the subject of a social media storm in recent days as a group of fans , mainly teenagers , have posted their affection for him under the # milifandom hashtag behind the # milifandom hashtag is @ twcuddleston , an as level student who appears to be a genuine labour supporter
her tweets in support of ed have led to lots of other women posting tweets of affection for him fearing a gaffe , the labour leader has remained tight - lipped on what he makes of the milifans but did tweet back the teen behind it , @ twcuddleston in her twitter profile , she describes herself as ' leader of the milifandom , a movement against the distorted media portrayal of ed. ' and even she is amazed at just how the hashtag has taken off , saying ' there are those in the milifandom , those who find the milifandom funny , and those who wonder how the hell ed has a fandom
' perhaps fearing a gaffe , the labour leader has remained tight - lipped on what he makes of the milifans but did tweet the teen behind it , @ twcuddleston , saying ' abby - delighted that you 've joined labour - welcome
' while abby seems to be a genuine labour supporter and a level - headed teen - she 's declined giving interviews in favour of revising for her upcoming exams , others seem to be more preoccupied with ed 's physical appearance than his abilities to run the country
' one user @ helen121 defended criticism of ed , saying he 's ' not " mouldy " , he 's hot ! ' another , @ helenamelia_xox , said ' if i ever met ed miliband i actually would cry he 's so hot ' maybe one day : labour fan @ sophiephilips1 dreams that ed will visit her in the south west teen angst : @ theurbanangel described her crush on ed as ' painful ' internet jokers have also got in on the act , posting mocked - up images of ed as various heartthrobs
' unlikely heartthrob : images of the opposition leader looking sultry for a newspaper article have been shared by twitter users in an attempt to make the labour leader look cool , twitter users have begun editing his face on to the body of famous men , including daniel craig as james bond in movie casino royale ed milibond : dressed in a suave grey suit , the labour leader is superimposed on yet another photograph of secret agent , james bond windswept : while tv viewers swooned over aidan turner 's poldark , ed has consistently polled low in popularity ratings not buying it : the drastic reworking of ed comes after he gained a reputation for appearing in awkward pictures , including eating a bacon sandwich ( pictured here on the body of don draper , from mad men ) he continues : ' this morning i saw a tweet by the young woman who i think originated # milifandom and it seems she was doing it because she supports labour and does n't like the way ed is portrayed
ed was mobbed by a screaming hen party â and even let the bride on his tour bus for a private ' selfie ' the bride - to - be 's sister , kathryn braithwaite , posted a picture of nicola and ed on the campaign bus just last week , the labour leader was mobbed by a screaming hen party - and even let the bride on his tour bus for a ' selfie '
