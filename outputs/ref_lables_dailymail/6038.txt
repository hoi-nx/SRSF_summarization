aside from making a fighter jet lightweight , agile and astonishingly fast , engineers of one the world 's most advanced aircraft have another , more surprising issue to contend with : the moon
bae system 's typhoon is so accurate that even the movements of the tide can disrupt the jet fighter 's positioning and accuracy
to counteract even the slightest shifts in gravitational pull , experts must build the jet on ' floating ' concrete rafts that move in sync with the moon
' this helps its â fly by wire â computer system to accurately control the aircraft , designed to be unstable but hugely agile these rafts measure 59ft ( 18 metres ) long and 9.8ft ( 3 metres ) thick and are used to house the measuring equipment
two laser trackers and nine jacks are positioned on a single surface , to make sure all movement is relative , and they control the alignment of the barges by cancelling out the subtle effects of the moon and the tides it creates
' this helps its â fly by wire â computer system to accurately control the aircraft , designed to be unstable but hugely agile , and this build accuracy can save enough fuel to fill up an average family car , or around 60 litres
the typhoon can take off in less than 8 seconds , achieve supersonic speeds in under 30 seconds and reach altitudes of 36,000 feet mach 1.6 in under two and a half minutes

' lancashire - based bae systems paid Â£ 2.5 million ( $ 3.7 million ) for this setup and said the ' result is one of the most perfectly aligned fast jet airframes in the world

it takes light from the sun eight minutes to reach earth and the firm said the typhoon can travel from london to paris in the same time

it also lets pilots ' see ' enemy aircraft through the body of the plane

and to reduce pilot workload , the typhoon has a voice throttle and stick ( vtas ) system which means the pilot can keep his hand on the throttle and operate the majority of the aircraft âs controls from this position
