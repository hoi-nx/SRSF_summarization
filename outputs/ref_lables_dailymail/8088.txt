it was a fishing trip with a very big catch â namely the Â£ 9 homemade rowing boat in which the two anglers ventured out on to the open sea
the bungling fishermen who had to be rescued from their diy boat , who have been named as jones , right , and toms , left the diy boat used by a pair of fisherman , who had to be rescued by a lifeboat crew
the men cobbled it together using insulation boards , scrap plywood , laminate flooring , coat hangers and silicone glue the anglers had already taken the boat out to sea the day before their rescue without any problems
they got the materials to build the boat for free and spent Â£ 9 on silicone glue to hold the boat together a lifeboat crew arrived to find neither man wearing a lifejacket , and one unable to swim
despite the experience , one of the men yesterday pledged to return to the water with another homemade boat
the long and the short of it is that this time one of the oars snapped
they were proper oars but one snapped at the join so we were stranded with only one oar
â the boat was put together by mr toms âs friend jones , who scavenged 4in - thick insulation board , polystyrene and scrap wood
the diy boat during its construction
the pair used scrap wood that they had found and spent just Â£ 9 buying silicone adhesive as well as using scraps of wood , the pair also made a diy anchor using a 15 metre rope and a lump of scrap iron after rescuing the men , who were found without lifejackets the clacton rnli crew had to bring the boat to the shore after the rescue , clacton rnli returned the fishing equipment to the pair before they destroyed the unseaworthy boat one of the men , named as toms , who had to be rescued coathanger wire was used to make the rowlocks , the rings on either side of the boat that provide the pivot for the oars
â the pair , from jaywick , lost their anchor , made from scrap iron , in the rescue
joff strutt , of clacton rnli , said the lifeboat crew had been stunned by the men âs stupidity
