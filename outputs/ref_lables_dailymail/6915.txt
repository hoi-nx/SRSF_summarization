those surprised at yaya toure 's apparent desire to talk himself in to a transfer from city this week should not be
yaya toure , for example , left home as a teenager to play in the belgian second division
equally , though , yaya toure 's rather clumsy statements of recent times should not be allowed to detract from his legacy at city and indeed in the premier league
it looks likely yaya toure may leave city this summer but his legacy should be a positive one yaya toure has struggled to impose himself upon games for city in the manner seen in previous seasons yaya toure 's time at city is defined as a success , bringing two premier league titles to the etihad stadium it looks extremely likely that he will leave england this summer
at his club , yaya toure has been fundamental to city 's transition from wealthy hopefuls to twice champions
back in 2010 , he arrived as a statement signing - a Â£ 24m fee and Â£ 1m a month â for a club determined to accelerate its own learning curve
i once asked a member of city 's coaching staff if there was anybody quicker at the club than micah richards
' we had a good team so it was not that hard for me that night , ' yaya toure told this newspaper in december 2011
yaya toure ( right ) demonstrated his versatily by shackling cristiano ronaldo in the 2009 champions league final midfield player toure ( left ) signed for city for a fee of Â£ 24million from barcelona in 2010 hughes , the then city boss , begun a plan to sign kolo toure in an attempt to entice yaya toure along in that same interview , yaya toure admitted that he liked to listen to whitney houston in his car on the way to training
though he did n't arrive at city until five summers ago , city 's pursuit of yaya toure had actually started eighteen months earlier in the january window of 2009
stunned by a home fa cup defeat to nottingham forest , city 's then manager hughes presented the club 's board with a list of transfer targets
yaya toure , then in his barcelona pomp , was on it and so , cleverly , was his brother
the two brothers â as close as could be â had always wanted to play together domestically and kolo 's subsequent recruitment from arsenal in the summer of 2009 was the trigger for the arrival of yaya toure a year later
nevertheless , yaya toure 's arrival remains one of the pivotal moments in the development of the modern city
the plan worked , with both ivory coast players gradually signing , but hughes had been sacked by then yaya toure ( left ) is a quiet figure away from the field and refuted reports of a fall - out with mario yaya toure ( centre ) led city to the premier league title 2012 and inspired an important victory at newcastle away from the field , the lumbering yaya toure has always been a relatively gentle soul
' that trip never took place but on the field yaya toure fulfilled the promises he made when he arrived
city were up and running and when yaya toure scored from 30 yards at newcastle a year later , a first premier league title was on its way
yaya toure ( left ) also led city to fa cup glory in 2011 with a decisive goal against united in the semi-final yaya toure also scored city 's winning goal against stoke city in the fa cup final in 2011 yaya toure delivered the trophies that he was brought in to do and will be missed at city when he departs this season , yaya toure has not been at his best
city still win lots of games when yaya toure starts , though
