researchers have found that rats can recognise pain the faces of their fellow rodents
researchers based at different institutions in tokyo , noted that rats flatten their ears , narrow their eyes and puff up their cheeks when they are in pain ( shown in the images on the right ) â an observation in previous studies researchers based at different institutions in tokyo , noted that rats flatten their ears , narrow their eyes and puff up their cheeks when they are in pain â an observation in previous studies
the scientists first took photographs of rats who were in pain and others with neutral expressions
to test the rodents ' response to rats â pained expressions , they showed them the photos in a specially made cage , to test whether they responded to the face , rather than the smell of another animal , for example
to test the rodent âs response to rats â pained expressions , they showed them the photos in a specially made cage ( pictured )
they found that rats spent less time in the room showing rodents in pain , than they did in the other compartment showing rats with neutral facial expressions male mice sing to woo females , scientists claim
each rat was allowed to wander freely around the cage for 10 minutes while the researchers recorded how long it spent in each room
they found that rats spent more time in the rooms where they did nât have to confront the image of a rat in pain
' â¦ the rats stayed longer in the compartment with the images of neutral expressions than in that with the images of pain expressions , â the study says
â on average , they spent one minute less in the pain room , than the compartment showing a rat with a neutral expression
while the scientists did nât say that the study suggests mice can empathise , they believe that their facial expressions have evolved to communicate pain
