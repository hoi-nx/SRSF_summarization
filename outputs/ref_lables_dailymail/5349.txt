hundreds of thousands of people who bought bg shares in the 1980s are in line for a windfall after their investment soared in value last night
the shares are one of the most popular in the uk due to the hugely successful â sid â advertising campaign when bg was privatised
last night shares in what is now called the bg group rose by nearly 30 per cent to 1,153p
the shares are one of the most popular in the uk due to the hugely successful â tell sid â advertising campaign when bg was privatised the rise came after the oil giant royal dutch shell announced plans to buy bg group in a Â£ 47billion deal
it is one of the biggest takeovers ever
the share sell - off , which encouraged people to spread news of the offer with the slogan â if you see sid , tell him â , saw more than 1.5million people pay 135p a share when the company was listed on the stock exchange
the holding across the now separate companies of centrica , national grid and bg group , is currently worth more than Â£ 1,604
but the windfall pales in comparison to the rewards for bg group âs newly arrived chief executive lund who could be in line for more than Â£ 30million in pay and perks if the deal completes next year
