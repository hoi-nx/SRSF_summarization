to hear griffiths tell it , the intervention staged by celtic boss ronny deila and assistant john collins was definitely closer to a kick in the what - nots than it was a pat on the back
whatever the detail of the conversation , and however lasting the effects may be , the short - term impact on the 24 - year - old force of nature â often as unruly and unpredictable as a whirlwind â has been nothing short of remarkable
â hat - trick hero griffiths with signed match ball and man of the match award rather revealing , is nât it ? clearly demanding ronny deila and original gym rat john collins did not hold back in dealing with the gifted but wild natural talent , wielding a big stick in a bid to persuade griffiths that the carrot was nât such a bad alternative to chips and tea cakes
i had a talk with the manager and john collins about everything and about what they wanted me to do
i did that and i have been bang on form since the turn of the year
â when i was at hibernian , i would have been the first name on the team sheet given the goals i scored
â i was brought to celtic to score goals and i âve started to do that since the turn of the year
celtic 's griffiths ( right ) completes his hat - trick against kilmarnock â the manager selects the team he thinks is best to win the game and we have boys in the squad and coming on from the bench
â myself , anthony stokes , stuart armstrong , gary mackay-steven were all on the bench against kilmarnock
â griffiths is making a stronger case than most by banging in the goals , his hat - trick in wednesday night âs 4 - 1 home win over kilmarnock definitely ranking among the better substitute performances the scottish game has seen this season
his second treble haul in celtic colours took his total for the season to 15 goals , the majority of those coming in 2015 , as he has contended more frequently with guidetti , stefan scepovic and anthony stokes for the lone striker âs role favoured â for now , at least â by ronny deila
watching guidetti amble around aimlessly until griffiths arrived to partner the big swede on wednesday night , it definitely seems as though ronny deila has only two options for sunday âs scottish cup semi-final against inverness
or he lets griffiths , scorer of an early opener against inverness in the highlands last weekend , loose on his own at hampden
substitute griffiths came off the bench to spark celtic into life after lacklustre first - half the extra-time hero as he scored his second of the game to ease hibernian past falkirk 4 - 3 at this stage of the scottish cup two years ago , griffiths also opened the scoring for celtic against rangers in the league cup semi earlier this season
â if griffiths starts and plays as he did against kilmarnock , even inverness at their most obdurate will struggle to cope
celtic manager ronny deila ( left ) congratulates griffiths after the final whistle â it was nât a bad night âs work , â he says with a smile
and we had suffered a setback , going 1 - 0 down to kilmarnock , although the boys fought back in the right way
my second one came for celtic against inverness last year
celtic start as favourites on sunday and , with hibernian also edging the odds in their semi against falkirk , griffiths could spend may 30 torn between professional pride and genuine love for his hometown team
asked outright if he would like to face hibernian , balancing up the desire to become a treble winner against the need to condemn his boyhood heroes to at least one more year of scottish cup taunts , griffiths admitted : â honest answer , no ! â if they get there , it will be great for the club , but i âm just concentrating on doing my job for celtic
