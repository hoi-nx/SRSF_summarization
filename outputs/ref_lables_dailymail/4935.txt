chelsea were made to work hard for their three points against stoke at stamford bridge on saturday but eden hazard starred for jose mourinho 's team
he slotted chelsea ahead in typically composed fashion from the penalty spot before charlie adam equalised with an astonishing strike from inside his own half shortly before half time
stoke continued to make things difficult for chelsea until an begovic error led to loic remy tapping in the winner
chelsea ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) thibaut courtois â 5.5 never called into action in the opening 43 minutes but beaten by charlie adam with an incredible strike from inside stoke âs half
thibaut courtois was on the winning team but will want to forget charlie adam beating him from his own half gary cahill ( left ) and terry leap up to block an attempt at goal from stoke 's wollscheid branislav ivanovic â 6.5 tidied up well on the rare occasion stoke threatened
played with more freedom once chelsea had the lead and tried to help in attack down the wing
gary cahill â 6 .5 looked cool when called into action and was able to clear the danger as stoke tried to cross their way into the lead in the second half
terry â 7 manned the back well and it took a goal - of - the - season contender for his team to concede against a stoke side that ran out of ideas at times
matic â 6 a few too many misplaced passes and a hurried clearance almost spelled danger for chelsea
brazil international willian ( left ) also produced an impressive display for chelsea in the win over stoke eden hazard put chelsea into the lead with from the penalty spot in the first half costa 's ( right ) game was curtailed 10 minutes after coming on with what looked like a hamstring injury willian â 7.5 a handful for stoke as he , oscar and hazard linked up well to create chances in the first half , though they were never taken
oscar â 6.5 scuppered one of chelsea âs best chances to take the lead by placing his shot wide of the far post , and was ultimately â and unfortunately â sacrificed for costa at half time
eden hazard â 8.5 a live wire
ultimately kept his cool from the spot to give chelsea a much - needed lead before charlie adam âs equaliser
loic remy - 7.5 looked a worthy replacement for costa as he twice went close to giving chelsea the lead in the opening seven minutes
loic remy ( left ) slots in chelsea 's winner against stoke in the second half at stamford bridge subs : costa â 6 came on but could do no damage as he was forced off with what looked like another hamstring injury
juan cuadrado â 6 little to do but helped chelsea get over the line
jose mourinho was active throughout the game on the touchline as chelsea beat stoke 2 - 1 stoke ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) begovic â 6.5 outstanding one - handed save at full stretch to deny loic remy âs deflected shot after less than three minutes
he âd done his homework , going the same way eden hazard normally does , but beaten at the other side
ryan shawcross ( right ) led stoke well but could not help his side take a point at stamford bridge wollscheid ( right ) slides in on cesc fabregas to concede a penalty in the first half , from which eden hazard scored marc wilson â 5.5 a little unsure at times , largely down to a lack of communication between him and his team - mates
steven nzonzi ( centre ) went close to scoring for stoke but ultimately did not impose himself on the game charlie adam ( second left ) is mobbed by his team - mates after his astonishing strike levelled the scores charlie adam â 6.5 take a bow , charlie adam
a little anonymous until that moment , but his faults were obliterated with that 66 - yard strike
jonathan walters ( left ) had little joy for stoke against chelsea on saturday , despite his hard work mame biram diouf ( left ) floundered against chelsea 's stern defence at stamford bridge on saturday subs : arnautovic â 6 too little too late to have an influence
