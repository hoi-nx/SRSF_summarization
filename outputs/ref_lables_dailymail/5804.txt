manziel was spotted for the first time since being released from rehab
the footballer checked into a facility on january 28 after stating that he wanted to ' be a better family member , friend and teammate , ' and tuesday night the cleveland browns quarterback was seen enjoying a texas rangers game with girlfriend colleen crowley
this as offseason workouts with the team will begin next monday , april 20
now comes the real test however , as he will be forced to compete with josh mccown for the starting quarterback position , who just signed a $ 14 million contract with the team that covers the next three seasons
this after a rookie season in which he saw limited game time and suffered difficult losses in his only two starts , manziel was no doubt hoping to step out of the spotlight following the end of the cleveland browns season last december , but talk soon turned to whether or not the accomplished footballer might have a problem
especially after one incident last year when , after partying until well past midnight , manziel , who is suffering from an injured hamstring , skipped out on a saturday morning team treatment session because he overslept , and in turn was fined by the cleveland browns
' and while his season may have been over at that time , many believed manziel would still tone things down for a bit in the wake of that controversy , which made it all the more shocking when he was spotted partying at fdr lounge at the delano in miami on over the new year holiday , alongside the likes of lebron james and ryan phillippe , and then seen chugging champagne straight from the bottle while sitting poolside with girlfriend colleen crowley and some buddies poolside at the delano
' manziel was known for his partying while at texas a&m , but said he was a changed man during the 2014 nfl , noting that he had ' grown up , ' before being selected 22nd overall by cleveland browns
just days into his training with the cleveland browns however , the local press began calling him out on his partying , which they cited as the major reason for his poor performance on the field
a source told cleveland.com at the time ; ' team officials had bought into manziel 's pre-draft promises to tone down the partying and leave his frat - boy lifestyle back in college station , texas , and they 've been stunned by his non-stop antics
' a photo snapped of manziel before the start of the season and later posted to instagram showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter manziel while the 2013 heisman trophy as the quarterback of the texas a&m university aggies also causing some alarm before the season even began was a photo snapped of manziel and later posted to instagram that showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter , leading some to suggest that he might have been snorting cocaine
manziel is now set to begin offseason workouts with the cleveland browns on april 20 as for his future with the cleveland browns , that is a little unclear
' gordon was also out with manziel and showed up late for the team walk - through , an offense that carried a far stiffer punishment for the starter as he was forced to sit out the final game of the season
currently , manziel has a four year contract with the cleveland browns worth about $ 8.25 million
