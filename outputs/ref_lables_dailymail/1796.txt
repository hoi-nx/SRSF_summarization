doctors have called for under - fours to be given free vitamins after a rise in the number of cases of rickets due to a lack of exposure to sunlight
the country 's chief medical officer sally davies is said to be concerned at the number of children suffering from the condition , which is caused by a deficiency in vitamin d. the disease , a scourge of victorian britain , was virtually eradicated after the second world war but is returning as more and more youngsters are used to staying indoors playing video games than going outside
the move is being supported by one of uk 's leading experts on vitamin d deficiency at university college hospital london alastair sutcliffe , who has spoken about an ' epidemic ' of cases due to a lack of sun exposure and overuse of sunscreen
he told the sunday times : ' nothing is free but the cost of the ill - effects of deficiency , such as rickets and anaemia from families not providing children with these supplements is greater for the nhs
' rickets is caused by a deficiency in vitamin d and causes bone deformities such as bowed legs , pictured , and a curvature of the spine rickets , which is also known as soft bones , can cause deformities such as bowed legs and a curvature of the spine
professor davies has previously spoken out about the advantages of giving free vitamins to young children
a scheme has already been set up in deprived areas of birmingham handing out supplements , which has halved the number of cases of rickets and other deficiency problems
professor davies said the uk âs record on children âs health used to be â one of the best but we are now the worst â
