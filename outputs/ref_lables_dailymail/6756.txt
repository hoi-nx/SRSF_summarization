' frankly terrifying ' : care staff ( not pictured , file image ) say they are increasingly being asked to perform tasks previously only carried out by nurses
these include changing colostomy bags and administering morphine the worrying conclusions come in a survey of 1,000 workers employed by councils and private firms by trade union unison
caroline abrahams , charity director at uk , said : â the idea that untrained care workers are administering drugs like morphine is frankly terrifying
survey findings : almost a quarter giving medication such as morphine or insulin had received no training â it can also have devastating consequences if care workers do nât have enough training to be able to appropriately communicate â with people with dementia often ending up in hospital as a result
â other findings include that more than half of home carers have not been shown how to care for people with colostomy bags and 45 per cent have not been trained to change a catheter bag
â the uk homecare association , which represents firms running services for councils , admits workers are â often called upon to undertake roles previously undertaken by registered nurses â
