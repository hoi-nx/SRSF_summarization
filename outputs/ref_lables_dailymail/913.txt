this week the world has been amazed by the story of a german pensioner who is pregnant with quadruplets at the age of 65
' someone who understands annegret raunigk 's position well is britain 's older mother , sue tollefsen , from essex
now seven , freya has often asked her mother if she could have a brother or sister and as a result , sue tollefsen revealed that she did consider it
' freya went through a period of wanting a sibling and i looked into fertility treatment to have another child but because i 've had health issues i decided not to push my luck , ' she said on today 's this morning
the retired special needs teacher said ' in a way ' she thinks annegret raunigk is ' selfish ' for having more babies at her age - despite leaving motherhood till late in life herself
but if she has thought about it and weighed up the positive and negative and said " this is the right thing for me " then that 's her decision
' now aged 64 , sue tollefsen told presenters phillip schofield and amanda holden that she never intended to leave parenthood so late
sue tollefsen , left , became pregnant thanks to ivf when she was 57
