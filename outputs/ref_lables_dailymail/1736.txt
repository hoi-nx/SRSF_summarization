many teenagers are tempted to try e-cigarettes , but few adopt the electronic devices as habit , a new study has found many teenagers are tempted to try e-cigarettes , but few become regular users , scientists have discovered
in fact , they found most of those teens who do try e-cigarettes are also smokers
this suggests young people are not using the electronic alternatives to try and quit their habits - nor are they getting hooked on them after initially trying them
experts at cardiff university found use of e-cigarettes at least once was more common than having smoked a conventional cigarette in all age groups , bar the oldest ( 15 to 16 year olds )
but only 1.5 per cent of those aged 11 to 16 said they regularly used the electronic devices - defined as at least once a month
the odds of regular e-cigarette use were 100 times higher among current weekly smokers than among non-smokers , and 50 times higher among those who had smoked cannabis the strong link between current smoking and e-cigarette use suggests that teens are not using these products to help them quit smoking , the researchers said
the cardiff university study noted most of those teens who do try e-cigarettes are also smokers , suggesting they are not using the electronic alternatives to try and quit their habits professor peter hajek , director of the tobacco dependence research unit , at queen mary university of london , said : ' the results of this large survey tally with all other available data and the picture is consistently reassuring
' about a fifth of regular smokers are using e-cigarettes , which is not a concern because e-cigarettes are less likely to harm users than are tobacco cigarettes
' it does not show us anything about whether e-cigarettes help teenagers quit
