the culprits behind the hatton garden raid may have carried out a similarly audacious burglary just two years earlier in berlin , it has emerged
in a case which has strikingly similar traits to the Â£ 60m heist in london , thieves targeted 294 security vaults during a break - in at the volksbank in steglitz , berlin , in january 2013
the gang , who fled the bank with diamonds , gold and silver worth more than Â£ 8.3m , have never been found
during that near - identical raid - one of the biggest in london 's jewellery quarter - 71 security boxes were raided before the gang made off with wheelie bins full of precious stones
likewise , robbers in london used a heavy duty drill to bore holes into a reinforced , two - metre - thick wall so they could gain access to the safety deposit boxes
suspects caught on cctv during the london heist were also dressed as construction workers - a tactic used in the berlin raid in a similar fashion to the germany heist , the burglars timed their raid over the easter bank holiday , entering after the premises emptied on thursday night and leaving on easter sunday the men then climbed back up to the ground floor to let other gang members in through a side entrance , before all making their way to the vaults where they drilled their way inside
and in berlin , police said the thieves had expert knowledge of the layout of the vaults , reiterated by the time they were afforded to create their all - important tunnel
cctv from the london heist also shows how the suspects dressed as construction workers and gasmen
police investigating the berlin theft were stumped when they discovered a giant hole cut through the wall with what appeared to be four cylindrical devices the tunnel was not discovered until 6am on monday morning when the robbers set fire to the impressive tunnel which breached one of the bank 's walls meanwhile , in berlin , police believe the robbers may have spent weeks digging the tunnel after renting a nearby lock - up garage under a false name , which they used to gain access to the strongroom
in germany , private security guards were also blamed for ignoring an alarm which went off in the volksbank 's vaults two days before the crime was discovered
in the 1986 robbery , the gang tunneled into a bank vault over a long weekend , triggering alarms on the friday that were not investigated , before raiding safety deposit boxes stored inside the vaults
in both cases , heavy duty drills were used to break through concrete to gain access to the stolen goods value of items taken , including jewels , said to be between Â£ 60m and Â£ 200m
raid took place over three - day easter weekend when workers had left building
71 safety deposit boxes raided
value of items taken , including diamonds , gold and silver , said to be Â£ 8.3m
294 security vaults broken into
