the fa , the oldest knockout football competition in the world , is set to be rebranded as the emirates fa cup in a new Â£ 30million sponsorship deal in a move that will upset traditionalists , the fa are understood to have secured a three - year contract with emirates
the deal , due to be rubber - stamped by the fa board on thursday , is believed to be worth at least Â£ 10million a year â but comes at a cost for lovers of the 144 - year - old competition
arsenal won last season 's fa competition , which will be rebranded the emirates fa cup villa will face the holders arsenal in this season 's final at wembley renaming it the emirates fa cup is a lot closer to title sponsorship than the previous â in association with budweiser â agreement , which was worth Â£ 9m annually
emirates have big money to spend after deciding last november not to renew their Â£ 30m - a - year fifa sponsorship for the 2018 and 2022 world cups with the corruption allegations surrounding those tournaments said to be a consideration
and the ambition is for the whole fa sponsorship portfolio to be worth Â£ 20m by 2018
