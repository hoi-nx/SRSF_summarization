mourinho had just made his first impression on the champions league by knocking out manchester united with unfancied porto
sir fergie and mourinho formed a firm friendship despite being fierce rivals fergie 's manchester united were stunned by mourinho 's porto in the champions league in 2004 mourinho sprinted down the touchline in celebration at porto 's last - gasp goal that sealed qualification ' that was when i felt the two faces of such a big man , ' said mourinho
but when we beat manchester united in the champions league i got that beautiful face of a manager which i try to have myself
his many spats with arsene wenger have seen him form a bitter rivalry with the arsenal boss , with mourinho 's accusation in 2005 that the frenchman is like ' a voyeur ' perhaps being the moment their relationship hit an all - time low , from which it has never recovered
mourinho claims to have learned respect from fergie , but he has had many spats with arsene wenger he also had a frosty relationship with guardiola when the pair were rival managers in spanish the 52 - year - old , who looks set to claim his third barclays premier league title with chelsea this season , also formed a spiteful relationship with guardiola while the pair duelled for honours in spanish
