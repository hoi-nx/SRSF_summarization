it 's such a crying shame that only now are people starting to realise what a vital player carrick is to england
when captain wayne rooney said after the draw in italy on tuesday that carrick was the ' best player on the pitch by a mile ' , and that he ' dictated the game ' he summed up what england have been missing since he signed for manchester united in 2006
successive england managers kept beating themselves up trying to solve the lampard / gerrard conundrum in midfield , but ironically it was a scot who presented the answer to them
carrick gets ahead of italy striker ciro immobile during tuesday night 's friendly in turin carrick applauds the travelling england supporters in turin after winning his 33rd cap against italy for all carrick 's achievements with manchester united , he has been consistently overlooked by england sir alex ferguson signed carrick for Â£ 18million , trusted him in midfield , and manchester united dominated domestically and even became champions of europe in an era when guardiola , lionel messi and barcelona were taking their place in history as one of the greatest ever club sides
that 's why i firmly believe that had carrick been a regular in england 's midfield for the past 10 years , we would have won a major tournament in that time
carrick has a 100 per cent record with england at the world cup
he 's only ever played in one game at the tournament , and england won it 1 - 0 against ecuador in the round of 16 in 2006
sven goran eriksson dropped him for the next game , the quarter - final against portugal , and england went out
what followed is inexplicable : from october 2006 through to september 2012 carrick did n't play a single meaningful competitive game for england
sir alex ferguson realised the abilities that carrick could bring to his manchester united team carrick gets stuck in to lionel messi during the champions league final with barcelona in rome carrick has played in 377 matches for manchester united in his nine seasons with the club carrick ( right ) has lifted the premier league trophy on five occasions at old trafford premier league ( 5 ) : 2006 - 07 , 2007 - 08 , 2008 - 09 , 2010 - 11 , 2012 - 13 football league cup ( 1 ) : 2009 - 10 fa community shield ( 5 ) : 2007 , 2008 , 2010 , 2011 , 2013 uefa champions league ( 1 ) : 2007 - 08 fifa club world cup ( 1 ) : 2008 in that same time period carrick won four premier league titles , a champions league , and played in two other champions league finals
who called it right ? alex ferguson kept winning trophies , but mclaren failed to qualify for the 2008 european championships , while fabio capello 's 2010 world cup campaign in south africa was lifeless worse still , fabio capello took carrick to that tournament , but then did n't give him a single minute on the pitch
carrick celebrates his recent goal for manchester united against tottenham at old trafford carrick celebrates with wayne rooney after scoring a vital goal for manchester united at wigan in may 2009 carrick has n't scored too many goals during his career but his stunner against roma in 2007 stands out carrick 's goal set manchester united on their way to a 7 - 1 victory that registers amongst their great european nights carrick must have been wondering why he 'd bothered leaving his wife and newborn son to go to the other side of the world and watch that horrible mess
gary neville told me this about carrick : ' the players that play with him love him , and sir alex ferguson has picked him in probably 95 per cent of games during the most successful period of manchester united 's history
in turin on tuesday , ross barkley and andros townsend caught the eye with their impact , but they were afforded the freedom to run with the ball , take risks and be adventurous because carrick was so disciplined behind them
two years ago i went to manchester united 's training ground to interview carrick
carrick celebrates with robin van persie ( left ) and adnan januzaj after scoring against fulham last season carrick has won five premier league titles at manchester united - the last of which came in 2013 carrick jumps for joy after robin van persie scored a last - minute free - kick at manchester city in 2012 carrick was never able to convince england manager fabio capello to give him a regular starting berth carrick was handed his england debut back in 2001 when mexico were beaten 4 - 0 at pride park in derby carrick shadows marco verratti during england 's ill - fated european championship quarter - final in 2012 he put it very simply : ' i 'm just there to help the defence and act as extra cover for them really , to stop the supply into opposition front players
his best performance in an england shirt came in berlin in 2008 when england won 2 - 1
carrick 's finest hour came in 2008 as england defeated germany 2 - 1 in berlin 's olympiastadion carrick performs a similar role to spain 's holding midfielder sergio busquets marcos senna has also performed the carrick role for the spanish team with great success carrick may not quite be at the level of italy 's pirlo but he 's the closest england have got those two winners have over 100 caps between them , and only three goals
which is why watching england struggle to deal with him at the last world cup made roy hodgson 's decision to leave carrick at home bewildering
what a shame previous england managers could n't see what sir alex ferguson was showing them
louis van gaal has quickly come to appreciate carrick since arriving at manchester united carrick 's performances against arsenal have drawn praise from the gunners boss arsene wenger ' i think carrick is an underrated player in england and sometimes not only should the goalscorer be rewarded but also the real players at the heart of the game
have a look at manchester united 's season â the better runs for the team have come when carrick has been fit
while manchester united were winning with him , england were losing without him
would england have won the euros , or a world cup with carrick in the team ? i think so
