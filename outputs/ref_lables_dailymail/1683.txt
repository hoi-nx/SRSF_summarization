while google and apple are developing self driving vehicles , nasa has revealed its vision - and its a lot more fun
called the modular robotic vehicle , or mrv , it was developed at nasa 's johnson space center to show off the technologies that could let man move across other planets
on earth , however , it also has some neat tricks - from the ability to park sideways to being able to spin on the spot , as well as being driven remotely at up to 70mph
a turn of the steering wheel , for instance , is recorded by sensors and sent to computers at the rear of the vehicle
these computers interpret that signal and instruct motors at one or all four of the wheels to move at the appropriate rate , causing the vehicle to turn as commanded
nasa says the vehicles was buit ' in order to advance technologies that have applications for future vehicles both in space and on earth
each e-corner can be controlled independently and rotated Â± 180 degrees about its axis
the driving mode can be switched so that all four wheels point and move in the same direction achieving an omni - directional , crab - like motion
this makes a maneuver such as parallel parking as easy as driving next to an available spot , stopping , and then operating sideways to slip directly in between two cars
' this two - seater vehicle was designed to meet the growing challenges and demands of urban transportation , ' said mason , also with johnson space center
ridley told an nasa magazine : ' it 's like driving on ice but having complete control
' the buggy can also be controlled remotely , and in the future nasa says this system can be expanded to allow for autonomous driving

' the technologies developed in mrv have direct application in future manned vehicles undertaking missions on the surface of earth 's moon , on mars , or even an asteroid
