most parents have the souvenir of a scan of their child in the womb at 12 weeks
the must - have for ivf mums and dads these days , however , is a video and pictures right from the moment of conception
the images are thanks to revolutionary technology that allows medics to record the microscopic miracle of life â from fertilisation to the division of cells , right through to the growth of an embryo
hundreds of parents are now the proud owners of these embryoscope images , which are also helping scientists learn more about the ivf process
as well as allowing parents to watch back the moment the embryos form , the technology â developed in the us â also allows experts to select the best possible embryos based on how they form during the conception process
the morleys , from walsall , had spent months trying to have children naturally before opting for ivf
â while the couple were undergoing ivf , the embryoscope technology was introduced at the midland fertility clinic , allowing them to be the first in their area to capture their child âs conception on camera
the technology allows medics and parents to watch the cell dividing
experts have hailed the technology as one of the most important developments in ivf
