the second i saw you by lorna c. beckett during his easter sermon of 1915 , the dean of st paul âs read out rupert brooke âs poem the soldier , which begins : â if i should die , think only this of me : / that there âs some corner of a foreign field / that is forever england
â rupert brooke 's ( pictured ) poem the soldier made him famous outside of literary circles before then , brooke was known only in literary circles
brooke âs death at 27 from blood poisoning en route to gallipoli duly cemented his image as the poster - boy of heroic self - sacrifice
the love story it tells was unknown until 2000 , when a british library curator made a thrilling discovery : more than 100 letters exchanged between brooke and an art student called phyllis gardner , together with her secret memoir of their relationship , written in 1918
at times , admittedly , those comments do smack of chick - lit clichÃ©s ( including brooke âs unwillingness â to commit â and phyllis gardner âs need to â move on â
the 21 - year - old phyllis gardner first saw brooke on the london to cambridge train in november 1911
luckily , the two moved in similar circles , with brooke studying at king âs college and phyllis gardner âs father an archaeology professor
â nonetheless , phyllis gardner was smitten , not least after , while on a walk together , the two took off their clothes to wade through a river and she dried him afterwards with her hair
â who was i , â she wondered , â that god should give me such piercing joy ? â the trouble was that brooke appeared to have accepted such adoration as essentially his due â and not just from phyllis gardner
in 2000 , love letters between rupert brooke and phyllis gardner were discovered as well as her secret memoir of their relationship which was written in 1918 when , after a few months , he proposed sex , phyllis gardner was delighted , on the heart - breaking grounds that â i thought of myself as the happy mother of his child â â until he made it clear they âd be using contraception
though badly hurt , phyllis gardner naturally sought to excuse brooke âs behaviour , somehow managing to see him as a â poor , lost angel â led astray by his racy friends
â but the book also does full justice to phyllis gardner herself , who died , unmarried , in 1939 at 48
