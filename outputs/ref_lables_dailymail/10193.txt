britain 's five highest - earning nhs dentists are paid average salaries of Â£ 690,000 a year
the sum is almost five times the prime minister âs Â£ 142,500 pay packet â and comes as thousands of patients struggle to get on the books of nhs practices
a further 11 dentists were paid between Â£ 400,000 and Â£ 500,000 and a total of 177 received more than Â£ 200,000
the figures lay bare the huge amounts of taxpayers â money paid to dentists for nhs work , following labour âs introduction of controversial contracts in 2006
under freedom of information laws , the nhs business services authority was asked about the pensionable pay of dentists who do nhs work
in 2012/13 , the latest figures available , five practitioners were paid more than Â£ 500,000
another 11 earned Â£ 400,000 to Â£ 499,999 from the nhs , 30 received Â£ 300,000 to Â£ 399,999 , 131 pocketed Â£ 200,000 to Â£ 299,999 and 1,617 received Â£ 100,000 to Â£ 199,999
yesterday 's daily mail she added : â investment is urgently needed on the front line where there is a desperate shortage of nurses [ and ] patients waiting for hours in a&e â¦ when the nhs is under such huge financial pressure , this type of spending on huge salaries is unacceptable
he added : â it is outrageous that these telephone - number salaries have been hidden from the people who pay them â¦ taxpayers expect the money they put in to the nhs to be spent on patients , not on bumper pay packets
according to the health and social care information centre , 21,500 dentists did nhs work in 2012/13 , but most also do substantial amounts of private work
the british dental association âs mick armstrong said the top - earning dentists â most likely own a group of practices â or are specialists in their area
