evans has shared two incredible stories on social media featuring women who claim that the paleo diet has helped alleviate the symptoms of the incurable disease , multiple sclerosis
a 30 - year - old woman , known only as hollie , wrote that she thought her life was over when she was diagnosed with relapsing - remitting multiple sclerosis in september 2013
but after jumping on the paleo diet bandwagon , hollie claims she has not suffered any ms symptoms over the past 12 months , her depression has gone and she feels healthier than ever
hollie 's experience led the sydney celebrity chef to share her testimonial with his 868,000 - plus followers on facebook on saturday
the australians chef also shared a similarly remarkable testimony by marg , another ms sufferer
the woman claimed she has seen significant health improvements after being on evans ' 10 weeks paleo program
' i have had a lot of health issues the past years , mainly auto - immune stuff including ms , ' she wrote in the online post on tuesday
the celebrity chef has been a proud paleo advocate ' having ms means i 'm always sapped of energy , have numbness , pins and needles , pain , poor concentration , etc. not any more ! ' marg says she was recently able to walk up and down a flight of 811 stairs
' the revelation comes after the outspoken paleo advocate posted a 2,100 word rant on social media claiming that the modern australians diet is behind the rise in autism
the my kitchen rules judge has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting the benefits of a ' caveman diet ' that cuts out grains , legumes , sugar and dairy
but hollie has praised evans for his endorsement of the controversial diet , saying ' the way you are changing the lives of others by leading an example is remarkable '
' in another recent facebook post , the australians chef shared a similarly remarkable testimony by marg who also suffers from ms evans has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting a controversial caveman ' diet ' however associate professor of dietetics and human n at latrobe university , itsiopoulos , pointed out that hollie 's diet might have been unhealthy before adapting the paleo lifestyle
' but we do n't actually know if her condition is cured so it 's hard to advocate on because there 's no scientific evidence to back this up
' the paleo diet has been one of the hottest diet trends around and has attracted a raft of celebrity followers even as some health professionals urge caution about interpreting results from the eating plan
' the paleo lifestyle , which evans is a long - time supporter of , bans all dairy , grains , preservatives and sugar the paleo advocate has been encouraging hundreds and thousands of australians to embrace the lifestyle professor of population health and nutrition at the university of south australia o'dea said while the diet seemed to have worked for hollie , it might not work for others
but dr o'dea said the modern paleo diet does not quite follow the way how palaeolithic ancestors lived from more than two million years ago
' the modern paleo diet consists of just lean meat but our ancestors ate everything edible , including organs , brains , livers and fat from the carcass of wild animals
