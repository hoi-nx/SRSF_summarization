he had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over , but higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title
he said : ' i 'm feeling relief and pride to beat robert milkins because he 's a dangerous player
' asked directly whether he was a potential champion , higgins initially said : ' nah
i probably know what it takes to win it but there 's more favoured players than me
