she eventually recovered in hospital but will now have to take blood - thinning medication for the rest of her life which have caused her hair to fall out and severe headaches
' i 'd been taking a popular brand of the pill for over a decade with no side effects
' mrs dickson was taken to causeway hospital , coleraine , ireland , after she experienced sharp pains on november 2 last year
after a ct scan , doctors told her she had two blood clots in her left lung - known as pulmonary embolisms - and that the clots had developed after she had been taking the contraceptive pill
the pill can increase the risk of blood clotting because it contains a synthetic version of oestrogen which can very slightly thicken the blood , leading to clots
mrs dickson 's blood clots had developed in her pelvis , moved around her body , and had then become wedged in the lungs
these clots then led to a pleural effusion , a condition which causes fluid to accumulate between the lungs and chest wall
the two pulmonary embolisms became lodged in ms dickson 's lungs , causing a condition known as pleural effusion which leads to fluid accumulating around the lung and can make them collapse mrs dickson was in a wheelchair after she was discharged from hospital and now must take blood thinning drugs for the rest of her life to reduce the risk of further clots developing as this fluid collected , mrs dickson 's left lung then collapsed
she was given a lot of strong painkillers , antibiotics , oxygen and blood - thinning medication to dissolve the clots
surgeons eventually managed to re-inflate mrs dickson 's collapsed lung and nurse her back to recovery
mrs dickson is pictured with her husband dougie when she was discharged from hospital in ireland a month after being discharged from hospital mrs dickson was finally able to plan her wedding the couple are pictured on their wedding day in edinburgh after mrs dickson was released from hospital ' all my plans of a beautiful wedding suddenly seemed so trivial , and i was actually thinking of what i wanted to happen at my funeral
at first taking the combined oral contraceptive pill can cause headaches , nausea and mood swings
oestrogen can make the blood more likely to clot - causing deep vein thrombosis ( in the leg ) , as well as clots in the lungs or brain , causing a stroke
ms dickson had been taking the pill clairette for three years and is now no longer allowed to use it as she can not take anything with oestrogen in it , as it is ' too risky '
ms dickson added : ' the blood - thinning medication i am now on causes severe headaches , nose bleeds , hair loss , nausea and extreme fatigue
