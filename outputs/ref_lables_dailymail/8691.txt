armstrong is brought down by partick thistle 's james craigen leading to a penalty referee willie collum shows james craigen a read card for his ' last man ' challenge on armstrong celtic striker kris commons steps up to convert the penalty to give his side a 1 - 0 lead before the break commons ( right ) races away to celebrates his 45th minute penalty strike midfielder stefan johansen , stand - in skipper in the absence of suspended scott brown , added a second in the 63rd minute as the encounter turned into a hoops procession
stefan johansen doubles celtic 's advantage in the 63rd minute with left - footed shot into the bottom corner stefan johansen is mobbed by his team - mates following his second - half strike parkhead defender virgil van dijk , up for a corner , flicked an armstrong cross against the crossbar at the near post before a desperate blocking tackle by maryhill defender balatoni prevented an almost certain goal from stefan johansen 's drive
balatoni again came to partick thistle rescue in the ninth minute , beating guidetti to a header in front of an empty goal , after left - back emilio izaguirre had troubled fox after surging into the penalty area
moments later , mackay-steven was set up stefan johansen but his goalbound drive from 12 yards was deflected away by partick thistle defender callum booth
