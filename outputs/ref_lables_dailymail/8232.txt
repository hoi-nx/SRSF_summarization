evidence has emerged of a wartime blunder that resulted in millions of pounds of russian bullion , supposedly bound for america , being lost in the river clyde
the bullion was to pay the america for arms shipped to russian during one of the most crucial stages of the second world war
but as a delicate operation began to transfer the cases of treasure onto a waiting boat , one slipped and fell into the muddy waters
in fact , the incident has only come to light thanks to a secret diary kept by one of the ulster hms ulster queen 's engineers , and now revealed by his daughter for the first time in a new book
edinburgh man thomas served on the ulster queen on four convoys to and from murmansk and archangel in russian 's extreme northwest
mr thomas had got into the habit of keeping copious notes and sketches during his pre-war role as a crewman on the research ship discovery in the southern ocean
he continued his writings on the convoys - but aware that should any of his diaries be discovered he would be in serious trouble , he wrote in code and secreted them well
edinburgh man thomas served on the ulster queen on four convoys to and from russian 's extreme northwest leona , 61 , a retired school teacher , said yesterday : ' the story about the russian bullion is fascinating
mr thomas recorded : ' no scuttles [ were ] allowed to be opened , but someone got a gleek out and saw mighty big steam locomotives smothered in soldiers , up and down the cleared area of the track , hundreds of them , all with rifles and many with tommy guns
' once back in the clyde , after ' a fast run down the minches ' , calamity was to come , however
mr thomas wrote : ' it was very late when we saw the welcoming but shaded lights of the boom control vessels , hauling left and right to usher us through the widening but regulated aperture , and suddenly the serenity of approaching a hallowed anchorage and being met by a small but important armada and a lighter
mr thomas , who died in 2000 aged 88 , pictured with his late wife louie in 1996 ' in the shaded lights were many officials , officers , men in good suits , bayonets , torches , clipboards , tarpaulins , surreptitious smokers , but nary an onlooker
the first boxes , two in number , were being hauled toward the lighter , and who knows what happened , but one slipped and fell with a resounding thump and a splash into the clyde
' written in the diaries left for his daughter , mr thomas said : ' i was thankful to keep all these years , the actual daily scroll of some of the harrowing times i found myself in , especially the runs in the arctic waters so fraught with danger , both man - made and that of nature
' mr thomas wrote in his diary how the crew of the ulster hms ulster queen had hoped their ship would be chosen to steam straight for america , so they could ' live it up ' for a few days before returning to war - torn europe
in the end , the decision was apparently made to off - load the cargo in the clyde , for eventual transfer to another vessel for the atlantic crossing
