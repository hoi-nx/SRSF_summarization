europe has been urged to copy australia 's military - led ' stop the boats ' policy to avoid migrant tragedies in the mediterranean
australia pm tony abbott â who sends naval gunboats to turn back asylum seekers before they reach australia â said the eu should ' urgently ' follow his lead
his hardline policy has proved controversial but mr tony abbott said it was the only way to prevent disasters such as the loss of 900 lives when a fishing boat capsized on saturday night
hardline : tony abbott , whose conservative government introduced a military - led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum - seekers before they reach australia , said harsh measures are the only way to stop deaths haunted : surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the mediterranean killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the sicily port city of catania yesterday morning solemn : a young man , bows his head as he makes the short walk from the rescue boat 's deck to the catania shore where hundreds of people had gathered new life : members of the italian police look on as a migrant who survived the ship sinking off the coast of libyan walks the ramp of an italian coast guard 's vessel upon arrival at catania 's port yesterday morning he said : ' the only way you can stop the deaths is to stop the boats
' conservative mr tony abbott won power in 2013 on a ' stop the boats ' pledge , and not a single one has breached his ring of steel in 18 months
operation sovereign borders involves the australia navy intercepting boats filled with migrants at sea , and either turning them back or towing them back to where they came from
mr tony abbott has previously said he was sick of being lectured to by the united nations over australia 's obligations to refugees , saying his policy was the ' most decent , most compassionate ' solution
in the mediterranean , callous people smugglers have been exploiting a willingness by europe nations to rescue migrants rather than send them back
last year , italian scaled back its rescue operations because it feared they were only encouraging migrants to gamble with their lives

any vessels which manage to get close are taken under naval escort to the pacific islands of nauru or papua new guinea , where they are detained while migrants ' asylum claims are processed
those detained on nauru are sent to cambodia , which is paid to take them by the australia government
any migrants who actually make it to australia by sea are automatically blocked from staying â even if they are found to be genuine refugees
the controversial scheme â which began 18 months ago has been attacked by human rights advocates who say it violates australia 's international obligations
however the government says it has greatly reduced the number of illegal immigrants arriving on australia shores
one of the architects of australia 's tough border policies , retired army major - general molan , said europe leaders were guilty of ' incompetence '
