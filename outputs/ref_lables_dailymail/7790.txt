while many of us have accepted what seemed like the inevitable every month and suffered through them armed with an arsenal of painkillers , hot water bottles and chocolate ( while those nearest and dearest to us run for cover ) , one doctor claims that our pms can be banished forever with just a few simple steps
' pms symptoms such as irritability and cravings are common , but they 're not normal , ' dr lara briden tells daily mail australia
" happy days : the naturopathic doctor says that pms can be banished for good by adapting an anti-inflammatory diet ' i ordered some blood tests for julie , and found that her hormones were normal , which is typical for pms
' i asked julie to stop eating desserts and deep - fried foods
" that 's why i love treating pms
spinach and goat cheese frittata beverages : water , tea or coffee unsweetened muesli with berries ( left ) and scrambled eggs ( right ) are among dr lara briden 's suggested breakfasts in her ' no - more - pms ' diet plan snacks : option 1
gluten - free almond and orange torte made with half the sugar dr lara briden explains that pms has often been dismissed as a myth in the past , but that new research has indicated a link between inflammation and pms
' pms has been a controversial diagnosis because researchers have not been able to detect any difference in the blood levels of hormones of pms - sufferers compared to non-pms - sufferers , ' says dr lara briden
' that has led some researchers to dismiss pms as a myth , but i see it another way
hormonal : pms is caused by your response to the drop in hormones , which depends on the health of your hormone receptors ... a primary cause of unhealthy receptors is chronic inflammation ' of course pms - sufferers have normal hormone levels
that 's because female hormones are not the actual cause of pms
' i 've worked with thousands of pms patients , and i 'm convinced : pms is not caused by hormones , or even by the drop in hormones ( which is inevitable at the end of the menstrual cycle )
instead , pms is caused by your individual response to that drop in hormones
dr lara briden has been a naturopathic doctor specialising in women 's health for 20 years ' this is where it gets interesting
your response to hormones depends on the health and resilience of your hormone receptors , which are the tiny docking stations for your female hormones , and are found in every tissue , including your brain
' your hormone receptors translate hormonal messages into real physical effects such as mood or appetite
' when your receptors are healthy , they 're flexible , and they adapt to rising and falling hormone levels by simply dialling up and dialling down their response ( depending on the level of hormone )
' fortunately , we know what impairs the health of hormone receptors : chronic inflammation
according to a recent study , blood markers of inflammation are higher in pms - sufferers
chronic inflammation is a kind of long - term immune activation that is caused by different things including stress and smoking
it 's also caused by certain inflammatory foods , and that 's why diet is so effective as pms treatment
' off the table : deep fried and sugary foods are the most inflammatory , and therefore should be avoided eat fewer inflammatory foods the most inflammatory foods are deep - fried foods and high - sugar foods such as desserts and sweet drinks , so you should avoid those
sugar and deep fried foods are inflammatory for everyone , but other foods , such as wheat and dairy products , can also be inflammatory if you have a sensitivity to them
food sensitivities are well known to cause symptoms such as sinus or eczema , but they are also a common cause of pms
eat the rainbow : brightly - coloured fruits and vegetables such as berries , spinach and kale provide essential nutrients such as folate and magnesium eat more anti-inflammatory foods the foods that actively reduce inflammation are fruits and vegetables , especially the brightly coloured ones such as berries , spinach , and kale
supplements : dr lara briden recommends mineral magnesium and vitamin b6 to supplement diet supplement with natural anti-inflammatory nutrients my favourite anti-inflammatory nutritional supplement is the mineral magnesium
tip : the no - more - pms diet works to prevent pms
