if a golf course were to be created in hell it might resemble the now serene landscape of gallipoli , where the blood of thousands was spilled a century ago in one of first world war âs most spectacular allied failures
today this beautiful turkish isthmus , facing the aegean to the west , the straits and the sea of marmara to the east , is a patchwork of monuments and memorial stones linked by country lanes , mountain tracks and undulating greenery
allied soldiers land and begin the attack at gallipoli , sometimes known as the gallipoli people have been gathering the graves at beach cemetery at gallipoli to mark the campaigns 's centenary allied cemeteries at gallipoli are kept immaculately by the commonwealth a cross left by a visitor at a graveside in gallipoli bearing a personal thanks to the one of the soldiers killed on a visit ahead of the poignant anniversary , we wandered among anzac âs sea - facing white headstones before heading down to the tip of the peninsula
the mighty ruined fortress of sedd al bahr , brought to its knees by allied naval firepower in 1915 , overlooks the cemetery
the ruins of the fortress at sedd al bahr in gallipoli - its name in turkish means ' barrier to the sea ' seaside homes dot the flat sands and yellow sandstone bluffs rise out of the aegean
a far cry from the fateful morning of april 25 1915 , when one of the bloodiest and most ill - conceived campaigns of the first world war kicked off , a campaign which almost brought to an end the career of its main instigator , churchill , and which witnessed almost 400,000 casualties
the allied plan was as brilliantly simple in conception as it was hopeless in execution : secure the straits and take constantinople , giving access to the black sea to supply the russians in order to free up a new line of attack on the germans
churchill , who was first lord of the admiralty , had underestimated the strength of the turkish troops , under the command of modern turkish âs founding father , atatã¼rk , and had overestimated the potency of his own superannuated fleet , which fell easy prey to the mines and coastal gun batteries
churchill ( left ) had been a soldier , but in 1916 underestimated the turkish forces led by atatã¼rk ( right ) if the naval thrust was a failure , his attempt to consolidate on land was a calamity , and after nine months of blistering summer heat and frostbitten winter nights the ragbag army of dysentery - ridden men was evacuated the following december and january , and churchill was forced to resign his post
the gallipoli war museum has many relics from the campaign from both the allies and turkish sides in addition to 11 rooms , with cinema screens shockingly simulating what it was like in the trenches of gallipoli
items of clothing worn in battle by atatã¼rk who commanded the turkish forces at gallipoli the battle sites and 31 memorials to the 130,000 dead covers a surprisingly small area
this is because allied troops were unable to make much headway against the ferocious onslaught of atatã¼rk âs men
with an impressive flourish of national pride , the turkish government has declared the whole area a historic park , to show the futility of war
you can look down on suvla bay 540m below , where uk troops landed , and walk a few hundred metres along the preserved dug - outs in the footsteps of new zealanders âs wellington battalion , before visiting the new zealanders monument
nearby is kiliã§bayiri , the memorial to the turkish 57th infantry regiment , which was wiped out following the allied landings at anzac
lined by rosemary bushes , baytrees and well - ordered flowerbeds , this is perhaps the biggest and most atmospheric of them all , with 3,236 graves and four ossuaries containing the bones of 12,000 unidentifiable soldiers
it surprises many to learn that more french soldiers were killed at gallipoli than australians and new zealanders combined
