the first season , he stated , would see him deliver united back into their rightful place in the champions league
his three - year vision would allow for such thoughts but , first things first , united needed to be dining from european football 's top table again
louis van gaal is close to delivering his first - season aim of returning united into champions league wayne rooney smashes home during united 's 3 - 1 win over aston villa on saturday united 's win over aston villa took them third , eight points ahead of fifth - placed liverpool in the table april 12 manchester city ( h ) april 18 chelsea ( a ) april 26 everton ( a ) may 2 west bromwich albion ( h ) may 9 crystal palace ( a ) may 17 arsenal ( h ) may 24 hull city ( a ) one season out of the champions league was far from ideal , but two seasons would be an absolute disaster and something , he understood , that would not be tolerated
instead of finishing top four in his first season , was he now suggesting that united might only be worthy of those positions by year three ? that did n't sound good
it took some time for united to hit their stride under van gaal but things have finally come together united were again at their best in saturday 's 3 - 1 home win over aston villa , which took them third united celebrate their title triumph in 2013 - van gaal 's aim is to return such success to old trafford but van gaal has been true to his word
barring a catastrophic late collapse in form , united will be gracing the champions league again next season
with an eight - point cushion established over liverpool in fifth , united 's faithful can look forward to those electric european nights against next season
with matches against chelsea , arsenal and manchester city still to come , there is even far - fetched talk of united winning the title
that wo n't happen but there 's no reason why united ca n't finish second or third , avoiding the necessity of a potentially tricky champions league qualifier in august
ander herrera scored twice in united 's 3 - 1 win over aston villa at the weekend juan mata , who scored twice in the 2 - 1 win over liverpool , has been excellent under van gaal angel di maria ( right ) has been mainly playing from the bench during united 's recent good run of form radamel falcao ( right ) has also had to be content with a place on the bench the 3 - 1 win over aston villa on saturday was another indication that united are now a settled side
now that united have manoeuvred themselves into a strong position in the top four , van gaal can regard his first season in english football as a job well done
united must mount a sustained challenge for the premier league title and reach the later stages of the champions league
