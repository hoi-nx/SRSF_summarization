david crossley developed large kidney stones like many busy people , david crossley often used to find himself so wrapped up in his working day that he would go without lunch , and often barely stopped for a cup of tea
' this revealed two large stones in his right kidney - a direct result , his doctors believe , of his low fluid intake
a ct scan showed that the stones were so large ( 6 mm across ) they could not be passed naturally , and he needed surgery
one in ten of us will develop a kidney stone , and the numbers are rising dramatically
sometimes , if a stone blocks the exit of urine from the kidney , it can lead to a build - up of bacteria and trigger a kidney infection
emergency admissions to hospital for kidney stones have shot up during the past decade by 136 per cent , according to official figures , rising from just above 5,000 to almost 12,000 per year
the cause for his condition , doctors believe , was low fluid intake and bizarrely , it may be that healthier lifestyles - doing tough workouts at the gym , and then not drinking enough , or shunning carbohydrates - are partly to blame , and may be why cases are going up , especially among women
' more men than women used to suffer from kidney stones , with a ratio of about three to one , ' says mr ajayi
' the main cause of kidney stones is dehydration
' but if you become dehydrated , you overload the kidneys with urine that has a high concentration of stone - forming chemicals , and these begin to bind together to build stones
changing diet trends are also pushing the figures up
' there has been a trend , especially in people either wanting to lose weight or bulk up muscle , to eat low - carb , high - protein diets , ' says dr griffith
' the animal proteins found in meat and fish break down into a waste chemical called uric acid ( a known stone - former ) in your urine
they also reduce the amount of citrate ( a stone - inhibitor )
' this can lead to uric acid stones forming , especially if you also do n't drink enough fluid to assist the kidneys in their disposal job
but low - carb diets could also put you at risk so the more salt you eat , the more calcium you will have in your urine , which can build into stones
this causes a change to the nature of urine , making it more acidic , which increases the risk of uric acid stones forming in the kidney
if you have more than two urinary tract infections within a short space of time , you should ask your gp for an ultrasound to rule out a less common kind of kidney stone called struvite stones , which are caused by a build - up of bacteria from repeated urinary tract infections , adds dr griffith
this involves sending shock - waves of energy through the skin that break down the stone
' it 's also ineffective in most cases for people with obesity , as the shock - waves have further to go to reach the stone
for very large stones ( those over 15 mm ) , percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( pcnl ) is used
the stone is broken up using a combination of high - frequency ultrasound and pneumatic energy ( a bit like a pneumatic drill digging up a road )
' i was out the day after my surgery , and although there was some discomfort around my kidneys for a few days , thankfully i 'm now stone - free
' the lifestyle changes that can be made to stop stones recurring are the same as those for avoiding them in the first place : proper hydration , low - salt , staying a healthy weight and reducing animal protein , ' says mr ajayi
mr ajayi also recommends drinking water with lemon juice in it daily , as the citrate ( a form of acetic acid ) in lemons is a natural stone inhibitor that can prevent calcium from binding with other substances , such as oxalates , that lead to stones
today , david crossley ensures that he gets enough fluid
' i did n't know that being too busy to drink enough could lead to kidney stones , ' he says
