self - assured and poised in her stilettoes and new hairstyle , sturgeon clearly revelled in being centre - stage â addressing a nationwide audience of british , rather than just the usual five million scotland
such was her exultation that judy murray , mother of tennis star andy ( who was widely criticised for voicing his support for scotland independence on the eve of last year âs independence referendum ) , tweeted about her triumph
the fact is that sturgeon has the most experience of governing of any of the seven politicians taking part in the tv debate , having been a member of the cabinet and deputy first minister since 2007
such is the hero - worship she attracts in scotland , that even after the snp lost the referendum vote last year , 12,000 people paid to see her speak at glasgow âs hydro , a concert venue more usually home to pop stars such as sting or rod stewart
sturgeon is a very canny operator
the british - wide tv audience was clearly impressed
fascinatingly , one of the most - searched things on google immediately after the end of the broadcast was whether people who do nât live in scotland can vote for the snp on may 7
but as someone who regards himself as â british â and who voted to keep the union , i am all too aware of her determination to destroy my country
indeed , nicola ferguson sturgeon is a very dangerous woman
judy murray said : â gsm sturgeon â ( game , set and match ) leader : for most people outside scotland , this will have been their first proper view of scotland âs first minister although poles apart politically â and sturgeon herself would run the royal mile in edinburgh at the comparison â she shares many similarities with margaret thatcher
like mrs t , the snp leader transformed her image from that of a dowdy egghead into a glamorous , power - dressing imperatrix â emphasising a mixture of elegant feminine charm and steel
indeed , during her snp conference speech last month she said : â i am determined that â unlike that other woman leader we once knew â i will use my time in this job to improve the lives of women across our country
first minister sturgeon greets young fans on the campaign trail in edinburgh , where she was hailed as ' scotland 's queen ' dangerous : snp leader sturgeon could hold the balance of power and be in position to decide who forms the next government having taken over from alex salmond after the snp had lost the referendum , sturgeon is in some ways exactly what scotland needed
and thursday âs tv debate offered the perfect platform
and with predictions that her snp could take 45 of scotland âs 59 seats , there is a growing fear in england that she could hold westminster to ransom
range : sturgeon , leader of the pro-independence snp , was touted as one of the victors
today , sturgeon is the most dangerous woman in british politics .
