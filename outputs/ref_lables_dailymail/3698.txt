israel 's leader reacted furiously to the west âs nuclear deal with iran yesterday , warning that it would threaten his country âs very survival
netanyahu said iran âs agreement to reduce some of its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions would pave the way for tehran to build an atomic bomb
danger : netanyahu said the deal will ' increase iran 's aggression and terror throughout the middle east ' but israel , which fears an iran nuclear attack , issued a series of dire warnings
â this deal would legitimise iran âs nuclear programme , bolster iran âs economy and increase iran âs aggression and terror throughout the middle east and beyond , â the prime minister said
â other critics including saudi arabia and republicans in the us say the deal leaves scope for iran to cheat
obama , however , has hailed the agreement struck after tortuous negotiations in lausanne , switzerland , as a â historic understanding â
there are still many details to be thrashed out before the deal is due to be signed on june 30 , including the pace at which sanctions will be lifted and what happens if iran is found to have breached the terms
according to tweets from his spokesman mark regev , mr netanyahu said : â the deal would not shut down a single nuclear facility in iran
â historic understanding : president obama hailed the nuclear agreement between iran and us while critics issued stark warnings mr netanyahu is demanding that any final agreement must involve iran âs recognition of israel âs right to exist
mr obama said yesterday : â this will be a long - term deal , that addresses each path to a potential iran nuclear bomb
