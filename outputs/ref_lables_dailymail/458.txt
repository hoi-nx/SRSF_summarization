the inaugural top spots in the album rankings and the two top places in the singles list have been claimed by gallagher , above it could be time to dust off the turntables as vinyl records are revealed to be enjoying a startling revival
sales are expected to hit two million this year and , in recognition of this trend , the uk âs first official weekly vinyl chart has been established
the inaugural top spots in the album rankings and the two top places in the singles list have been claimed by gallagher , 47
seemingly earning himself a reputation as the most popular artist on vinyl , gallagher can also claim the most successful album of the last 20 years on the format , with oasis âs 1995 offering ( what âs the story ) morning glory ?
perhaps proof that good music is timeless , classic releases by led zeppelin , pink floyd and bowie have all also landed among the current top tens
martin talbot , official charts company chief executive , said : â with vinyl album sales up by almost 70 percent already this year , vinyl junkies could well have snapped up two million units by the end of this year â an extraordinary number , if you consider sales were one - tenth of that just six years ago
this growth underlines the continuing resurgence of this much - loved format , whether you âre a fan of arctic monkeys , gallagher , led zeppelin or bowie
in the album chart , led zeppelin âs physical graffiti , which reached number one when it was released in 1975 , claim second place behind gallagher
