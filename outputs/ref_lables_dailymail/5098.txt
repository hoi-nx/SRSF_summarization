ancient civilisations such as the romans , greeks and egyptians have had to deal with rowdy , drunken behaviour in public for thousands of years
party : this relief from herculaneum shows dionysus , the god of wine , with followers at a frenzied gathering contrast : health experts have compared ancient nights out to modern drinking spots such as magaluf mark bellis , who is honorary professor of public health at bangor university , is giving a talk at a conference in vegas this week about the history of binge drinking
' vessel : a greeks amphora which could have been used for holding the wine which was drunk in large quantities at feasts many of the concerns of the ancient authorities were strikingly similar to ours , according to dr mark bellis
in pompeii - where one of the best - preserved buildings after the eruption of vesuvius is a tavern - city officials installed street lights , only to face opposition from drinkers who were worried about sacrificing their privacy
the greeks launched wide - scale campaigns to dissuade drunkenness , with playwrights using gods in their productions to warn against alcohol abuse
and in egyptians , one of the major concerns was mixing drink and drugs , as many locals would consume a narcotic flower called ' blue lotus ' while knocking back beer , dr mark bellis says
' the use of alcohol goes back to the stone age , and almost all societies around the world have made some sort of drink - despite the problems that come with a booze culture
many aspects of greeks culture were centred around drinking - one of plato 's best - known texts is the symposium , set at a huge drinking party , while wine even had its own deity in the form of dionysus
the islamic world attempted to eliminate the problem of drunkenness with a religious ban on alcohol , but there are signs that this did not always work
one tactic used to tackle alcohol abuse was to substitute less strong drinks instead of spirits - for example , in the georgian era william hogarth published two prints contrasting the hellish ' gin lane ' with the relaxed and peaceful ' beer street ' .
