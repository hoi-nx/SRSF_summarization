cad : poet rupert had a string of short - lived relationships with various women before he died aged 27 in april 1915 poet rupert has long had a reputation as a ' young apollo ' , a symbol of innocent youth who was cut down in his prime during the senseless slaughter of the first world war
the documents , brought to light for the first time thanks to a Â£ 430,000 grant , show brooke 's lovers complaining about his refusal to take their relationships seriously
brooke , who died 100 years ago today at the age of just 27 , became a semi-legendary figure thanks to his early death and his popular poems such as the soldier
however , the letters in the schroder collection - including 170 documents written by brooke himself - show a somewhat different side to the great poet
king 's 's archivist mcguire said that brooke was ' promiscuous even for a man of his time ' and carried on relationships with multiple girlfriends
' among the lovers whose affairs with brooke are featured in the letters are hollywood star cathleen nesbitt , artist phyllis gardner , and laurence olivier 's cousin noã«l
lovers : cathleen nesbitt , left , and phyllis gardner , right , are among the women who had affairs with brooke popular : brooke became one of britain 's best - loved poets after his premature death nesbitt wrote to marsh , brooke 's biographer , saying : ' i 've no intention of marrying anybody for years to come - nor , i hope , has rupert - though i should n't be in the least surprised if he settled in the wild with a squaw and a wigwam
" ' this is not the first time that brooke 's reputation has taken a battering - previously discovered letters have shown him expressing unpalatable views on jews and homosexuals
trove : peter jones of king 's college , cambridge with a haul of letters which the college has now bought thanks to a Â£ 430,000 grant home : the old vicarage in grantchester , cambridgeshire , where brooke once lived if i should die , think only this of me : that there 's some corner of a foreign field that is forever england
despite the recent revelations , brooke has retained his image as a ' young apollo ' cut down in his prime , whose poems encapsulate typically england scenes
' peter jones , the librarian at king 's , said : ' it is hard to realise today just how significant brooke 's impact was 100 years ago
' one of the letters now made available reveals how brooke 's mother mary ruth sought to avoid turning her son into an icon , and also intervened to stop marsh inserting details of his more sordid relationships
