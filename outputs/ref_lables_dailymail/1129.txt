he had been on good form when the exchange started - in which , as arranged , he would discuss his experiences on the new blockbuster which premiered in uk on tuesday
' responding , downey jr , 50 , said : ' i could pick that apart for two hours and be no closer to the truth than giving you some half - arsed answer right now
' but , when asked about his relationship with his father , robert gets up and says : ' i 'm sorry , i really do n't ... what are we doing ? ' before walking out of the interview
