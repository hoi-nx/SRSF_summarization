a senior labour mp has admitted that the party would look to ' forge a common alliance ' with the snp to ensure miliband becomes prime minister
david lammy , who is standing for london mayor , said the snp was a party labour could ' do business with ' in the event of another hung parliament
the admission comes amid increasingly stark warnings from the tories that the snp will hold labour to ' ransom ' if it holds the balance of power in parliament next month
former prime minister john major will today warn that britain faces a ' daily dose of blackmail ' from the snp if they have the power to bring down a labour government
with 16 days to polling on may 7 , sir john major will say that a labour - snp administration would lead to ' weak and unstable ' government and wreck britain 's economic recovery
however , speaking on itv news last night , mr david lammy went further â insisting that a deal with the snp could be struck
mr miliband meanwhile has accused the prime minister of ' threatening the integrity of the britain ' by talking up the prospects of scottish nationalists in the may 7 general election speaking on newsnight last night mr miliband insisted he would not form a coalition with the snp after the election he said : ' we are fighting for a victory
defence secretary michael fallon said the admission exposed the threat posed by an snp - labour alliance
speaking this morning mr miliband insisted there would be no coalition with the snp and denied nicola sturgeon 's party would hold the whip hand on policy , telling bbc1 's breakfast : ' a labour government led by me , what happens in that labour government will be decided by me , not by the snp
' labour had ' fundamental differences ' with the snp , such as the nationalist party 's desire for a second independence referendum within five years , he said , adding : ' i 'm not having that
' mr miliband said mr david cameron had been ' talking up ' the snp in the hope that it would take votes and seats from labour north of the border and allow him to ' crawl back ' into 10 downing street
