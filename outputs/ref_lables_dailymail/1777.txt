now scientists have identified the unfortunate individual whose bones were found fused to the walls of a cave in lamalunga , near altamura , in southern italy
using analysis of dna extracted from the bones sticking out from the limestone rock , researchers have found he was a neanderthal who fell down a sinkhole around 150,000 years ago
over the thousands of years that followed , the body decayed and the remaining bones gradually became incorporated into the stalactites left behind by water dribbling down the cave walls
the dna is the oldest to ever be extracted from a neanderthal and the researchers now hope to further analyse the genetic information from the skeleton
scientists have found traces of compounds found in camomile and yarrow in the hardened plaque of 50,000 year old neanderthal teeth found in el sidron , spain
first discovered in 1993 , the skeleton - nicknamed ' altamura man ' - has provoked debate among anthropologists partly due to the difficulties in studying the skeleton as it had become part of the cave walls
they found mitochondrial dna they extracted from the shoulder bone matched that of other neanderthal skeletons
' researchers have , up until now , held off from excavating the remains ( above ) as they believed it would cause irreparable damage to the skeleton but an early studies had suggested it had some neanderthal features the lamalunga cave where the uniquely preserved neanderthal skeleton was found is close to altamura , italy neanderthals are thought to have numbered up to 70,000 at their peak and lived in hunter gatherer societies the researchers now hope that further analysis of the dna might reveal new insights into neanderthal evolution
it is nearly 100,000 years older than other previously sequenced neanderthal dna
' thus , the skeleton from altamura represents the most ancient neanderthal from which endogenous dna has ever been extracted
' it has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern - day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient neanderthal
neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred , meaning europeans now have roughly two per cent neanderthal dna
scientists have found that part of our hla system , which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body , could have come from neanderthal
other researchers have suggested that humans outside africa are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes because they interbred with neanderthal
if they manage to sequence the dna , they hope it might reveal new details about the evolution of hominids in general and the early history of the neanderthal
it could also help shed new light on their relationship with modern humans analysis of other neanderthal dna has shown they interbred with our own species
