the mass stranding of 160 melon - headed whales on two beaches in japan has triggered fears of upcoming earthquake and tsunami
the whales , which are in fact a species of dolphin , were found washed up along a 6 - mile ( 10km ) stretch of the pacific coast of hokato , around 60 miles ( 100km ) north of tokyo
although officials are still investigating the cause of the strandings , they triggered rumours on social media of an impending earthquake
however , experts have dismissed the claims as being ' unscientific '
they found that animals in peru - such as pumas and razor - billed curassow birds - ran for cover days before the event
instead they believe the melon - headed whales may have suffered a parasitic infection
toshiaki kishiro , head of cetacean resources at japan 's national research institute of far seas fisheries , said while it was possible the whales frightened by disturbances in the earth 's electromagnetic field caused by movement in the tectonic plates - there were was no firm evidence of this
' he added that the animals , which measure two to three metres in length , could have been trying to avoid predators like killer whales and come too close to the shore
however , despite attempts to reassure the public , social media sites like twitter have been ablaze with rumours of an impending earthquake
scientists are still investigating what caused the whales to become stranded on the beaches of hokota city city local resident used buckets of water in an attempt to keep the melon - headed whales alive on the beaches officials have spent the weekend removing and buring the dead melon - headed whales after they stranded however , almost all of the animals have now died although a few were returned to the ocean
the strandings in 2011 before the magnitude 9 earthquake off the coast of japan is not the first association of whale strandings with tectonic activity
around 100 pilot whales died in a mass stranding on a remote beach in new zealand just two days before a large earthquake hit christchurch in 2011
those whales that survived were taken back out to sea by the japan coast guard to return them to the ocean japan coast guard personnel managed to return some of the whales back to the sea the whales were stranded on two beaches close to hokota city around 60 miles north of tokyo according to the us geological survey , which monitors tremors around the world , there was a small magnitude 5.3 earthquake 157 miles ( 252km ) off the coast of namie , japan
despite international opprobrium , japan hunts minke and pilot whales off its coast , and has for many years also pursued the mammals in the antarctic , where it takes advantage of a scientific exemption to an international moratorium on whaling
the iwc 's ( iwc ) panel of experts said today that it opposed japan 's proposal for its scientific research whaling programme , saying it did not demonstrate a need for killing whales .
