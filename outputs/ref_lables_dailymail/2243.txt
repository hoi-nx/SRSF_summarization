' pep guardiola had just 14 fit players to choose from at the estadio do dragao and the bayern manager implied in his post-match comments that the defeat was down to the lack of available players

there is talk of controversy about muller-wohlfahrt 's methods , but i wo n't have a bad word said against him
he is still bayern 's team doctor , world renowned and a master of his art - and they did n't seem to be doing too badly the last time i watched them in the champions league final
