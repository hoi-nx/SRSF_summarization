deila has called for inverness âs meekings to be spared a cup ban despite his controversial handball
the celtic boss admitted the 2 - 1 premiership victory at dundee had helped him bounce back from what he described as the toughest day of his career at hampden on sunday
but although his club âs treble ambitions were shattered as a result of the meekings â incident in the semi-final defeat to inverness , the norwegian said it would serve no purpose for the defender to be given a retrospective suspension by the sfa
inverness defender meekings ' arm blocks the ball and prevents a goal to celtic on sunday meekings has been retrospectively suspended for one match , the punishment he would have got if sent off the fall - out from the hampden showdown has been dominated by the failure of the match officials to award a penalty after meekings blocked a goal - bound effort from leigh griffiths with his hand
inverness will learn today whether they have succeeded in overturning the suspension that compliance officer tony mcglennan offered earlier this week
and while celtic have written to the sfa seeking clarity over the pivotal incident , deila insisted that he hopes meekings is cleared to line up against falkirk in the final on may 30
â it all happened so quickly and it is a clear handball and a red card and a penalty
â i do nât think that is right for him to miss that match as you want all the best players to play in the final
i would hope that the ban would be overturned
â deila said he was unaware of any response from hampden to celtic âs letter but said he can understand the scale of the furore that has erupted this week
fifa vice president jim boyce yesterday waded in to the debate to strongly criticise the sfa âs decision to charge meekings
â it is a huge thing as we are talking about the treble here and the scottish cup semi-final when we were 1 - 0 up , â added deila
fifa 's head of referees jim boyce says the suspension of a player for an unpunished handball is wrong inverness is appealing the ruling that , if upheld , will deny meekings ( right ) a place in the cup final â i am trying to focus on the next game and we have performed very well since christmas and we have racked up a lot of wins and points
â deila admitted he had hit an all - time low after the 3 - 2 extra-time defeat to john hughes â side last sunday
the result pushed celtic closer to the premiership title as they hold an eight - point lead over aberdeen with just five games to go
meekings ( right ) celebrates inverness 's 3 - 2 win over celtic in their cup semi-final â we really wanted it and we had a very good opportunity there
celtic have quality throughout their team
