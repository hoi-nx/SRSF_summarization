his death came as a shock to the family who had been focusing on nic 's struggles ' it was so hard to work at school because of the nature of the condition : it can have cognitive impairments , so i 'd go from reading nonstop to not being able to listen to a word the teacher was saying
' on average , statistics show that it takes 20 years for someone with bipolar to go from having the symptoms to being diagnosed - and that 's not even treating it , ' nic said
' a high achiever from a young age , nic ( pictured left and right ) ' crashed ' after pushing himself too hard in the first year of high school his anxiety and depression progressed into a type of psychosis and he soon admitted himself into a psychiatric ward for almost nine months but along with the cold , stale , square rooms , the psychiatric wards offered a surprising comfort : other people who were not afraid to talk about mental illness
i did n't want to leave because i met so many people there from different backgrounds and religions and with different ideas about the world â¦ and the reason i really got along with these guys was because it was the first time i had met other people with mental health issues and that it was such a non-issue
' the level of support and acceptance of mental health problems that nic experienced was a far cry from the experience of his older brother christopher
i 'd literally just sit there in class and just fantasize about different ways i could kill myself with different objects in the room ' it took at least another two years after his brother 's death before nic ( pictured ) was correctly diagnosed with bi-polar and set on the correct path of treatment , but not without another stint in a psych ward and doctor 's experimenting with every drug for depression under the sun ' then chris ended up killing himself when i had just turned 16 and he was just shy of 18

christopher 's ( left and right ) mental health problems peaked after a surgery that left him bed ridden and unable to play rugby : ' he would really keep it close to his chest because he had a lot more to lose socially - he was an alpha - male , jock , lovable larrikin and athletic type and i think he really felt that if he would have talked about having depression and anxiety it would made him look like less of a man ' ' we stopped having christmas that year because mum and dad could n't deal with that emptiness
we started having dinner in front of the television permanently because , what do you talk about ? how can you discuss anything and have that chair sitting there ?
