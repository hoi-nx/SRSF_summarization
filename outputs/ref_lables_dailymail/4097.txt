after four years orbiting the closest planet to our sun , the messenger spacecraft will this week make a death - dive into mercury
now nasa has released an image taken by the probe 's visual and infrared spectrometer ( virs ) revealing distinct features such as volcanic vents and fresh craters

this is an instrument with wide - and narrow - angle cameras that has been mapping the rugged landforms on mercury âs surface
' the mdis ( mdis ) is an instrument with wide - and narrow - angle cameras that has been mapping the rugged landforms on mercury âs surface
it was used to helped create these images of mercury the spacecraft is expected to smash into the planet 's surface on thursday 30 april after a four - year mission among the features messenger has revealed to scientists in the past month are patterns of distinctive hollows - each around a couple of hundred metres wide - in the bottom of a huge impact basin
another image shows a 621 miles ( 1,000km ) long cliff that rises 1.8 miles ( 3km ) above the surface , called enterprise rupes
but spectral data from mercury suggests its surface contains very little nanophase iron , certainly not enough to account for its dim appearance
scientists have calculated that after billions of years of bombardment , mercury 's surface should be anywhere from three to six percent carbon
data sent back by mercury suggests these cliffs , or lobate scarps as they are called , have formed as mercury has cooled and contracted over time , creating dramatic tectonic faults on the surface
another image shows a meteorite crater that has almost completely filled with lava on mercury 's northern volcanic plains , leaving just the hint of a rim behind
it also shows how the contracting surface of the planet has also created strange formations where ridges and cliffs have hit other lava filled craters
they are thought to have formed as mercury cooled distinctive hollows on the floor of the zeami impact basin on mercury can be seen in this messenger image andy calloway , messenger mission operatoins manager at johns hopkins applied physics laboratory , said : ' the messenger spacecraft operates in one of the most challenging and demanding space environments in our solar system
its journey included 15 trips around the sun before it entered orbit around mercury in 2011 - the first spacecraft to ever do so
it has helped reveal volcanic vents that measure up to 15 miles ( 24km ) across that were once sources for the large volumes of lava that have covered the surface and carved out valleys
this image shows some of the mysterious irregularly shaped hollows on mercury 's surface in greater detail the above artist 's impression shows messenger as it orbits above the surface of mercury
it is due to impact on the surface at the end of april as the planet 's gravity slowly pulls it down out of its current orbit messenger has also revealed the temperature of mercury 's surface
