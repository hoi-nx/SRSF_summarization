car - congested cities could become a thing of the past , provided people are prepared to ride - share with a robot driver
the finding comes amid reports that companies such as google and uber are working on technology to develop driverless taxis
pictured is an interior view of a google self - driving car showing the video and the data the car uses to ' see ' the road
google is believed to be working on technology for self - driving cabs , but has n't revealed details the study , by paris - based organisation for economic cooperation and development used data from lisbon in portugal
by plugging the data into a computer model , they simulated how such self - driving , communal cabs would affect traffic
even with only one passenger per ride and no complementary public transport , the number of cars still dropped by 77 per cent
the authors said replacing personal cars with self - driving cabs would also free valuable real estate currently used for public parking - equivalent to over 200 football pitches in lisbon âs case
major technology firms are already banking on self - driving taxis to be the future of transportation

motorists were found to copy the driving style of the computer controlled cars by leaving less space between them and the vehicle in front , but were less able to react quickly
speaking at the code conference in california , kalanick said : â the reason uber could be expensive is because you 're not just paying for the car - you 're paying for the other dude in the car
the report said that google had told uber 's board of this possibility , and executives had seen screenshots of what appears to be a google ride - sharing app , currently being used by employees
