ten years ago , i signed a letter backing labour in the 2005 election
five years ago the world was facing catastrophic economic problems
former tony blair ally charles dunstone ( pictured ) is now supporting the conservative party in the election when i speak to investors and business people around the world , they see the recent britain story as something of a miracle
i really believe cameron and george osborne deserve much of the credit for this incredible turnaround
in 2005 i supported labour because they had ended the tyranny of ' or ' â the idea that you could only have a strong and growing economy ' or ' a fair and compassionate society
labour recognised that the one helped pay for the other ; healthy tax receipts from business meant more money for schools , hospitals and helping the poorest in our country
i 'm genuinely concerned that this view is n't shared by the current labour party â and that business is viewed as the problem , rather than the essential engine that gives politicians the ability to provide that fair and compassionate society
the current government has made it very clear that the britain is open for business and endeavours to make business welcome here
it 's vital , because fundamentally , the business world is driven by confidence and positive sentiment
the former carphone warehouse boss said mr cameron deserved credit for turning around the economy however , it is very fragile and hard to nurture , and the mobility of the modern business world means a tech firm can start up as easily in berlin or silicon valley as they can in london , so they 're not going to pick a place which they perceive will make it hard for them to thrive
we need a government that backs business , not one that views us as cartoon capitalists ; a necessary evil to bring in money at best ; the embodiments of greed at worst
because the truth is the vast majority of those working in business are trying to build something good and to employ more people
they are not to be stigmatised but backed
i 'm backing the conservatives for this election as they 've shown a determination to stick to the course even when the tide of opinion was turning against them
he ignored them , the plan paid off , and now those same people are patting him on the back for his resolve
he said the current labour party , under miliband , viewed business as the problem , rather than the essential engine that gives politicians the ability to provide that fair and compassionate society i was speaking to an italy contact recently who told me that anyone starting a small business in italy gets sucked into a quagmire of bureaucracy , treated like some massive enterprise with their own accounting department
he could n't believe that in britain you could get online and register your company in a few short steps â and that is to the conservatives ' credit
economic success is n't decided on high , it is the collective result of millions of people feeling that we are heading in the right direction ; willing to take chances and work hard to succeed
but on this occasion i really felt i had to speak out as our economic recovery truly hangs in the balance
and it is not a choice between backing business on the one hand and promoting fairness on the other
there is nothing progressive about attacking business and undermining our economy
but that is what i fear would happen with a labour - snp government â one that is anti-business , anti-aspiration and pro-spending money we have n't even earned yet
