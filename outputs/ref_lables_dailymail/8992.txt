roach insisted on saturday that mayweather does not deserve to be ranked alongside pacquiao as the leading fighters of their generation as the two boxers put the finishing touches to their preparations for the fight of the century in las vegas a week on saturday
roach , pacquiao âs trainer , said he rated super-middleweight star andre ward and middleweight sensation gennadiy golovkin above mayweather despite the american âs unbeaten record and his status as hot favourite for the may 2 showdown against pacquiao
â mayweather is undefeated so you have to give him a little credit for that , â said roach , â but he has picked and chosen his opponents and i do nât think he âs fought enough competition to be considered the best
pacquiao 's trainer roach says that mayweather can not be considered best ever roach says that mayweather has picked and chosen his fights during his career â pacquiao has had some devastating losses in his career but he is a realist
i âd put andre ward and triple g above mayweather right now
â roach has been vocal in an otherwise low - key and surprisingly respectful build - up to the welterweight showdown next month and knows that his tactics have made the stakes even higher for him
but he is adamant pacquiao will spring a surprise in the most eagerly awaited fight for years
â the fight will be won and lost on the ropes , â said roach
â if mayweather goes to the ropes and tries to rest his legs , he will get beat
â roach claimed pacquiao is in the best shape of his life , moving faster and punching harder than ever before
â he trains harder than any fighter i have ever had in my life , â said roach
roach rates super middleweight andre ward higher than he does undefeated mayweather roach , who has trained pacquiao for 15 years , says the filipino is in the best shape of his life â it âs a better fight today than it was five years ago because they were both a lot faster and more mobile five years ago and it might have been more of a boxing match but now they âre a little bit older , it âs going to be a better fight
â i believe pacquiao can win this fight
