whatever brown goes on to accomplish in the game , it âs unlikely he âll ever forget this weekend
so back he went to london , sitting amongst the substitutes on the loftus road bench , the no 37 on his back , as the blues took another big step towards the premier league title

and there , on monday afternoon , he pulled on the captain âs armband once more and scored two goals to inspire chelsea âs academy side to european glory
his excellent individual performance was one of many as the blues dominated shakhtar to become the second name , after barcelona , to be inscribed on the handsome uefa youth league trophy

showing no signs of fatigue after all that commuting , brown thundered home dominic solanke âs low cross , culminating one of the many intricate passing moves chelsea put together in the game
shakhtar drew level when blues defender andreas christensen ( centre ) scored an own goal in the first - half leading scorer dominic solanke put chelsea back in the lead shortly after the interval with a close range header chelsea striker dominic solanke wheels away after netting in the blues ' 3 - 2 victory over shakhtar dominic solanke celebrates his goal with the impressive boga who provided the assist dominic solanke leaps for joy after handing chelsea the lead while becoming the tournament 's top scorer that knocked the stuffing out of shakhtar âs challenge

brown completed his brace with a drilled shot from outside the area in the second half chelsea 's rising star goes to celebrate with team - mate charly musonda after netting the eventual winner chelsea youth manager adrian viveash rallies his troops from the touchline french attacking midfielder boga , who set up two goals for the blues during the match , takes a free - kick chelsea youngsters , led by captain brown , begin their celebrations by raising aloft the trophy chelsea youth manager viveash raises the lennart johansson trophy as his side are crowned champions a second for shakhtar , through substitute viktor kovalenko in stoppage time , came too late to change the outcome
and as brown lifted the uefa youth league trophy beneath cloudless skies in this most picturesque of venues , chelsea strengthened their claim to have england âs best academy
the real test comes in seeing whether brown , dominic solanke , boga and the rest of their talented cohort can graduate to chelsea âs first team
