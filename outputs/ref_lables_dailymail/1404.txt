suddenly , after close to 14 years of international football and just 33 caps , michael carrick is the answer for england
michael carrick has made nine competitive starts for england , and the majority have been ordinary at best
he played in the match against ecuador in the 2006 world cup , in which england were saved by a david beckham free - kick , and was then dropped and replaced by the more energetic owen hargreaves for the quarter - final with portugal
michael carrick played against ecuador at the 2006 world cup but was dropped for the quarter - final england have won just four competitive matches when michael carrick started , including against poland michael carrick ( left ) played in the 2 - 0 defeat by croatia which went a long way to england missing out on euro 2008 under mcclaren he started in the disastrous double header of a 0 - 0 home draw with macedonia followed by a 2 - 0 defeat in croatia â the results that effectively cost england âs place at the 2008 european championship
england have won four competitive games in which michael carrick has started â against ecuador , and then san marino , poland and lithuania , all at home
ecuador were feisty opponents and michael carrick struggled to match their intensity ; the same in the second half in montenegro , when england were overwhelmed and fortunate not to lose
michael carrick was hailed after an impressive performance for england in their friendly draw with italy last week michael carrick has also been impressive in manchester united 's midfield under louis van gaal this season so the idea that england managers are fools for consistently preferring steven gerrard and frank lampard is misguided
equally , in less than one year , between may 30 , 2009 , and may 9 , 2010 , frank lampard scored more goals for club and country than michael carrick has in his entire career
