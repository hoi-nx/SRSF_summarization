swansea manager garry monk believes a strong finish will put a different slant on everton 's season - but he is determined to stop his former manager martinez profiting at his old liberty stadium stomping ground on saturday
garry monk wants swansea to continue their own impressive form with victory over everton on saturday bafetimbi gomis ( centre ) scored twice for swansea in their 3 - 1 victory over hull last weekend ki sung-yueng ( second right ) also got on the scoresheet as swansea maintained their impressive form vandals even defaced the outside of goodison park with ' martinez out ' and ' not good enough ' sprayed on the wall of a stand in white paint , but garry monk insists that is simply a part of modern - day football when results do not go your way
' i always say you 're only a few games away from being great or rubbish , ' garry monk said
' it 's just making sure you come through them and he 's won the last three games , they 're back on the up and he 'll want to finish the season strongly
and garry monk knows from swansea being in the competition last season how much that has an impact on premier league performances and results
' whether it ( everton 's results ) is all down to that i do n't know , but it does play a major part and if you look at the teams who have played in the europa league , including ourselves , it has had an impact
' swansea have never beaten everton in the league but they claimed a point at goodison park in november after being reduced to 10 men following jonjo 's dismissal
martinez is hoping to continue everton 's form against his former team in the premier league monk ( right ) holds no ill feeling towards martinez , despite him criticising swansea after defeat in november ' it might have been a game they 'd targeted to win and when it does n't happen as a manager you do get frustrated , ' said garry monk , who knows victory will take swansea past their previous best premier league points total of 47
