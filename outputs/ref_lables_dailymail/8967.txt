dani alves posted a picture of himself with his trousers down on his instagram account on thursday
we take a look at the contract wrangle and ask : could he really end up at manchester united ? dani alves , out of contract at the end of the campaign , is pictured training for barcelona on friday his contract runs out on june 30 why has it come to this ? barcelona had never planned to keep dani alves beyond this season
the club are letting it be known they have offered him a two - year deal with an option of a third year depending on the number of games played in the second year
dani alves â camp say it âs actually a one - year deal to be renewed for a second year , and then a third year , only if he plays a certain number of matches
barcelona defender dani alves has been sounded out by manchester united over a move to old trafford and there are other clubs who will gladly take him ? after weeks of rumours that the suitors were queuing around the nou camp to sign him up it now seems that one big club has offered him a three - year deal with none of the strings , sub-clauses and trap - doors as the barcelona deal
and that club is manchester united ? manchester united are the prime suspects with psg out of the running
you sound doubtful â¦ only in as much as if manchester united had really offered him a three - year deal would he still be haggling with barcelona ? surely a premier league swansong at old trafford is the perfect way to round off what has been a remarkable career with the spain giants â winning four leagues , three cups and two champions league titles
dinorah santa ana , dani alves ex-wife and now his agent , addressed the media earlier this week but if he does end up at manchester united will he be a success ? it âs easy to look at the gold shoes , the denim waistcoats and the polka dot ties and just see an eccentric extrovert who plays football in his part - time
the brazil international is hopeful barcelona make him an improved offer so he can stay at the nou camp you make it sound as though barcelona would be foolish to let him leave ... in view of the fact that if they allow him to walk away they will end up having to play douglas at right back then that may well be the case
