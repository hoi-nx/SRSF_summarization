adam looked up , noticed courtois was off his line , and thought : â why not ? â why not , indeed
the stoke midfielder was 66 yards from goal but had the audacity to score what will surely be crowned the premier league âs strike of the season
david beckham did it against wimbledon in august 1996 , as did rooney against west ham last march
there was xabi alonso in 2006 and maynor figueroa three years later , too
adam ( centre ) lets fly from inside his own half as he scores one of the goals of his career at chelsea courtois watches on as he is unable to stop adam 's shot from hitting the back of the net for 1 - 1 yet this was different
this was a direct shot from deep inside adam âs own half which fooled one of the world âs greatest goalkeepers â and adam meant it
â this is better than david beckham , more audacious than rooney âs last season , this is one of the best strikes we âve ever seen
it âs an absolutely incredible piece of play by adam
nineteen years ago , when david beckham introduced himself to the world with his goal from the halfway line , he did so wearing the wrong footwear
the united great beat wimbledon goalkeeper neil sullivan wearing custom - made boots embroidered with â adam â on the tongue â adidas sending david beckham a pair which were actually intended for former rangers attacking midfielder miller
adam ( second left ) admitted he had mixed emotions after scoring the goal but losing the game david beckham struck from inside his own half for united against wimbledon in 1996 david beckham celebrated the final goal in 3 - 0 win for united on the opening day of the 1996 - 97 season chelsea became the second team to score 100 penalties in the premier league
miller never got his boots as they were retired , turned into a museum piece , having helped david beckham towards his first of 115 england caps less than three weeks later against moldova
from one scottish adam to another , adam plans to frame his boots and shirt from stamford bridge , but this goal is unlikely to be the making of the former rangers , blackpool and liverpool midfielder as it was for david beckham
it left a black mark against a win which moved them seven points clear at the top of the premier league , yet even the chelsea manager can admire a wonder - goal when one comes along , as much as it hurts to admit it
even chelsea boss jose mourinho had to admit that adam 's goal was a strike of the highest quality adam ( right ) celebrates with his stoke team - mates after scoring at stamford bridge on saturday â it was a fantastic goal , every player in the world would like to score a goal like that , â jose mourinho said
â indeed there are compilations of goals just as outrageous on youtube and , on saturday , adam rightly earned his place in history among them .
