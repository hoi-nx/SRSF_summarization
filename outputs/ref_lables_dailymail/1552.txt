a perth woman who claimed she cured her cancer using a dietary program where she ate vast amounts of pineapple has pledged to release her medical records after critics questioned claims about her ' magic diet '
in the wake of recent controversy surrounding ' wellness warriors ' such as whole pantry founder belle gibson and the death of gerson therapy advocate jessica ainscough , bloggers have demanded ' irrefutable proof ' that modelling agent candice cured her cancer ' with juice '
but when a return visit to the doctors revealed cancer cells had spread to other parts of her body , ms candice rejected further conventional medical treatment in favour of a diet and lifestyle plan she discovered online
she is planning to release relevant medical records without her personal details ' i was feeling a bit lost , just winging it on the internet myself , ' she said , until she discovered a u.s. organisation called the nutritional oncology research institute
she would sometimes spend weeks on a fruit - only diet , taking up yoga and leaving her stressful job behind to join a positive - thinking dance group called the liberators international
her diet program involved her drinking ' morning juice ' , dipping into boxes of pineapples each hour and taking vitamins
ms candice said when she returned to the doctors months after embracing her new lifestyle , medical staff found her cancer had been radically reduced in size and is now gone
' in response , ms candice said she was applying to obtain all her relevant medical records , which will take 45 to 60 days to obtain
she is planning release them in a pdf file , without personal details such as her medicare number and contact details
' ms candice ( pictured ) has been questioned by bloggers over claims she cured her cancer through a diet as well as meditation as part of the modelling world , ms candice is friends with the bachelor blake garvey ' i did n't even know about this belle gibson lady , ' she said
' ' i 'm not a fraud and i 'm not a fake '
' i think it 's really important for anybody who is facing cancer that they put their faith in medical doctors who are going to be backed up by sound research , ' ms chapman said
' oncologist dr olver , the director of the samsom institute , said there was evidence a diet of fresh fruit and vegetables with less red meat could prevent cancer
' even if someone claimed they were cured by a certain diet , you 'd like to know if that happened one in two ( cases ) or one in 20000 - but these anecdotes get blown up into suggestions for lifestyle
