soaring immigration means most parts of the country could have fewer available primary school places than pupils in just two years
pressure on the education system has intensified following a baby boom and continued migration , forcing schools to boost class sizes and add classrooms
the lga warned they may not be able to create more places at the rate that is needed
pressure on the education system has intensified following a baby boom and continued migration , forcing schools to boost class sizes and classrooms - but say they may not be able to continue doing so its analysis of official figures indicates that by september next year , two in five local authorities in england will have more children ready to start school than there are places
the lga said that councils have created more than 300,000 primary school places since may 2010 , with many increasing class sizes
the lga warned they may not be able to create more places at the rate needed but the association warned the situation is reaching a â tipping point â and made a fresh call for an incoming government to hand councils enough cash and fresh powers to open new schools and establish more places
last year , research based on an lga report found an extra 130,000 primary places would be needed across the country within three years
many parts of the country saw a rise in applications last year and up to four in ten children were denied admission to their chosen primary schools
david simmonds , the chairman of the lga âs children and young people board , said : â mums and dads rightly expect their child to be able to get a school place where they live
labour âs education spokesman tristram hunt said : â david cameron âs crisis in school places is yet more evidence the tory plan is failing children and working families
â make no mistake , his decision to plough hundreds of millions of taxpayers â money on free schools into areas where there are no shortages of school places comes at the expense of the families in the areas where there is a desperate need
â according to the lga , no areas currently have more pupils than places , as councils in oversubscribed parts of the country have managed to create enough slots
many pupils are not ready to sit down to do formal reading , writing and maths when they start school , according to the nut
