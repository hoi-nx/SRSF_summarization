â if they think by coming in the dead of the night and scribbling on a wall and by being anonymous on twitter that they will intimidate and bully me they are picking on the wrong person , â she said
â i believe it is right that we have a conservative mp up here who is sitting at the table at cabinet , so their underhand tactics wo nât bully and intimidate me
â miss esther mcvey , who was given a job in the cabinet by cameron last july , said that she is one of a number of women sat around the table who knows how to have her voice heard and shows the party is not solely made up of women in â twin - sets and pearls â
