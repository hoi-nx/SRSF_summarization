stubbs says he feared there would have been crowd trouble if he 'd agreed to have his hibernian team form a guard of honour for hearts in the edinburgh derby
hearts head coach neilson and hearts defender alim ozturk have both rounded on their city rivals for refusing a public display of acknowledgement for the scottish championship title winners at easter road
rangers lined up to applaud hearts on to the ibrox pitch when the teams played just over a week ago , and queen of the south and alloa did the same
but stubbs , who admitted that the police had n't been consulted , insisted that the threat of unrest â not a lack of respect â was responsible for the decision
hibernian boss stubbs feared unrest among fans if his side formed a guard of honour for city rivals hearts ' it 's been turned into a lack of respect , ' said the hibernian boss
' my players have come out in the press and said hearts have been the best team
' the reason why we decided against it is because there are two sets of rivals fans , it 's a derby , there 's going to be a lot of animosity
not a lack of respect
it 's a respect for fans
it 's a decision we spoke about and we feel as if it 's the right decision for both sets of fans
' agreeing that it would be unthinkable for either old firm team to offer their oldest rivals a guard of honour in a similar situation , stubbs said : ' so why 's it any different here ? ' it 's a derby and it means a lot to both sets of fans
' hearts head coach neilson feels that it is disrespectful not to acknowledge his team 's achievements hearts fans favourite alim ozturk inferred that the decision not to have a guard of honour showed a lack of respect by hibernian , while boss neilson claimed it could backfire on them on the pitch
' but other teams have shown respect to us - and if hibernian do n't want to do it , that says a lot about them
' that kind of respect you get is really nice but they [ hibernian ] are not going to do it , so that is it
