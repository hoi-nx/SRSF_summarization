an advanced spacecraft flies up to an orbiting space station , taking with it cargo and supplies for the crew on board as they continue their mission in the final frontier
no , this is nât a scene from star trek - it âs an event that took place in earth âs orbit just the other day
and to celebrate the arrival of the cargo - carrying dragon spacecraft , one astronaut on the iss donned a uniform from the popular tv show
together with nasa astronaut terry virts she captured the spacecraft
on board it had 4,000lbs of supplies - including a coffee machine
it will remain at the iss for a month before returning to earth italian esa astronaut samantha cristoforetti revealed her unique attire in a tweet
here it was â berthed â to the iss - which means it was grabbed by an arm on the station , and did not dock by itself
with the assistance of expedition 43 commander terry virts of nasa , samantha cristoforetti successfully captured the spacecraft at 9.15am last friday
spacecraft like dragon are used to keep the iss stocked with supplies , but this mission carried with it a treat for the astronauts - a coffee machine called the isspresso
italian coffee giant lavazza joined forces with the turin - based engineering company argotec and the italian space agency to provide a specially designed machine for use off the planet
it is the first coffee machine able to work in micro gravity on the iss , where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on earth
italian coffee giant lavazza joined forces with the turin - based engineering company argotec and the italian space agency to provide a specially designed machine for use off the planet
here a prototype of the coffee from the machine is shown the outfit worn by samantha cristoforetti was the one that crew wore in the tv show star trek voyager , shown the canadarm2 reaches out to capture the dragon cargo spacecraft and prepare it to be pulled into its port on the iss on friday 17 april
the canadarm2 robotic arm maneuvered dragon to its installation position at the earth - facing port of the harmony module â it 's been just amazing , â samantha cristoforetti said after snaring the dragon over the pacific
aside from the coffee machine , the dragon supply ship had in total 4,000 pounds of food , science research and other equipment the espresso machine is three months late because of the backlog created by last year 's loss of a supply ship in a launch explosion
much later and the espresso machine would have missed samantha cristoforetti , who returns home next month
among the newly arrived research are experiments for american astronaut scott kelly , who is just a few weeks into a one - year mission , which will be a record for nasa
