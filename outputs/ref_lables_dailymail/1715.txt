' the club 's record scorer has not been spotted at his old stomping ground since his surprise appearance appeared at last month 's general meeting to see the board which axed him as boss swept out of power
ally mccoist will be welcome back to the club ' with open arms ' according to club legend brown ally mccoist was removed from the manager 's office back in december as relations with the old board crumbled and has spent the four months since on garden leave

ally mccoist is rangers record scorer but was axed as manager amid speculation surrounding the clubs future brown - helping to promote the rangers first fans group - said : ' i know what ally went through as manager
' but the rangers fans love ally and i 'm sure in time he will be welcomed back at the club with open arms

but brown said : ' hopefully dave has got rangers at heart
he 's got money to put into the club - rangers need that money
but i think hopefully dave would be good for rangers , especially with the guys he has brought with him such as the three bears and the money he will generate for the club
' hopefully dave will be sanctioned to go ahead and build rangers back up to the club that i remember , capable of winning trophies
brown believes his former ibrox team - mate should keep the job full - time - but he does not think rangers should even contemplate hanging around in the second - tier for another season if they can help it
' rangers are a massive club , the biggest in scotland
' the simple answer is that rangers need to be back up there now
' rangers will challenge celtic if they get back into the premier league
