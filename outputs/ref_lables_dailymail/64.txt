i supported mark completely ' gibson , defending , said it was a tragedy sparked by wayne , ' a jekyll and hyde character ' who when drunk ' would pick an argument and fight even his friends '
mr gibson said the injuries wayne suffered in the first fight were ' lawfully inflicted ' and mark had tried to avoid more violence
' but he added : ' the trigger here is a man asleep in bed , being attacked by another man with a knife
' mr justice king said mark unleashed a ' frenzied ' attack on his brother and said it was not true that he had acted only in self - defence and bore no responsibility
