more than 1,000 cuban properties are listed on airbnb , with 40 per cent located in the capital of havana kay kuehne , regional director for airbnb , told the ap : â we believe that cuban could become one of airbnb 's biggest markets in latin america
â forty per cent of airbnb âs listings in cuban are in havana , while the rest are mostly located in tourist hotspots along the coast
â tourists leave a privately - owned home with rooms for rent in havana for the time being non-us travellers will not be able to book rooms or flats in cuban through airbnb one of the biggest hurdles airbnb hosts are currently facing is the lack of internet access across the island , which restricts their ability to check on bookings and respond to questions from potential guests
