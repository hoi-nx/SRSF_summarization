jessica ennis-hill has begun communication with the iaaf in the aim of being rewarded with world championship gold from 2011 after champion chernova was exposed as a drug cheat
in january chernova was found to have provided a positive sample for a prohibited steroid at the world championships
the russia anti-doping agency issued a backdated ban and annulled her records from 15 august 2009 to 14 august 2011 â just 16 days before she beat ennis by 129 points in the heptathlon in daegu , south korea
chernova ( left ) failed a drugs test two years before beating jessica ennis-hill in south korea in 2011 ennis-hill believes it is unfair that chernova was banned but allowed to keep her world title ennis-hil has written to the iaaf to ask shy chernova has been allowed to keep her world title ennis-hill , then the defending world champion , had to settle for silver
the following year the brit took gold in memorable scenes at london olympic games , with chernova third
chernova 's ban is due to expire on june 21 â in time for this year âs world championships in beijing in august and , of course , the 2016 olympics in rio
â obviously i 'm not happy about how the ban has been handled , â said ennis-hill
â i ca nât really understand it myself
i 've spoken to british athletics and the iaaf and i am putting my faith to look into it a bit more
â i ca n't understand how that is fair
ennis-hill suggested she may have suspected chernova but could not have allowed herself to think about anything other than her competition
earlier this year russia 's athletics head coach valentin maslakov resigned after a number of athletes from the country were found guilty of committing doping offences
