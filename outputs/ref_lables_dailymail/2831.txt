tiger woods achieved it at the home of golf
and now rory mcilroy has the chance to join the exalted company of just five men at augusta , of all places
as tiger woods put it : ' where better could you ask for than to complete it here ?

this 79th masters was set up beautifully as it was , with rory mcilroy 's bid to win a third straight major , but tiger woods 's return has elevated it to another plane
