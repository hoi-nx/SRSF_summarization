spiders on mars may have been predicted by david bowie , but in fact spiders in space could help us get to the red planet
tether unlimited has revealed a system of robo spiders than can construct solar panels , trusses and other parts of spacecraft in orbit
spiderfab uses arachnid - like droids to construct large objects in orbit
spiderfab could cut construction costs by only launching raw materials such as carbon fibre into orbit
the system uses arachnid - like robots to construct large objects in orbit around the earth or further into the solar system
' ' our really long - term objective for all of this work is to eventually enable the use of in - situ resources to construct the infrastructure in space needed to support humanity 's expansion throughout the solar system , ' dr. hoyt claimed last month during a presentation with nasa 's future in - space operations ( fiso ) working group
under a nasa contract , the firm is currently implementing the first step in the spiderfab architecture : a machine that uses 3d printing techniques and robotic assembly to fabricate long , high - performance truss structures
