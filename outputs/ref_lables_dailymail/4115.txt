the mother of a young woman who suffers from lupus , an inflammatory disease which affects the immune system , has hit back at a stranger who left a cruel note on her daughter âs car claiming she had no right to park in a disabled space â despite the fact that she has a handicap permit
corinna , from pittsburgh , pennsylvania , took to facebook to publicly shame the anonymous note writer , while also defending her daughter harley jo , a student at ohio state university , and her condition
' noted : harley jo skorpenske , who suffers from lupus , discovered this note on her car after stopping at a cvs in cleveland , ohio keeping up appearances : the disability caused by harley 's illness is not visible to others , but presents her with a battle every day the harsh note , which was left on harley âs car , despite the fact that that her official handicap tag was clearly visible , read : ' you should be ashamed ! when you take a handicap spot , an actual disabled person suffers
' the person who wrote it evidently saw harley walk into the pharmacy unaided , and assumed that she was lying about being disabled
in response to the note , harley 's mother corinna wrote an open letter on facebook , hoping it would eventually reach the person whose ignorance had so upset her daughter , and also aiming to raise awareness for non-visible ' ghost diseases ' such as harley 's
including a photo of the note lying on top of harley 's handicap tag , corinna wrote in her post : ' to the person who left this on my daughter âs car
you 'd never know : harley may struggle every day , but she continues to persevere , unbeknownst to many of those around her mom knows best : corrina skorpenske ( pictured ) hopes to find the writer of the note and change that person 's - and others ' - perceptions about ' ghost diseases ' ' wishing so much for you to have stopped and talked to this amazing person before leaving this
if you had , you would have known that my daughter has a disease
corinna went on to explain in detail the laborious battle her daughter has been through since being diagnosed with lupus aged 16
' i think you would love her ' : harley 's mother leapt to her daughter 's ( pictured ) defense in an open letter , describing her as a fighter and an ' amazing person ' ' i may not be a perfect parent , but i know i did good with her ! ' corinna 's letter is finished with a plea to the writer of the note , saying she hopes to find him or her : ' not to tell you how wrong you were in leaving that note ... but to give you the opportunity to meet my girl
' ' people with ghost illnesses are often labeled as lazy or fakes , ' corinna told yahoo health
