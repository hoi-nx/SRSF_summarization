the regular version , which costs from $ 549 ( Â£ 479 ) and the edition watch , from $ 12,000 ( Â£ 8,000 ) both have sapphire glass screens , while the cheaper ' apple watch sport ' version , costing from $ 349 ( Â£ 299 ) has a strengthened ion-x glass screen , which iphonefixed describes as â more shatterproof and impact resistant than sapphire glass '
