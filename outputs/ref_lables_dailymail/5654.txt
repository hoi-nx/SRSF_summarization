economists plotted how much goods listed on ebay sold for and discovered that items with precise prices attract higher offers than those with round numbers , such as $ 1,000
in fact , sellers who end their price with â 00 â typically receive offers that are five to eight per cent lower than those with more specific prices
us researchers claim that exact prices of goods on ebay attract higher offers than round numbers
this chart shows that when the posted initial price is of a round number ( the red dots ) , like $ 1,000 , the average counteroffer is much lower than if it is a non-round number ( the blue circles ) , like $ 1,079 in terms of the study , the word ' odd ' is used to represent an unusual number , and not the opposite of even
within that range , sellers are looking for a higher price while buyers would like a lower one , so each has an incentive to signal to the other their willingness to be a tough negotiator
sellers on ebay who end their price with â 00 â typically receive offers for their goods that are five to eight per cent lower than those with more specific prices , such as this watch example while ebay is used for auctions , the bulk of its business comes from ' buy it now ' sales , such as this iphone
the study found that prices that end in ' 00 ' as above are more likely to sell quickly , but may not attract the most lucrative counter offers from sellers researchers from cornell university , ebay research labs and the university of california , have addressed the problem in a new paper
researchers from cornell university , ebay research labs and the university of california looked at pricing strategies within the confines of ebay âs so - called ' negotiation platform '
the study found that when the initial price is a round number , such as $ 1,000 , the average counteroffer is between five and eight per cent lower than if it is a non-round number , like $ 1,079
in fact , the economists said sellers can even end up with a higher counteroffer if they list at $ 997 rather than $ 1,000
but sellers with round numbers are more likely to close a deal six to 11 days sooner , and are up to 5 per cent more likely to sell at all
the researchers applied their findings to house sales and discovered that people looking to sell their house quickly should pick a round number , but if they 're willing to wait , an odd one is more likely to get a good price while the study is new , professor gans said the technique to sell houses ( a stock image is shown ) as quickly as possible , or for as much money as possible , is already used by estate agents alternatively more patient sellers may be using non-round numbers to signal their toughness
but sellers with round numbers are more likely to close a deal six to 11 days sooner , and are up to 5 per cent more likely to sell at all
prices ending in 99 cents , or 99 pence , are very common in shops and send out the same type of signal as the â 00 â prices , they said
