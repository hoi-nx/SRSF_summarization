the bbc co-host appears to have already launched a new career - as a documentary maker of incredibly dull things
the 45 - year - old , whose top gear future has been in doubt since clarkson 's unceremonious sacking , has released his first home video on a new channel on youtube
using the username ' hammond is bored ' , the presenter entitled the video ' bored ' , before publishing an edited version under the equally - inspired name of ' bored 2 '
the amusing but mind - numbing film - which lasts for ten minutes - begins with hammond lying on top of a wall on his farm in ross-on-wye
he is seen shouting at the top of his voice - to no one except his dog - that he is ' bored ! ' the slickly - edited video then follows hammond as he drives along the m6 and country roads to buttermere in the lake district , cumbria
the film follows hammond as he takes his dog to buttermere in the lake district to learn how to herd sheep amid scenes of the national park in all its springtime glory , the footage follows hammond as he learns from local farmers about how to look after sheep
but , unlike his top gear presenting style , hammond rarely speaks during the film , sharing only a few key insights such as : ' it 's raining ' and ' what are we doing ? ' the film then ends with a cliff hanger which shows hammond releasing some of the sheep back onto his farm in wales - but realising that he has left his beloved dog behind
it follows the former top gear co-host as he drives along the m6 listening to radio , with his dog in the car it also shows him having a few drinks in the pub. unlike his top gear presenting style , hammond rarely speaks during the film , sharing only a few key insights such as : ' it 's raining ' and ' what are we doing ? ' two hours after promoting his film via twitter , hammond thanked his fans for their comments - but said it had not abated his boredom
' many comments on my little bored film
called it bored 2 and put it on youtube on ' hammond is bored '
' yesterday , clarkson - who was sacked from top gear last month - revealed that hammond was spending his days trying to train his dog
the film ends with a cliff hanger which shows hammond releasing some of the sheep back onto his farm - but realising his dog is missing in an amusing end scene , the dog is scene sitting next to the lake , worryingly looking around for her owner ' and now , after just a couple of weeks , he reports that the dog in question hates him and hides whenever he comes into the room
' clarkson also reflected on the perils of being unemployed , saying he has to make everything ' last for hours ' to fill the gaping chasm left by top gear
because what the hell do they do all day to stay sane ? ' earlier this month , james may also took to youtube to share his jobless life with friends
it has already been watched more than 230,000 times in a badly - lit video , the former bbc presenter gave a ' masterclass ' in making a shepherd 's pie
he had previously posted a video showing him tackling ' greensleeves ' on his recorder while struggling with a hangover â a popular piece that has thus far notched up over half - a - million views
a source told the daily mirror : ' hammond is a tv presenter and this could be his chance to become top dog - he 's been on the show a bit longer than james may
' all three were on the cusp of signing new three - year deals when the clarkson fracas unfolded
the day after clarkson 's sacking , may gave a big hint that he has no plans to return to top gear , suggesting he is to â go back to normal life
â but bbc bosses are reportedly still trying to persuade hammond and james may to continue with the show , in a bid to cling onto long - term fans the presenter admitted he was already considering what to do next with his life - and suggested he might even ditch cars to become a teacher
' if clarkson is not in it and hammond and james may are , that needs to be a conversation with them as well
