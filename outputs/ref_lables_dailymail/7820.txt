the new horizons spacecraft has taken its first colour image of pluto and its largest moon charon ahead of its arrival in three months
taken from a distance of 71 million miles ( 115 million km ) , the blurry image does nât reveal a huge amount of detail - but it is a sign of things to come
as the spacecraft gets closer and closer , the images will continue to improve until it flies by on 14 july - humanity âs first ever visit to pluto
nearly there : after more than nine years , the new horizons spacecraft is now just three months away from its historic encounter with pluto
and now the spacecraft has taken its first colour image , shown , revealing the dwarf planet ( the bigger blob ) and its moon charon after a journey of more than nine years , nasa âs new horizons spacecraft is now reaching the climax of its thrilling mission
in july this year new horizons will become the first spacecraft ever to visit pluto
it was launched on 19 january 2006 at a speed of 36,373 mph ( 58,536 km / h ) - the fastest spacecraft ever to leave earth orbit , 100 times faster than a jetliner after passing the orbits of all the major planets from earth to neptune , new horizons is now beginning its final leg of its 3 billion - mile ( 4.8 billion km ) journey
on 14 july 2015 the flyby of pluto will begin
using a suite of instruments , the spacecraft will map the surface of pluto and its moon charon to a resolution of 25 miles ( 40km ) - far better than anything possible before
despite the long journey , new horizons will be travelling at such a speed that the flyby will last only around two hours - beginning at 11.49am gmt ( 06.49am est ) on 14 july and ending just after 2.15pm gmt ( 9.15am est )
after passing pluto , new horizons will flyby one or several kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) , other bodies beyond the orbit of pluto
pluto was demoted from a â planet â to a â dwarf planet â in 2006 when other objects of a similar or greater size were found
â new horizons is one of the great explorations of our time , â said new horizons project scientist hal weaver at the apl in laurel , maryland
â we âre not rewriting textbooks with this historic mission - we âll be writing them from scratch
the image shows pluto with a sort of reddish colour and charon - which is just over half the size of pluto - considerably dimmer
our best images of pluto so far come from the hubble ( shown is one of the images ) , so the arrival of new horizons is hugely exciting for scientists , who have waited many years to catch a glimpse of this distant world and unravel some of its secrets new horizons ( artist 's illustration shown ) was launched on 19 january 2006 at a speed of 36,373 mph ( 58,536 km / h ) - the fastest spacecraft ever to leave earth orbit , 100 times faster than a jetliner
owing to the speed of new horizons , the observations of pluto will last just two hours the flyby caps a five - decade - long era of reconnaissance that began with venus and mars in the early 1960s , and continued through first looks at mercury , jupiter and saturn in the 1970s and uranus and neptune in the 1980s
the moon is so big that pluto and charon are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system
the dwarf planet may even harbour an underground ocean
owing to the speed of new horizons , the observations of pluto will last just two hours
' new horizons is flying to pluto - the biggest , brightest and most complex of the dwarf planets in the kuiper belt objects
new horizons ' mission represents the last of the worlds in the ' classical solar system ' to be explored - and will be our sole visitor to pluto for many , many years scientists still know very little about pluto ( illustrated left ) , its largest satellite charon ( right ) and its other moons
when the new horizons mission was first devised in 2001 , it was a mission to just pluto and charon , before the four smaller moons were discovered
currently , even with new horizons closer to pluto than earth is to the sun , the pluto system resembles little more than bright dots in the distance
but teams operating the spacecraft are using these views to refine their knowledge of pluto âs location , and skillfully navigate new horizons toward a precise target point 7,750 miles ( 12,500 kilometers ) from pluto âs surface
this image , taken by nasa 's hubble , shows five moons orbiting the distant , icy dwarf planet pluto
this image was taken with hubble 's wide field camera 3 on 7 july 2012 ' our team has worked hard to get to this point , and we know we have just one shot to make this work , ' said alice bowman , new horizons mission operations manager at the apl ( apl ) in laurel , maryland
beyond pluto , nasa is also planning to study one or two kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) with new horizons in the years after its historic primary mission .
