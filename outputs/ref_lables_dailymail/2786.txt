lorraine bracco has revealed that the sopranos creator david chase wanted her to play the role of tony 's wife carmela and not dr. jennifer melfi , his psychiatrist
the oscar nominated actress , 60 , revealed she turned down the starring role alongside james gandolfini in the landmark hbo drama because she had already played a mobster 's wife in goodfellas , nine years previously
accusing chase of lazy casting , lorraine bracco chose instead the complicated role of jennifer melfi , who provided the therapy that allowed new jersey mob boss tony soprano to justify many of his monstrous acts
and i said , ' look , i do n't think i should play carmela because i did it , i did it in a martin scorsese movie , i got an oscar nomination
what could have been : lorraine bracco wanted to play dr. jennifer melfi ( left ) but was originally asked by show creator david chase to play soprano
he cast edie falco ( right ) instead oscar nominated : lorraine bracco starred opposite ray liotta in goodfellas in 1990
the martin scorsese mob drama is recognized as one of the greatest movies in that genre obviously not wanting to count herself out of what became arguably the best television drama ever made , lorraine bracco asked to play the character of dr. jennifer melfi instead
he said , ' you want to play jennifer melfi ? ' and i said , ' yeah , i want to play mefli '' so i left on that , and he gave it to me
