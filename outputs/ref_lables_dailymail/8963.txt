apple founder steve jobs ' widow laurene has told of her admiration for democratic white house front - runner clinton
ms laurene jobs , 51 , called former first lady clinton a ' revolutionary ' woman , and added that it 's not just because she 's a woman - but ' the type of woman she is '
speaking to time 100 , ms laurene jobs said : ' clinton is not familiar
she is one of america âs greatest modern creations
laurene jobs , pictured , widow of apple 's steve jobs , has strongly backed clinton for president laurene jobs said that clinton , right , has ' judgment and wisdom ' based on her public service ' her decades in our public life must not blind us to the fact that she represents new realities and possibilities
' it matters , of course , that clinton is a woman
' mrs clinton announced her intention to seek the democratic nomination on sunday - and set upon the campaign trail with a trip to meet ' ordinary ' voters in iowa
but she was blasted for her ' staged ' visit on tuesday morning to a coffee shop in leclaire , iowa
bird , one of the men pictured sitting at the table with mrs clinton , claimed the whole event was orchestrated ' from beginning to end '
staged : clinton sat to talk with three young iowans at a coffee shop on tuesday â all of whom were driven to the event by her iowa campaign 's political director not so ordinary : bird is a democratic insider who chauffeured vice president biden around davenport , iowa in october during a pre-election campaign trip bird told daily mail online that campaign staffer price called and asked him and two other young people to meet him tuesday morning at a restaurant in davenport , a nearby city
the three got the lion 's share of mrs. clinton 's time and participated in what breathless news reports described as a ' roundtable ' â the first of many in her brief iowa campaign swing
but then all of a sudden he says , " hey , we have secretary clinton coming in , would you like to go meet her ? " ' ' and then we got in a car â troy 's car â and we went up to the coffee house , and we sat at a table and then clinton just came up and talked with us
clinton 's team tapped him last week to be its political director in iowa
bird is a government and community relations coordinator at genesis health system in davenport , iowa , according to his linkedin profile
when no one recognized the former first lady â she was wearing sunglasses â the campaign leaked information to the new york times so its reporters could get security - camera footage to prove she had tried to mingle with voters
scripting supposedly off - the - cuff appearances is common in presidential politics but could hurt clinton especially hard since her gonzo road - trip journey to america 's broad midwest is designed to counter her image as cold , calculating and politically venomous
and planting party insiders in place of typical iowans wo n't go over well in the iowa , where pressing the flesh and collecting caucus votes is a quadrennial full - contact sport
astroturf : setting up faux events for news cameras is nothing new in politics , but iowans take presidential contests seriously and could punish clinton for the deception the fixer : bird said troy prince ( left , pictured with vp biden ) , who was executive director of the iowa democratic party until he left last month to help clinton 's statewide political effort , recruited him and others to attend the ' spontaneous ' coffee meeting clinton 's campaign has already taken heat for depicting at least three people in her campaign launch video as ' everyday ' america who were actually partisans with political connections
in leclaire on tuesday , bloomberg and other outlets referred to bird as a ' student ' at st. ambrose university , not as a hospital government - affairs staffer with democratic street - cred
