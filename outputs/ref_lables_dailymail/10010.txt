in telly terms , the fa cup has had quite - what they like to call in the trade - a ' journey â this season

well , some twenty four hour or so later , wembley was certainly delighted to host them
arsenal players celebrate during the victory over royals which saw the gunners reach the fa cup final fabian delph ( centre ) is congratulated by his team - mates after scoring against liverpool at wembley wembley was a great setting for this weekend 's two fa cup semi-final clashes prior to that first clash on saturday between arsenal and royals , there had also been disgruntled talk from inside the emirates stadium
