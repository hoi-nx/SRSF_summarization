george was last seen running off in the direction of a caravan park near his home in north wales and was found on a doorstep in yorkshire five weeks later
he has now been reunited with his owners after julia hill , who found the 18 - year - old tabby outside her home in calderdale last week , posted on a lost and found cats facebook group
' at the time he thought nothing of it and did n't say anything but when we got home that afternoon george was nowhere to be seen
' we think george must have sneaked into the car and ran towards the caravan site that is nearby
' we ca n't think of any other way of him getting to yorkshire other than stowing away in a vehicle or caravan belonging to a tourist
he has now been reunited with owners steven davison and his wife susan ( pictured together with george ) ' we thought we 'd lost him for good so it 's amazing to have him back
' but the mammoth cross-country journey took its toll on the 18 - year - old cat and when the family went to collect him they realised he had cat flu
' ms julia hill , who found george and started the appeal , said the cat was ' poorly , thin and grumpy ' when he turned up on her doorstep
