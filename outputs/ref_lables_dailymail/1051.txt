the incoming ecb chairman has been responsible for the mixed messages that leave the england team in as big a state of turmoil and internal rebellion as ever
graves has made a habit of talking before thinking since being announced as ecb chairman he has become the loose cannon of english cricket â and he has yet to take up office
so when graves said that kevin pietersen â exiled for valid reasons after the last ashes debacle before producing a nasty autobiography that only supported the ecb 's decision â had to be playing county cricket to earn an england recall , it was put down to yorkshire straight - talking
yet subsequently , most importantly in a phone conversation with kevin pietersen , graves has done little to play down the 34 - year - old 's chances â even if privately the chairman is said to be perplexed at the media 's ' spin ' on his apparent opening of the england door
and if graves disagreed with the original decision to axe kevin pietersen , then he had a duty as deputy chairman of the ecb to say so then , not wait until he had taken over from giles clarke
since his kevin pietersen outburst , graves has said that there will be an inquiry if england do not beat a ' mediocre ' west indies in the upcoming three - test series
then graves came out with the ridiculous notion of reducing test matches to four days
former england batsman kevin pietersen has been linked with a return to the national side recently if graves wants to make himself useful , then he should concentrate on his supposed main aim of introducing a 10 - team english premier league franchise twenty20 competition
