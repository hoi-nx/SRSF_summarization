this is a shocking collection of harrowing photographs of the death and destruction visited on armenians by ottoman turks turkey a century ago that were taken by an us and a colleague who risked imprisonment to smuggle them out and show the world the full horror of what happened
john elder and wegner both documented the unimaginable suffering they witnessed in images which helped build a case against a turkish government which still denies the slaughter of up to 1.5million armenians constituted genocide
as armenians mark 100 years since the atrocities , many western countries still do not use that word , and us president barack obama is once again unlikely to do so in his upcoming statement marking the anniversary despite pledging he would during his election campaign
more than 150,000 armenians children were left parentless by the end of 1918 armenians deportees travel on foot in 1915 as taken by wegner , including women and children on an unpaved road in the desert sun a crowd looks on as armenians are hanged in the street in constantinople before their forced removal to the desert had begun after april 1915 this image was titled ' abandoned and murdered small children of the ( armenians ) deportees ' by wegner and was taken in 1915 - 1916 wegner , a volunteer military nurse , set up clandestine mail routes with foreign consulates and embassies to get many hundreds of notes , annotations , documents , letters and photographs of the armenians deportation camps to german and the us
he did so in defiance of strict orders from the turkish and german authorities aimed at preventing any evidence of the horrors of the ' genocide ' reaching the outside world
but his ruse was discovered and he was arrested by the german authorities and put to serve in cholera wards in baghdad at the request of the turkish command
there he fell seriously ill , and german - born wegner left for constantinople ( modern - day istanbul ) in november 1916
hidden in his belt were his photographic plates , and those of other german officers , with images of the armenians massacre to which he had been a witness
his images , which along with john elder 's were provided to mailonline by the washington dc - based armenian national institute , still retain the power to shock as the world marks the 100th anniversary of the ' genocide ' today
the then two million strong armenians minority were persecuted by a government suspicious that as christian they were more loyal to christian governments like that of russian than they were to the ottoman turks caliphate
and in a third of wegner 's incredible images taken in 1915 , a band of armenians deportees , including a woman carrying a baby , children and elderly men , stagger through the desert along an unpaved road in the blazing suns towards their hellish new lives as refugees
john elder , from pennsylvania , was a relief worker in the armenians capital of yerevan from 1917 to 1919
the city was occupied in 1920 and is now part of a region of eastern turkey ' a 15 - year - old child who died of starvation ' , according to wegner , who took the image of the two bodies of young boys in 1915 - 1916 armenians deportees living in the open desert with bedding as their only shelter , though luckier families in the background have tents he also painted a heartrending picture of the nightmare he witnessed using his camera
in light of such evidence barack obama 's reticence to use the word ' genocide ' , in a bid to placate us 's turkish allies , has disappointed many
several us officials said there had been a sharp internal debate over whether to use the 100 - year anniversary to call the killings ' genocide ' and make good on the president 's campaign promise , particularly after pope used the term earlier this month
the city is now called gyumri , the second largest in armenians wegner ( left ) fearlessly documented the horror with his camera just like john elder , who took this image of an armenians refugee ( right ) a burial service is held at a deportation camp
wegner describe the scene as ' armenians deportees living in the open desert under makeshift tents
clothing of some deportees is already worn to rags ' a painfully thin orphan of the massacre ( left ) taken by john elder in yerevan , now the capital of armenians , in 1918
several european governments and parliaments are also expected to use the word in discussions of the events 100 years ago
recep tayyip erdogan , the turkish president , said at a press conference on wednesday he ' would not want barack obama to use the word " genocide " and would not expect such a thing
in his formal statement on the anniversary he also insisted that armenians losses were among many in the first world war and that it was a form of ' discrimination ' to focus on armenians and not on ' turkish and muslim ottomans ' who died at the same time
us president barack obama ( right ) continues to avoid using the word ' genocide ' in connection with what happened to the armenians at the hands of the ottoman turks
