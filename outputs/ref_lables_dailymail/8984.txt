a 19 - year - old model in california has taken to bathing in pig 's blood in a desperate â and bizarre â attempt to maintain her youthful appearance â despite the fact that she is a vegetarian
in the latest episode of mtv 's true life , entitled ' i 'm obsessed with staying young ' , freelance model chanel details her unique skincare method , which she tries to justify by claiming that ' thousands of years ago people did this and it worked '
' my greatest fear is getting old and developing wrinkles and extra loose skin , ' chanel says
her desperation to remain looking as young as possible for as long as possible has driven chanel to a number of extraordinary lengths , most notably covering her body in animal blood , a process she insists will ' keep the skin looking soft and tight '
the model also shows off a myriad of other ' beauty fixes ' she uses , including a daily shot of garlic powder , balsamic vinaigrette , sage , and olive oil - which she claims helps to ' preserve your body ' - as well as a skincare regimen that involves washing her face eight to ten times per day
in the thick of it : chanel seems unperturbed by the process , dunking her hand into the container of blood and examining the contents before pouring it on to herself bloody bizarre : the teenager picked up the blood at a local butcher who asked her if she would prefer pork or beef , to which she replies , ' i do n't eat meat ' the teen 's grandmother , lois , tries her best to dissuade chanel of her latest endeavor , saying she could be risking her well being
later in the episode , chanel claims that though she believes the blood bath helped her self - esteem , she ' has no desire to do it again '
luckily for chanel , the experience of filming with mtv seems to have had a positive outcome
