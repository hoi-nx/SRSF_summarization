trillions of pounds worth of oil â as much as the entire north sea fields â lies beneath an area of england dubbed â uk âs dallas â , it was claimed yesterday
analysis suggests there is up to 100billion barrels of the fossil fuel under the home counties
the potential goldmine in the weald basin , across surrey , sussex , hampshire and kent , could meet up to a third of uk âs oil demand within 15 years , according to the consortium exploring the area
since 1975 , of an estimated 100billion barrels of oil in the uk north sea , only 45billion have been pumped out
experts warned last night that only a fraction of the weald basin oil may be accessible for extraction
uk oil & gas investments , which has a 30 per cent stake , said â cutting - edge â data suggested the oilfield holds 158million barrels per square mile â equating to 100billion barrels across the basin
at current crude prices , this could be worth Â£ 3.7trillion
stephen sanderson of ukog , which insisted it would not use fracking , said : â by 2030 , we could produce 10 per cent to 30 per cent of the uk âs oil demand from within the weald area
us firm nutech , which conducted the tests , estimated 3 per cent to 15 per cent of the oilfield could be extracted â up to 15billion barrels
a study by the university suggested a maximum of 40billion barrels in the region , while the british geological survey estimated the basin held just 4.4billion barrels of shale oil
discovery : the horse hill site near gatwick in sussex , where a large amount of oil has apparently been found drilling : exploratory wells have found that the ground contains 158million barrels per square mile development : the site is owned by a number of companies including uk oil & gas investments the professor added : â the question will be how much of it we can actually get out and whether it is commercially and technologically viable to do so
â there might be 100billion barrels of oil beneath the home counties â but residents living above it may not receive a penny of the profits
the government also gains money from the tax it receives on the oil extracted
oil rush : the weald basin , of which horse hill is part , could contain a total of 100billion barrels mystery : it is not yet known how much of the area 's oil will be easily recoverable boom : the sussex countryside could soon be dotted with oil wells ( file photo )
