model and actress lafontaine is not a daredevil stunt driver who raced in furious 7 7 - she just plays one on tv
in the run - up to the premiere of the latest installment in the fast & furious franchise , the athletic , petite brunette gained notice with her claims she was the sole female stunt driver in the action flick starring vin diesel , michelle rodriguez and dwayne johnson
' being both an actress and stunt driver , there is no better film to be involved in , ' she told her interviewer
when asked what it was like being the only female stunt car driver , lafontaine addressed some of the challenges of working in a male dominated - industry
' female stunt drivers are far and few in between , ' she lamented , without missing a beat
' but to be the only female stunt driver on a set of this magnitude was absolutely mind blowing ! i feel very honored
nice try : lafontaine even photoshopped herself into a poster of the film , wedging her picture between michelle rodriguez and the late paul walker cog in a machine : a stunt supervisor on furious 7 said lafontaine worked as an extra on the set ( pictured ) - one among some 1,500 people more lies : during an interview with new york fashion times , lafontaine said she became licensed with the international stunt association in europe and later got certified as a stunt driver in california when asked about the passing of fast & furious franchise stalwart paul walker , who was killed in a car crash last year , lafontaine said that he was sorely missed on the set , where she described the mood as very somber
lafontaine then launched into a monologue about how proud she was to be part of the furious 7 stunt family , how she has never sought public recognition for her ' craft , ' and how driving was in her blood
during that interview , ms lafontaine causally mentioned that she has been in the stunt industry ' for a while ' - a statement that would come back to haunt her later on
the cnn ireport from the hollywood premiere last friday raised some eyebrows among stunt drivers , who wasted no time calling lafontaine out as a con artist
backlash : members of the stunt community quickly called out lafontaine for her fibs on twitter and facebook , insisting that she was a fraud and a liar brazen : lafontaine , pictured right with director marc scarpa , talked about the somber mood on the set after paul walker 's passing last year eddie perez , a director and stunt coordinator , tweeted in response to lafontaine âs bold claims : ' social media and self promotion can be deceiving but you will get caught
as the automotive blog reported , lafontaine âs lie - riddled interview on cnn ireport was not a matter of an ambitious performer getting carried away or fudging a few minor details , given that she has made similar claims on other occasions
during an interview with new york fashion times , lafontaine asserted that after being asked to perform car stunts in a movie she was in , she became licensed with the international stunt association in europe and later got certified as a stunt driver in california
he also refuted lafontaine âs assertion that she was the only female driver on set , saying that the production involved at least seven or eight female stunt doubles , including the veteran racer debbie evans leavitt
about - face : in response to the growing outrage sparked by her claims , lafontaine issued a statement on her facebook monday apologizing for a ' misunderstanding ' small - time thespian : lafontaine has about a dozen and half minor movie credits â including a manicurist in what just happened and a hotel guest in will smith âs hitch she listed furious 7 7 as her most recent project on imdb , describing herself as an unaccredited ' race car driver ' in the film in response to the growing backlash sparked by her furious 7 premiere interview , lafontaine issued a muddled statement on her facebook monday apologizing for a ' misunderstanding
