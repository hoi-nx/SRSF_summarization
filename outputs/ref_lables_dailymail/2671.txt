the zulus king blamed for sparking the violence against foreigners which has seen south african 's streets turn into battlefields running with blood over the past two weeks is no stranger to scandal

a speech given by the king goodwill zwelithini in durban last month , denouncing foreigners as ' ants ' and ' lice ' who should leave the country , has been blamed for sparking the violence
the hellish scenes across townships in south african are a far cry from king zwelithini 's opulent marriage to his sixth wife mafu , a 28 - year - old princess from the neighbouring kingdom of swazi , in july , which included a marquee , catering and flowers for 5,000 invited guests
in total , the extravaganza , attended by 5,000 people , cost an estimated Â£ 250,000
and he decided they all needed new , imported military regalia to wear to the opening of kwazulu natal 's state legislature later this year - at the not insignificant price of Â£ 155,000 , the sunday times claimed

and just last month , the sunday times reported that the king goodwill zwelithini had bought each of his queens a new mercedes sedan , in addition to a seventh model ' as a back up '
