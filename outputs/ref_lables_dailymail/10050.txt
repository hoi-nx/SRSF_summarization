theresa may warned last night that lives will be in danger if britain is saddled with a hung parliament unable to pass anti-terror laws
the home secretary said new legislation was urgently needed to update the powers of mi5 and gchq , and repair the damage done by the us traitor snowden
but , based on current polling , parliament would be left deadlocked â with the balance of power held by scottish nationalists opposed to updating the law
home secretary theresa may ( pictured ) warned that lives will be in danger if britain is saddled with a hung parliament unable to pass anti-terror laws - adding new legislation for mi5 and gchq is urgently needed she urged wavering ukip supporters and the four in ten voters who say they are still undecided to realise what is at stake for britain âs security on may 7
the situation is made especially acute by a â poison pill â inserted into emergency anti-terror laws passed last year
and if mps can not agree on a replacement , britain âs spies will be unable to properly track the communications of islamic state and other terrorists
mrs may said that , in the worst scenario , the decision would be in the hands of a minority miliband government propped up by the snp â which is opposed to new data retention powers , her comments follow a controversial warning by defence secretary fallon that labour might be unable to renew the trident nuclear deterrent if it is reliant on sturgeon âs snp â as the polls say is highly likely
defence secretary fallon ( pictured ) said labour might be unable to renew the trident nuclear deterrent if it is reliant on sturgeon âs snp mr fallon said that , having stabbed his brother in the back to get the labour leadership , mr miliband may now do the same to his country over national security
there is a concern where we have a hung parliament where it is difficult to get legislation through or a labour government that is propped up by the snp
â the anti-terror law due to expire next year is the data retention and investigatory powers act , passed as emergency legislation in 2014
