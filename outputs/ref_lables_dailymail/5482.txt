a football club chairman has warned of a new breed of hooliganism in the sport â from retired grandfathers who are trying to relive their youth and encourage violence on match days
dave doggett , the boss of league two outfit cambridge united , believes groups of up to 10 men - aged in their 50s and 60s - are trying to relive the 1980s by arranging fights with rivals prior to games
he said violence at matches has increased recently as the older men return to watching their team play in their retirement and fears there is a danger that they will try to encourage younger fans to join their ' gangs '
' peter woor , a cambridge united fan , said he had noticed that the hooliganism of the 1970s and 1980s still lingers in games against local rivals such as southend united and luton town
