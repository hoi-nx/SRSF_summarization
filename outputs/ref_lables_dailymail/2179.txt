it took louis van gaal less than a minute of his weekly press conference to burst manchester united 's bubble and re-open some of the more troubling issues of his time in charge at old trafford
the dutch wasted no time in revealing that michael carrick , daley blind , phil jones and marcos rojo will miss the much - anticipated clash with chelsea at stamford bridge through injury
four players capable of filling two key positions
rooney arrives in london ahead of the chelsea clash while ashley young ( right ) poses with a fan manchester united captain rooney could be dropped further back into midfield against chelsea rooney had been impressing for the red devils in his favoured striking role but manchester united have players out michael carrick ( left ) limped off against city while marcos rojo ( right ) picked up an injury too daley blind ( left ) and phil jones ( right ) are also out injured for manchester united ahead of their game with chelsea manchester united midfielder mata posts a picture on his official instagram of the squad 's journey to london manchester united boss louis van gaal ( left ) and assistant ryan giggs ( right ) carry their luggage on friday van gaal puts his arm around rooney during a training session earlier this week ahead of saturday 's game the uplifting victory in last weekend 's manchester derby has come at a price
all of a sudden , manchester united 's chances of extending an impressive run of six straight premier league wins by becoming the first top - flight team to win away at chelsea this season look decidedly slimmer
van gaal must take on his old apprentice jose mourinho without either of his two first - choice holding midfielders , michael carrick and blind , and two senior centre - backs in phil jones and marcos rojo
it means that captain rooney is likely to be asked to sacrifice himself for the team once again by dropping into midfield â an issue that both player and manager must have hoped was behind them
with robin van persie not ready to return from injury , that in turn raises the old question about whether radamel falcao has the necessary match sharpness to replace rooney and lead manchester united 's attack having not started a game since february
manchester united striker robin van persie has not yet been passed fit enough to return to first - team action there remain doubts over radamel falcao 's ability to fill the void in manchester united 's attack against chelsea luke shaw is set to take over from daley blind at left back despite fitness concerns that have plagued him since his Â£ 28million move from southampton last summer and led to him being hooked at half - time in the fa cup defeat by arsenal last month , not to be seen since
was he concerned by the lack of playing time among the players he may turn to ? the manchester united boss answered with one of his dutch sayings
luke shaw ( left ) looks set to return to the manchester united first - team , while rooney will drop into midfield ' i did n't have injuries anymore and now , coincidentally , we have four in two positions where we do n't have any other players
' it 's the worst scenario because marcos rojo and phil jones are good players at the left central defender position
' blind and michael carrick could play the midfield holding position and i do n't have any other option , or i have to play rooney in that position again
' with chelsea holding an eight - point lead and a game in hand over manchester united , van gaal is experienced enough to know that even victory is unlikely to make any difference in the title race
' but , all right , we have to play against them and so do arsenal so we can lay pressure on chelsea 's shoulders
' they play at home but i think that chelsea will be satisfied with a draw
