the arrival of an advanced group of modern humans in europe 40,000 years ago played a role in the demise of neanderthals , scientists have claimed
now scientists have found proof that a group of modern humans known as the protoaurignacian culture arrived in southern europe at around the same time the neanderthals disappeared
scientists took ct scans of teeth found at riparo bombrini in western ligurian alps ( left ) and in the grotta di fumane in western lessini mountains ( right ) , both in italy , and found they belonged to ancestors of modern humans who were part of a group known as the protoaurignacian culture they have been able to conclusively show that a pair of ancient baby teeth found at two prehistoric sites in northern italy belong to modern humans from this culture
an incisor found in riparo bombrini in western ligurian alps in 1976 , and an upper incisor found in 1992 , in the grotta di fumane in the western lessini mountains in italy are among only three remains thought to have belonged to the protoaurignacian culture - an early group of humans
they found that the enamel on the crown of the teeth was thicker than that found on neanderthals teeth and it was more similar in morphology to modern humans
using advanced scanning and dna analysis , researchers have now been able to prove that these teeth belonged to protoaurignacian humans and are the oldest modern human remains in europe
the aurignacian culture that followed the arrival of these first modern humans produced the world âs earliest known musical instruments and the oldest wall art. they also produced advanced bone and antler based weapons , and are thought to have been behind a 40,000 - year - old sculpture known as the lion man
â there are very few archaeological remains of the protoaurignacian culture from when they arrived in europe
the baby teeth , found at two sites in north italy shown above , are two of just three protoaurignacian remains using advanced scanning and dna analysis , researchers have proved the teeth belonged to this culture and that they are the oldest modern human remains in europe
they suggest it was the arrival of this modern human culture ( infant skull pictured left ) led to the rapid disappearance of neanderthals ( skull pictured right ) this fragment bird bone was engraved by inhabitants of a rock shelter at riparo bombrini in north west italy and is now known to have been made by the first modern humans in europe who arrived 40,000 years ago ct scans of the incisor found at riparo bombrini ( above ) showed it had thicker enamel than neanderthals teeth and it was more similar in morphology to modern humans
they found that the enamel on the crown of the teeth was thicker than that found on neanderthals teeth and it was more similar in morphology to modern humans
the researchers say that the findings prove that by 41,000 years ago modern humans of the protoaurignacian culture were spreading across southern europe
they believe that the advanced culture of these modern humans allowed them to outcompete and perhaps even overpower the neanderthals who were established there
however , their results can not exclude the possibility that the teeth came from individuals who were the result of interbreeding between neanderthals and modern humans
one of the teeth was found during an excavation of the grotta di fumane in northern italy ( shown above )
