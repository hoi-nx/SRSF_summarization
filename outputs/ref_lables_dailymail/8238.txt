more than $ 440,000 has been raised for an indiana pizzeria that said it would refuse to serve gay marriage ceremonies under new religious freedom laws after it was reportedly forced to close its doors
kevin oâconnor , who owns memories pizza in the small town of walkerton , told reporters he has temporarily shut the restaurant 's doors after he received abusive phone calls and was trolled online
a contributor from glenn beck 's the blaze set up a fundraising page on gofundme for the pizzeria , with a goal of helping ' the family stave off the burdensome cost of having the media parked out front , activists tearing them down , and no customers coming in '
speaking to abc57 on tuesday , crystal o'connor said : ' if a gay couple came in and wanted us to provide pizzas for their wedding , we would have to say no. â the comments sparked fierce debate after they were published , and now tmz is reporting that the pizzeria has closed its doors until the dust settles
according to the gossip site , o'connor also tried to clarify his views , saying he would never refuse to serve gay customers , but as a christian he disagrees with gay marriage , and so would refuse to serve a same - sex wedding
however , it is not all bad news for memories , as supporters have hit back , raising more than $ 440,000 for the embattled owners via a fundraising page in just one day
two thumbs down : the pizzeria 's yelp page was targeted by those who disagreed with the o'connors ' statements , attracting hundreds of one star reviews several reviewers invoked adolf and the kkk in their eviscerating assessments of the pizzeria when indiana governor pence , a gop , signed the controversial religious freedom restoration act into law last week , the oâconnor family in walkerton applauded his decision
pence said in a statement last thursday that the bill ensures â religious liberty is fully protected under indiana law
â critics of the legislation said it could allow discrimination against gay people , but its supporters claimed the bill merely seeks to prevent the government from compelling people to provide such things as catering or photography for same - sex weddings or other activities they find objectionable on religious grounds
why should i be beat over the head to go along with something they choose ? â divisive bill : indiana governor pence , a gop , signed the controversial religious freedom restoration act into law last week the pizzeria owners made it clear that if a gay couple came to the restaurant , they would not deny them service - they simply would not cater a same - sex reception
the story of a small - town pizza joint backing a divisive piece of legislation has sparked backlash online , with people from across the country leaving strongly worded comments on the restaurant âs facebook account
the picture section of the review page has also been swamped with images , some of which contain explicit content , supporting homosexuality and gay rights
public outcry : critics of the legislation said it could allow discrimination against gay people demonstrators gather outside the city county building on march 30 in indianapolis , indiana
another critic of the walkerton establishment joked that their discriminatory practices did not go far enough
