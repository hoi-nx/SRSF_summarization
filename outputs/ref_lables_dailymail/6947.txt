target : groups of men and women were asked whether they would kill a young hitler to prevent second world war it is a classic question of morality - if you could travel back in time and prevent the second world war by killing a young hitler , would you ? you could hypothetically save millions of lives - but at the cost of personally murdering someone who had yet to do anything wrong
researchers from germany , canada and the usa analysed answers to the hitler question , and others like it , from 6,100 people
they found that significantly more men than women would kill to save lives further down the line , while women were more troubled by the act itself and would often decide to do nothing
differences : the study revealed that women are more reluctant than men to do something harmful in the short - term to secure a better result in the long term ( file photo ) hard times : another question imagined that the only way out of poverty and stavation was making a young girl do sex work for money ( file photo ) the scientists found that men were moderately more likely to fall into the utilitarian camp , while in women there was a very pronounced trend to go the opposite way
other data also suggested that women found the decisions more agonizing than the men , who had relatively straightforward time coming to their conclusion
rebecca friesdorf , one of the researchers , who is based at wilfrid laurier university in ontario , canada , said that the results seem to show women employ more emotion making their decisions , while men go more on logic alone
