ramos was the first man ramos embraced at the final whistle of real madrid âs dramatic champions league win over atletico madrid on wednesday
ramos ( left ) celebrates with javier hernandez ( centre ) and pepe after real madrid 's winning goal ramos gees up the crowd during another all - action display at the santiago bernabeu for real madrid it was a fiery atletico madrid derby on wednesday night , but ramos ( left ) once again proved his worth to real madrid he often fools around in goal at spain training
he started his real madrid career as a right back and won the european championship there for his country
he has filled in at left - back , can play across the midfield and actually started his youth football career as striker
in spain midfielders who have pace and can head and tackle often end up at centre - back and that is where he has settled
he is real madrid âs carles puyol â the all - action hero who rises above everyone else in in the penalty area in the champions league final and heads in a corner that equalises atletico madrid âs 1 - 0 lead in injury time , allowing real to play out extra-time and score three more to lift the trophy
ramos heads away from his own penalty area , but spent most of the game marshalling the midfield the makeshift midfielder holds off atletico madrid 's koke during a superb display in the middle of the park and when does fall short as he did from the penalty spot against bayern munich in 2010 in the champions league semi-final when he sent his kick â at least as far as twitter was concerned â into outer space , he has the guts to take another one in the european championship final a couple of months later , and not only score but dink it panenka style over the keeper âs dive
the spanish centre - back celebrates his crucial , last - minute goal in last year 's champions league final ramos has shown character to bounce back from his errors , as his penalty for spain in 2012 showed his supporters believe he stands for a dignity that many feel is disappearing from the game
â we would both have never heard the end of it had we been knocked out â he said after that 1 - 0 win with him deployed to win aerial duels with mario mandzukic who ramos had noted dropped back into midfield to get on the end of atletico madrid keeper jan oblak âs drop kicks
he may even cover for luka modric again with the midfielder not back for another five weeks ; he will play as an auxiliary striker if real madrid need a late goal , and he âll go in goal if the emergency presents itself
