he went on to recall how he and screenwriter nicholas pileggi were no longer welcome at their favorite italian restaurant after the movie - and its depiction of italian - american mobsters - upset the owners
' remember that nice italian restaurant in tribeca that we used to go to ? and then when the film came out , the owner of the restaurant said we 're not allowed in anymore because we apparently denigrated a certain ethnic group for the picture ? ' said scorsese
throughout the two - and - a - half - hour screening the audience cheered each major character 's first appearance along with iconic scenes like henry hill 's doorbell - yelling session , and memorable lines like henry hill 's opening narration : ' for as long as i can remember , i always wanted to be a gangster
