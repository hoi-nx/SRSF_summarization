manchester city 's grip on the premier league title was loosened further after a controversial glenn murray goal put palace on the way to a 2 - 1 victory
glenn murray fired palace ahead in the first half , despite both he and scott dann appearing to be offside , and jason puncheon crashed in a superb second to deal what looks to be a fatal blow to manchester city 's already slim hopes of retaining their crown

manchester city appealed for offside but glenn murray 's first - half goal stood on monday night damien delaney 6 picked up a booking for cutting down sergio aguero but otherwise solid
james mcarthur 8 a superb , full hearted performance by the midfielder who made several vital clearances
joe hart appeals to the officials as glenn murray celebrates after putting palace ahead wilfried zaha 6.5 should have put palace ahead in the second minute but sliced shot high and wide of the target yannick bolasie 6 might not be renowned for his defending but made an excellent first half tackle on yaya toure when the midfielder looked ominous jason puncheon 7.5 his curling free kick to double palace âs lead was superb , worked tirelessly and made an important first half tackle on yaya toure
glenn murray 8.5 against the run of play does not do justice to his 35th minute tap in but it was his fifth in as many games and he was a constant threat in the air , too
manchester city midfielder yaya toure ( right ) hammers home the equaliser manchester city ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) joe hart 6 was tested just once in the opening half sagna 6.5 right back 300th premier league appearance vincent kompany 6 seemed distracted by feelings of injustice after the palace goal which he deemed to be offside manchester city striker sergio aguero could not find a way through a steadfast palace defence martin demichelis 6 rightly booked for a hefty challenge on glenn murray gael clichy 5.5 he and sagna struggled to deal with the pace of bolasie and zaha and offered little in attack
fernandinho 6 made a senseless and unnecessary challenge on glenn murray to give away the free kick which led to the second goal
edin dzeko 5 a quiet game for the striker who seemed furious at his manager at being replaced by lampard after 66 minutes but surely he could have no complaints ? the pressure is mounting on manchester city manager manuel pellegrini sergio aguero 6 expert at finding space in a crowded penalty box and hit the post in the first half , just could not find a way through a steadfast palace defence
manager manuel pellegrini 5 manchester âs premier home removal firms might look to clear some space in their diary around the end of may because surely his time at the etihad is limited
he does not lack cojones , backing up his linesman who was probably right to rule scott dann and glenn murray onside for the goal and dealt well with the excessive protestations of manchester city players
