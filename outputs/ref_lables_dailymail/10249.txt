passengers hoping to make a short domestic flight friday were trapped on the tarmac at an airport for six hours with only one bathroom between them
men , women and children who boarded a united flight from kansas city , missouri , to denver , colorado , were instead diverted to colorado springs due to bad weather
the 6am flight took just an hour and a half to get to the unscheduled stop at colorado springs - but then languished for another six hours , before everybody was ordered off anyway
but passengers were told that if they got off , that would be the end of their trip and they would have to give up on connecting flights and make their own way from colorado springs
in the mean time , passengers told how the short - haul flight 's meager supplies of crackers and water dwindled , while the single bathroom became ' foul ' and ran out of necessary supplies
