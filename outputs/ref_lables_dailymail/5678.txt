palmerston remains a very painful place for rangers managers
a convincing 2 - 0 defeat did nothing to alleviate the mood of gloomy chaos that had engulfed the club
rangers were simply second - best all over the plastic pitch in dumfries striker derek lyle points to the skies after putting queen of the south in the lead at palmerston park kidd celebrates after an own goal doubles queen of the south 's lead at the start of the second half gavin reilly ( left ) celebrates after forcing an own goal for queen of the south 's third to dent rangers ' second place hopes queen of the south : clark , durnan ( scott hooper ) , andy dowie , chris higgins , kidd , mcshane , daniel carmichael , mckenna , holt , derek lyle ( pickard ) , gavin reilly ( russell ) subs : paton , atkinson , smith , smith booked : chris higgins scorers : lyle 33 ' , lee wallace ( og ) 46 ' , reilly 69 ' rangers : robinson , darren mcgregor , marius zaliukas , bilel mohsni , lee wallace , templeton ( crawford ) , law , andy murdoch , vuckic , kenny miller ( hardie ) , clark ( kris boyd ) subs : black , shiels , simonsen , sinnamon booked : templeton , moshni ref : don robertson att : 5,093 immense credit must go to queen of the south , who recorded a thoroughly merited victory that has significantly boosted their play - off hopes
under fowler , they are capable of bright , energetic football that delivered goals from derek lyle and gavin reilly , as well an own goal from lee wallace
a first defeat of his six - game reign confirmed that assessment in the most emphatic fashion
queen of the south will face falkirk at that same time , having just overhauled their key rivals for the fourth and final play - off spot
ranger 's newcastle loanee haris vukic ( left ) attempts to block a shot by queen of the south ' chris higgins new manager mccall ( right ) suffered his first defeat since taking charge of the ibrox club rangers were without suspended skipper lee mcculloch â banned after a red card for an elbow on hearts â osman sow at the weekend â which meant a starting role for bilel mohsni alongside marius zaliukas at the heart of the defence
the winger was another change to mccall âs line - up and he saw plenty of the ball before the break , without making it amount to a great deal
queen of the south 's kidd ( left ) rangers fends off templeton of rangers as he runs with the ball derek lyle ( 2nd left ) opened the scoring following a first - half corner in the 3 - 0 defeat of rangers derek lyle ( centre ) wheels away after putting the hosts in front with a strike on 33minutes one neat bit of skill saw him drift infield from the left flank before thumping a shot just too high
daniel carmichael swept play wide to kidd who took on lee wallace
the ibrox left - back toppled , apparently looking for a foul that was nât there , allowing kidd to break into the penalty area
his cut - back found derek lyle , who took a touch on his left foot before dispatching a sweet finish off his right
derek lyle set up gavin reilly and his daisy - cutter drew a fine stop from robinson at full stretch
the queen of the south striker acknowledges the home supporters after making the score 1 - 0 in the first half play continues as a flare is let off in the rangers section of the crowd at palmerston park queen of the south goalkeeper clark ensures rangers ' bilel mohsni does not find the back of the net rangers used the shock to stir them into greater vigour
nicky clark was close with a brave effort from a darren mcgregor cross , which led to him being flattened by his namesake in the queen of the south goal
the first half duly closed with a penalty shout from lee wallace after he tangled with durnan
far worse followed for lee wallace 16 seconds after the restart as he got the final touch to his side âs second concession of the evening
kidd celebrates after forcing an own goal from rangers lee wallace immediately after the break queen of the south 's gavin reilly ( left ) demonstrates a calm finish to put his side 3 - 0 to the good ibrox minds still appeared to be in the dressing room as gavin reilly surged into the box and sent a low cross speeding through the six yard box
off balance , lee wallace attempted to clear from the line but only succeeded in helping the ball into the net via his heel
holt nicked possession away from crawford and worked a little exchange that released gavin reilly
rangers attempted a pride - saving late flurry but found clark in excellent form in the home goal
