they were the heartbreaking scenes of a family being torn apart : four young sisters being dragged kicking and screaming from their mother 's home in the middle of the night
the story was that the girls had been taken from their abusive father back in italy to hide out in australia and now they were being sent back to the ' monster ' against their will
the scenes of the girl 's forced return caused widespread outcry , particularly as the girls ' mother portrayed the cruelty of the dad , and the girls - then aged nine to 14 years old - frightened and distraught
what had been lost in the drama was the fact that the four sisters had earlier been taken by their mother from italy without the knowledge or permission of that father , tomaso vincenti , and that the girls had been born in italy and spent the greater part of their young lives there
now 60 minutes has returned to the village near florence where the girls have been living with their italy dad and interview the two elder girls , emily and claire vincenti and talked to them about their lives and the dramatic circumstances in which they were apparently wrenched from their mother , garrett
this scene of one of the tomaso girls in apparent distress outside her father 's villa in florence after the four sisters were taken back from australia to italy emily and claire vincenti ( pictured ) are now aged 16 and 17 and are living in italy with their father emily and claire talked about their parents and were filmed going out with their italy boyfriends in florence the four vinceni girls miss australia and their mother , but appear happy and calm in contrast to the dramatic and hysterical scenes in which they were removed from australia in late 2012 the girls are living positive and fruitful lives , attending school six days a week , talking about what they will study at university and going out with their italy boyfriends in florence , according to the programme
despite claims by the girls ' mother than they were not happy in italy , the sisters now seem settled and leading good lives with father tomaso the dramatic turn in the lives of the tomaso vincenti girls began in 2010 , when they left italy ostensibly just for month 's holiday back in australia , with their mother 's family on the sunshine coast in queensland
the girls had not seen their mother since they left australia , but after 60 minutes went to italy to film the story , garrett has subsequently turned up for a three - day visit
