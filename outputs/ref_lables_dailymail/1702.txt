whatever your view , one thing âs for certain : when it comes to twins , particularly identical ones , they are an endless source of fascination
yet , despite all this interest , the rest of us remain baffled , emotionally and scientifically , by the uncanny bonds identical twins share
having spent a year researching twins for my new novel , i have come to realise that we are only beginning to grasp how strange they truly are and quite why they have compelled us for thousands of years
ashley ( left ) and mary-kate olsen ( right ) are two of the most famous twins in the world and despite their very similar appearances they are not actually identical twins take pre-colonial brazilians , who thought twins were a product of adultery , resulting in the poor innocent mother often being executed for her supposed infidelity
some primitive african societies abhorred twins because of the way multiple births resemble an animal âs litter
in greek mythology , however , twins were believed to be the product of human intercourse with the gods , meaning they were sacred , while ancient slavs maintained that twins shared one special soul
not all monozygotic twins ( i.e. twins born from a single fertilised egg ) are truly identical
some are â mirror image â twins
but many identicals are truly identical in ways we are still uncovering
obviously , identical twins share facial characteristics and body shape
but they also share virtually identical dna , meaning they are more closely related to each other than to anyone else , including their parents or their own children
joel ( left ) and benji madden ( right ) are identical twins , it 's likely that they will have grown more alike over time as their identical dna asserts itself a daring Â£ 5 million jewel heist was carried out at a berlin department store in 2009
the glove provided dna evidence traced to identical twin brothers
identicals also share the same blood group , the same hormones , the same serum proteins ; they are alike in heart rate , blood pressure , brain waves , respiratory rate and digestive process
parents often refuse , believing they will be able to distinguish their twins as they age ( not least , by dressing them differently )
this , however , can be a mistake because twins can grow more identical over time ( as their identical dna asserts itself , following different levels of nourishment in the womb )
and twins often end up being dressed in exactly the same clothes anyway , lest one become jealous of the other getting â better â treatment
over recent decades , scientists such as thomas bouchard , of the minnesota centre for twin and family research , have analysed the personalities of twins and discovered seriously uncanny facts
take the classic example of twins separated at birth
one of my favourite cases is the separated twins who discovered , when reunited , that they both entered the sea on beach holidays by wading backwards up to their knees
these identical american twins were separated when four weeks old , and adopted by different families in ohio
hunter ( left ) and scarlett johansson ( right ) are fraternal twins and so do not share the same strong characteristics and traits as identical twins do they also drove exactly the same kind of car and both enjoyed woodworking in the garage
some parents of twins have reported their children having identical dreams
others recount twins suffering pains , in the same part of the body , when only one of them is hurt
even in death , twins share an incredible bond
john and jedward , commonly known as ' jedward ' , are identical twins
some parents of identical twins have observed them having identical dreams or even suffering pain in the same parts of the body other infant twins seem painfully confused as to whether their twin is really gone , because they keep seeing the living image of their dead sibling in the mirror or in a reflecting window ; when they see themselves , they see the sibling
finally , sally studied her child âs birthmark very closely ( the twins had similar but not identical birthmarks ) and realised a terrible mistake had been made â katie had survived and samantha had died
