they have a reputation as rather brutish creatures who chomped their way through huge hunks of meat , but it seems neanderthals may actually have been the first masterchefs
new research is suggesting that these extinct early humans may have used wild herbs to flavour their food
scientists have found traces of compounds found in camomile and yarrow in the hardened plaque of 50,000 year old neanderthals teeth found in el sidron , spain
neanderthals ( represented in the drawing above ) may have been the world 's first gourmets - using herbs like yarrow and camomile to flavour the meat that dominated their diet , according to a new scientific paper at first researchers thought they might have been using these plants as a form of self - medication , but now new findings have presented a different theory
a study of tooth plaque from the teeth of fossilised neanderthals remains also suggest that they may have heated grains of barley
a study of plaque found on neanderthals teeth like the one above suggests they ate grains like barley they have found that wild chimpanzees in uganda eat three different types of leaf while consuming meat they had caught
they say neanderthals could also used herbs to improve their culinary creations in the same way
writing in the journal antiquity , dr krief and her colleagues said : ' data on neanderthals behaviour suggest that their subsistence and technological strategies were complex
however , recent discoveries have shown that they may actually have had a complex culture - capable of making stone tools and even jewellery
three years ago researchers at the university of barcelona examined ten teeth from the remains of five neanderthals found in el sidron , northern spain
dr krief and her team found that separate groups of chimpanzees at budongo forest reserve and kibale national park ate plants while chewing meat
new archaeological discoveries are expanding our knowledge of how neanderthals lived in ways that could not have been imagined when their fossilised remains , like the skeleton above , were first found by archaeologists celebrity chef gordon ramsay has become well known for his subtle use of flavours that contrasts with his rather brutish approach in the kitchen , but it seems he could also have learned some tips from neanderthals neanderthals , like the one shown above , may well have been the world 's first gourmet chefs , findings suggest they reason that if this was for medicinal purposes , different animals would eat different plants depending on their ailments
however , the animals in each group all tended to eat the same plants with their meat , suggesting they were eating them for flavour instead
dr krief said that previous work has dismissed the idea that neanderthals were eating herbs to flavour food based on the assumption that their tastes were very basic
however , she says that if chimpanzees use plants to flavour their food , then it is entirely possible that neanderthals also used herbs and spices
' other recent discoveries are starting to reveal what culinary creatures the neanderthals were
camomile is well known as a herb that can produce some interesting flavours for dishes and was eaten by neanderthals according to recent research on dental plaque that had hardened onto fossiled teeth yarrow is a hardy plant but its leaves can be used as a herb known for its sweet flavour and bitter aftertaste research presented at the paleoanthropology society annual meeting this week suggests they tended to eat horses , deer and bovids rather than larger game like mammoths
there is also some evidence from neanderthals sites in gibraltar that suggests they also liked nuts and wild olives
analysis of fossilised neanderthals faeces has also revealed that while they ate meat , they also had a ' significant intake of plants '
' neanderthals first emerged around 280,000 years ago , spreading to inhabit much of europe and parts of asia , but they eventually died out 40,000 years ago
a 60,000 - year - old multi-purpose bone tool unearthed in france also suggests neanderthals understood how to use bones to make useful devices a recent discovery by researchers at the musã©um national d'histories naturelle in paris suggests that neanderthals may have built homes using the materials they found around them
they discovered a 26 feet wide building created 44,000 years ago from mammoth bones
