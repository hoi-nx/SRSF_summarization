the conservatives have opened up a four - point lead over labour with millions of voters yet to make up their minds about how to vote in the tightest election race since 1992
an exclusive poll by comres for the daily mail and itv news shows that david cameron âs party , on 36 per cent of the vote , has moved ahead in the last fortnight as labour , the lib dems and ukip have all slipped
labour is on 32 per cent , ukip on ten per cent and the lib dems on eight per cent , with the greens on five per cent
however , 25 per cent of both tory and labour voters say that they would consider voting lib dems , suggesting that the party still has some hope of winning over voters on either side of the political spectrum
the reverse is true for the lib dems â 25 per cent of men compared to 31 per cent of women , while both genders are equally likely to consider voting labour , with 48 per cent each
nick clegg 's ( left ) lib dems have an eight per cent share of the vote , will nigel farage 's ( right ) ukip has ten per cent
the poll suggests that the green party has five per cent of the vote ahead of the election more than half of british adults â 57 per cent -- disagree that a hung parliament places too much power in the hands of smaller parties , and seven in ten â 70 per cent -- disagree that having smaller parties in government is undemocratic
comres said the poll showed the tories had â reinforced their lead â , with labour yet to be ahead in any telephone survey by the pollster this year
and 42 per cent say mr david cameron is strong , compared to only 11 per cent who say the same of the labour leader
to the alarm of labour strategists , another pollster also suggested the party âs support is slipping and the tories have taken a four - point lead
a survation poll for the mirror put the conservatives up two on last week , with 33 per cent , labour down six on 29 per cent , ukip on 18 per cent and the lib dems on ten per cent .
