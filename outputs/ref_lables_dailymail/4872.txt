when president obama dined with a dozen technology business leaders in california four years ago , it was google executive chairman schmidt who sat at the head of the table
google executives and employees donated more than $ 1.6 million to obama 's two white house campaigns , and the online search giant parachuted top talent into both
one result has been a coziness with the u.s. government 's executive branch that few other companies can match â marked by access for lobbyists , mentions in nearly half of obama 's state of the union addresses , and a personnel feeder trough serving the white house with new senior hires
beginning : in 2007 obama had an on - stage cameo with google 's then - ceo schmidt as part of a presidential candidate series influence : schmidt ( far left ) shared the head of the table with the spouse of a venture capitalist whose firm owned 20 per cent of google , as president obama dined with tech leaders in 2011 there have even been allegations that google 's up - close - and - personal relationship with the west wing earned it a reprieve from what would have been an earth - shaking federal trade commission antitrust lawsuit
' employees of the silicon valley behemoth have been in the white house more than 230 times since obama took office â approximately once per week
it needed that muscle in 2011 , after the federal trade commission found google allegedly manipulated search results in ways that favored its own for - profit products
about the same time , white house visitor logs show , google chairman schmidt met with obama senior adviser pete rouse
revolving door ? google vice president megan smith left her job to become obama 's chief technology officer lobbyist joanna shelton and general counsel kent walker met with furman , then the newly minted chair of the president 's council of economic advisers
ready for hillary : stephanie hannon , director of product management , civic innovation and social impact at google , has become the hillary clinton campaign 's top technology guru google agreed to change its business practices but dodged a potential 10 - figure fine â and saved the cost of litigating a years - long case that could have resulted in breaking up the company into smaller , more market - competitive units
but a google spokesperson confirmed thursday on background that company executives has talked with the federal trade commission about unspecified antitrust concerns in the past
left - hand man : schmidt ( right ) got a prime seat at the table when newly minted president obama met with a group of ceos in february 2009 ' evangelist ' : online pioneer cerf is google 's top ' internet evangelist ' and also a member of obama 's national science board his ascent in obama 's world began in 2007 when the future president visited google 's california headquarters for a one - on - one interview , staged for the benefit of the company 's employees , then 16,000 strong
obama offered schmidt his choice of cabinet slots after the 2012 election â either treasury or commerce â and was even prepared to create a new ' secretary of business ' position for him
he was by then already a donor to obama 's white house bids , contributing the maximum amount allowed by law both times
schmidt 's specialized software gave then - senator obama access to high - tech voter targeting algorithms that republican john mccain could n't match
high life : google ideas director jared cohen co-wrote a book with princess beatrice of york in 2013 , three years after he left the obama state department to work for the search giant election kings : michael slaby ( left ) and justin vincent ( right ) were key architects of obama 's data - mining and voter - targeting software efforts , and both were emigres from google and michael slaby , the chief integration and innovation officer af obama for america , the president 's campaign organization came over from a job as technology strategist for tomorrowventures â schmidt 's venture capital fund
google itself was accused publicly of favoring obama 's 2012 re-election campaign in a more visible way
customized search results would appear when users typed ' obama ' into a search window , but entering ' mitt romney ' yielded no such help
some of that work could conceivably be performed by former white house staff who have joined google , just as the president counts several former google executives among his advisers
former secretary of state hillary clinton this week hired away a top tech talent from google for her presidential campaign - in - waiting
poaching seasoned google veterans is a maneuver the obama white house has perfected
megan smith , a former vice president at the company , is now the administration 's chief technology officer
angus durocher , a computer engineer who left google to work for the obama campaign , tweeted this photo of himself and vice president joe biden when he was at work in the campaign 's new hampshire nerve center the deputy cto position was held for obama 's first two years by another google emigre , andrew mclaughlin
