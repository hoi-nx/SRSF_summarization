breast cancer is the second most common cause of death from cancer among american women the american spends $ 4billion a year on unnecessary medical costs due to mammograms generating false alarms and on treatment for breast tumors unlikely to cause problems , a new report has revealed
the study , published in the health affairs journal on monday , has estimated the figure for women aged 40 to 59
it is made up of $ 2.8bn resulting from false - positive mammograms and another $ 1.2bn attributed to breast cancer overdiagnosis - treatment of tumors that grow slowly or not at all and are unlikely to develop into life - threatening disease
breast cancer is the second most common cause of death from cancer among american women , claiming nearly 41,000 lives a year
study authors mei-sing ong , a research fellow at boston children 's hospital , and mandl , a professor at harvard medical school , say their findings indicate that the cost of breast cancer overtreatment appears to be much higher than previously estimated
their $ 4bn figure is the midpoint of a range that depends upon assumptions about the rates of false - positive mammograms and breast cancer overdiagnosis
' there was no attempt to balance the costs with the benefits , ' said wender , who heads prevention , detection and patient - support efforts at the american cancer society
the study found that women aged 40 and 49 were more likely to have a false - positive mammogram , compared to women in their 50s
early detection : annual mammograms starting at 40 years old have long been considered standard for preventive care , because cancer is easier to treat if detected early the american cancer society recommends yearly mammograms for women starting at 40 , while a government advisory group says regular screening should begin at 50 wender questioned the assumptions behind the new study , saying that the authors made a ' very selective choice of estimates ' for the rates of false positives and overdiagnosis
the study was based on billing data from a major american insurer , including more than 700,000 women aged between 40 and 59 in all 50 states , from 2011 through 2013
