the boss of supermarket sainsbury has been sentenced in his absence to two years in egypt jail over the company 's disastrous venture into the middle east 16 years ago
chief executive coupe , 53 , was convicted of embezzlement last september after former sansbury 's business partner el-nasharty accused him of trying to illegally seize cheques
now a court has sentenced him to two years behind bars for the crime , which relates to sainbury 's joint venture with local supermarket chain edge , owned by mr el - el-nasharty coupe , chief executive of sainsbury 's , has been sentenced to two years in an egypt jail after a former business partner of the uk supermarket claimed mr coupe tried to seize money from him mr coupe is believed to have travelled to the middle east country last sunday to appeal the conviction , which dates back to a time when he did n't work at the firm , but this was unsuccessful , reports the times
sainsbury 's opened its first store in egypt in cario in 1999 , hoping to capitalise on a growing middle class that were still largely reliant on corner shops for groceries
when sainsbury 's eventually withdrew from egypt in 2001 , losing Â£ 110million , the company blamed a ' deterioration of the trading environment ' , widely believed to be a reference to the fatwa
sainsbury 's quit egypt later that year , losing almost Â£ 110million in the process , and selling the business back to mr el-nasharty
sainsbury 's countered this claim , alleging that mr el-nasharty had paid for the business with cheques that later bounced
mr el-nasharty then went on to claim that mr coupe travelled to egypt shortly after being appointed ceo last july and attempted to seize money from him , breaching egypt 's bankruptcy laws
mr coupe was automatically convicted of the charge last september after ' failing to attend court hearings ' , though a spokesman for sainsbury 's said the business was not told these were taking place
he began his career at super-brand unilever before moving on to tesco , and then asda where he was the boss of justin king , the former sainsbury 's ceo who he succeeded
' coupe was not even employed by sainsbury 's at the time of the original business deal in 2001 which gave rise to these legal proceedings and has never met the complainant mr el-nasharty
sainsbury 's went into business with amr el-nasharty in 1999 , eventually purchasing 80 per cent of chain edge in order to open 100 supermarkets across egypt , with the first being built in cario ( pictured ) in 2001 the uk chain withdrew from the loss - making middle eastern market , selling its shares back to mr el-nasharty , who complained the business was insolvent , beginning a 16 - year legal fight ' mr el-nasharty has consistently made false claims against sainsbury 's and individuals within the business over the years , all of which have been unsuccessful
' when mr el-nasharty bought the egypt business back from us in 2001 , he paid us with cheques that bounced
mr el-nasharty is now claiming that coupe was in egypt in july 2014 and tried to seize these cheques
