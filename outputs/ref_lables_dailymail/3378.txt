a uk mother is among nearly 100 women who have had babies by a denmark sperm donor who has triggered an international scare over the spread of an incurable genetic disease
the man , known only as donor 7042 , carries a defective gene known as neurofibromatosis 1 ( nf1 ) that can pass on a severe , life - limiting condition to his offspring
with demand for denmark sperm soaring , the donor is understood to have fathered 99 â viking babies â â as they are widely dubbed â across the world through the clinic nordic cryobank
a child born from a parent with the defective gene has up to a 50 per cent chance of developing the disease
now four families are suing the sperm bank and the case has raised questions among fertility experts about denmark âs booming , and unregulated , sperm export trade
â nf1 is a rare disease , but the terrible spread of the gene via this prolific denmark donor highlights the worrying dangers of the widespread use of a single donor
denmark mother sogaard-kristensen , whose daughter inherited donor 7042 âs illness , claims she was contacted by as many as 17 women with his children who had the condition
ms witjens said last night that it was possible more uk women could have bought his donations with the defective gene online
donor 7042 âs sperm was also exported to a closely associated centre in america â the california cryobank
but in 2009 it was discovered he carried the nf1 gene â despite undergoing tests and stating in a questionnaire for nordic cryobank that there were no genetic disorders in his family
and when her daughter andrea subsequently developed the illness , she became one of the families â three from denmark and one from the america â who are taking legal action against nordic cryobank
dr jackson kirkman-brown , the fertility expert who led the research at birmingham university , said : â what is clear when buying sperm from abroad is that although the number of families a donor is allowed to father in the uk is capped , it could be hundreds elsewhere
