from deep craters to basaltic plains , the varied surface of the moon has been revealed in stunning detail by the us geological survey
the two sets of maps , compiled by cartographer hare , include image mosaics and topographical views of the lunar landscape taken over a period of four years
to the left of these craters , is ocean of storms , which is latin for ' ocean of storms '
the two sets of maps include image mosaics ( right ) and topographical views ( right ) of the lunar landscape
last year , however , nasa scientists proposed that the ocean of storms was in fact the result of the formation of ancient rift valleys
the map also shows mare orientale , an impact crater that was partially flooded by basalts
shaped like a target ring bull 's - eye , the mare orientale is one of the most striking large scale lunar features
to create the maps , more than 6.5 billion measurements were collected between 2009 and 2013 by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter wide angle camera ( wac ) and the lunar reconnaissance orbiter nasa 's ultimate goal at the moment is to land humans on mars by the 2030s

the images have also been released in black - and - white image mosaic based on the same data using wide angle cameras to create the maps , mr hare used more than 6.5 billion measurements collected between 2009 and 2013 by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter wide angle camera ( wac ) and the lunar reconnaissance orbiter ( lunar reconnaissance orbiter )
