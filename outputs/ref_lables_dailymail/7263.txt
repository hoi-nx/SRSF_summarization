thierry henry said the stadium of light was the noisiest atmosphere he had ever experienced during sunderland âs derby win over newcastle
a sorrowful silence as thousands streamed for the exits in the wake of crystal palace âs fourth goal inside 14 second - half minutes
sunderland strikers fletcher and jermain defoe ca n't hide their disappointment following defeat a shameful silence as sunderland âs players afterwards absorbed the shock of another embarrassing home collapse
but perhaps most damning was the sad silence of realisation from advocaat
when asked how concerned he was that the side he has inherited are in danger of the drop , he grimaced for fully 10 seconds before returning : â worried ? yes , very worried
sunderland manager advocaat looks on as sunderland are dismantled at home by crystal palace the stands emptied during the second - half at the stadium of light as sunderland conceded four goals exactly four weeks earlier advocaat had watched from the comfort of his home in holland as sunderland trailed 4 - 0 at half - time to aston villa , a side who had scored just twice on the road all season
crystal palace were ruthless and alan pardew , beaten in his last four tyne-wear derbies as newcastle boss , had his revenge

super stat : sunderland have now lost the four matches immediately after their tyne - wear derby victories
sunderland , though , had again given a depressing demonstration of how to surrender a football match
advocaat said : â i can see for myself that we do nât create enough chances even though we play with three strikers
sunderland will only be spared relegation by the shortcomings of others
crystal palace forward zaha evades the attention of sunderland striker fletcher during the contest â he has put sessions on that have been especially for the strikers , it âs been excellent
â as for next season for sunderland , they can only hope they âre in the same division as crystal palace
