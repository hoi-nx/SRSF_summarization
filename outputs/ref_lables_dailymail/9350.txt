the us supreme court 's arguments on tuesday over same - sex marriage will cap more than two decades of litigation and a transformation in public attitudes
based on the court 's actions during the past two years , a sense of inevitability is in the air : that a majority is on the verge of declaring gay marriage legal nationwide
in his most recent gay rights decision for the court in 2013 , rejecting a legal definition of marriage limited to a man and woman for purposes of federal benefits , kennedy deplored that us law for making gay marriages ' unequal
instead , the nine justices are hearing in tuesday 's oral arguments an appeal of the sole decision from a regional us appeals court that went the opposite way
last november , the cincinnati - based u.s. court of appeals for the 6th circuit upheld gay marriage bans in ohio , michigan , kentucky and tennessee
with 37 of the 50 states now permitting gay marriage , many because of judicial orders , it seems unlikely the country 's highest court would reverse course
public opinion polls over the last decade have shown large increases in support for gay marriage
how much will kennedy , a member of the court 's five - man conservative bloc who often casts decisive votes in close cases , show his hand in the 2 - 1/2 hours of oral arguments ? will he reveal a clear view that the constitution gives gay people a right to marry or will he voice concerns for state interests in controlling marriage laws ? an element of uncertainty hovers over chief justice roberts , who broke with the other court conservatives and cast the deciding vote upholding president barack obama 's healthcare law in 2012
but he separated himself from the most conservative dissenters and declined to declare outright that states may ban gay marriage
in the 2013 ruling , he denounced the court majority 's sentiment that federal lawmakers were deliberately harming gay people with the limited definition of marriage
