a woman has spoken of her regrets about going under the knife after a turkey surgeon botched her facelift and left her with her ears sewn awkwardly to the side of her face
belinda , 56 , from essex , had hoped the operation would deal with her jowls and says she was looking ' worn out ' ahead of the procedure
in the uk , the average facelift costs Â£ 7,900 , so belinda was thrilled when she found a turkey surgeon offering cut - price operations that cost a fraction of the uk equivalent
' they 're stretched and they are dragging down her earlobes ' mr vijh ( left ) recommends another full face and neck lift to correct the damage , but warns belinda ( right ) she could be risking nerve damage and further scarring an excited belinda then travelled to turkey for the procedure , where such ' bargains ' are common , checked into an istanbul clinic and went under the knife
expecting a dramatic change , the healed facelift , says belinda , ' had n't done anything ' - except , much to her horror , leave her with earlobes that had been ' sewn ' to the sides of her face
according to mr vijh , this was due to the surgeon stitching up belinda 's face in the wrong position , resulting in bad scarring that should have been concealed behind her ears , not around them still , belinda is determined to go ahead , and after a gruelling session on the operating table at the hands of mr vijh ( pictured ) , she comes out smiling ' we 've lifted her neck , we 've pulled up her face , and got rid of all those scars , ' mr vijh states
