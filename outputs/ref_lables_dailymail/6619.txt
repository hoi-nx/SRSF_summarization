landslides have exposed trails of dinosaur footprints running along a near - vertical rock face in bolivia
and although the angle of the prints could suggest the lumbering reptiles were avid mountaineers , bolivia âs cal orcko paleontological site is the result of tectonic activity that forced the earth upwards
the attraction , at fancesa limestone quarry in sucre , comprises some 462 trails made up of 5,055 prints - and frequent landslides reveal new ones , some of which belong to unknown species
bolivia âs cal orcko paleontological site is the result of tectonic activity , forcing earth upwards and preserving the precious trackways so that dinosaur tracks are seen on a vertical ' wall ' ( pictured ) the wall , which is the largest dinosaur trackway in the world , is approximately 390 feet ( 120 metres ) tall and features tracks made by at least eight species of dinosaurs , the daily beast reported
but the imprinted rock was once horizontal before being pushed upwards by tectonic activity
the attraction , at fancesa limestone quarry in sucre , bolivia ( left ) , comprises some 462 trails made up of 5,055 prints ( right ) â and frequent landslides reveal new ones , some of which belong to unknown species the wall , which is the largest dinosaur trackway in the world , is approximately 390 feet ( 120 metres ) tall and features tracks made by at least eight species of dinosaurs
some , like the one pictured , are large in 2009 , fossil hunters came across what are thought to be among the world 's largest dinosaur prints
it 's thought the late jurassic dinosaurs were more than 75 ft ( 23 metres ) long and weighed up to 40 tonnes
this activity thrust a huge slab of earth upwards , which dried into limestone and now resembles a cliff face
one set of tracks , for example , revealed two lines of prints with a smaller pair , suggesting a baby walked alongside its parents , while another set , now known as johnny walker , was made by a baby t.rex
the imprinted rock was pushed upwards by tectonic activity , thrusting a huge slab of earth upwards , which dried into limestone and now resembles a cliff face ( pictured ) at first glance , it appears that large dinosaurs ( such as the one pictured ) as well as titanosaurs and armoured ankylosauruses , hauled their considerable bulks up the incredibly steep slope the site , at fancesa limestone quarry in sucre ( shown on the map ) attracts 120,000 tourists every year , which some believe is a threat to the site , as well as a nearby cement works that uses limestone the dinosaurs left their mark ( pictured ) while walking along the shoreline of a large lake
due to the spacing of these prints , experts can use them to reveal clues about the dinosaurs â gait , build and lifestyle while there may be more precious footprints yet to be found , some experts say cal orcko , which means â lime hill â in the quechua tongue , is under threat from human activity
