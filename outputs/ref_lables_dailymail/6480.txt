clinton 's family 's charities are refiling at least five years of tax returns after an investigation revealed they had misreported tens of millions of dollars in donations from governments
the charities ' errors generally took the form of under - reporting or over-reporting donations from foreign governments , or in other instances , omitted to break out government donations entirely when reporting revenue , the charities confirmed to reuters , which uncovered the mistakes
following the discovery , the clinton foundation and the clinton health access initiative said they will be refiling multiple annual tax returns and may audit returns extending as far back as 15 years in case there have been other errors
following reuters ' report republican presidential candidate ted cruz called on the non-profit to return all of the money it received from foreign governments
the unsettled numbers on the tax returns are not evidence of wrongdoing but tend to undermine the 990s role as a form of public accountability , experts in charity law and transparency advocates told reuters
for three years in a row beginning in 2010 , the clinton foundation reported to the irs that it received zero in funds from foreign and u.s. governments , a dramatic fall - off from the tens of millions of dollars in foreign government contributions reported in preceding years
those entries were errors , according to the foundation : several foreign governments continued to give tens of millions of dollars toward the foundation 's work on climate change and economic development through this three - year period
the clinton foundation erroneously reported it had received no funds from governments for three years - even though it previously received millions
pictured , bill and clinton speak about the charity last september the decision to review the returns was made last month following inquiries from reuters , and the foundation has not ruled out extending the review to tax returns extending back 15 or so years
clinton health access initiative , which is best known for providing cheaper drugs for tens of thousands of people with hiv around the world , began filing separate tax returns in 2010 , and has previously refiled at least once both its 2010 and 2011 form 990s
changes : in light of clinton seeking the 2016 democratic presidential nomination , the foundation said it would only continue to receive donations from six countries that are already supporting ongoing projects ' i âm # readyforhillary to return all the money she raised from foreign nations , ' republican presidential candidate ted cruz said on twitter
some experts in charity law and taxes said it was not remarkable for a charity to refile an erroneous return once in a while , but for a large , global charity to refile three or four years in a row was highly unusual
though mrs. clinton has abdicated her board seat , republican rival ted cruz has zeroed in on the democratic presidential candidate in a tweets about the clinton foundation 's tax headaches
