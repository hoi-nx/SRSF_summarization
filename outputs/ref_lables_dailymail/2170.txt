the tories have accused labour of a crude new attempt to ' weaponise ' the nhs by orchestrating a letter from doctors claiming hospitals will not be safe if david cameron wins the election
miliband was also accused of hypocrisy after he claimed that the coalition had made it harder to get a gp appointment
but critics were quick to point out that his figures were out of date â and that the gp crisis is widely blamed on labour 's gp contracts , which allowed them to opt out of out - of - hours care
meanwhile it emerged last night that a labour - supporting gp had circulated a letter claiming that ' five years of flat - line funding ' have ' crippled the nhs '
a version of the letter â organised by dr gerada , the former chairman of the royal college of gps â appeared in the guardian signed by more than 100 doctors last night
it claimed the ' direction of travel ' under the tories was towards privatisation , adding : ' another five years of tory austerity will sap staff morale and reduce the nhs to a poor service for poor people '
labour were accused of orchestrating the letter as a ' stitch up '
conservative mp julian smith said : ' this labour stitch up is another desperate attempt to weaponise the nhs
' in an email obtained by the tories , dr gerada said signatures were being collected to ' counter ' the 100 business leaders who wrote a tory - supporting letter to a national paper last week
mr miliband claimed there were now 600 fewer gp surgeries open during evenings and weekends than before the previous election â which he said was directly contributing to the a&e crisis health secretary jeremy hunt has promised to give nhs chiefs ' whatever they need ' after the election
nhs chief executive simon stevens has said the health service needs an extra Â£ 8billion a year by 2020 just to keep standards as they are
the tories have pledged to find huge public spending cuts , and every pound spent on the nhs means less for other priorities such as education and defence
' dr gerada said she was a member of the labour but not an ' activist ' and said the letter had been organised independently
' the tories say that at least two of the signatories are labour supporters , including one who tried to stand as a labour candidate and another who has previously spoken at the labour conference
he added : ' the next tory government will deliver a truly seven - day nhs , putting right a problem which began with labour 's disastrous 2004 gp contract
he added that far from cutting funding , the tories would give the nhs ' whatever it needs ' if the party wins the election
clegg leader clegg accused labour of ' making cheap political points using outdated statistics '
following the letter from 100 doctors claiming the nhs is not safe in tory hands , labour is today expected to launch a fresh attack over the health service
claim : there are 590 fewer gp surgeries open at evenings and weekends compared to labour 's last year in office reality : shadow health secretary andy burnham is using figures which compare july 2009 to the year ending april 2014 - which means they are a full year out of date
the party 's claim that families are Â£ 1,600 worse off under the tories was also 12 months past its sell - by date
claim : the tories have made it harder to see a gp reality : anybody with memory of the blair years will know it is labour - and the disastrous 2004 decision to renegotiate the existing gp contract - which lies at the root of the current problems
claim : the tories have left the nhs weaker than at any stage in its history reality : in the latest attempt by labour and the left to ' weaponise ' the nhs , 100 doctors last night released a letter which claimed the nhs was ' withering away ' under the coalition and ' if things carry on as they are then in future people will be denied care they once had '
on privatisation , the nhs outsourced 4.4 per cent of its budget under the labour - but less than 2 per cent under the coalition
it was labour - not the tories - which presided over the shameful scandals at basildon and mid staffs hospitals which cost hundreds of lives .
