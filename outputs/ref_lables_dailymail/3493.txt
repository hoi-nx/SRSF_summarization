a young bride planned a fairytale wedding and married her fiancÃ© just six days after finding out his cancer is terminal

' the couple first met at school as teenagers but it was n't until 2012 when jack worked in laura 's local corner shop that their relationship blossomed
jack underwent gruelling rounds of chemotherapy after being diagnosed two years ago , but it failed to stop cancer from spreading into his bone marrow

' when he was given just weeks to live we had no time to wait , i 'm so happy that i can call jack my husband now , we are soul mates and it seemed like the perfect thing to do
in 2013 , jack knew there was something wrong when he started to feel tired and achy all the time - a blood test confirmed he had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at the time laura was due to give birth to lilly and needed to focus on her , but the pair kept in touch ' i surprised jack by wearing a traditional white wedding dress after i told him i was wearing a smart suit
' laura was distraught when jack broke the news that his treatment was n't working and he had just weeks to live
' when he told me it was terminal last friday i thought i would at least have a year with jack before he died but when he told me he had just weeks left i was in complete shock
when lilly was six - months - old laura drove two hours to see jack at bristol hospital after nine months of being inseparable the pair decided to start a relationship in february 2014 they often had date nights where they would order dominoes and watch films leukaemia affects a person 's white blood cells
' laura wore a floor length white wedding dress that was fitted by her mother , jenny cant , 47 , who works in bridal store , jane 's
laura added : ' the day was perfect , jack was determined to walk on his wedding day despite being completely exhausted due to cancer treatment
' laura first met jack when they were at school but it was n't until years later while laura was pregnant that their relationship blossomed
' me and jack would always have a little chat and he worked every day he could but one day when i walked in i noticed a charity bucket on the till for him , it read ' help poorly jack
' laura surprised jack by wearing a traditional white wedding dress after telling him she would wear a suit there is nothing more jack wanted than to become laura 's husband , so she 's delighted to have been able to fulfil that wish for him ' i was devastated when i realised he had blood cancer , he had kept it to himself as he did n't want me to worry
' jack knew there was something wrong when he started to feel tired and achy all the time - a blood test confirmed he had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
' laura has been at jack 's side ever since and after nine - months of being inseparable the pair decided to start a relationship in february 2014
