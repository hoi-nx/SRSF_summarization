everton will look to extend gibson 's contract this summer as he recovers from the latest injury setback of his career
roberto martinez confirmed on thursday that the republic of ireland international will miss the final seven games of the season with metatarsal damage , but expects him to be ready for pre-season as he does not require surgery
gibson has endured a wretched time over the last 18 months , not least when he ruptured cruciate ligaments , and his position at goodison park could be regarded as vulnerable , particularly as everton will rekindle their long - standing interest in tom cleverley in the summer
everton midfielder gibson will not play again this season after damaging his metatarsal everton manager roberto martinez expects gibson to return to pre-season in the best possible shape tom cleverley , who has spent the season on loan at aston villa , will become a free agent in july when his united contract expires and , given they have worked together before at wigan , he is a player roberto martinez will consider recruiting
but roberto martinez has moved to assure gibson he has a place in his plans
' this injury has arrived at such a bad moment because he was back from another long - term injury but it 's something we 'll look at in the summer , ' said roberto martinez
' i 've been very pleased with gibson
coming back from that sort of injury you do n't reach 100 per cent for a long time
everton will look to extend gibson 's contract this summer as he is treated for his latest injury setback roberto martinez has moved to assure gibson he has a place in his plans despite holding an interest in tom cleverley ' but when he 's been on the pitch , he 's performed really well
' tom cleverley is a target of roberto martinez and with his united contract running out a move could happen tom cleverley played under roberto martinez at wigan , on loan from united , and has been at villa park this season having won their last three matches against newcastle , qpr and southampton , everton have put together their best sequence of results in the barclays premier league for more than 12 months to clamber away from a potential relegation scrap
there is no chance , however , of them qualifying for europe next season but roberto martinez does not think their potential to make new signings in the summer has been effected
everton have put together their best sequence of results in the barclays premier league in over a year roberto martinez does not think their potential to make new signings has been effected by a lack of european football ' within football when you face an opposition losing or winning does n't affect players , ' said roberto martinez
' it 's how you lose and i think every player who 's faced everton this season will have come out with a real respect and a real appreciation of the way we play as a club
' roberto martinez says he has ' got a bigger picture ' of everton 's progress and does not rely on 10 months of results
