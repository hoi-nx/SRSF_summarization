scientists have discovered strange new organisms that infect the primitive forms of life that live deep below the ocean floor
while examining species of bacteria that thrive on the fossil fuel deposits deep inside the earth - known as archae - they have found a new type of virus that infects them
this graphic shows how the new archael virus changes uses ' docking tips ' - purple area - to infect bacteria they now believe it may be viruses like this that actually hold the secret that have allowed archae bacteria to adapt to some of the harshest environments on earth
this is because the virus actively causes one of its own genes to mutate - allowing it to develop new ways of coping with the ecosystem it finds itself in
life has been discovered nearly a mile and half underground , raising hopes bacteria might be able to survive deep beneath the surface of other planets
scientists have already speculated that the discovery of archae bacteria deep inside the earth 's crust has raised prospects of finding life on other planets
' dr valentine and his colleagues discovered the virus while exploring methane vents 2,800 feet beneath the surface of the ocean in the santa monica basin off the coast of california
when they screened the genomes of the methane - eating bacteria they discovered the genetic fingerprint of the new virus
the researchers , whose work is published in the journal nature communications , screened other samples taken from around the world and found similar fingerprints in bacteria from norway and elsewhere along the coast of california
' scientists used submersible alvin ( left ) to obtain sediment samples ( right ) from the the santa monica basin the sea floor , shown above , is covered in microbial mats of primitive bacteria that are infected with viruses the researchers also found that a small genetic element - known as a diversity - generating retroelement - was able to accelerate mutation of a specific part of the virus 's own genome
' the researchers also found similar guided mutation elements in the archae bacteria living under the ocean floor themselves
' the findings suggest that life living beneath the ocean floor and in the cracks of rocks deep below the surface could be far more diverse than previously thought
