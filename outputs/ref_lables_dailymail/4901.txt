saunders and eubank jnr could rematch in under six weeks after the pair reignited their war of words at a london press conference on thursday
now the duo are both set to fight at wembley arena on may 9 but not against each other
as it stands , eubank will be making the first defence of his wba interim belt while saunders will have a warm - up ' international contest ' ahead of his challenge for the wbo middleweight title mooted for july
saunders and eubank jnr were involved in a war of words during the press conference saunders shows his unbeaten record to eubank jnr during a press conference eubank challenged saunders to take a re-match with him on may 9 hall of fame promoter warren initially played down the chances of the pair fighting in may , but later said he would work on trying to get the fight on but this show has been scheduled in a bid to build up a rematch between them , with promoter warren suggesting an autumn rematch
however they kicked off their verbal sparring in a fiery press conference and eubank challenged saunders to go straight ahead and fight him on may 9
saunders said : ' you want to fight on may 9 ? i 'll tell you what we 'll do , warren can double my purse for the world title and i will fight eubank jnr no problem
' eubank and saunders have had a long standing rivalry and saunders won when the pair met in november warren , who was sat between them , was startled by the agreement and initially laughed it off
however he does have concerns about staging the fight at wembley arena and may seek to make the fight at a bigger venue â possibly even a football stadium if they are able to push the date back into the closed season
warren said : ' listen , if i could get that on for may 9 , that would be on , i can assure you but we are limited by the fact it is wembley arena
saunders is due to fight at wembley arena on may 9 on the same card as eubank jnr saunders is keen to get back in the ring with saunders and get revenge for his professional defeat ' but when i leave this press conference you know what i will be working on and we will see how we go with it
saunders got the better of eubank over 12 rounds when the pair met back in november eubank and saunders are both keen on a re-match and while may 9 is a possibility an autumn fight is more realistic defeat for saunders or eubank before the rematch could damage the credibility of the fight and warren knows it could be in everybody 's best interest to get the fight on as quickly as possible
' eubank won the wba interim world title by out - pointing dmitry chudinov at the 02 arena in february and the brighton man has urged saunders to forget about his current route to the wbo title and instead concentrate on dethroning him
