craig lister , 54 , is on hormone therapy for prostate cancer , which starves cancer cells by reducing levels of testosterone in the body - and has the side - effect of hot flushes
' i have about ten to 12 flushes a day , and six to eight at night , ' says craig lister , a yorkshireman who lives in watford , hertfordshire , with wife sue , a teacher , 52 , and their three children , george , 22 , evie , 20 , and joseph , 18
craig lister , 54 , was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012
' hormone therapy , usually given in the form of regular injections or implants , is the first treatment offered to men with advanced prostate cancer - where the cancer has spread beyond the prostate
hormone therapy is also given alongside radiotherapy to some men with localised prostate cancer to shrink the cancer and make it easier to treat
however , blocking testosterone can cause a variety of side - effects , explains ali rooke , a specialist nurse at the charity
' testosterone is a man 's natural source of energy , so along with hot flushes we often see fatigue
' hormone therapy also raises the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes , and can cause bone thinning , because testosterone is important for bone density
studies by prostate cancer uk have found that 80 per cent of men having hormone therapy will suffer hot flushes , and 27 per cent of these say it is the side - effect that troubles them the most
' people do n't tell you much about hormone therapy at the beginning , ' he says
' she used to have hot flushes and so she 's very sympathetic
' men with advanced prostate cancer could be on hormone therapy for the rest of their life , says ali rooke
' she says the charity receives hundreds of calls every year from men struggling with hot flushes and side - effects of hormone therapy
' men are warned about side - effects , but clinic appointment times are not long , so doctors ca n't realistically talk through them all in detail
it 's also hard to predict what side - effects a man will have and how he will respond
' there are treatments to alleviate hot flushes , such as drugs based on the female hormone progesterone , which has an effect like testosterone but does n't fuel the growth of cancer cells
this causes hot flushes and night sweats a trial on prostate cancer patients at king 's college london , published in march , has shown such impressive results that it is likely to be offered nationally
myra hunter , professor of clinical health psychology at king 's , has previously found that cbt reduces hot flushes in menopausal women , and breast cancer patients who are experiencing them as a result of treatments that reduce levels of oestrogen
' beliefs about hot flushes can exacerbate the symptoms , ' she says
professor hunter believes that by replacing overly negative thoughts about hot flushes with more helpful , positive ones , they will have less of an impact
her latest study recruited 68 men receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer , all of whom were experiencing at least ten hot flushes and night sweats a week
' women feel hot flushes are a signifier of their age and reproductive status , ' says professor hunter
' they felt the hot flushes had social consequences - people would think that there was something wrong with them
' after six weeks , the cbt group 's hot flushes were 40 per cent less problematic and 36 per cent less frequent , compared with 12 per cent and 16 per cent reductions in the control group
professor hunter is hoping to offer her self - help audio guide and booklet for hot flushes free through prostate cancer uk , but this has not yet been confirmed
craig lister was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer three years ago , at the age of 50 , so quality of life is important to him
while the hormone treatment has been helpful , the hot flushes have been hard to deal with
