james staring , a london - based personal trainer , says there are four simple ways to banish belly fat many of us dream of a flat stomach and washboard abs. but despite dieting and exercising , fat around the middle can be especially hard to shift
now , personal trainer james staring , from fit to last , a london - based fitness company , claims he has four simple tips which can help anyone achieve an enviable stomach area
from writing a food diary to doing short burst of tough exercise , he reveals the best ways to burn away belly fat ... avoid white bread and pasta and only eat carbohydrates after exercise avoid carbohydrates that are refined i.e. white bread and pasta as these enter your blood stream much faster
unprocessed carbohydrates ( i.e. whole grains , legumes , vegetables and fruits ) increase feelings of feeling full and release sugar into the blood stream at a much slower rate
how this will help you : when you consume excess carbohydrate ( and , by extension , if your carbohydrate consumption is nât paired with activity ) these carbohydrates are stored for future use , often as body fat
do full body exercises the more muscle groups you use , the more calories you will burn both during and after exercising
carrying out full body exercises will speed up metabolism and means a person will burn more calories afterwards
but if you want to lose belly fat , you must exercise , full stop
doing short bursts of high intensity exercise leads to higher energy demands and more calories burned , which will help shed weight from the stomach according to a study from canada âs mcmaster university , high intensity interval training ( short blasts of exercise followed by short recovery periods ) enables you to achieve the same exercise benefits in less time than slogging countless hours on the treadmill
write down what you eat ( including how you feel two hours afterwards ) writing down how different foods affect feelings can stop a person mindlessly eating , mr staring claims busy lifestyles often mean that eating has become a required reflex , not a considered decision
how this will help you : watching your energy level patterns is an effective way to monitor your blood sugar levels
keep these levels consistent with carbohydrate timing , add in high intensity exercise , and the belly fat you want to be rid of will be a distant memory sooner than you think .
