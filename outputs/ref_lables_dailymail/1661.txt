everton manager roberto martinez has not ruled out the prospect of antolin alcaraz or sylvain distin earning new contracts but stressed they need to prove they can still be important figures in the club 's future
both centre - backs ' current deals expire this summer and it seems highly unlikely sylvain distin , who is 38 in december and has played more for the under - 21s in the last month than he has the first team , will be retained
antolin alcaraz , 33 in july , has more of a chance of securing a short - term extension as roberto martinez looks to strengthen and restructure his defence in the summer
roberto martinez insists 37 - year - old defender sylvain distin still has time to prove he deserves a new deal antolin alcaraz , who joined everton from wigan where he played under roberto martinez , could get a new deal while the everton boss is keen to advance the talents of younger players - tyias browning and brendan galloway the two most likely to benefit - he has not ruled out retaining existing senior players
' there are only two players out of contract and we have two loan players ( aaron lennon and christian atsu ) and those decisions will be made when we have finished the season , ' said roberto martinez
' roberto martinez says his club 's recruitment team have been searching for targets for six months sylvain distin has played more for everton 's youth team than the first xi in the past month , and could be on his way roberto martinez said they have established a list of transfer targets for the summer and , while he would not confirm publicly , aston villa 's on - loan manchester united midfielder tom cleverley , out of contract at the end of the season , is believed to be one of them
tom cleverley , who is on loan at aston villa , is a target , with roberto martinez having worked with him before ' the dressing room is very strong as it is now , so we need to make sure whatever we do in the summer is to get us in a better place
