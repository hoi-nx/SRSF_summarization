colin pitchfork was jailed for life in 1988 for raping and killing two schoolgirls
he strangled 15 - year - old lynda to death after raping her on a deserted footpath in the leicestershire village of narborough in 1983
three years later he raped and killed dawn ashworth , also 15 , less than a mile from where he murdered lynda
pitchfork was finally caught two years later thanks to dna tests on all the men in surrounding villages
he received a 30 - year minimum sentence which was then cut to 28 years in 2009 , meaning he was supposed to be eligible for release next year
a spokesman for the parole board said : ' we can confirm that the secretary of state for justice has referred the case of colin pitchfork to the parole board for a review of his suitability for release
' once a case has been referred to the parole board , it usually takes around six months before a decision is issued , meaning the double murderer could be out this year
on november 22 , 1983 , the body of 15 - year - old lynda was found raped and strangled on a deserted footpath running between a cemetery and a psychiatric hospital in the leicestershire village of narborough
almost three years later , in july 1986 , the body of another 15 - year - old , dawn ashworth , from nearby enderby , was found in almost identical circumstances in a wooded area , less than a mile from the scene of lynda 's murder
however , two years later , semen samples found at the crime scenes were used to match the dna of pitchfork , a baker and convicted flasher
he became the first criminal in the world to be convicted based on dna fingerprinting , following the first mass screening of 5,000 men in three neighbouring villages .
