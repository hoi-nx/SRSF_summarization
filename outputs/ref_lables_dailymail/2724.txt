most women have known the frustrated feeling of nursing the broken heel of a irreplaceable shoe
tanya heath has revolutionised women 's footwear with her collection of shoes that feature an interchangeable heel
every shoe features a button on the inside of the shoe , in the centre of the heel
once a new heel is slid into the shoe , it is locked into place , and at the press of the button , the heel can be released and slid out of place
in terms of storing the shoes , the heel can easily be slid off and packed away , which makes for less clumsy carrying or packing there are hundreds of heel varieties available , from high to low , stiletto to chunky , and in a large array of prints the brand was perfected in september 2013 , with the tagline reading : ' same shoe , different heels , endless possibilities

masterminding the brand is canadian fashion designer , tanya heath
' i just fantasised non-stop about a shoe where you could just take the heels off , and that would go from a comfortable low - heel to a high - heel , and still make me look good ! ' tanya heath has admitted that it was difficult to create a shoe , where the composition would n't change depending on the height of the heel
she has worn a style from the collection ' every day of my life for the past 3 years ! ' tanya heath 's invention means that high stilettos ( pictured left ) can be swapped for a chunky more comfortable heel ( pictured right ) depending on the occasion it 's not only just the heel height that 's the selling point - different prints can boost the outfit
in this case , pink sparkly heels are being chosen and slid on in terms of the celebrities tanya heath would want to wear the heels , the list is endless
