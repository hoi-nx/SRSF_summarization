a map that reveals every official sighting of a ufo over the past 76 years suggests that we are experiencing more cosmic traffic than ever before
the interactive map was created by writer levi pearson , who used a ufo sighting dataset from the national ufo reporting centre and open source software from cartodb

it was created by writer levi pearson , who used a ufo sighting dataset from the national ufo reporting centre and open source software from cartodb published in the quantbait website , it begins in 1933 with the first ufo sightings being spotted over california and nebraska in the us , the british and france in europe , and locations in japan and australia
the number of sightings increases dramatically between the 1940s and the 1960s across the world , according to the map
in the us , sightings documented during the 1940s include the famous battle of los angeles and roswell
on february 25 1942 , radar operators spotted a ufo within 120 miles ( 193km ) of los angeles that moved at incredible speed before vanishing

its shows that the number of sightings increases dramatically between the 1940s and the 1960s explanations for ufo sightings are just as vague as for aliens themselves , and could be down to the development of drones and new aircraft technologies â or a genuine rise in alien activity

while this could indicate ore alien activity , the cia recently claimed that half of ufo sightings in the us were linked to them testing u2 spy planes ( pictured ) at altitudes of 60,000 ft an artillery officer said he saw 25 craft flying at 25,000ft ( 7,620 metres ) and other eye witnesses reported seeing swarms of balloon - shaped objects flying at around 200mph ( 320km/h )
â ufo sightings often come in sudden and short - lived periods , which ufologists call flaps or waves
soldiers reported unusual lights and when they investigated , found a metal object with coloured lights ( ufo map of british shown ) thanks to the rise in popularity of sci - fi films and an increase in ufo sightings , aliens were very much in the public consciousness in the 1960s
there appear to be repeated ufo sightings in the midlands shown on the map during the 1960s , with clusters of activity also seen in the netherlands , germany and other parts of central europe
there is a marked increase in sightings on the map during the 1950s and 1960s , all across the us shown on the map
last year , the cia took credit for half of the ufo reports in the 1950s and 1960s and as sci - fi films gained popularity such as invaders from mars , 2001 : a space odyssey and invasion of the body snatchers , it âs possible aliens were higher in the public conscious than ever before
the cia said that ufo sightings were directly correlated to them testing u2 spy planes at altitudes of 60,000 ft ( 18,288 metres ) - a feat of engineering that was not possible before
reports suggest that the cia soon realised that ufo sightings lined up with the place and time the u- 2 planes were flying , but that they purposefully chose not to let people know that what they were seeing were not aliens to keep the tests firmly under wraps
however , this does not explain the 1966 westall encounter in australia , when some 200 students and teachers in melbourne claim to have seen a ufo land in a suburban field , before taking off again
the map also shows a famous ufo sighting in sao paulo , brazil , in 1986 , when military aircraft were sent to intercept 20 ufos , which showed up on radar
the map shows the whole of europe ablaze with circles indicating ufo sightings , as well as areas of western south africa , india , south east asia and south america
some believe that the increase in sightings over the past 20 years could be down to the widespread uptake of the internet , which allowed people to share sightings more easily than before ( ufo map focused on australia pictured ) the map shows a famous ufo sighting in sao paulo , brazil , in 1986 , when military aircraft were sent to intercept 20 ufos , as well as numerous sightings in south africa and other parts of the continent , which have been reported in recent years
ufo maps of south america ( left ) and south africa ( right ) are shown the global nature of the sightings suggests this could be down to the widespread uptake of the internet , which allowed people to share sightings more easily than before
mr watson said : â with the coming of the internet it is easier for people to report ufo sightings and this is probably one reason for a rise in sightings
