a spanish expert , dr celia sanchez-ramos , has found the led screens found in most electronic devices can harm the retina - the light - sensitive layer at the back of the eye - and may even lead to partial blindness
according to dr celia sanchez-ramos , modern led screens , produced from about 2007 onwards , emit up to five times as much blue light as older technology
the average adult now spends up to eight - and - a - half hours in front of a screen every day , and it is not uncommon to be exposed to multiple screens at once
for these reasons , says dr celia sanchez-ramos , who is based at university of madrid in madrid , the majority of people are likely to be in the danger zone
children and the elderly are most at risk on account of their delicate eyes , as well as ' digital workers ' and those - like me - who are especially sensitive to blue light
dr celia sanchez-ramos ( pictured ) said : ' never before in human history have we exposed our eyes to light that is so intense , for such long periods , from such an early age ' ' never before in human history have we exposed our eyes to light that is so intense , for such long periods , from such an early age , ' she says
' the damage , she explains , starts when the photoreceptors - types of neurone found in the retina that convert light into information - begin to die out due to the prolonged saturation of blue light
eventually , the concentration of blue light in the centre of the retina , an area known as the macula , may cause it to be permanently damaged , leading to visual disorders
however the problem can be remedied by using special screen filters or glasses designed to block blue light , which are available through opticians
daniel hardiman-mccartney , clinical adviser at the college of optometrists , says : ' it has been proven that intense exposure to blue light kills cells in the retina , and it is a perfectly reasonable possibility that it can cause macular degeneration over a period of time
' dr celia sanchez-ramos carried out experiments at the university of madrid in which human retinal cells , taken from volunteers , were exposed to cycles of led light of different intensities
dr celia sanchez-ramos found that exposure to intense blue light caused cell death in the eye
however this was reduced by 83 per cent when a special protective filter was placed between the cells and the light her findings prompted her to design a screen filter called ' reticare ' , which converts harmful blue light to a gentler frequency more akin to sunshine other treatments are also available
in particular , blue wavelengths , which are emitted by most electronic devices produced from 2007 onwards , have been shown to have ' adverse health effects '
researchers have found that using an electronic gadget with a backlit display for just two hours can affect the production of melatonin - the chemical that controls our body clock - and cause sleep problems , particularly in teenagers
in addition , dr celia sanchez-ramos has found that exposure to blue light can damage the retina causing macular degeration , or partial blindness
prior to this , i had been unable to use iphones , ipads and other gadgets with led screens without shooting pain in my eyes , dizziness and nausea
it can also be found in those with autism , adhd , migraine , photo - sensitive epilepsy and multiple sclerosis , as well as stroke victims
when i road - tested one of dr celia sanchez-ramos ' filters , i found my symptoms were reduced significantly on all devices , though the blue spectacles were more effective with certain screens
dr celia sanchez-ramos says the use of led screens has become so ubiquitous in such a short period of time that in 20 years ' time , severe eye problems could become widespread
she and her colleagues are lobbying apple , samsung and other technology manufacturers to make their screens friendlier to the eye , meaning that no protective filters would be needed
as a result , a number of spanish local authorities have ruled that all schools under their jurisdiction must use protective screen filters
