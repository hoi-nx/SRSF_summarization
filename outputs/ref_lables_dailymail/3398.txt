the converted four - bedroom home on lawrenny court was built as a garage to service the generous 57 - room mansion homeden , home to supreme court justice sir henry hodges and more famously the nicholas family who found their fortune in the manufacture of the drug aspro
interestingly , the conversion took place at the same time homeden was being tuned into a block of flats.this provided the owners with a unique opportunity to buy some of the original features of the mansion and transfer them into the 740 square - metre garage residence
the blackwood and copperlight archway has been tastefully adapted to suit the light - filled property and the windows upstiars are also a homeden original
