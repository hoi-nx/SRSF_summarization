an ontario girl whose father chose her needier twin sister to receive his liver donation has now gotten a lifesaving new organ of her own
vietnamese binh , 3 , and her identical twin phuoc were left with fatally impaired liver function due to alagille syndrome
but when phuoc needed a donor just a little more , their adopted father michael chose her to receive his liver , which was a perfect match
now , thanks to the generosity of an anonymous donor , binh and her sister phuoc are both on their road to recovery , reports the national post
the twins suffer from alagille syndrome , a life - threatening genetic disorder that causes a loss of the bile ducts within the liver during the first year of life ' binh received her gift ! ! ! there are not enough words to thank the amazing and so unselfish donor , ' the parents wrote on a facebook page dedicated to the girls
the post continued : ' binh is recovering well , at her own pace
she has been through a lot with very different medical issues from her twin who had her transplant two months ago
' when mr binh and his wife johanne found out that both girls would need a liver transplant , they were relieved to find out that he was a perfect match
however , binh was only able to give a portion of his liver to just one of his daughters , leaving him with an impossible choice
mr binh and daughter phuoc went into surgery on february 10 , and it has so far been a success
anonymous lifesaver : the parents have asked that media not try to track down the donor of binh 's new liver , because he or she has chosen to remain anonymous recovering well : ' binh is recovering well , at her own pace
she has been through a lot with very different medical issues from her twin who had her transplant two months ago , ' read a facebook update about the girl five days after the operation , the family posted a heartwarming video of the moment father and daughter were reunited in phuoc 's hospital room
' hey mon belle ! ' mr binh says to his little girl , which translates to ' hey my beauty ' in french
' months before binh 's transplant , michael wanger was convinced to pass her by and choose her sister phuoc ( right ) to receive part of his liver alagille syndrome is a life - threatening genetic disorder that causes a loss of the bile ducts within the liver during the first year of life
this leads to a buildup of bile in the liver , causing damage to liver cells
treatment of alagille syndrome focuses on trying to increase the flow of bile from the liver
so we left the orphanage that day and went to buy two little containers with dragonflies on them and that 's what we were going to lay their ashes in if they did n't make it , ' mrs wagner recalled about meeting the girls in vietnamese despite the health problems , mrs wagner does not regret her decision.she said : ' we would travel this path all over again
