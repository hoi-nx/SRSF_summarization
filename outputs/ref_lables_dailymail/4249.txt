researchers have isolated bacterial dna of several strains of the disease from the bodies of mummies found in the crypt of a church in the city of vã¡c in hungary
they found 14 different strains of tb bacteria that had infected eight of the bodies in the tomb and traced them all back to a single source
mummified remains of 28 - year - old terã©zia hausmann ( above ) found in the 18th century crypt of the dominican church in vã¡c , hungary , were among those found to have been infected with tuberculosis by the researchers they say the strains of tb they found all evolved from a single germ that had began infecting people during the late roman period
professor pallen , a geneticist at university of warwick who led the work , said : ' by showing that historical strains can be accurately mapped to contemporary lineages , we have confirmed the genotypic continuity of an infection that has ravaged the heart of europe since prehistoric times
they found a clear relationship to tb lineages in animals - especially seals and sea lions
the study , which is published in the journal nature communications , used samples taken from the mummified remains of 26 people who had been buried in a cyrpt of vã¡c 's dominican church during the 18th century
the researchers found that eight of the 26 bodies they examined showed signs that they had died of tuberculosis , five of whom had suffered from multiple strains
it is the first evidence that mixed infections of multiple strains of tb were common in the 18th century
the researchers found that all of the strains belonged to a lineage of tb bacteria known as lineage 4 , which still causes more than a million tb cases a year in europe and america
the researchers found several different the mummies were discovered during restoration work at the dominican church in vã¡c , hungary ( above ) they found that they all seemed to stem from a single strain of tuberculosis that was in existence between 396ce - 470ce
' our dating is consistent with evidence that a strain containing the pks15 / 1 deletion was present in britain by the second â fourth centuries ce. ' the findings also suggest that at the time when the mummies died , tb was already raging in europe and killing large numbers of people even before urbanisation and crowded housing created devastating epidemics
the dry climate in the crypt preserved the bodies and clothing of the people placed there in the 18th century the church where the mummies were found is in vã¡c in the pest region of northern hungary ( shown above ) professor pallen , who conducted the work along with researchers at the university birmingham , university college london , the hebrew university in jerusalem and the hungary natural history museum in budapest , said : ' microbiological analysis of samples from contemporary tb patients usually report a single strain of tuberculosis per patient
