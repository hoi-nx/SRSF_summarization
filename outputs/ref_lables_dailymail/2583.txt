bayern munich manager pep guardiola blamed his team 's champions league quarter - final first - leg defeat by porto on injuries
porto take a two - goal advantage to munich next tuesday for the return leg of the last - eight clash after punishing a sloppy bayern munich with two early goals from quaresma and a second - half effort from martinez
' pep guardiola says his side suffered with the injuries they are currently contending with in the squad porto manager julen lopetegui said his side can now dream of reaching the semi-finals , but they will need to be ' perfect ' in the second leg
' julen lopetegui says reaching the champions league semi-final would be a dream come true quaresma ( 7 ) gave porto an early lead from the spot but neuer was lucky to be on the pitch julen lopetegui said the return from injury of goalscorer martinez , who had been out since early march with a hamstring problem , was one of the reasons for wednesday 's victory
martinez , who capitalised on an error by jerome boateng in the 65th minute to round bayern munich keeper neuer for porto 's third goal after thiago alcantara had reduced the arrears , said he was not yet 100 percent fit
the striker was a constant menace for bayern munich 's defenders and his tenacious harrying was rewarded after three minutes when he robbed xabi alonso before being brought down by neuer for a penalty that quaresma converted
