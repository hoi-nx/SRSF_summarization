is this the world âs safest bike ? its designers certainly think so
and perhaps most noticeable of all is the roll cage that surrounds the cyclist - keeping them safe against trucks and buses turning into them
called the babel bike it has a host of features including a roll cage
crispin sinclair ( shown with the bike ) is seeking Â£ 50,000 of funding on site indiegogo
the bike also has foot protectors and an electric motor the babel bike was designed by london - based crispin sinclair - son of the famous british inventor sir clive , whose 1985 sinclair c5 bike turned out to be somewhat of a flop
he is seeking Â£ 50,000 ( $ 74,000 ) of funding on indiegogo to bring his dream to fruition
at the front of the bike are two steel foot protectors , which are detachable and can also be used as a bike lock
the babel bike was designed by london - based crispin sinclair - son of the famous british inventor sir clive , whose 1985 sinclair c5 bike ( pictured with clive in it ) turned out to be somewhat of a flop at the front of the bike are two steel foot protectors , pictured here , which are detachable and can also be used as a bike lock the bike does nât rely on pedal power alone , but rather has an electric motor inside that assists it at speeds of up to 20mph in the us and 15.5mph in the eu
â in both the us and the eu you can still pedal faster but in both jurisdictions the motor ca nât assist at higher speeds ( by law ) , â the team notes on their indiegogo page but crispin sinclair notes in a video that even all these safety features â wo nât help in a collision with a turning bus or truck at a junction - by far the single biggest cause of cycling fatalities
so the team designed a roll cage for the bike , which prevents it getting trapped under a vehicle
