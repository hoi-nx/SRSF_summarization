a university of virginia student whose reputation was trashed by rolling stone 's discredited tale of a violent gang rape on campus has taken the magazine to task for not firing anybody after its story fell apart
jackie , a former friend of supposed victim ' jackie ' , spoke out after he featured in the now - infamous feature a rape on campus , and was painted as a callous social climber who discouraged a rape victim from speaking out
' i think the rolling stone absolutely should be held accountable ' , he said in a tv interview monday , and added the under - fire magazine has risked its reputation by not disciplining erdley , the reporter who wrote the story
the most important failing , they said , was not contacting jackie and another student , duffin , who spoke out alongside jackie in an interview with fox news 's megyn kelly
jackie and duffin - who were referred to by pseudonyms in the story - would have been able to tell erdley that there were serious inconsistencies between what jackie had told them and the story the article credulously repeated
rolling stone 's story said that jackie , sitting in a dress stained in blood from a gang rape by seven different men just hours before , sobbed to her three friends , who told her to take it no further
still employed : rolling stone will not take any action against sabrina rubin erdely , whose reporting was roundly discredited the story said the three - duffin , stock and an unnamed woman - were preoccupied with the ' social price ' of being associated with rape accusations
duffin and jackie were painted as wannabe frat boys whose prospects of acceptance would be harmed
in fact , they revealed , jackie had no blood on her or obvious wounds - and the friends immediately suggested going to the police , which jackie said she was not prepared for
none of them was ever contacted by erdley - in duffin 's case because jackie had falsely told her that he had refused to contribute
' responding to the same question , duffin said : ' i think much more than anybody losing jobs or not losing jobs i think it 's important that rolling stone and other media outlets look at this more as a story of what not to do in reporting
her piece credulously recounted jackie 's tale the story of an anonymous student - referred to as jackie - who said she was lured to the phi kappa psi house and raped by a gang of seven men
the article recounted the event in vivid , graphic detail based on jackie 's account
' the review spelled out extensive contact between sabrina rubin erdely and jackie , spanning eight interviews
sabrina rubin erdely wrote 405 pages of notes about the story
sabrina rubin erdely had asked repeatedly for the name of the supposed attacker , but jackie said she was not ' comfortable ' with the idea of him being contacted for the story
sabrina rubin erdely asked jackie again for the name once the public interrogation of her account began
experts at columbia concluded that sabrina rubin erdely , her editors , and the fact - checking department all failed to try hard enough to speak to the accused , and other people mentioned in the story
claims : the story published in november focused on a university of virginia student named jackie who claimed to have been gang raped by seven men at the campus ' phi kappa psi fraternity two years ago
above , the frat house on january 15 , 2015 another possible way sabrina rubin erdely could have found out inconsistencies in the story would have been giving fuller details to the fraternity and university of virginia when asking them for comment , the review said
' when the full story was published , phi kappa psi responded by pointing out there had been no party on the date jackie gave
the review concluded : ' rolling stone 's repudiation of the main narrative in a rape on campus is a story of journalistic failure that was avoidable
' the magazine set aside or rationalized as unnecessary essential practices of reporting that , if pursued , would likely have led the magazine 's editors to reconsider publishing jackie 's narrative so prominently , if at all
sean woods , one of jackie 's editors , described the scandal over the article as ' it 's been an extraordinarily painful and humbling experience '
' i allowed my concern for jackie 's well - being , my fear of re-traumatizing her , and my confidence in her credibility to take the place of more questioning and more facts
