david cameron 's manifesto pledge to dramatically extend lady thatcher 's right - to - buy policy was this morning attacked as a ' deeply unfair ' bribe which will cost taxpayers billions of pounds
in a bold pitch to working class voters , the prime minister said the tories would offer discounts of up to 70 per cent to 1.3million families in housing association properties to buy their home
but the national housing federation said the subsidy - which will be funded by forcing councils to sell off their most expensive properties - will cost taxpayers Â£ 5.8billion and was effectively worth Â£ 100,000 to each family who benefited
labour jumped on the remarks this morning , claiming the policy had ' unravelled ' and pointed to figures showing that last year just 479 council homes were sold off â raising Â£ 100million , or 2 per cent of the funds promised by the tories
he said : ' the next tory government will extend the right - to - buy to all housing association tenants in this country â 1.3million extra families â a new generation given the security of a home of their own
' original plan : the right - to - buy scheme became lady thatcher 's most famous single policy the pledge to extend right - to - buy , which was introduced in 1980 but has now been stopped in its tracks by labour in wales and the snp in scotland , will delight the tory faithful , who were buoyed last night by a six - point poll lead over labour
national housing federation director ruth davison said the extension of right to buy to housing association properties was ' the wrong solution to our housing crisis '
' the conservatives say that forcing councils to sell off their most valuable properties would fund this extension plus 400,000 new homes over five years â we fear the figures simply wo n't stack up
the original right - to - buy saw more than 1.5million council homes being sold off at discounted rates
labour 's shadow housing minister attacked the tory policy today the coalition government has already increased right - to - buy discounts for council homes , meaning more are moving into the private sector
but most tenants living in homes provided by housing associations â not - for - profit bodies that have gradually replaced councils as the main providers of social housing â do not qualify
currently , taxpayers subsidise the housing costs of many unemployed and lower paid workers who live in housing association properties
the 1.3million housing association homes are occupied by 2.75million people
' some labour figures , including former welfare minister frank field and former cabinet minister alan milburn , have previously championed the idea of extending the right - to - buy to housing associations
how does right - to - buy work ? introduced in 1980 , it gives council house tenants discounts to buy their home
what has the coalition done ? it has sought to reinvigorate the scheme , cutting from five to three the number of years tenants need to have been in a home before they can buy it and upping the discounts to a maximum of Â£ 77,000 for most areas
are housing association tenants covered ? housing associations â autonomous , not - for - profit bodies that receive public money and loans from the private sector to provide low - cost homes â are largely exempt
what are the tory proposals ? they would legislate to give all housing association tenants full right - to - buy
how will this be paid for ? the tories say they will make councils sell off expensive properties when they become vacant
another slice of the proceeds would be used to fund the new right - to - buy discounts for housing association tenants
