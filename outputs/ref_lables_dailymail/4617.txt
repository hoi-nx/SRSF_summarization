hamilton is getting inside teammate rosberg âs head as the german bids to win his first world championship title , according to two time winner mika hakkinen
rosberg accused mercedes team - mate hamilton of deliberately compromising his race at last weekend âs grand prix by slowing down but mika hakkinen said the british driver âs tactics , which saw him win a third consecutive grand prix ahead of the german , were entirely legitimate
â if you are leading a race that 's a fantastic place to be and what goes in your mind when you are leading into finish the race first , â said mika hakkinen
hamilton celebrates his win with the mercedes team , but rosberg appears less pleased with 2nd rosberg accused hamilton of being selfish by driving too slow and compromising his second position hamilton crossed the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in chinese â so you do everything with the team in the right way so you are able to finish the race first
â i have been in this situation with michael [ schumacher ] where where i was much quicker than him and he was definitely challenging me in a very interesting way , â added mika hakkinen
â lewis and rosberg are going through at the moment , they are having a very difficult challenge , already last year and there are challenges continuing this year between them
rosberg responded to a fan who accused him of ' crying ' after he complained about hamilton former world champion mika hakkinen says hamilton was well within his rights to look after himself hamilton celebrates with with his trophy and bottle of champagne after his race win ' they are the drivers with the best possible chance of winning at the moment
â hamilton , who is bidding to win a third world championship title this season , has out - qualified and out - raced rosberg in all three grand prix and rosberg will likely be feeling the pressure according to mika hakkinen
â rosberg has definitely got big pressure on him , â said mika hakkinen , â he does n't know how it feels to be a world champion and does n't know what confidence a world championship generates inside you when you are racing driver
he wants to win but first he has to beat lewis but rosberg is a great driver and if you look at the qualifying result at the last grand prix the time difference was hardly nothing
was the race as expected in terms of the challenge from ferrari and , also , can you talk us through that radio message you got from the team about speeding up ? were you aware that rosberg was getting so backed - up towards sebastian ? lh : i was nât controlling his race , i was controlling my own race but , great race , i âm really happy
i had no real threat from rosberg through the whole race
q : rosberg , can you talk us through your view of the race today
driving slower than was maybe necessary at the beginning of stints meant that sebastian was very close to me and that opened up the opportunity for sebastian to try that early pit - stop to try and jump me
q : lewis , would you like to respond ? lh : not really ! my job is not to â¦ it âs not my job to look after rosberg âs race
