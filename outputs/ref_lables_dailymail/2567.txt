what if someone took your greatest insecurities and body image fears , and voiced them out loud ? known for its empowering campaigns and championing of real women , dove has taken a more brutal approach in its latest advertisement
showing the harsh criticism that women regularly heap upon themselves , dove decided to see what would happen when somebody else said those things , to their faces
the women filled in a notebook each , and handed it back to dove unbeknownst to the women , those negative remarks and self - body shaming were turned into a script created in france , dove asked a group of women - all beautiful and impeccably chic - to write down every thought they had about themselves in a notebook
dove recruited two undercover actresses to read the script , created using the notes each of the women made about themselves , while they were all within earshot
in the experiment set up by dove , the women heard the actresses repeat their own thoughts to each other , out loud
while another , ' your face looks like a bulldog , ' when said out loud underlines the way many women effectively bully themselves every single day
' i hope my daughter never speaks to herself like that , ' says one , moved to tears by the shock of the experiment visibly shocked by the comments , the women recognise the dialogue as their own notes
' i hope my daughter never speaks to herself like that , ' says one
