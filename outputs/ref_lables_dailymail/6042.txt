a two - mile victorian railway line which was shut down 50 years ago under a programme of sweeping closures could reopen as britain 's longest cycle tunnel
the disused rhondda , which runs 1,000 feet beneath the welsh hills , was closed as part of the beeching cutbacks , a project which spelled the end for thousands and stations across the rail network in britain
but engineers are due to visit the 3,148m tunnel next week - for the first time since it closed - to see whether it is safe to use as a cycle route
leanne wood , leader of plaid cymru , said : ' there is a real buzz about this project which could transform these valleys if the tunnel is opened up
but engineers are due to visit the 3,148m tunnel next week - for the first time since it closed - to see whether it is safe to use as a cycle route the railway tunnel , which runs beneath the mountains under the dunraven forest in the south wales valleys , was opened in 1890 in the coal boom
it was then closed in 1968 it was opened in 1890 during the coal boom , after a five - year building project , which was overseen by the tunnel 's chief engineer william yockney , a pupil of isambard kingdom brunel
but both ends of the tunnel - at blaencwm in the rhondda and blaengwynfi in the afan valley - were filled in during the 1970s
the tunnel runs from blaencwm in the rhondda valley to blaengwynfi in the afan valley ( shown in map ) how the tunnel 's length will compare to those around the world , according to the rhonda tunnel society under the proposals , it would be one of the longest cycle tunnels in the world , second only to the 4,000m snoqualmie tunnel near seattle in the u.s although some 3,000 miles of railway lines were closed before the report , he became infamous for causing the closures of several rural stations
after falling victim to the report , the abandoned rhondda lay dormant for nearly 50 years
but the rhondda tunnel society formed a few years ago in a bid to secure funding for the tunnel 's excavation
pictured right : workers at the rhonnda tunnel the highways agency historic railways estate has contracted a construction and engineering company to undertake the three - day inspection of the tunnel , alongside the mines rescue service the rhondda tunnel society formed with the sole purpose of reopening the victorian locomotive route he said : ' the engineers will be walking the length of the tunnel across three days looking at the safety of the structure to see what it 's like after 47 years and to see if it is possible to re-open the tunnel
' he added : ' with the interest of the world looking in on the project , the inspections next week are going to be crucial with engineers being in the dark depths of the tunnel evaluating its integrity
it is being inspected next week for the first time since it closed engineer dr beeching , whose report led to the reduction of the britain railway network in 1963 , dr beeching , a civil servant from the isle of sheppey , was recruited by the government to write a report about how to make the railway network more profitable
