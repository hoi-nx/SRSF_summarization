men with advanced prostate cancer could benefit from a pioneering drug originally meant for women
new â exciting â new research suggests the drug , already used to treat women with breast cancer , could also help men with genetic faults within their prostate cancer ( pictured ) tumours up to 30 per cent of men with advanced prostate cancer have tumours that have dna defects and these respond particularly well to olaparib
they found 16 out of 49 men with advanced prostate cancer responded to the drug , also known as lynparza
it stopped prostate cancer growth , generating lower tumour cell counts in the blood and improved responses in medical scans
the drug - called olaparib - can extend the length of time that a prostate cancer patient lives with the disease without it getting worse , according to new clinical trials
olaparib is the first cancer drug to target inherited genetic mutations
side effects from traditional anti-cancer treatments are reduced because only cancer cells with genetic defects are targeted
professor johann de bono , who was the trial chief investigator , said : â this opens up the exciting possibility of delivering precise treatment for advanced prostate cancer , guided by genomic testing and based on the molecular characteristics of patients â tumours
' it shows that parp inhibitors can be effective in a wider group of patients than had been thought â in men as well as women , patients with mutations in their tumours as well as those with inherited mutations , and in those with a wider range of gene defects
â the drug , olaparib , is the first cancer drug to target inherited genetic mutations
it works by blocking the cancer cell âs ability to repair damage dr emma hall of the institute of cancer research said : â we âve seen a significant improvement in the length of good quality life men can hope to live even with the most advanced prostate cancers
â researchers did not specify the length of time for which olaparib was able to stop advanced prostate cancer worsening .
