the dawn of a new era of space travel may be upon us after amazon 's bezos successfully tested a vehicle that will take tourists into space
mr bezos ' firm , called the blue origin company , has long spoken of its desire to take paying astronauts into the cosmos
and now it has performed the first successful test of the vehicle they hope will make that dream a reality
the new shepard vehicle rose to a height of 58 miles ( 94km ) - four miles short of space - before landing
it was unmanned , but will ultimately take six people into space the test took place from the company âs launch site in west texas
called new shepard , the vehicle consists of a main booster rocket and a six - seater capsule on top , standing 60ft ( 18 metres ) tall
the new shepard system will take astronauts to space on suborbital journeys
after descent and re-entry into earth âs atmosphere , the crew capsule will land under parachutes no more than a few miles from the launch site
in addition , the new shepard vehicle will provide opportunities for researchers to fly experiments into space and a microgravity environment
for this , the first test flight of the entire architecture , it was unmanned - but the company hopes to soon start taking customers into space
and blue origin is also much more secretive - with this successful test flight taking many by surprise
in video released by blue origin , the booster - using liquid hydrogen and oxygen - lifts the new shepard vehicle to an altitude of 58 miles ( 94km )
â the flight came as somewhat of a surprise because the company did n't make any announcements in the build up that it would be launching a rocket - unlike its rivals virgin galactic and spacex who are very open about the tests they will be performing at peak altitude , 307,000ft ( 58 miles , 94km ) up , the main booster separated from the capsule
the booster failed to land successfully but the capsule landed without a hitch ultimately , the flights will enable six people to go to space
in a video a small crowd was seen watching the successful flight from the company 's launch site in west texas - but for the most part the launch was kept a secret bezos ( pictured ) is better known as the ceo and founder of amazon , with a fortune of Â£ 22.5 billion ( $ 34.7 billion )
he founded his blue origin company in 2000 musk , the paypal co-founder and electric car maker , is competing against bezos to develop a re-usable rocket an isolated edge of vast west texas is home to a highly secretive part of the 21st - century space race , one of two being directed in the lone star state by internet billionaires whose personalities and corporate strategies seem worlds apart
his company contracts with nasa to resupply the international space station and is building a launch site about 600 miles from van horn , on the southernmost texas gulf coast , with the much - publicized goal of sending humans to mars
spacex and blue origin are among several u.s. companies engaged in the private space business

and he noted that the company was already working on a larger vehicle , new shepard âs â very big brother â , which is apparently many times new shepard âs size with five times as much thrust
