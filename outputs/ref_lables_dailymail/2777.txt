you âve just bought a new outfit and you âd really like a new nail polish to co-ordinate with it
or perhaps you âve picked up a dress for a party the same night and it needs more of a glitzy make - up look than usual
now , you no longer need to hotfoot it to the department store or chemist to stock up on make - up â because fashion retailers have got in on the beauty act
fashion retailers have started to get in on the beauty act with plenty of shops now offering their own make - up ranges as well as clothing from marks and spencer to primark , they âre all at it , flogging foundation and lippy alongside frocks and leggings
but are any of them worth splashing your cash on ? claire coleman put some of the biggest fashion beauty brands to the test
topshop beauty the high street giant has all of this season âs beauty looks , from a rainbow of nail polishes ( Â£ 6 ) to lip ombre ( Â£ 9 ) â sets of two cream - to - powder formulation lip colours to be worn in tandem ( caution : lips must be very well moisturised )
the foundation ( Â£ 16 ) was a rather pleasant surprise
it has a good amount of silicone , so slides on easily , and coverage is smooth â but there are only four shades and the dropper applicator is a bit of a gimmick
topshop beauty 's eye shadow ( top left and right ) creates an iridescent shimmer and the lunar colour is perfect for a smokey eye while the high street giant also stocks a wide range of nail polish and lip colour star buy : mono eye shadow ( Â£ 5 )
do nât be put off by their initial glittery appearance
once on , they âre not nearly as sparkly , with more of an iridescent shimmer
lunar , a purplish black , is perfect for a smokey eye
it covers well , but the result is flat , with not enough luminescence to brighten the under - eye area
next make me beautiful this collection , in its chunky silver and transparent packaging , was a real surprise
but if you absolutely had to go straight from primark to a party , had no make - up and only Â£ 5 to spend , it would do
i would nât use this as my everyday foundation , but i âd definitely keep it in my handbag for on - the - go touch - ups
it comes in innovative , twist - up packaging , like a lipstick
the matte velvet lipstick ( Â£ 10 ) is moisturising , with a matte â but not flat â finish , while the ultra rich twist up lips ( Â£ 9.50 ) are a cut - price version of clinique âs famous chubby sticks
the absurdly long wand and very thin brush gave little control â i ended up daubing it on my eyebrows ! new look pure colour if you âre not a teenager , you probably wo nât be shopping in new look â and , on the whole , its make - up range reflects that
star buy : i was torn between the matte nail polishes ( Â£ 2.99 ) , which come in plenty of great colours that go on evenly and dry really quickly , and the baked highlighter powder in gold ( Â£ 4.99 ) , which gives skin a beautiful , almost soft - focus , sheen
