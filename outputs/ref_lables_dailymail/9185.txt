sherwood said his aston villa team â bamboozled â liverpool and paid particular tribute to christian benteke , fabian delph and grealish , the teenager who shone on his wembley debut
aston villa earned a comeback win to book their place in the fa cup final against arsenal and end gerrard âs dream of lifting the famous old trophy on his birthday before bidding farewell to the club
sherwood was dealt a blow by gabby agbonlahor âs failure to overcome a hamstring injury , but adapted his plans to brilliant effect as liverpool struggled to cope with aston villa âs fluid attack
christian benteke is congratulated by aston villa team - mate fabian delph after scoring at wembley the aston villa manager said : â we changed the way we played
we normally go very direct , and use our pace down the sides , i think liverpool would have expected us to do that
i âm not sure liverpool tried to second - guess what we were going to do but i do nât think they would have expected that
â â we looked liverpool and thought it might cause them a few problems if we played two no.10s with grealish and charles nâzogbia and it turned out that way
â we needed to get players in support of christian benteke
we were nât worried about what liverpool were going to do
â brendan rodgers conceded his side had been second best , but praised captain gerrard , who had a late header cleared off the line
aston villa players chase fabian delph after the england midfielder made it 2 - 1 with 36 minutes left on the clock â he was doing everything , everything he possibly could to help the team , â said the liverpool boss
â sherwood kept faith with grealish , the 19 - year - old academy graduate , after handing him his first premier league start against queens park rangers a fortnight ago
he did not disappoint , playing a part in christian benteke âs equaliser , then setting up fabian delph âs winner
â fabian delph and team - mate ashley westwood celebrate their fa cup win over liverpool at wembley grealish , who wears children âs shinpads and socks rolled down , won two free - kicks for his team through dribbling with the ball
he takes more kicks in training than he does on the pitch so he â s getting a lot of practice fending off those kicks â he probably needs bigger pads ! â christian benteke scored his ninth goal in seven games to level philippe countinho âs opening goal , before fabian delph found the net for the second time under sherwood , following his quarter - final goal against west bromwich albion
liverpool playmaker coutinho is mobbed by his team - mates after opening the scoring â i âve never seen him have a bad game here at wembley for england and he âs not had a bad one today , so hopefully he plays well in the final
i just want to encourage him to do that and then he âll be too expensive for anyone to buy ! â on christian benteke , sherwood added : â he âs done that consistently for me
â coutinho spreads his arms out wide after scoring during his side 's surprise fa cup defeat sherwood praised aston villa âs 32,000 fans and turned his attention to arsenal
