patties foods says its testing has found no link between its nanna 's brand frozen mixed berries and a national hepatitis a outbreak
the health department continues to investigate how 34 people in six states contracted the hepatitis a virus , all of whom consumed the same brand of frozen mixed berries
patties foods said no hepatitis a virus or e.coli were detected in any sample of its recalled and non-recalled nanna 's mixed berries 1kg product during its own testing
managing director and ceo chaur said the company 's microbiological and viral testing does not confirm any link between nanna 's mixed berries and the virus and shows no systemic failure of its quality assurance programs
patties foods is again supplying its non-recalled nanna 's and creative gourmet berries varieties onto supermarket shelves but only after each batch tested negative for hep a and e.coli , mr chaur said
