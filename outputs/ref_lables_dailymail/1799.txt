muslim women should be allowed to wear a full - face veil while appearing in court , british 's most senior judge has suggested
lord neuberger , the president of the supreme court , said judges and courtrooms should allow women to wear the traditional dress as they should ' show , and be seen to show ' respect towards different customs
lord neuberger said british 's privileged judges must be aware of their ' subconscious bias ' when dealing with poorer members of society his address to the criminal justice alliance came at a time of uncertainty over the place of muslim traditional dress in the legal system
here she pictured during her court hearing last year , the european court of human rights upheld a ban by french on wearing the muslim full - face veil , the niqab
lord lord neuberger also suggested muslim women should be allowed to wear a full face veil while appearing in court ' more broadly , judges should be courteous and , generally , good - humoured ; and , while they should be firm , they should never , however great the temptation , lose their temper
he also said : ' judges may not appear to be neutral because they will almost always be seen , normally rightly , to come from a more privileged sector of society , in both economic and educational terms , compared with many of the parties , witnesses , jurors in court
' a white male public school judge presiding in a trial of an unemployed traveller from eastern europe accused of assaulting or robbing a white female public school woman will , i hope , always be unbiased
' keith porteous wood , executive director of the national secular society , told the daily telegraph : ' lord neuberger understandably recommends judges understand the expectations of how those ' from different cultural , social , religious or other backgrounds think and behave and how they expect others to behave ' and that the judiciary should show ' respect to everybody equally '
' it was a missed opportunity , however , not to acknowledge that occasionally â for example on a defendant wearing a full face veil â doing so might conflict with justice being seen to be done , or even justice being done
' my concern is not theoretical ; it is now 18 months since a judge at blackfriars magistrate court wasted a great deal of court time dealing with the question of full - face veils , and made a heartfelt plea for central guidance to avoid this inefficient use of expensive court 's resources being replicated elsewhere
