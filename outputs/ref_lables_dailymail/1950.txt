bulgaria might not be the first hotspot that springs to mind for a summer holiday â but that could change after it was named european 's cheapest destination yesterday
resorts on its black sea coast offer the best value in terms of a meal out , buying a cup of coffee and essentials such as sun cream and a cold drink , according to a study
research into an imaginary shopping basket of ten typical holiday purchases showed a total price of Â£ 37.39 for bulgaria , which is down by 13.6 per cent from last summer
there was a bigger fall of 22 per cent for the algarve in portugal , taking the total cost to Â£ 44.02 , helping it beat spain 's costa del sol to become the second cheapest destination
only in turkey , where inflation is 7.6 per cent â compared to virtually zero in britons and the eurozone â will britons find the cost of a day out much more expensive
bulgaria 's most popular resort of sunny beach is a carbon copy of those of spain and greece
its basket costs Â£ 101.60 â almost three times bulgaria 's
holiday : bulgaria ( pictured ) is one of 13 european hotspots out of 14 where your cash will go far further this summer , largely thanks to rock - bottom exchange rates and higher inflation in some countries there , a cup of coffee comes in at Â£ 1.49 , while the three - course meal for two was a much dearer Â£ 52.24
