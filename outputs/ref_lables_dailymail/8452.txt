it was the moment a man , hands open in peace , stood up to a swastika - tattooed neo-nazi with his fists clenched in rage
a striking picture , taken by photographer kenji wardenclyffe , captured the explosive moment during a melbourne protest against the ' islamisation ' of australians
the dramatic scenes occurred after reclaim australia , an anti-islam group , organised protests at major cities across australians , which were countered by anti-racism activists who held rallies in the same locations
the reclaim australia event in melbourne was also crashed by neo-nazis , who spectacularly clashed with anti-racism groups
' the neo-nazi definitely seemed to be instigating , trying to start a fight with the anti-racism group
' the violent intent of the bald man was proven elsewhere at the rally , when he was photographed with one fist gripping another protester 's shirt and the other raised to punch the man in the face
violent intent : at the rally , the man involved in the standoff was seen trying to throw a punch at another protester as the scene descended into violence one man appeared to be knocked out cold in the melee and was left lying on the ground mr wardenclyffe said he was pushed around by protesters throughout the day , and some of his camera equipment was broken by people attempting to stop him from taking photos
' in a video of the event , it also appears to show the moment a man throw a punch at the head of a female anti-racism protester
despite reclaim australia 's promise of a peaceful protest , a number of men with shaved heads and tattoos of the swastika appeared at the event and attempted to intimidate anti-racism protesters
' in these photos , taken by freelance photographer kenji wardenclyffe , a man with a swastika tattoo came head to head with one of the anti-racism protesters and attempted to intimidate them into backing off

' a clash of anti-islam and anti-racism groups turned dangerous and violent during protests in melbourne melbourne police formed a barrier between the separate rallies to attempt to disperse the protesters it comes after a twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-islam groups has mocked protests there was never a violent exchange between the groups however the men with the swastika 's moved through the crowd taunting the anti-racism protesters
