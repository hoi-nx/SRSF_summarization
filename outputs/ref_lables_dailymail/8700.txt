there can be no doubt that the bone - jarring collisions we see on saturday will be far more substantial than the flick from david beckham 's right boot which led to diego simeone collapsing in apparent agony on the same pitch 17 years ago
this mouth - watering repeat of last year 's european cup semi-final in saint-etienne 's famous stade geoffrey-guichard will be no place for faint - hearted souls like argentina 's 1998 football world cup captain
instead , sarries head coach mark mccall wants warriors
twenty - three of them , to be exact , if every player in his squad gets on to the field to face a clermont team that made premiership champions northampton look like a pub side only two weeks ago
veteran fly half charlie hodgson will run the show for sarries against clermont on saturday england centre brad barritt will captain mark mccall 's side against at stade geoffroy-guichard owen farrell has recovered from a knee injury and has been named on the bench for the big clash clermont : n abendanon ; n nakaitaci , j davies , w fofana , n nalaga ; b james , l radosavljevic ; v debaty , b kayser , d zirakashvili , j cudmore , s vahaamahina , j bonnaire , d chouly ( capt ) , j bardy
jacques burger , clermont 's nemesis in last year 's semi-final , is back after a one - match ban while 20 - year - old maro itoje will take the other flank in a sarries pack that must match clermont 's monstrous eight for physicality
sarries ' experience also tells them clermont can be beaten
this time last year the sides met at the same stage and produced what many believed to be a seminal performance in sarries ' history as vern cotter 's men were crushed 46 - 6 at twickenham
there were warriors aplenty for the men in black that day as sarries powered into their first european cup final only to fall short against a jonny wilkinson - inspired toulon in the final maro itoje has been named to start at blindside flanker following a string of impressive performances on saturday , a similarly herculean effort will be required against a clermont side who have almost forgotten how to lose at their own stade marcel-michelin
' playing away from home has always galvanised us , ' said sarries battle - hardened centre brad barritt â captain in the absence of alistair hargreaves
' clermont have an array of attacking talent that can hurt sarries with wesley fofana to the fore few teams know each other better , with last year 's semi-final still fresh in the memory as well as two pool games this season which saw honours shared
' jacques burger ( centre ) was a standout performer in sarries ' 46 - 6 victory at twickenham last season saracens are able to call on linchpin no 8 billy vunipola , who starts in a back row alongside burger and itoje who , standing 6ft 5in and weighing 18st 2lb , epitomises the modern - day rugby player
with veteran fly - half charlie hodgson in the form of his life and owen farrell on the bench after recovering from the knee injury which kept him out of england 's six nations campaign , sarries are close to full strength
' against a clermont side capable of striking from anywhere on the field , sarries will need all those strings
