it seems to happen after every single world cup that someone near to the top of english cricket gets the sack
paul downton is just the latest victim
it is high time that we looked at the entire structure of english cricket and the reasons we are incapable of producing the types of cricketer required to succeed in international one - day cricket
paul downton has left his role as managing director of ecb peter moores ( from left to right ) , downton and ecb captain alastair cook during the press conference the system is broken and it desperately needs fixing if ecb are ever going to compete in limited - overs cricket again
from downton to coach peter moores , to selectors james whitaker and angus fraser , these are players from a different era who have been painfully slow to react to situations

english cricket needs to learn to embrace the maverick
