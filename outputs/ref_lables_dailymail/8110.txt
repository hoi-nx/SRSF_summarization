the london mayor , who has been largely invisible at a national level despite being the second best known tory in the country , will make a high - profile joint appearance with david cameron , sources said
there have been growing calls from conservative mps for mr boris johnson to be â weaponised â as the party seeks to break away from labour
high profile : boris johnson ( pictured at a gin distillery in london on friday ) will move centre stage in the tory election campaign next week while many polls indicate deadlock , one by survation for the daily mirror lifted tory spirits yesterday by putting their party up four points in a week and moving ahead of labour
it is only the second time the tory have been ahead with survation since the organisation began conducting national polling in 2011
last night lord bell , the advertising guru who masterminded margaret thatcher âs three election victories , was scathing about the tories â campaign , saying : â it âs dreadful
when he showed he can there was no plan b. â there have been growing calls from conservative mps for mr boris johnson to be â weaponised â as the party seeks to break away from labour there was surprise that mr boris johnson was not present at this week âs tory manifesto launch , with mr david cameron instead introduced by education secretary nicky morgan , home secretary theresa may and chancellor george osborne
internal polling suggests mr boris johnson is by far the most popular senior tory among ukip voters , who mr david cameron has pleaded with to â come home â to his party rather than risk a labour government propped up by the snp
other senior figures told the daily mail that david cameron must underline manifesto pledges aimed at working class voters â such as extending the right - to - buy and promising a tax - free minimum wage
boris johnson tried a 99 cornet ( left ) in west drayton yesterday and visited the al falah mosque ( right ) â we should be out selling some of the terrific stuff in the manifesto every day until polling day
â one senior tory donor said the campaign was â lacklustre â , â negative â , and â boring â
â the london mayor , who has been largely invisible at a national level despite being the second best known tory in the country , will make a high - profile joint appearance with david cameron , sources said some tories are also complaining that the collapse in party membership has decimated their ground operation in some constituencies and they are being outleafleted by labour â whose canvas operation has been swelled by thousand of trade unionists â by three to one
another said the mood was â tense â and there was â some dismay â that the manifesto launch had not given the party â lift - off â
â a tory adviser said : â we âve always known this would be an incredibly close election and that a large number of undecided voters will only decide who they want in downing street â david cameron or miliband â at the last minute
â you will be seeing more of boris johnson as we move towards the end of the campaign â that has always been the plan
