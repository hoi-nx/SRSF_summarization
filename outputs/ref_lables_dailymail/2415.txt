when the queen , then aged 86 , was filmed ' jumping out of a plane ' during the opening ceremony of the london 2012 olympics , no one was more surprised than her grandson , prince william
sense of humour : the queen proved her sense of humour remains undiminished with her james spoof active : the queen still rides regularly and is pictured out in windsor last week long - standing love : queen , pictured in 1968 and 1972 , has long adored all things equestrian but the queen is an expert when it comes to defying her advancing years and , along with maintaining a schedule that would leave people a third of her age exhausted , continues to enjoy herself much as she always has
although recent years have seen her cut down on the amount of time she spends in the saddle - the result of a niggling knee injury that also forced her to give up presiding over trooping the colour on horseback - the queen remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and , according to sources , is a familiar sight at her windsor stables
under the queen , the monarchy has also modernised and embraces the latest technology , including social media
her first post , an anodyne comment about the opening of an exhibition at the science museum , went viral - as did her first photo - bomb
photo - bomb ! this snap of the queen by australian hockey player jayde taylor rapidly went viral first selfie : 14 - year - old jack surgenor snaps a cheeky selfie with the queen during a visit in belfast first tweet : the queen sends her first official twitter message during a visit to the science museum beyond selfies and social media , the queen continues to make waves in the sartorial world with her trademark shift dresses and colourful coats , all of which are regularly referenced by the world 's top designers
even her launer london handbags are enjoying renewed popularity , with the brand regularly selling out colourful special edition versions of her favourite Â£ 1,075 traviata style
at home , her family are enjoying a period of relative peace and , as she celebrates her 89th birthday , the queen is about to become a great - grandmother for the fifth time
but for her majesty , who is spending today privately with her family at windsor castle , the imminent arrival is just one of a number of reasons to be pleased
still riding , still enjoying the races and still unafraid to surprise family and the public alike , the queen , nearly ninety , surely is the world 's coolest great - grandmother
happy family : her majesty is about to become a great - grandmother for the fifth time royal family : the queen pictured with her family and the middletons at prince george 's christening in 2013
