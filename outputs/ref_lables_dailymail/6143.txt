breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the uk
in 2011 , just under 50,000 women were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer
most women who get it ( 8 out of 10 ) are over 50 , but younger women , and in rare cases , men , can also get breast cancer
a person should see a gp if they notice any of the following symptoms : * an area of thickened tissue * nipple discharge , which may contain blood * a change in the size or shape of your breasts * dimpling on the skin of your breasts * a rash on or around your nipples * a change in your nipple 's appearance â for example , becoming sunken into your breast * persistent pain in your breasts or armpits * a lump or swelling in your armpits source : nhs choices rubbing the sore area , she felt a pea - sized lump and her husband tristan , 36 , urged her to visit her gp
mrs leza davies said : ' i was only 30 and did n't think it would be anything to worry about
while breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the uk , 8 out of ten women who get it are over 50 years old
mrs leza davies describes the pure terror of being given such a diagnosis
' that july , she began six months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy , but the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes surrounding her breast
she then had an operation to remove five lymph nodes containing cancerous cells , and afterwards doctors were confident she was in remission
she explained : ' afterwards , they told me they 'd got all the cancer but that i would n't have anymore children as a result of the treatment
' all thanks to my boob job
' mrs leza davies only went to her gp about the lump she had found because husband tristan , 36 ( pictured here with her on their wedding day ) begged her to go mrs leza davies says her implants saved her life and will allow her to see her children , including her youngest baby araya ( pictured ) grow up
it was less than a centimetre in size , so if i had n't knocked my breast , i would never have felt it
' i thought breast cancer was something that affected older women
