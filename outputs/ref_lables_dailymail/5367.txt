rare and valuable pieces of meteorite have fallen to earth from a gigantic fireball that lit up the skies over uk and ireland , experts say
the fireball was captured on camera on sunday by the uk meteor observing network ( ukmon ) in portadown , county armagh
david moore from astronomy ireland told the mirror : ' this event was so bright that a piece or pieces may have survived the re-entry and landed as extremely rare and valuable meteorites
' however , the group 's initial analysis of its trajectory , based on the 50 sightings that were reported to it , suggests that it may well have fallen into the irish sea
' it added that the meteorite was burning at a very low altitude of 21 miles , compared to the usual 50 to 75 miles and was formed of ' very hard and dense material compared to soft cometary material which we normally see as meteor showers '
the network is appealing for members of the public to report eyewitness accounts of the event
it comes after astronomers revealed that they believe a meteor triggered the conversion of biblical figure paul , one of the most influential figures in early christianity , experts believe the bright light in the sky that blinded him for three days match accounts of the fireball that streaked across the sky above chelyabinsk in russian in 2013
