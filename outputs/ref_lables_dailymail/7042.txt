this is the shocking moment a labour candidate collapsed seconds before he was due to take part in a live tv debate
darren jones , who is standing for bristol , was seen stepping away from his podium after complaining of pins and needles in his legs
the labour candidate started swaying on his feet in front of worried audience members before collapsing in front of presenter ellie pitt and his opponents on made in bristol 's programme , decision made
darren jones was seen stepping away from his podium in front of his worried - looking opponents just seconds before the programme was due to go on air the 28 - year - old approached presenter ellie pitt , taking off his glasses before collapsing in front of the studio audience seconds before they were due to go on air the channel was forced to cut to commercials as the 28 - year - old recovered on the studio floor
once back on his feet mr darren jones was escorted out of the building leaving other local candidates - ukip 's michael frost , liberal democrat clare campion-smith and conservative charlotte leslie - to take part in the debate without him
clearly this was unwise ! ' audience members rushed to help the labour candidate after he fell at their feet just seconds before going on air after coming to , mr darren jones sat on the studio floor with his debate notes still on the podium next to his opponents ' i 'm just disappointed that voters in bristol did n't get the labour representation they deserved but i look forward to the opportunity of representing them in parliament as the next labour mp for bristol in a few weeks time ( fingers crossed )
