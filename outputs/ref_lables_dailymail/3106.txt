duncan smith has launched a scathing attack on labour 's ' politics of hate and envy ' and claimed the conservatives are ' the real party of work '
the work and pensions secretary said ed miliband was standing on ' the most left - wing platform since michael foot ' and was ' peddling lies ' about the government 's record
in an interview with the daily mail , the former conservatives leader set out a powerful moral case for the party 's policies , which have reduced welfare dependency and got two million more into work
right , labour leader ed miliband ' labour does n't understand work
they do n't understand the importance of work in a cultural , social and health sense , ' he said
they hate people who get up early in the morning and work to get a business off the ground , they hate people who take risks , hate people that earn money , hate people that create jobs
it 's alive and well
it 's the politics of fear
' mr duncan smith called on fellow tories to ' bang the drum ' in the next fortnight to champion the government 's achievements â and persuade voters that british 's best days lie ahead if it sticks to its current economic course
hailing the ' staggering ' increase in employment , now at a record high , he insisted : ' there are more disabled people in work than under labour , the proportion of people in social housing who have a job is higher than it has been since records began
' all these people that have gone back into work are lives saved in my book
success : the work and pensions secretary hailed the ' staggering ' increase in employment , now at a record high
above , prime minister david cameron on the campaign trail in horstforth , yorkshire today ' everything i have done â the cap on benefits , the work experience for young kids , changes to sickness benefits â we really do care about people
' labour thinks welfare and work are two sides of the same coin
' the work and pensions secretary said labour had made a ' staggering misjudgement ' when it claimed the government 's austerity measures would put one million people out of work
in fact there are two million more in work , ' he said
' we know ed miliband and ed balls were party to the government that misjudged the public finances so dramatically , despite all the warnings that we were running a deficit that was too high
they have learned nothing - absolutely nothing - since the financial crisis
' that 's why every labour government leaves office with unemployment higher than when they came into power
the government can set the conditions by which businesses can thrive : lower taxes , less regulation , give entrepreneurs a reason to stay in the british and create jobs here
defence : the former conservatives leader , pictured on good morning britain last week , set out a powerful moral case for the party 's policies , which have reduced welfare dependency and got two million more into work ' what labour does is start to force up taxes , spend far too much , lose control of the public finances
' he said labour was also seeking to mislead voters about the future of the nhs , though they have not matched the tories ' pledge to give it Â£ 8billion a year in extra funding
the work and pensions secretary warned that a labour government ' would be a prisoner to two groups - not just the snp , but also their own backbenchers '
mr duncan smith warned labour would halt his programme to replace all out - of - work benefits and tax credits with a new universal credit , which ensures it always pays more to take a job or more hours than remain on benefits
