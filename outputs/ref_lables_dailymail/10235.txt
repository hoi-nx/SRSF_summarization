lubitz appears to have researched suicide methods , cockpit door security and medical treatment before crashing the germanwings plane into the alps , killing all 150 people on board killer pilot lubitz researched suicide methods and cockpit door security before crashing his germanwings plane into the alps , it emerged last night
german prosecutors said an examination of a tablet computer found at his apartment revealed he had recently used internet search terms such as cockpit doors and their security , and suicide methods
the revelations came hours after it was reported that lubitz told doctors he was on sick leave rather than flying
it also emerged that the 27 - year - old was prescribed an anti-anxiety drug so strong doctors have to warn patients of the increased risk of suicide
medical experts say it can also increase the risk of self - harm at the start of treatment
investigators believe lubitz locked his captain out of the airbus a320 âs cockpit on march 24 and deliberately crashed the plane , killing all 150 people on board â possibly because of suicidal tendencies or fears he may lose his pilot âs licence
citing sources from the investigation , german newspaper bild reported that he sometimes lied to doctors that he was off work and wanted to get better so he could fly again
evidence : police carry a computer out of the house lubitz shared with his parents in montabaur , german , two days after the disaster
investigators have also found a tablet computer which revealed a search history from march 16 to march 23 that included medical treatment , suicide methods and cockpit door security team talk : alps gendarmes get ready to visit the crash site of the german airbus a320 as part of the search operation in seyne - les - alpes images showing the damaged black box data flight recorder , the second from the germanwings airbus a320 the second black box from the germanwings plane , seen during a press conference of the alps prosecutor in marseille , was found ' usable ' condition yesterday a member of the dog services of the french gendarmerie carries a dog as he prepares to visit the crash site the first black box voice recorder from the germanwings flight that was recovered last week and revealed lubitz deliberately crashed the plane
investigators have found mobile phones amid the wreckage but they are yet to be thoroughly examined lorazepam belongs to a class of drugs called benzodiazepines which treat a variety of conditions including anxiety , sleeping problems and other mental health disorders
worryingly , this can include an increased risk of suicide , particularly in the early stages of treatment
â doctors had recently found no sign that lubitz intended to hurt himself or others
but he was receiving treatment from neurologists and psychiatrists who had signed him off sick from work a number of times , including on the day of the crash
investigators continue to deny reports that mobile phone footage from on board the jet had emerged
they say they have found phones amid the wreckage but the devices have yet to be thoroughly examined
alps forensics experts confirmed yesterday they had identified dna strands from all 150 victims of the crash
rescue workers examine wreckage at the site of the germanwings airbus a320 crash in the alps alps lubitz exploited post- 9/11 safety mechanisms to carry out his murderous plan
he waited for his captain , patrick sondenheimer , to leave the flight deck and go to the toilet before commanding the airbus a320 to descend
once out of the cockpit , the door locked automatically
ironically , this auto - lock feature , which led to lubitz having sole control of the plane , was introduced as a way of improving flight safety in the wake of 9/11
access to the cockpit door on the germanwings airbus a320 ( like the one above ) can be disabled from inside the flight deck to prevent hijacking in normal flight , the door to the flight is closed and locked
