residents in the otherwise immaculate cobbled cul - de - sac in kensington , one of the city âs wealthiest areas , said the colourful redesign was driving them â mad â and likened mrs lisle-mainwaring , believed to be in her early 70s , to â a child throwing a tantrum â
today mailonline can reveal mrs lisle-mainwaring has also fallen out with the family of her late husband robert , who have accused her of failing to pass on cash and property worth millions after his death in 2007
robert lisle , her stepson , said her behaviour does not surprise him , having last had contact with her in 2012 when they continued to row over the inheritance he believes is due to him and the wider family
his wife sally claims mrs lisle-mainwaring 's life revolves around money , which has left her estranged from much of her family
ms lisle-mainwaring 's original name is understood to be patricia royde , who later changed her name to zipporah - the name of moses ' wife - because of ' vanity ' , her family claim
she is the daughter of a second world war hero pilot , flying officer george reicher royde , who was handed the distinguished flying cross in 1942 for helping fly a bomber back to uk from a european raid when the pilot was injured , saving the rest of the crew on board
but in 1943 he was shot down over belgium while heading to bomb germany factories and buried in the schoonselhof cemetery
in may 2013 mrs lisle-mainwaring helped unveiled a memorial at the crash site to remember her father 's life and the others lost
neighbours of a Â£ 15million townhouse in south end , kensington - one of the most exclusive areas of london - have branded the property an â eyesore â after it was painted with red and white stripes following objections to knock it down and replace it with a five - storey mansion memorial : in may 2013 mrs lisle-mainwaring , second from right , helped unveil a memorial at the crash site to remember her father 's life and the others lost when his raf plane was shot down in 1943 residents surrounding her stripy kensington townhouse told mailonline they are â horrendously unhappy â with the new exterior of the three - storey terraced home in south end , kensington , and likened it to a â beachside hut â
planning documents show mrs lisle-mainwaring wanted to replace the property with a five - storey â traditional mews - style â home , including a two - story basement complete with gym , media room and swimming pool with a double - height ceiling
residents now believe that mrs lisle-mainwaring , a property developer , ordered the garish paint job - which took place under the cover of darkness - as an act of revenge for the legal challenge
while mrs lisle-mainwaring âs solicitors refused to comment yesterday on the motives behind the dramatic paint job , there is little doubt that it has rubbed the objecting neighbours up the wrong way
' the woman who owns it put in a planning application to go down two floors but it was rejected and now we think she 's trying to do this so the council is forced to demolish it '
he said : â in terms of the paint job , i just think it âs really bizarre
â the owner of the Â£ 15million kensington townhouse was once involved in a high - profile legal challenge over another property dispute
zipporah lisle-mainwaring , along with her husband robert - who died in 2007 , four years into the marriage - , was the owner of yeoman 's row management limited which became embroiled in a legal battle with property developer mr cobbe
residents said they are â horrendously unhappy â with the new exterior of the three - storey terraced home in south end , kensington , which suddenly appeared after legal challenges thwarted a planning application to give the home a double basement to include a swimming pool the house ( pictured centre before the paint job which occurred in the last couple of weeks ) was bought by zipporah lisle-mainwaring several years ago and turned from office space into storage space
she now wants to turn it into a residential property measuring five - storeys ms lisle-mainwaring has submitted several planning applications but ultimately wishes to demolish the current property and rebuild it to take it from three - storeys to five - storeys with a double basement below ground
it will include four bedrooms , a gym , pool and media room the company would then sell mr cobbe the property for Â£ 12million upon the planning application being successful , and when the work was completed , he would have to give yeoman 's 50 per cent of the profits if the sale was in excess of Â£ 24million
if the planning application was not successful , mr cobbe would receive no payment
during the case , the chancery division and the court of appeal criticised mrs lisle-mainwaring âs conduct as â unconscionable â and â unpleasant â
mrs lisle-mainwaring was unavailable for comment today but her solicitor said her kensington home was not bought for Â£ 15million and would not be worth Â£ 25million if the two years of proposed work is completed
