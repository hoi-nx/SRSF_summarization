everyone is watching valencia âs 19 - year - old left back gaya with man city , arsenal and chelsea hoping to snatch him from under real madrid âs nose this summer
why are england clubs so keen ? his buy - out clause is currently set at Â£ 13.5m
gaya ( right ) in action for valencia during a la liga match with sevilla earlier this season reservations ? he flies forward very much in the style of jordi alba and bernat
but those two left - backs who came before him at valencia are in sides that allow them to play at times as auxiliary wingers â one at barca and the other for pep guardiola at bayern
gaya is an attack - minded left - back who likes to get forward at every opportunity and he is very effective going forward ? much like the aforementioned bernat and alba , and liverpool âs alberto moreno , he grew up playing as a winger before gradually been moved back to full - back
he also played as central striker before being moved wide and as an 11 - year - old whose idol was david villa , he scored 60 goals one season in valencia âs academy
spain already seem to be well - stocked at left - back so will he make it to the senior first team ? he has represented his country at every level since under - 16s and has tended to benefit every time bernat has moved up an age category , stepping into his place
gaya slides in on atletico madrid midfielder arda turan during last month 's match in real madrid does he want to leave valencia ? he has supported the club all his life
hour - long trips from his home in alicante to train with them since age 11 have helped ingrain that affection but there is a reason why he has still not signed a new deal that would increase that Â£ 13m buy - out clause
will he come to england ? valencia would rather do business with an england club than real madrid
but if the buy - out clause is met then there is little the club can do about deciding where the player goes
marcelo is first choice at the moment so how many games will he actually play ? a club like arsenal could come in and promise far more first - team football which might sway him but real madrid are favourites
gaya , pictured here at the 2013 under 20 world cup , has represented spain up to under 21 standard gaya ( left ) talks to team - mate federico vico during an under 19 international against germany real madrid bought danillo this week and now they want gaya
they want danillo and carvajal contesting the right back position next season , and gaya and marcelo the left - back spot
