for the first time the enstone - based marque are providing their test and reserve driver with a number of outings in friday 's first practice session ahead of grand prix weekends
jolyon palmer will drive in every friday practice session for lotus this season this year , however , lotus have decided jolyon palmer will get a shot , and not just as a driver doing all the donkey work too
every friday jolyon palmer will be behind the wheel - as was the case in china last week and again in bahrain this week - his run - plan will be similar to that of whoever he replaces
in china , jolyon palmer was only 0.6secs behind maldonado at the end of fp1 , a tremendous effort given it was jolyon palmer 's first major outing at an f1 event
if jolyon palmer can continue to push , or even on occasion better the times of maldonado and team - mate romain grosjean , doors may open
