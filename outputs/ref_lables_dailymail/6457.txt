a family was awarded the rights to 10 rare gold coins possibly worth $ 80 million or more on friday after a us appeals court overturned a jury verdict
us treasury officials insist the $ 20 double eagles were stolen from the mint in philadelphia before the 1933 series was melted down when the country went off the gold standard
they argued that langbord and her sons can not lawfully own the coins , which she said she found in a family bank deposit box in 2003
the government believed that switt stole the coins from a mint in 1933 langbord 's father , jeweler switt , had dealings with the mint in the 1930s and was twice investigated over his coin holdings
' langbord , who 's in her mid- 80s , worked in her father 's store on jeweler 's row for most of her life
nearly half a million of the coins were minted in 1933 , though almost all were melted and a surviving coin sold for $ 7.6million in 2002 the coins were never released to the public after president fdr switched the us off the gold standard they do not plan to comment on the ruling and have not decided whether the coins will be sold , berke said
the mint struck nearly a half - million of the double eagles in philadelphia in 1933 but never released them after president fdr abandoned the gold standard and prohibited using the gold coins as currency
the 1933 ' double eagles ' was dreamed up by president fdr âs distant cousin , theodore , who had commissioned the sculptor augustus saint-gaudens to re-design the $ 20 gold coin in the early 1900s
in industry speak , an ' eagle ' is $ 10 , hence the term ' double eagle ' for the $ 20 1933 examples
while prosecutors argued to jurors in 2011 that switt must have stolen the coins with help from a mint insider , berke said he could have traded his scrap gold for them
alison frankel , a journalist who wrote a history of the 1933 double eagles , told the new york times that berke had an ' amazing accomplishment ' by making the government prove that no coins could have possible gotten out of the mint legally
switt , who died in 1990 , admitted to the secret service in 1944 that he had possessed and sold a set of nine other double eagles , which were recovered and destroyed
the mint sent a pair of 1933 double eagles to the smithsonian institution for its us coin collection .
