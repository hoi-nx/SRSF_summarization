stone age man ate mushrooms as part of their diet , a study on ancient tooth plaque has revealed
anthropologists studying the remains of a prehistoric woman nicknamed the red lady of el mirã³n have found spores of several mushroom species embedded in her teeth
discovered in an elaborate grave in the el mirã³n cave in cantabria , spain , the remains are thought to belong to a 35 to 40 - year - old woman who was buried around 18,700 years ago
the images above show some of the microscopic fungal spores from grilled fungi ( left ) and bolete fungi ( right ) that the researchers found trapped inside the hardened dental plaque on the red lady of el mirã³n 's teeth the study now provides the oldest evidence yet that mushrooms were eaten by early humans and helps to shed new light on the mysterious red lady
the red lady 's remains were uncovered in 2010 during excavations of the el mirã³n cave in cantabria
researchers at the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , germany , found her teeth bore the remains of plant pollen , fungi and animals
they found microscopic evidence that the woman had been eating sponge capped , bolete mushrooms and gilled mushrooms from the agaric group
the researchers also found her teeth bore little signs of decay , suggesting she ate few carbohydrates
power , who led the research , said : ' these types of microremains show that the individuals at el mirã³n consumed a variety of plants from different environments , as well as other foods , including possibly bolete mushrooms
the red lady 's remains were first uncovered in 2010 during excavations of el mirã³n cave , which lies between santander and bilbao
this plant fragment was discovered in the hardened plaque on the teeth of the red lady of el mirã³n the red lady was discovered in the el mirã³n cave in 2000 at a site that has been excavated since 1996 haematite comes from the greek for ' blood ' and red ochre ( pictured ) is often used as a pigment , particularly in cave paintings but the red lady was found covered in the substance when her remains were discovered after discovering a range of individual bones , researchers from the university of new mexico led by lawrence straus , unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave
it is not known why the red lady was painted in this way , and the researchers are unsure whether her body or clothes were covered in the pigment
the entrance to the el mirã³n cave ( above ) is located in the mountainous region of eastern cantabria in spain the red lady was found in an elaborate grave ( pictured ) and is thought to have been buried 18,700 years ago anthropologists who have studied the red lady 's remains believe she was buried in a tightly bundled fetal position on her left side with her chest facing the cave wall and her back towards a large stone block the fact she was buried within in what appears to be living quarters has suggested she was instead a person of status or authority and was buried in such a way to oversee her subjects
there is some evidence that the people living in the cave at the time ate large amounts of meat from red deer and ibex but there are few signs of what role plants played in their diet
mr power and dr amanda henry , whose work is published in the journal of archaeological science , examined samples of the plaque from the red lady 's teeth in an attempt to learn more about her
the fly agaric ( above ) is one of the most easily recognised gill mushrooms which formed the red lady 's diet the researchers also found the remains of pollen from pine trees and spores from the fungi
writing in the journal , mr power and his colleagues said their findings had shed new light on prehistoric diet of the red lady
they said : ' the types of microremains show that the individuals at el mirã³n consumed a variety of plants , including seeds and underground storage organs , as well as other foods , including possibly bolete mushrooms
' the cave site of el mirã³n is in the rio asã³n valley of cantabria , spain
in addition to el mirã³n , magdalenian sites have been found from portugal in the west to as far east as poland
