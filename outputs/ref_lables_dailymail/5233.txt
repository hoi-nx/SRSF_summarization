the apple watch version one , with its much - hyped unbreakable sapphire screen and hundreds of apps , may not be all that it 's cracked up to be and has been labelled ' a waste of money ' by some of australia 's tech experts
with the wait almost over , release date for the whiz - bang time - piece is set down for april 24 , the price comparison website finder.com.au suggests , if you have n't already pre-ordered , you might be better off waiting until next year for the second generation apple watch
' if you want an apple watch battery that lasts longer than a day , better apps and gps , you might be better off waiting , ' said hutchison , finder 's money expert
if you âre going to spend between $ 499 and $ 24,000 on the first edition , you might end up being disappointed with its functionality in 11 months time
they all expect the second version to be a vast improvement , pointing to a long lasting battery life as the number one feature missing from the current apple watch
other key features which are absent , include an independent internet connection ( the watch relies on an iphone for data ) , gps and water - proofing was also an issue
from $ 499 right up to $ 24,000 the apple watch 1 has been in high demand but some tech heads say version two might be worth waiting for she also estimated that apple watch version two would be released on or around march 18 , 2016
he also hoped there would be better gps capability , along with a ' thinner and faster device with a brighter screen ' chris stead , editor in chief , old mate media added : ' better battery life is a given as apple improve its tech efficiency
