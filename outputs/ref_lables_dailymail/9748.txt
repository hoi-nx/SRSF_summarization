surgeons are calling for the rules on laser eye surgery to be strengthened after an apparent rise in patients receiving substandard care
a private hospital in harley street says that increasing numbers of people are seeking its help after being given bad advice or poor treatment elsewhere
a leading private eye hospital is calling for tighter regulations on laser eye surgery after noting a rise in the number of people who have been given inaccurate information or poor care
up to 120,000 britons have laser eye surgery each year to correct long and short - sightedness , and almost one in 20 of them suffer some sort of complication.most operations are done privately , with patients paying up to Â£ 5,000 to have both eyes corrected
regret : law graduate roberts law graduate roberts said that surgery to correct her short - sightedness left her in agony
she suffered from painfully dry eyes after she had the laser treatment , which was caused by damage to the nerves that stimulate tears
and in the years after the procedure , miss roberts said she had to apply eye drops every day to alleviate the pain , which in itself can bring on chronic eye inflammation
poor night - time vision can occur if part of the cornea has been lasered incorrectly
they say that despite the term â laser eye surgery â , the procedure does nât have to be done by a surgeon or even someone with specialist eye knowledge
dr khan , an eye surgeon at the london eye hospital , said the unit is treating more patients who have received unsatisfactory treatment elsewhere than five years ago
and other specialist clinics are seeing a similar rise
he said : â laser eye surgeons are , at present , only required to be registered as doctors ; no specialist qualifications are legally required to carry out a laser eye procedure
the london eye hospital in harley street said laser eye surgeons are presently only required to be registered as doctors - and no specialist qualifications are legally required â and with those who trained abroad , it âs even more difficult to establish levels of expertise in specific treatments
â we have seen a rising number of people arriving at the london eye hospital who have previously been given inaccurate information or poor care and we strongly believe that it is time for this industry to be taken to task
a spokesman said that while in theory the operation could be done by someone who is registered as a doctor but does not have further qualifications , the likelihood of this happening is â very , very negligible â
