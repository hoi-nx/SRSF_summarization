aeroplanes are infamous as breeding grounds for bacteria , with tray tables , seats and blankets singled out as the worst offenders on board
but an entrepreneurial team are hoping their new invention will revolutionise the cleaning of aircraft and help airlines win the battle against bacteria arthur and mo kreitenberg have created a robot , called the germfalcon , which uses ultra violet light to kill bacteria throughout the cabin
but the family team has developed the unusual new robot as a way to counter issues with cleaning the interior of a plane - which currently only takes place a few times a year
arthur and mo kreitenberg , from los angeles , said the 3.5billion people expected to fly this year risk falling ill due to poor plane hygiene
writing on their kickstarter page to raise money for their project , mo kreitenberg said : ' germs will survive on aeroplane surfaces sometimes for as long as seven days
mo kreitenberg added : ' the industry is growing aggressively
' we have created an efficient and practical way for airlines to sanitize the interiors of commercial planes between passenger loads
it also has uv-c lamps on its top and sides using uv-c light they have have proven a 99.99 per cent germ - kill rate in under 10 minutes with no damage or reaction from any cabin materials ' using uv - c light , we have proven a 99.99 per cent germ - kill rate in under 10 minutes with no damage or reaction from any cabin materials
the germfalcon is programmed to reach the most commonly touched passenger surfaces and kill all germs that are exposed to the robot 's sanitising lights
they are currently seeking sponsorship via kickstarter and are offering backers the chance to fly on the first completely clean flight .
