between the sugar - free devotees and the paleo health nuts sprouting advice in forums and on blogs , there are a lot of confusing messages surrounding what foods are best and most for nourishing children
in an exclusive interview with daily mail australia , uk children 's cookbook guru karmel has slammed pete evans ' controversial bone broth recipe in his book ' bubba yum yum - the paleo way ' , calling it dangerous , and said the paleo method goes against everything nutritionists and child health experts recommend
' babies need milk - it needs to be a formula or breast milk because it has the nutrients they need and bone broth will not give them what breast milk or formula does , ' karmel , 51 , said
bad for bubba : karmel says pete evan 's kids cook book goes against everything health experts would advise ' however , from two years old , provided they âre not underweight , they can have low - fat skim milk , but up until two they should have full fat milk , proper yoghurt and full fat everything
' ' so it 's really important babies have iron rich food , essential fatty acids and nutrient dense foods - which is basically the opposite of bone broth
' they need cheese because their tummies are so small and they need energy because they âre running around , so cheese , avocado and meat have a high calorie content and that âs really important , ' said karmel
fad foods : karmel says she does n't believe in fads and is against sugar free , paleo and low carb diets ' so basically ( the paleo diet ) goes against everything that nutritionists and experts in child health would advise and i do nât know where he gets his advice from but i would not advise it
' karmel crusade : karmel is out to revolutionise healthy meals for kids with the launch of a new frozen food range ' there âs sugar and then there is sugar
' obesity epidemic : karmel says aside from diabetes and tooth decay , obese children are also not happy instead , karmel believes balance is key
mothers are working longer hours than ever before and she believes while they all start with good intentions and want to feed their children well , children get hungry , wo n't wait and so mothers are worn down into giving unhealthy , time - poor food substitutes like chocolate , chicken nuggets , pizza etc. as a mother of three herself , karmel knows exactly the pressures facing new mums
beginning her career after the tragic death of her first born natasha , karmel became extremely passionate about making recipes that would nourish her children that followed , as well as helping other mother 's give their children food they would eat

and despite initially being rejected by 20 publishers , it went on to sell four million copies back in 1991 , making her a guru of children 's cookery
rags to riches : karmel 's first cook book ' complete baby and toddler meal planner ' was refused by 20 publishers before getting picked up now in a bid to help the seven million obese people currently across the nation , karmel has arrived in australia to promote her new healthy food range for children in the hopes to be a trail blazer , revolutionise the healthy meal scene for children and help mother 's for generations to come
