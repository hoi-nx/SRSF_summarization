england must decide whether to stick with the attack that failed to force a first test win or twist and freshen things up for a second match that is already upon them
the sight of liam plunkett and mark wood impressing in the nets here on sunday , and moeen ali bowling apparently without discomfort after joining the squad , was a reminder that england have options for the second test which starts on tuesday
liam plunkett , pictured with chris jordan , is pushing for a place in england 's attack for the second test mark wood ( pictured ) and liam plunkett impressed in the nets on sunday ahead of the second match of the series yet there is no doubting that they were missing an x-factor , with strike bowlers anderson and broad down on pace and england refusing to gamble on the inconsistent leg - spin of adil rashid
chris jordan was the fastest bowler in the first test , clocked at 91mph , and while it would be a huge surprise if england dropped either anderson or broad , there is a case for liam plunkett or the impressive mark wood to feature
â moeen ali has joined up with the england squad after missing the first test in antigua through injury moeen provides an option for the england selectors while jonathan trott appeared in good spirits on sunday if moeen convinces england he is fully fit after recovering from a side injury he will probably replace james tredwell , who took five wickets in the first test but is now nursing a shoulder injury
