alarmed by a rash of explosions and injuries caused when amateurs make hash oil , lawmakers in colorado and washington are considering spelling out what 's allowed when it comes to making the concentrated marijuana at home
the proposals came after an increase in home fires and blasts linked to homemade hash oil
in colorado , at least 30 people were injured last year in 32 butane explosions involving hash oil â nearly three times the number reported throughout 2013 , according to officials with the rocky mountain high intensity drug trafficking area , a state - federal enforcement program
washington 's legal marijuana law in 2012 did not permit the production of hash or even edibles at home ; it technically remains a felony even to use weed purchased at a state - licensed store to make brownies
people make hash oil at home for the same reasons they make beer , wine or booze â to save money , make it to personal taste , or as a hobby
the resulting product â called hash oil or shatter or wax in even more concentrated form â can be used in vaporizers or added to foods without the grassy taste raw pot imparts
washington lawmakers are proposing to allow limited home hash production , though butane or other explosive gases would be banned except for use by commercial producers
alarmed by a rash of explosions caused by amateur hash production , colorado and washington lawmakers are considering limits on making the marijuana concentrate at home ' we have a little problem here with people blowing themselves up , ' said washington sen. ann rivers , the republican sponsor of that state 's measure
' in colorado , where hash regulations vary by jurisdiction , a bill up for its first vote next week in a house committee would establish a similar ban on the use of explosive gases to make hash
' people who make it at home , they can do so with alcohol or methods that are safe , ' said colorado state rep. willett , a sponsor of the bill
colorado 's largest jurisdiction , denver , banned some types of home hash production late last year
the state 's marijuana legalization measure specifically included concentrated marijuana and all its production methods
mannaioni challenged the legality of denver 's hash oil ban , prompting colorado 's former attorney general to say the marijuana amendment allows limits on home production
