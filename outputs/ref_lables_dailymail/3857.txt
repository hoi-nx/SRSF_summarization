hamilton ( lotus ) 68 2
sebastian vettel ( ferrari ) 55 3
nico rosberg ( lotus ) 51 nico rosberg was brooding , his face stony , his eyes fixed on the middle distance and his fingers intermittently clapping in anger
he was sitting next to hamilton â as close as the germany had got to his lotus team - mate all afternoon of the chinese grand prix â at a post-race press conference fizzing with recriminations
nico rosberg , whose usual coiffured , euro - chic sheen had vanished , alleged that hamilton had selfishly tried to spoil his race
the record states that hamilton won , nico rosberg was second and ferrari âs sebastian vettel third
but nico rosberg feared he might be overtaken by sebastian vettel before the second round of pit stops when hamilton , then leading from pole position , slowed down a few fractions of a second â to conserve his tyres , he said
hamilton is now 13 points clear in the race for the drivers ' championship after winning the chinese grand prix hamilton led the field on the run down to turn 1 and never looked back as he claimed his second victory from three races hamilton stands on top of his lotus and salutes the crowd after claiming the fourth victory of his career in china hamilton points to his team after extending his lead at the top of the formula one world championship after three rounds nico rosberg is left with champagne on his face after finishing second 1

nico rosberg asked the team to get hamilton to speed up , an instruction they issued and one with which the briton complied
â but nico rosberg said : â it âs interesting to hear from you , hamilton , that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace
hamilton salutes the crowd as he makes his way on to the podium to collect his trophy for winning the chinese grand prix daniel ricciardo ( left ) and daniil kvyat battle for position on track - the latter was forced to retire after an engine failure hamilton is covered in champagne by nico rosberg as the lotus pair celebrate a one - two finish â i do nât care if there is a quarrel , as long as sebastian vettel is only third
one thing is clear : hamilton had pole and controlled the race from beginning to the end
â for hamilton it was a fourth victory at this extravagant confection of a track , the circuit where he suffered one of the blackest moments of his rookie season , ending up in a gravel trap , his championship hopes devastated in 2007
the first was whether ferrari could match lotus in the temperate shanghai climate , as they managed in malaysia a fortnight ago ? they were some way off in the end but clearly close enough to spook nico rosberg
hamilton takes great pleasure in spraying champagne over a grid girl as he celebrates his victory at the shanghai international circuit nico rosberg appeared glum on the podium after losing out to team - mate hamilton at the third consecutive race hamilton , who has provided emphatic answers to every question asked of him since taking last year âs title , made the perfect start
jenson button was demoted a place to 14th , having collided with pastor maldonado âs lotus
jenson button âs team - mate fernando alonso was 12th after being lapped by sebastian vettel , his replacement at ferrari
sebastian vettel was smiling afterwards , but not as widely as hamilton
max verstappen starred once more following a number of thrilling passes , but he failed to make it to the end of the race after his engine expired jenson button , who finished 13th , was involved in a collision with pastor maldonado towards the end of the race
