two black candidates were among three people elected to the ferguson city council tuesday , tripling african-american representation in the st. louis suburb where poor race relations have been a focal point since the august shooting death of an 18 - year - old black by a white police officer
the election means that half of the six - member city council in ferguson , a town where two - thirds of the 21,000 residents are black , will now be african - american
this just over one month after the justice department released a report on the shocking culture of racism and abuse in the city
the lone black incumbent councilman , dwayne james , was not up for re-election
the town that drew only 12.3 percent of registered voters last april had 29.4 percent turnout tuesday , according to the st. louis county board of elections
that was about double the overall turnout in st. louis , where ferguson is located
unofficial results showed that wesley bell defeated another black candidate to win in the 3rd ward ; ella jones defeated another black candidate and two white candidates in the 1st ward ; and fletcher , a former mayor who is white , won a 2nd ward race against another white candidate
' this community came out in record numbers to make sure our voices were heard , ' said councilman - elect wesley bell
it was the first municipal election in ferguson since officer wilson fatally shot brown , who was black and unarmed , on aug. 9
but the federal department released a scathing report blasting the city for racial bias and profiling in the police department and a profit - driven municipal court system
several city officials resigned following the review , including the city manager , police chief and municipal judge
the new city council will be tasked with approving hiring of the replacements
wesley bell is a lawyer and a criminology professor who had to defend himself because of a third job - municipal judge in a neighboring town of velda city that , like ferguson , derives a large percentage of its budget from municipal court fines
