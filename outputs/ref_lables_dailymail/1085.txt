the size of sky â gamble in paying an astonishing Â£ 11millon a game to retain their premier league tv rights has led to the company having to re-address their entire sports strategy
and overlord francis addressed staff this week to present his way forward - â fit for the future â - with the station needing to make considerable changes to afford their gigantic football bill
this will see sky concentrate on their live rights in every sport while reducing the support programming and those leaving the network are not being automatically replaced
sky will pay Â£ 11millon a game to broadcast premier league football for three years starting in 2016 graeme souness , thierry henry and ed chamberlain on sky 's super sunday coverage of the premier league francis , who prefers to speak off the cuff , was using a prepared script on this important occasion and one department asked for a copy to show sky personnel who missed the meeting
but he declined to issue duplicates , telling his troops he did nât want your sports agenda columnist to get hold of the text - such is the paranoia in isleworth
sky claim the strategy talk - rather than plain cost cutting - was preparing the station for the varied demands of a multi-platform future where a thierry henry video on sky âs youtube channel can become more important than traditional programme making

england 's latest star harry kane was recently micro-managed by the fa to not speak in media mixed zones football agent mcgill continues his search for â peace of mind â by proving he was wrongly cut out of the Â£ 300,000 fee agency sem received for the gavin mccann transfer from aston villa to bolton eight years ago
