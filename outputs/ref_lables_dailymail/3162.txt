a little boy with autism has sent his toy bear on a round - the - world mission to help him raise awareness about the disability
in january 2013 , dorian poe , from burlington , ontario , sent his favorite toy out on the global adventure , having been inspired by the story of a cancer - stricken girl who , unable to live her own dreams of world travel , sent her teddy bear in her place
hoping to raise the same level of global awareness about his own condition , dorian poe decided to send his ganz webkinz bear , called tikko , out into the world , carrying with him a message of understanding and tolerance for those affected by autism
now , the bear has circled the globe and then some , continuing to share his vital message , while inviting the world to join in with his journey online
i was thrilled to support tikko because dorian poe had found a way to give back to our community ; a community that has been wonderful at supporting our fundraising efforts
i have autism , and so does my pet polar bear tikko
my polar bear wants to raise autism awareness
things you should look out for : to accompany tikko the autistic bear on his adventures , dorian poe included a letter explaining the characteristics and challenges involved in having autism â using the toy to help other people understand what the various aspects of the condition can feel like
each family who receivedtikko on his travels would take on the job of raising awareness in his or her community â helping to spread dorian poe âs message across the globe , while he remained at home in canada
' in january when tikko took his first trip to jamaica , i connected with another mom there whose child had autism , ' christine explains
' hearing such a story from so far away , christine began to research autism in the other countries tikko was visiting , and she shared what she learned on the campaign 's facebook page
at the gate : tikko made it to 24 countries in his first 10 months of traveling a towering success : the little bear has made it to some of the world 's most instantly - recognizable landmarks she keeps supporters informed with daily updates on tikko 's location on facebook and twitter , receives new tikko travel photos every day , and promotes the awareness campaign across autism networking sites
he 's posed at some of the world 's most famous landmarks , hobnobbed with a-list celebrities , and even scraped the skies in a daring aerial show , all the while broadcasting the important message splashed across his t - shirt : ' autism â¦ it âs okay to be different ! ' the campaign has affected children all over the world who have autism , not in the least the young boy who started it all
a message in motion : tikko spreads awareness with his motto : ' autism â¦ it âs okay to be different ! ' getting back to his roots : tikko has even made it as far as the north pole , which was a dream of owner dorian poe ' dorian poe feels a sense of purpose , ' says mom christine
tikko is one busy bear ! '
