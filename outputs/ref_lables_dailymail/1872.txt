blackpool chairman oyston took a surprising step in denying five fa charges for text messages during which he labelled a supporter a â retard â
his appeal is expected to be heard by a separate fa panel next month and oyston still faces a ban from football activities
blackpool chairman oyston has decided to contest his fa charge for allegedly abusive text messages oyston - who has been the constant target of fan protests over the course of the seasiders â worst season for decades - is also looking at a hefty fine and mandatory four - hour fa education course
the shocking text messages , seen by sportsmail , emerged just before christmas when he sent a series of vitriolic volleys to fan stephen smith , who he told to ' enjoy the rest of your special needs day out '
oyston later apologised for his part in the exchange , and it is understood his denial boils down to a reasonable expectation of privacy
on announcing oyston âs denial , an fa statement read : â it is alleged that the misconduct constituted five breaches of fa rules , and that during the text message exchange , mr oyston used abusive and / or insulting words towards a supporter of blackpool
â mr oyston has denied the charge
' oyston also joked with other fans that plans are afoot to see blackpool , a premier league side four years ago , spiral down to the conference , with another text reading : ' i am a never - ending nightmare revenge mission '
the content of the vile messages first emerged just before christmas and oyston came in for widespread condemnation
supporters have been protesting against the oystons before matches and then not attending the games blackpool âs off - field problems have become such a distraction that the club posted an article on their official site clarifying their stance on ongoing defamation cases , one involving a national newspaper
the rationale of this policy is to avoid the adverse reaction towards such charities that accept the donations , as was the case when the club donated the first settlement to a leading , vibrant and forward thinking charity in blackpool , fylde and wyre
