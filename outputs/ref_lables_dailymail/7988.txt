back - track or snap right back at him ? stress the good intentions and best wishes he feels towards falkirk , or defend his team against the insinuation that they âre a bunch of weak - willed tippy - tap merchants who ca nât defend crosses ? in the space of 10 minutes on monday , the hibernian boss did placatory â â i have a lot of respect for peter houston and what he âs done â â and followed it with accusatory , as in â i think you need to ask peter houston what he said when he came into my office after we got beat 1 - 0 in the first game ; it certainly was not what he said in the press ( on saturday )

â i wished falkirk all the best and good luck in the final but peter houston âs made his comments

we have a goal difference that is 27 better than falkirk âs
