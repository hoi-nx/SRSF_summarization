it marks the moment when the civilised world entered the dark ages and some of the most spectacular societies in the world disappeared
now one historian claims he has unraveled what may have lead to the downfall of egypt and other bronze age civilisations collapse
he claims they were hit by a ' perfect storm ' of disasters 3,200 years ago that left the ancient egyptians , the babylonians , minoans and mycenians unable to cope
the sphinx and pyramids at giza ( above ) hint at the power of ancient egyptians civilisation before it collapsed as each of these great societies were interconnected , the collapse of one also affected the others , creating a domino - like effect , claims professor eric cline , director of the capitol archaeological institute at george washington university
he claims that a series of droughts , famines , climate change , earthquakes , invasions and internal rebellions between 1225bc and 1177 bc happened in quick succession
egypt 's old kingdom - when most of the pyramids were built - collapsed more than 4,200 years ago because it failed to adapt to climate change , according to research
' professor eric cline sets out his arguments in his recent book ' 1177bc the year civilisation collapsed '
the claims the events that led up to the collapse of these civilisations marked a turning point in ancient history
the sea people , shown here fighting ancient egyptians forces , were widely blamed for the collapse of many of the great civilisations in the near east and mediterranean at the end of the bronze age 3,200 years ago the map above shows many of the suspected invasions made by the sea people around 1200 bc although the egyptians apparently managed to defeat them , the kingdom never recovered
the tomb of ramesses iii ( above ) in luxor , egypt , features a wall relief that shows battles with the sea people however professor eric cline says in his book that the sea people 's may have been unfairly blamed for causing the collapse of these great civilisations
professor eric cline says as each of the civilisations relied upon each other for trade , the misery of one was shared by others
ramesses iii 's reign was plagued by raids by seafaring people but also coincidence with a great drought he said : ' i would argue that the civilizations of the mediterranean and the ancient near east were so interconnected ... that when one collapsed , it affected the others , so that one by one they fell , like a chain of dominoes
' indeed professor eric cline warns that he can see parallels between the events that led to the downfall of those ancient societies and those occurring today
however eric cline even suggests that isis could be the modern day equivalent of the sea people , sparking mass migrations and destablising the lands they invade
