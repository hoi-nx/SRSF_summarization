suddenly , at the age of 34 and after 15 years of hoping for the exact opposite , i desperately wanted to get pregnant
my husband russell was ready to be a father , we were financially secure and after editing a weekly magazine in new york for four stressful years , i was ready to resign and focus on building a family
proud mum sarah ivens with her two children , william ( left ) and one - year - old matilda ( centre ) ' have i left it too late to have a baby ? â i âd wail impatiently to russell as month after month i âd clutch at my abdomen in pain as my period started , filled with a burgeoning dread that my body was failing us
during my pre-broody years i âd been bombarded with images of 40 - something celebrities , gloating about how easy it had been for them to conceive naturally and quickly
the truth , i was quickly discovering , lay somewhere in the middle of the heartbreak , guilt and misinformation women find themselves drowning in as they consider motherhood
happy family : after years of heartbreak , sarah ivens and russell have two children william , ( centre ) and matilda pregnancy expert zita west said : â i think in a way modern life has done women a disservice
â we âre told we can have it all , so women go on the pill while they are building their careers for many , many years , which masks any issues they may have such as polycystic ovary syndrome or endometriosis
sarah ivens and russell celebrate their wedding with a dream day in the cotswolds in 2009 expectant parents sarah ivens and husband russell prepare for their son william 's imminent arrival in 2011 ' what women need to do immediately is ask their mothers what age they went through the menopause : this is a key genetic factor in your own fertility , and your cycle starts to decline rapidly 10 years before you hit the menopause
â eventually , russ and i conceived - naturally - but at the 13 - week scan , the other horrific factor of late motherhood reared its ugly head
what had i expected ? preparing to be a new mum , sarah ivens poses at nine months pregnant with her son william , born in 2011 friends were as divided as the media when it came to declaring their true fertility stories
â i âll only be 37 when i âm done â and if i have to re-sit , i can delay pregnancy another year easily , â she tells me , perhaps naively
another friend got joyously pregnant with her first child on the eve of her 40th birthday
sarah ivens celebrates the joy of having her son , william in 2011 , after the grief of having to end her first pregnancy her husband â who was depressed at being made redundant â threatened to kill himself if she kept the baby
so she had an abortion , while he suddenly seemed to get better â better enough to leave her for a 20 - something woman he met in his new job a few months later
â other friends in their mid-to - late 30s are choosing to stick their heads in the sand
â if i get to 40 and i âm still single , i âll get just find a sperm donor , â is the flippant battle cry of many women i know
some friends get pregnant as soon as they decide to start trying , of course , and those ones frustrate me the most
there is nothing noble in my frustration ; i am despicably jealous â especially when these women do nât appreciate how lucky they are
' all these things cause free radical damage , which harms your long - term chances of conceiving
sarah ivens 's much longed - for son william , tenderly kisses his newborn baby sister matilda â modern women are all about not getting pregnant , then suddenly a switch flips in their head at a certain age and they think they should be able to conceive immediately
