tindall would n't have moved any quicker had he been surging towards the posts in a six nations clash at twickenham
in aintree 's crowded unsaddling area , the former england captain was making a beeline to the place marked with a big number ' 3 ' , with his wife , zara phillips , scampering in hot pursuit
tindall was beaming from ear - to - ear having just seen monbeg dude , the horse whom he owns with james simpson-daniel and nicky robinson , run his heart out and wanted to be in place for when the old warrior , who was sent off unconsidered at 40/1 , returned
former england rugby captain tindall and wife zara philipps at aintree ahead of the grand national tindall celebrates after watching his horse monbeg dude finish third in the grand national monbeg dude is now 10 and , according to his jockey treadwell , ' likes to do things at his own pace ' but his resolution is not in question and this was the latest wonderful day he had given his owners and trainer michael scudamore
while the exultant connections of winner many clouds were celebrating a few yards away , their joy was almost matched by the happiness of the monbeg dude team ; as michael scudamore shook his head in wonder , his father peter , the former champion jump jockey , dashed to engulf him in a bear hug
here was thumping evidence that no other race stirs the emotions quite like the crabbie 's grand national
the Â£ 88,400 was by far the biggest pot monbeg dude has collected in his 24 - race career but the reactions of tindal et al ( italicise ) showed this was about far more than money
' many clouds and aspell jump a fence on the way to winning the 2015 grand national at aintree treadwell 's contented look as he strolled to the owners and trainers tent a little while after said as much
he won the grand national in 2009 , when steering mon mome to a 100/1 success , but this was the first time he had ridden in the race since 2010 , when unseating at the 20th from nozic
aintree , even when you are defeated , is a place where dreams can come true .
