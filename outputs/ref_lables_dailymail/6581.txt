bergdahl was released in exchange for five taliban leaders held at guantanamo

cnn reported based on a defense department leak , that bergdahl told us army investigators he left his forward operating base in 2009 so he could report ' a breakdown in discipline and order ' to military higher - ups â not with desertion in mind
he said the claim broadcast by cnn is ' ridiculous , ' and that the us army 's decision to charge bergdahl with desertion is ' in direct conflict ' with any claim that he intended to be a whistle - blower
