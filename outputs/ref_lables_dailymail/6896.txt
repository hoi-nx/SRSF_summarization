even after offering so little on the pitch , harry kane still served a useful purpose for his manager on sunday
he drew the attention away from the cold reality of a disappointing display against burnley ; away from the fact that tottenham âs chances of now qualifying for the champions league appear extremely remote
if there was a danger mauricio pochettino might have to endure some less than flattering headlines , harry kane at least offered an alternative
harry kane was captain for tottenham in the premier league match against burnley at turf moor tottenham striker harry kane became the youngest premier league player to be captain this season at the age of 21 years and 251 days tottenham went into the premier league match looking to get back into the race for champions league qualification after liverpool 's loss burnley ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : heaton 6 ; trippier 7 , duff 7 , shackell 7 , mee 6.5 ; george boyd 7.5 , jones 6.5 , arfield 6.5 , barnes 7 ; ings 6.5 , sam vokes 7 ( jutkiewicz 76 , 6 ) subs not used : gilks , keane , ward , kightly , sordell , ulvestad booked : trippier , mee goals : none manager : sean dyche 7 tottenham ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : vorm 6.5 , walker 6 ( ben davies 47 , 6 ) , chiriches 6 , eric dier 6 , rose 6.5 ; bentaleb 6 , ryan mason 6.5 ( andros townsend 83 ) ; chadli 6.5 ( lamela 64 , 6 ) , christian eriksen 7 , paulinho 5 ; harry kane 6 subs not used : friedel , dembele , stambouli , soldado booked : none goals : none manager : mauricio pochettino 6 mom : george boyd referee : m. atkinson 5 attendance : 18,829 how the premier league table looks harry kane 's heat map vs burnley
the last time he failed to hit a shot on target in the premier league was on december 6 against crystal palace
14 harry kane made just 14 passes , the joint lowest of any tottenham starter
56 % harry kane 's pass completion rate was the worst of any tottenham player except goalkeeper vorm
in fairness to mauricio pochettino , this would not have been in his thinking when he selected kane as captain for this contest and he was honest enough to admit afterwards that securing a top - four place would now be difficult
but the post-match autopsy was relatively painless because there was more interest in discussing the continuing rise of the 21 - year - old striker rather than the thoroughly unremarkable performance harry kane and his colleagues had just produced
seemingly miffed by the line of questioning , mauricio pochettino âs only explanation for why he made harry kane the youngest skipper in the premier league this season was brief and to the point
but mauricio pochettino did not stop there , accepting the invitation to gaze briefly into the future and imagine harry kane as club captain
the goal only 78 seconds into his england debut ; the fact that he is just one short of becoming the first tottenham striker since gary lineker to score 30 in a season
here at turf moor , though , the dream and the reality were not quite in tandem for once , harry kane enduring one of the more difficult afternoons he has experienced this season alongside team - mates unable to provide him with the service he requires
but tottenham played like a side that took one look at arsenal âs thumping defeat of liverpool on saturday and concluded that a place in the champions league was already beyond their reach
