an astonishing letter from the titanic 's owners to the family of a dead officer asking for a huge sum of money to return his dead body to england has been uncovered 103 years on from the tragedy
the letter , dated may 7 , 1912 , was sent from white star to christopher , the brother of 24 - year - old officer james moody , who died after the titanic hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage
in it , company bosses demand Â£ 20 - the equivalent of Â£ 2,000 in today 's money - to return his body to england , and state that christopher will have to pick up the tab from there
' should you after further consideration desire the remains of your brother to be returned will you kindly telegraph us in the morning at the same time sending us a deposit of Â£ 20 for any expenses and land charges on the other side and we will at once cable new york asking then to arrange this if practicable
serving as the vessel 's sixth junior officer , he set sail on her maiden voyage from southampton to new york on april 14 , 1912 , along with 2,224 passengers and crew
the man replied : ' iceberg , right ahead ! ' after the collision , james moody was seen on deck all night , helping passengers into the lifeboats , and declining to go himself , despite all his junior officer colleagues escaping
' instead , the company suggests that mr james moody 's remains be buried in halifax with the other survivors , but they offer to send his family ' a photograph of the tombstone ' , if they want one
even more shocking is the fact that mr james moody 's body had not been recovered by the time the letter was sent , and bosses would have known that , as all remains were cataloged
the remains of mr james moody , who was on watch when the ship struck the iceberg and later helped passengers into the lifeboats while declining a space for himself , have never been found
mr james moody was among the 1,500 passengers and crew to die aboard the titanic when it sank in the north north atlantic ocean on april 14 1912 , two days into her maiden voyage
he had been serving as the titanic 's sixth officer , and was the only junior officer to perish after staying behind to help evacuate the passengers after the other officers left
he was originally stationed on the oceanic , the titanic 's sister ship , but transferred just months before the disaster in 1912
mr james moody ( front left ) , 24 , was the titanic 's sixth officer , and the only junior officer to die on board while helping passengers into the lifeboats , long after his colleagues had abandoned ship the titanic ( pictured ) , sank on april 14 , 1912 , on her maiden voyage from southampton to new york , after colliding with an iceberg in the northern north atlantic ocean andrew aldridge , from the auctioneers , said : ' white star line is asking for Â£ 20 , which was a colossal amount of money in 1912 , for the return of the body of one of their own officers
' the mere concept of requiring payment for the return of the body of anyone who died on titanic - let alone one of the ship 's officers - is just beyond comprehension
' what 's more , the Â£ 20 white star were asking for did not cover getting the body home or to the undertakers once it arrived in england
' but where this letter is most shocking is the fact that james moody 's body had not been - and never was - recovered in the aftermath
' the implications are huge - how many families of the deceased did white star ask for payment from ? ' james moody was an incredibly brave man , helping to get passengers into liferafts and choosing to stay with the ship until the bitter end
on 14 april 1912 , four days into the crossing she hit an iceberg at 11:40pm ship 's time
