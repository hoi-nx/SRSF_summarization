the new youtube mobile app targets young children with unfair and deceptive advertising and should be investigated , a group of consumer advocates told the federal trade commission in a letter tuesday
google introduced the app in february as a ' safer ' place for kids to explore videos because it was restricted to ' family - focused content
' but the consumer activists say the app is so stuffed with advertisements and product placements that it 's hard to tell the difference between entertainment and commercials
national geographic ; reading rainbow ; and thomas the tank engine leave the world of sodor for the first time in 70 years to travel the globe
one example is a 7 - minute video of disney 's ' frozen ' characters who appear as dolls inside a toy mcdonald 's , eating ice cream and drinking sprite
' while we are always open to feedback on ways to improve the app , we were not contacted directly by the signers of this letter and strongly disagree with their contentions , including the suggestion that no free , ad - supported experience for kids will ever be acceptable
' but when searching for elmo or barney , it 's easy to pull up other user - generated content aimed at adults , such as the two puppets cursing or waving guns
' now , parents can rest a little easier knowing that videos in the youtube app are narrowed down to content appropriate for kids , ' wrote shimrit ben-yair , the app 's product manager , in a february blog post
according to the consumer groups ' letter , the videos mingle commercial and entertainment content in ways that would n't be allowed on television
mailonline has learned the app will launch with content from jim henson tv , dreamworks , national geographic , and a handful of popular youtubers and new series , such as thomas the tank engine
' for example , right now , i spend a lot of time on youtube with my 3 - year - old son , who loves watching videos of car washes , super simple songs , and about the universe
' today , we 're introducing the youtube app , the first google product built from the ground up with little ones in mind
' the app makes it safer and easier for children to find videos on topics they want to explore , and is available for free on google play and the app store in the u.s. ' the app includes a timer to limit kids ' screen time , sound settings to turn off background music and sound effects , and search settings to limit your children to just the pre-selected videos available on the home screen
ben-yair , the project 's group product manager , told usa today that the site has seen a 50 per cent increase in viewing time year - on - year , but that the growth has been around 200 per cent for family entertainment channels

' the news that youtube plans to launch a kid - friendly video app will be welcomed by security savvy parents , ' said david emm , principal security researcher , kaspersky lab. ' our research shows that children can be as little as three click away from inappropriate or adult content on the video platform
' examining youtube 's ' suggested ' videos which sit visibly alongside clips or episodes of popular children 's television programmes such as peppa pig , rastamouse and dora the explorer , our researchers have found that , on average , users are just three clicks away from content better suited to a more mature audience
' the child - focused app will in part compete with netflix 's kids service and vine 's child - friendly app showing age - appropriate video clips
google recently acquired launchpad toys , which is behind the ipad app toontastic , and has previously announced plans to make child - friendly versions of some of its products such as chrome and search , as well as youtube
