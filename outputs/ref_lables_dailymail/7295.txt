former captain of the fictional star trek enterprise , shatner has proposed a radical method to solve california âs ongoing drought disaster
he is planning to run a kickstarter campaign and is hoping to raise $ 30 billion ( Â£ 20 billion ) to build a pipeline from seattle to bring water to the state
but the proposal to build a pipeline hundreds of miles long has been declared ' highly illogical ' by some experts
he wants to build a 4ft - wide pipeline from seattle down to california to transport water and solve the state 's ongoing drought problem he revealed the crowdfunding campaign in an interview with david pogue from yahoo news
mr shatner likened his project to a similar pipeline in alaska - with , in this case , the pipeline running from seattle to california down the i - 5 highway
he said seattle was â a place where there âs a lot of water â - although its state , washington state , is also experiencing a major drought
without going into specifics , mr shatner added he would need a â large , four - foot pipeline â above ground to keep enough water flowing
if he does nât get the funding he requires , mr shatner says he will give the money he raises to a politician
however , kickstarter does nât allow campaigners to keep any money if they do nât reach their target , so mr shatner may need to use a site such as indiegogo instead , which does
on twitter , mr shatner responded to some of these comments by posting : â i know i need experts and @ algore and @ elonmusk should be asked to weigh in and join the conversation , â he said
