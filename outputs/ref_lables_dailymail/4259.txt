scientists may have captured the song of a new species of whale living in the antarctic
the song ca nât be identified and does nât fit the pattern of noise generated by the few known species of beaked whale , raising hopes that it could be coming from a completely new species
experts are sure the noise is nât made by arnoux 's beaked whales or cuvier 's beaked whales ( stock image ) , because the signal does nât match there are 22 species of beaked whale and all of them are elusive deep divers , meaning that they are most often identified by their songs , which they use to navigate
â given that new species of beaked whale are still being discovered , the source of these antarctic signals might be a species that has yet to be identified , â the study says
but the song belong to a strap - toothed whale , a southern bottlenosed whale or a gray âs beaked whale ( pictured ) , according to the study , despite the sound being the wrong frequency for a gray âs beaked whale whale sounds are used by whales for different kinds of communication
experts are sure the noise is nât made by arnoux 's beaked whales or cuvier 's beaked whales , because the signal does nât match their songs
but it could belong to a strap - toothed whale , a southern bottlenosed whale or a gray âs beaked whale , according to the study , published in the journal of marine mammal science
it is very rare for strap - toothed wakes to be sighted as far south as the noises have been heard , while the noise is the wrong frequency for a gray âs beaked whale , leaving the southern bottlenosed whale as the most likely match
but again there âs a problem , because the whale âs relative , the northern bottlenose whale , makes very different calls , leading experts to think that the southern species probably vocalises in a similar way â unlike the antarctic bw29 signal
because frequency is usually linked to a whale âs size , there is a theory that the antarctic bw29 song may be made by a southern bottlenose whale , while the higher pitched antarctic bw37 song could be made by a smaller gray âs beaked whale
