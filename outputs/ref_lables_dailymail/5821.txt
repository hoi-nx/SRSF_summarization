the painstaking effort put into pre-match choreographies of both inter 's curva nord and milan 's curva sud emphasised that this was no ordinary derby
a wayward pass from former cardiff man gary medel after just 51 seconds set the tone , his searching long ball falling straight into the hands of milan keeper diego lopez , with umpteen other options on
there were glimmers of the potential roberto mancini 's inter possess
hernanes almost lit up the occasion with a wicked left - footed shot that had to be beaten away by diego lopez as it threatened his top corner
jesus ' momentary blip saw him almost turn menez 's cross into his own net , while diego lopez was almost caught on the ball by mauro icardi
milan 's chances were few , suso providing handanovic with his first action of the game after 20 minutes , a routine stop from a stinging shot after the liverpool loanee cut in from the right
at the other end inter 's front two of palacio and mauro icardi huffed and puffed , but to no avail
both under - pressure managers , filippo inzaghi ( left ) and roberto mancini , gesticulate as their sides struggle to find a way through despite the disappointing seasons both sides are experiencing , the atmosphere was electric in the san siro as expected though , there was no lack of enthusiasm on the pitch
jesus continued to prove a source to be exploited for milan , his lack of concentration allowing suso to nip in and start another foray into the inter area , this time handanovic dealt with menez 's low cross
