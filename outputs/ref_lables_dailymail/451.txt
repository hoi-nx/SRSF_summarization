self - styled ' anarchist libertarian ' squatters have set up camp in one of london 's most historic monuments and unfurled banners reading ' homes for all '
the protesters mounted admiralty arch , which joins trafalgar square with the mall , and called for others to join them
it is not clear what their protest is attempting to highlight , as a garbled message posted on facebook by the group simply calls for ' christmas lights ... any and all radical / revolutionary messages '
but banners bearing messages such as ' better squat than let homes rot ' and ' respect existence or expect resistance ' were seen hanging from the grade - i listed building , as the masked demonstrators sat with their legs dangling over the side
the five protesters from anti fascist group ' autonomous nation of anarchist libertarians ( anal ) ' called for support in a message on their facebook page as police converged on the area
they posted : ' urgent shoutout for banners , christmas lights and anything else we can use to make the most of this massive canvas we have
they are believed to be the same group who took over the former offices of the institute of directors on mall in central london last month
the group said they got into the building overnight by climbing through an unlocked window
proclaiming that what they were doing was ' more punk rock than the sex pistols , ' one of the men , who only gave his name as ' fox ' said the group decided to take admiralty arch because it was a ' significant ' building a stone 's throw away from the buckingham palace
' a ' notice to vacate ' has been posted up the entrances to the landmark , however liam fox warned that if the group are evicted ' there may be some individuals that do resistance
