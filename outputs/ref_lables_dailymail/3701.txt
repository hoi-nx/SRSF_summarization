the football family has rallied round a blackpool pensioner sued by the karl family for alleged defamatory comments made on his facebook page
knight settled before court proceedings with the owners of the championship âs basement club , having to pay a staggering Â£ 20,000 in damages
supporters up and down the country have reacted to that by raising close to Â£ 15,000 in under three days â an act of defiance against the running of blackpool
blackpool fans vent their disgust at the oyston family , who own the club , last week supporters have been protesting against the oystons before matches and then not attending the games knight is a lifelong fan of the seasiders and was ordered to apologise for posting a disparaging status online this time last year
a fellow blackpool fan began a fundraising page on the website â go fund me â , which has attracted interest across britain
brand said : â blackpool fans ! what 's going on at your club ? how can i help ? # thingscanchange â riley tweeted : â one for the football family - petty and awful treatment of a tangerine oap fan by the owner , ridiculous stuff
â it looks likely that organiser atherton will reach his Â£ 20,000 target in the coming days
blackpool chairman karl speaks on his mobile phone during tuesday 's draw with reading owner owen oyston watches the match huddled under a blanket in the stands blackpool fan knight posted an apology on a supporters ' messageboard on thursday and atherton ca nât believe the way in which his fundraising has taken off
â when typing in the Â£ 20,000 " target " i sat back and thought " no chance , if we can get knight Â£ 5k or so i 'll be happy
