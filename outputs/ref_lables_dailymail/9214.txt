former pub landlord thorpe has had his conviction for illegally showing foreign footage of premier league games overturned after eight years a pub landlord convicted of showing premier league football matches on foreign tv channels has won an eight - year legal battle to clear his name
mr thorpe , 55 , was convicted of showing a premier league game without having an agreement with official broadcasters in november 2006 at the stoke inn in plymouth , devon
judge recorder nicolas gerasimidis has now upheld his appeal and overturned the conviction following a landmark european court ruling
but the landlord says the court action has seen him lose the stoke inn in plymouth which he used to run mr thorpe 's appeal was further delayed until another case involving media protection services ltd , the company which took him to court on behalf of the premier league , but which no longer does so
the premier league has since been taking landlords to civil courts for breaching copyright , with some ordered to pay up to Â£ 65,000 in costs
despite the decision , the premier league has insisted pubs still can not show foreign - tv footage of its games
since the european court decision , it is taking landlords to civil courts and suing them using copyright laws , which were not affected by the previous ruling
in 2012 , pub karen murphy landlady won a landmark legal battle to overturn her conviction for using foreign decoders instead of sky to show premier league football matches
the premier league took legal action against her mrs karen murphy and she was fined Â£ 8,000 for dishonest reception of a television reception in 2006
but a european court ruling said having an exclusive system of tv rights was contrary to eu law and the high court overturned her conviction
despite the ruling , the premier league can still take pub owners to civil courts over breach of copyright
