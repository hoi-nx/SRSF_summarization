when dulwich picture gallery began discussing the idea of introducing a fake painting to their collection , no - one could have imagined it would have led to the quadrupling of visitor numbers
but that is exactly what happened when jean-honorã© fragonard âs 18th - century work young woman was replaced by a hand - painted replica , produced in china and ordered over the internet for Â£ 70
it has hung in among 270 old master paintings since february 10 after a challenge was laid down to the public to ' spot the fake '

can they spot a replica by comparing it with the magical , beautiful originals we have ? ' the way to distinguish the real from the fake , mr bray said , was to look at the lack of warmth in the background canvas of the imposter and the modern pigment of acrylic paints
