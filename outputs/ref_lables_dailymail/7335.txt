tracey neville would say she has never lived in the shadow of her footballing brothers
at the peak of her career as an england netball player who won bronze medals at the commonwealth games and world cup , she earned just Â£ 742 a month
but there has been no shortage of ambition and no lack of personality
she is phil neville 's twin and i ask her which of them , back on january 21 , 1977 , emerged first
tracey neville , pictured at hotel football in manchester , is phil neville 's twin and sister to gary neville phil neville gives a team talk to her manchester thunder players during a match with surrey storm last year england coach and sky sports pundit gary neville poses with his sister tracey and her friends it might explain why it is tracey who has risen to the rank of national head coach first , taking england 's netball team to this summer 's world cup in australia while her brothers continue to combine coaching and broadcasting
gary neville has spent the past three years as assistant to england manager roy hodgson
tracey was parachuted into the top job on an interim basis last month and will select a squad of 12 for the tournament in august
winning it will be no easy task , even if england are ranked third in the world
they failed to win a medal in last year 's commonwealth games and poor results in a recent test series convinced netball chiefs to turn to 38 - year - old phil neville , who has performed impressively as the boss at manchester thunder
how england perform will impact on funding with up to Â£ 4million at stake
like gary neville and phil neville , she was first capped for her country at 19 , eventually making 81 international appearances before a knee injury forced her to retire â and she says her personality is probably a mixture of the brothers '
sportsmail 's chief sports reporter , matt lawton , interviews phil neville over breakfast at hotel football phil neville , who now works as pundit with bt sport and the bbc , takes a selfie with his twin sister phil neville celebrates with her manchester thunder team after clinching the superleague title in april last year ' i think we 're all natural leaders , ' she says as she tucks into a cooked breakfast at hotel football , which stands next to old trafford and counts her brothers and man united 's other ' class of 92 ' players among its main investors
' i 'd say i 'm quite intense , like gary neville
' so phil neville 's the nice one ? ' i think i am , ' she says , chuckling again
' i 'm probably not as intense as gary neville and i 'm not the mediator that philip is
i 'm probably the one who winds gary neville up , to be honest
' she says she was never dazzled by the success her brothers enjoyed at man united or by the fact that gary neville 's best mate was david beckham
and she claims never to have been the sister her brothers turned to for fashion or girlfriend advice
' and gary neville and clothes ? i do n't think they are ever in the same conversation really ( cue more laughter )
phil neville , who will manage england at the netball world cup , believes she is a natural leader like her brothers gary neville ( left ) leads wayne rooney , james milner and michael carrick ( l-r ) in england training phil neville represents england at the 1998 commonwealth games in kuala lumpur aged just 21 ' but we have an awesome dynamic
that did n't rub off because like gary neville and phil neville i was a defender
' because gary neville 's so busy i would see more of his family , his kids , than i do him
he would n't say he wants to be the next england manager because his focus will be on the job he 's doing at the moment
and when i told gary neville i 'd got this job , it was just a one - word text response
' before australia she will draw on the experience of both brothers
phil neville spent a season as assistant coach to david moyes at man united
given the opportunity she would also like to pick the brains of sir alex ferguson
phil neville would love to have a coffee with sir alex ferguson and pick his brains before the netball world cup phil neville spent last season on the coaching staff at man united , with 10 months under david moyes phil neville has worked in hospitality and earned a maths degree in bristol and sports science degree in chester ' if he would n't mind having a coffee with me i 'd love to do that , ' she says
' but i 've got 30 minutes booked in with gary neville
' the challenge is nevertheless significant , as australia and new zealand are the powerhouses in netball
' the england target is to get to the final but we 've never made a final before , ' she says
i 've always had such passion for england
