in the early 1970s , sir richard brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up his virgin recording business
and from then until the present day , the virgin logo â which has gone on to adorn trains , planes and a multitude of other businesses â has always been printed in the red of those humble chapel doors
sir richard converted the old chapel in shipton - on - cherwell , oxfordshire , into a home in the 1970s at the time he converted the property , richard had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel at south leigh in shipton - on - cherwell , oxfordshire
