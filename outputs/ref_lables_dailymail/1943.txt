the white house , sensing a legislative defeat was nigh , today said president obama would be willing to meet congress half way and sign legislation codifying its role in processing a nuclear deal with iran if a senate committee axed key portions of the bill during a formal review this afternoon
senators later voted 19 - 0 to give the white house some of , but not all of its asks , and left in a signature feature of the bill giving congress the authority to approve a final deal with iran that the white house earlier implied may have been on the chopping block
it now goes to the full senate , where it is could pass with a veto - proof majority of more than 66 lawmakers
the white house 's top vote counter on monday said lawmakers in the lower chamber would also take up the bill after their colleagues in the senate finished the voting process
senators voted 19 - 0 to give the white house some of , but not all of its asks , and left in a signature feature of the bill giving congress the authority to approve a final deal with iran that the white house earlier implied may have been on the chopping block the obama administration was in panic - mode this week , trying to strike a last - minute deal with legislators on both sides of the aisle that would satisfy its concerns with bill , which the white house had said as recently as yesterday that the president would ' absolutely ' veto as written
while the legislative branch was in recess administration officials called 130 members of congress to try to persuade them not to act until the political framework that iran agreed a week before firmed up
among the white house 's demands were that the senate foreign relations committee drop from the bill a requirement to for iran to certify that it has not backed terrorism against united states , cut down a 60 - day ' window for congress to look over a deal and ' clarify ' that it is the president 's ' decision to make ' whether or not to enter into an agreement with iran
' ' if we arrived at a place where the bill that is passed by the senate foreign relations committee with bipartisan support is essentially is a vote to vote later on congressional sanctions - not the decision about whether or not to enter into the agreement - that would certainly resolve some of the concerns we 've expressed about the authority that is exercised by the president of the united states to conduct foreign policy , ' white house spokesman earnest said
it is ' critical ' earnest said that the legislation that comes out of the senate is bipartisan so that ' there is n't an untoward effort to insert a different provision into some sort of must - pass piece of legislation that could really gum up the works here
earnest later indicated that the president 's signature would be predicated on senators watering the bill down to just a vote to later vote on congressional sanctions and the inclusion of language that would make clear the proper role of congressional oversight
senate foreign relations committee chairman sen. corker , the author of the bill , center , shakes hands with the committee 's ranking member sen. ben cardin after the committee unanimously passed the iran nuclear agreement review act of 2015 he later expressed concern that republican members , if given a vote on the final deal , would be ' willing to flush down the toilet the best bet that we have ' in favor of carrying out air raids on iran , as former united states ambassador bolton has suggested
' every 90 days , the administration would have to certify that iran is in compliance with the accord , and if there are violations , the executive branch would have 10 days to notify congress so it can reapply sanctions if necessary
the white house , sensing a legislative defeat was nigh , today said president obama would be willing to meet congress half way and sign legislation codifying its role in processing a nuclear deal with iran if a senate committee axed key portions of the bill during a formal review this afternoon
in the end , the committee decided to buck the white house pushing back on the administration 's suggestions that supporters of the senate legislation are warmongers , virginia democrat tim kaine , a key force in the bipartisan negotiations around the deal , characterized the claims as ' ridiculous ' and ' offensive ' during the committee meeting , ' i âm pro-diplomacy ... but i have also been strongly pro the need for congressional approval , ' he posited
' but as the body that imposed sanctions on iran , congress has a vitally important role in any process that seeks to modify them , ' he added
' the corker - menendez bill sets up a reasonable mechanism for congress to have a voice in the process that will help make any agreement with iran as strong as possible
