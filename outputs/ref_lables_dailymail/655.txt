sportsmail 's derek lawrenson gives his predictions ahead of the 79th masters at augusta on thursday
best american so many to choose from but given augusta âs predilection for a tale of redemption â from vijay â kiss my ass â singh to adam â this one âs for you , scott â let âs go for the reformed party animal dustin johnson
dustin johnson watches his tee shot during a practice round on the augusta course on wednesday best european ( non-uk ) not so many to choose from , alas
indeed , given henrik stenson spent a week in bed with flu recently and reckons his strength is still low , we âre almost empty - handed
henrik stenson has only recently recovered from flu but the swede will be hoping to mount a serious challenge best from the uk let âs leave out the history man on the grounds he has his own category
jason day has a great chance to become another australian winner at the masters best each way bet when you think last year âs joint runner - up jonas blixt is 150 - 1 , there are some tasty odds out there
how about padraig harrington at 80 - 1 ? or bernhard langer to finish in the top six at 400 - 1 ? my particular favourite is three - time masters champ phil mickelson at 25 - 1
phil mickelson watches his fairway shot on the 11th green during his practice round on wednesday how will rory do ? given what it would do for the sport and what an achievement it would represent , i fervently hope bubba watson is slipping a size 38 regular jacket on to rory mcilroy âs shoulders come sunday night
