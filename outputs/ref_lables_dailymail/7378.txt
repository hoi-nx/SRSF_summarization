ed miliband was accused of ' offensive ' behaviour ' touching on racism ' by a sikh community leader yesterday after banning journalists from a place of worship
the labour leader visited the gurdwara â a sikh temple â during a campaign tour of the midlands on wednesday
but his team banned national media journalists from the event â despite the fact that gurdwara are traditionally open to all
worshippers were also banned from using cameras and phones to take pictures of the labour leader , who had donned a red head - covering to comply with sikh customs
but even one of the sikh journalists was allegedly asked to leave labour 's battlebus after straying from a list of agreed questions
singh , an adviser to the sikh federation who attended the visit , said the attitude of the labour leader 's team went against the ethos of his faith
and he suspected the labour leader did not want to be widely pictured in a head - covering in case the pictures were embarrassing â something he said was ' offensive , even touching on racism '
they said there will be no cameras whatsoever , they were telling people not to even use their phones to take any pictures inside â that is unheard of inside a gurdwara
public visit : cameron at the golden temple in amritsar mr singh said he suspected mr ed miliband was trying to ingratiate himself with the sikh community but was ' worried about the reaction of non-sikhs ' if he was seen in the headgear at the leamington and gurdwara
' there 's a feeling that they wanted publicity within the sikh community , ' he added
' mr singh , whose organisation is urging politicians to sign up to a ten - point sikh manifesto , said it was disappointing that mr ed miliband had refused to pose for pictures or make a public statement about labour 's stance on sikh issues
he added : ' labour told the media it was a private visit , but that 's nonsense
only an official labour photographer was allowed inside , and pictures were not released to the national media
but mr ed miliband held a brief press briefing for three journalists from the sikh media on labour 's battlebus
a journalist from the sikh media asked mr ed miliband if his party would back an independent inquiry into the 1984 massacre at the golden temple in amritsar ( file picture used ) shalbinder singh malle , secretary of the leamington and gurdwara , which co-operated with labour over the visit , insisted worshippers were not offended by the event
' the row risks provoking cynicism about mr ed miliband 's motives
' the visit was widely covered by the national and sikh press and many worshippers took pictures inside with ed miliband
' to respect worshippers in the prayer hall , ed miliband gave press interviews , including with the sikh federation , outside the temple
