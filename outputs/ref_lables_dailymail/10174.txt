a giant supervoid 1.8 billion light - years across may be responsible for a mysterious â cold spot â in the universe
hawaii scientists say a supervoid may account for an anomaly in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) of the universe , shown bottom right
in 2004 astronomers first found the ' cold spot ' - a region 20 per cent less dense than elsewhere - and may now have an explanation for its formation the research , published in monthly notices of the royal astronomical society , was carried out by the institute for astronomy at the hawaii at manoa
the cold spot was first discovered by astronomers in 2004 when they were examining a map of the radiation left over from the big bang - the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) - made using esa 's planck telescope
a supervoid is not empty , but rather a region of space that has less matter than other parts of the universe
but as the universe is expanding , by the time the light gets to the centre , its route out has become â shallower â - or less dense
the supervoid is thought to be causing a ' less - dense ' region of the universe ( illustration of empty space shown )
at 1.8 billion light - years across it would be the biggest object ever found
but some ' exotic physics ' is also needed to explain what 's happening the huge unexpected cold spot region , shown , contains about 20 per cent less matter than other regions of the universe , and about 10,000 less galaxies
while other sparse regions have been discovered , nothing on this scale has been found before the original theory was that the cold spot originated from the big bang , and was a rare sign of ' exotic physics ' that our current models of the universe could not explain
previous attempts to find a void at the distance of the cold spot were unsuccessful , but this latest study suggests it is actually a foreground object , three billion light - years from earth
the findings by the researchers were made using nasa âs orbiting wise ( wise ) telescope ( artist 's illustration shown ) , which was launched on 14 december 2009 , and hawaii âs pan-starrs1 ( ps1 ) telescope on haleakala , maui however , the supervoid can only account for about half of the entire cold spot , suggesting there might still be some exotic physics at play
