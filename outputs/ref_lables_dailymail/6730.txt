north - it 's perhaps the fiercest argument between the people of england and this week we 've started a fresh debate based on football
we then sent the all - star teams to our friends at football manager , who have simulated the match
sanchez and harry kane were the heroes as the southern all-stars came out on top in our simulated clash between the premier league 's best players from the north and south
despite falling behind less than a minute into the game to a stunning finish from sergio aguero , who was supported up front by rooney , the southern xi were able to mount a fightback with a brace from sanchez either side of harry kane 's second - half goal
scroll down to watch a video of the simulated match sanchez of arsenal ( left ) starred in our simulated all - star game , while spurs striker harry kane ( right ) also scored in the match manchester city hotshot sergio aguero gave the northern combined xi the lead after less than a minute , but his team were still beaten the southern all-stars boasted harry kane up front while the northern side was led by sergio aguero and rooney the southern saw less of the ball and created fewer chances but were more clinical in front of goal than the northern all-stars , who twice hit the woodwork
their pressure was rewarded when sanchez linked up with harry kane and buried his shot from inside the area
the northern team were made to rue missed opportunities after creating three clear - cut chances to the south 's two but did n't convert them arsenal 's sanchez is the stand - out in football manager 's player ratings with 6.1 while martin skrtel was least effective for the north the northerners enjoyed marginally more possession than their rivals and won 13 corners but failed to kick on after sergio aguero 's opener the southern â manager rob draper will be delighted by his team 's smooth transitions from defence to attack , and their elaborate passing play in the middle of the park
it could well have been a different story , however , had joe bernstein 's northern side been able to convert their chances
