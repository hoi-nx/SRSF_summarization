now researchers in the us and italy say they have evidence that dna - like fragments may have come with ' instructions ' that guided their growth into complex life forms 4 billion years ago rna , which stands for ribonucleic acid , is a molecule made up of one or more nucleotides
the researchers believe these fragments used their innate self - evolving abilities to grow into repeated chemical chains long enough to evolve into primitive life
scientists believe that when life was in its early stages , rna played a leading role in creating complex organisms before dna and proteins were developed
the researchers found the self - assembly of dna fragments just a few nanometres in length have the ability to drive the formation of chemical bonds
these connect together short dna chains to form long ones , without the need for a separate biological process
the liquid crystal droplets act as ' micro-reactors ' where short dna can join together into long polymer chains to evolve into more complex life ' our observations are suggestive of what may have happened on the early earth when the first dna - like molecular fragments appeared , ' said cu-boulder physics professor clark , a study co-author
in the pre-rna world , the spontaneous self - assembly of fragments of nucleic acids â the building block of life - may have acted as a template for their chemical self - assembly
' the new findings show that in the presence of appropriate chemical conditions , the spontaneous self - assembly of small dna fragments into stacks of short duplexes greatly favours their binding into longer polymers , thereby providing a pre-rna route to the rna world , ' added professor clark .
