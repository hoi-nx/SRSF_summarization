over six months since he travelled to syria , hamza 's friend abu mariya remains a frustrated bachelor
like hamza , all his friends appear to be struggling with life as a bachelor , with several of them taking to social media to voice their annoyance at being unable to escape their lonely life in syria
one of hamza 's best friends , a belgian fighter known as al-belgiki , recently wrote : ' urgh another brother got married ... the pain ... lol i 'm happy for him but still ... the pain ... ' the hapless belgian wrote : ' but marriage for the mujahideen especially for us , who come from europe , is a big problem here ... there is no mujahiras
' ' whenever you are going to marry someone ... their ( sic ) is always that guy who 's better than you ... u stand no chance ... life reality ... ' hamza ( left ) wearing the traditional hat of the pashtuns , and a dark robe

abu mariya reportedly travelled to syria last october , along with a group of up to 10 british nationals

' another of hamza 's friends , abu ibrahim al-finlandi , was mocked on social media after revealed his devastation in discovering his dream jihadi bride had already got engaged
