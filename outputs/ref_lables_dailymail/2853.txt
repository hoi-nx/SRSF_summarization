burnley manager sean dyche has complete confidence that his side will beat relegation
the burnley are gearing up for the final eight games of their premier league survival battle reinvigorated after a warm - weather training camp
sean dyche 's squad - minus the four players on international duty - spent last week in spain preparing for a run - in that begins with sunday 's tricky visit of tottenham
sean dyche believes his burnley side are more than capable of avoiding the premier league drop they have a tough battle ahead but recent performances - not least last month 's defeat of champions manchester city - have given hope that a side rated as pre-season relegation favourites can escape the bottom three
danny ings man danny ings will need to be in top form to get the better of the tottenham defence ' it 's a different kind of challenge this time but we want the same outcome which is to win games and be in the premier league

the tottenham clash is followed by another tough task against arsenal but sean dyche has no doubt his side will push hard
we beat manchester city but we need more of that , and it 's not always good play but a bit of luck , a decision to go your way every now and then
' sean dyche has dismissed suggestions that his side , inexperienced at the top level , could start flagging as the heat intensifies in the coming weeks
