nobody is expected to win a majority when votes are cast on may 7 in what is being touted as the closest and most unpredictable race since the 1970s
prime minister david cameron , of the conservatives , narrowly topped the polls assessing who ' won ' the two - hour clash against six other parties in an unusual format for britain
crucially , 33 per cent of the 7.4 million viewers hailed david cameron as ' the most impressive ' on the subject of the economy , which lies at the heart of each party 's campaign
but pollsters refuse to predict whether it will be david cameron or the labour party 's miliband who takes the top job in an inevitable coalition after votes are cast
deputy prime minister nick clegg , leader of the liberal democrats , and nigel farage of the britain independence party completed the line - up
