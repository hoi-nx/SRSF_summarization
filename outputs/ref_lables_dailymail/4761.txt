arkansas hutchinson gov. hutchinson said wednesday that he wo n't sign a religious freedom bill that his state 's legislature sent to him on tuesday , citing influence from his politically liberal son
he is sending it back to lawmakers , he told reporters , for amendments that will bring it more in line with the 1993 federal religious freedom restoration act â which critics say better protected the rights of gays and lesbians
hutchinson said during his press conference that his son had in part convinced him not to sign the bill into law
' my son seth , signed the petition asking me , dad , the governor , to veto this bill , ' hutchinson said
' seth told daily mail online that ' i love and respect my father very much , but sometimes we have political disagreements , just as many families do
' most importantly , ' he told daily mail online , ' i hope that the groundswell of grassroots opposition to hb 1228 and other similar discriminatory bills around the country will energize more americans and help create a long - lasting drive for change in this country , on many issues
' his father told reporters hours earlier that the bill on his desk carved out too much new territory
' the bill that is on my desk at the present time does not mirror the federal law , ' hutchinson said
' it does n't mirror it in a couple of ways , particularly allowing the first amendment to be asserted in the private litigation between parties or reliance on the state law in those claims
' and i think , you know , governor hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry
' hutchinson did n't cite any pressure other than his son 's , however
' my responsibility is to speak out on my own convictions , ' gov. hutchinson said at the state capitol , ' and to do what i can as governor to make sure that this bill reflects the people of arkansas , protects those of religious conscience â but also minimizes the chance of discrimination in the workplace and in the public environment
' the unusual move â sending the legislation back without actually vetoing it â means hutchinson does n't risk a veto - override in the state legislature
' the kind of outcry that we saw in response to the indiana legislation being signed into law by governor mike pence is similar to the outcry that we saw in arkansas last night after the legislature passed that legislation
' we saw , you know , some pretty strong criticism including from some pretty prominent business leaders in the state of arkansas expressing some concern about the impact of that law , and that that law could justifiably â or could be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love
and i think , you know , governor hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry
' his concern that the bill went further than the 1993 law signed by then - president bill clinton was akin to complaints that critics raised this week in indiana , where a similar law took effect on monday
state - and federal - level commissions and law - enforcement agencies typically carry them forward
and indiana university law professor deborah widiss told the associated press on wednesday that religious freedom restoration act laws have not ' been a sort of blank check to discriminate
' let me make it clear , ' hutchinson said wednesday : ' this law under consideration does not extend discrimination
' this is a bill that in ordinary times would not be controversial , but these are not ordinary times , ' he said wednesday as americans watched his quick 180 - degree turn
hutchinson spoke to reporters outside his office at the state capitol in little rock on wednesday , saying that he wants a religious freedom law changed so it better reflects a federal law that took effect in 1993 dad - whisperer : seth hutchinson seems to have had an outsize influence on his famous dad as arkansas braced for the possibility that it would become the new religious - freedom ground zero , wal-mart , the state 's largest for - profit employer , had insisted that the new legislation was a bad idea
yet mcmillon , the company 's ceo , signed a statement saying that the state 's religious freedom restoration act ' threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold
flashpoint : rallies like this one in arkansas ould spread to the other 19 states where versions of the religious freedom restoration act are already on the books arkansas state rep. bob ballinger ( right ) sponsored the bill and was all smiles when it passed , but now his brainchild is in limbo ' we will fix this ' : indiana gov. mike pence told reporters on tuesday that he wants legislation on his desk by the end of the week to clarify that his state 's new religious freedom law does not allow discrimination wal-mart is n't the only big player that would have complained if hutchinson had signed the bill
