it is the disease the medical community refuses to accept , and most experts claim is just a mental illness
morgellons disease has been described by those who suffer from it as causing fatigue and memory loss , while also leading to large sores on the body which are constantly itching to the sensation of bugs or parasites crawling underneath the skin
' that person is joni mitchell , who claims to have suffered from morgellons for most of her life , and who has recently been hospitalized after she was found unconscious at her home
the cdc reports that the symptoms are very similar to those of mental illness , from the sensation of crawling and bugs and parasites to the concept of false beliefs
the cdc even conducted a study at one point , and found that most people who claim to suffer from the disease were likely just experiencing anxiety , depression or , in some cases , issues with substance abuse
the medical community believes morgellons is likely a mental illness and that sufferers are anxious , depressed or even suffering from substance abuse ( mitchell above in 1996 ) cindy casey holman , the director of the charles e. holman morgellons disease foundation and herself a registered nurse takes issue with this study
' some individuals have said that taking antibiotics cured them of morgellons , though some experts could bring that back to the idea of mental illness and claim it is simply a placebo effect
researchers and experts meanwhile do accept that morgellons exist , just not as an actual medical condition
