a nurse who faced surgery to treat breast cancer at the hospital where she worked discovered just days later that she 'd never had the disease
a mix - up at new cross hospital in wolverhampton meant staff confused the notes of three patients
as a result , elizabeth dawes was wrongly told in july 2013 that she had invasive grade three breast cancer following a biopsy

ms elizabeth dawes refused , but did undergo major surgery to remove a ' cancerous ' tumour from her right breast as well as lymph nodes from her armpit
elizabeth dawes , 39 , was told she had breast cancer in july 2013
but four days after the operation she was told staff had confused her medical notes with those of other patients , and she 'd never had cancer the mother - of - one was also told she would need a further procedure to correct ' deformities ' to her breasts caused by the first operation
, added : ' the doctor also told me i would need a bilateral breast lift to cosmetically improve the shape of my breasts , as otherwise , after having the cancer surgery i would be left deformed
