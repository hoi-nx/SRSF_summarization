after blair âs speech in his former constituency of sedgefield last week , the former pm made an appearance at a low - key private fundraising dinner for 15 labour target seats
but despite the fact that blair has a record of three general election victories , only one shadow cabinet minister , umunna , could be bothered to attend
during a dinner held in an indian banquet hall in morden , blair ( pictured last week in newton aycliffe , county durham ) name - checked ed miliband only once , devoting his speech instead to his own achievements the dashing shadow business secretary is being mentored by lord mandelson , the former blairite cabinet minister , who wants to see him as the next labour leader
the programme for the dinner , held in an indian banquet hall in less - than - glamorous morden high street , south london , was littered with errors and even misspelt umunna âs name
a clearly uncomfortable blair name - checked ed miliband only once , devoting his speech instead to his own achievements
last year he earned Â£ 303,000 in addition to his mp âs salary , mostly from Â£ 1,600 - an - hour appearances on iran âs press tv and russia today
huddled - down , risk - averse politicians from all the main parties have decided to treat us like credulous children
