these rusting ' ghost ' ships are the last remnants of what was once the united states ' ndrf , set to protect and serve in the hour of need
the ndrf was set up in the wake of the second world war , and at its peak in the 1950s , the fleet consisted of nearly 2,280 ships moored across the united states
at its height in 1950 , the ndrf consisted of 2,277 ships at eight anchorage sites : james river , virginia ; beaumont , texas ; suisun bay , california ; stony point , new york ; wilmington , north carolina ; mobile , alabama ; astoria , oregon ; and olympia , washington
reduced : out of the original eight anchorage sites , only three ; james river , virginia ; beaumont , texas and suisun bay , california remain pollution : the worst affected mooring side is suisun bay in california where less than 50 ships remain , slowly releasing toxins into the bay going , gone : at its peak , in 1952 , the suisun bay , california site had 340 ships anchored - today , less than 50 ships remain the federal maritime administration has pledged to dismantle the fleet at suisun bay , with 25 ships in the worst condition taken out within two years and the remainder to be scrapped by the end of 2017 the ndrf was established to serve as a reserve of mainly merchant vessels to be activated for national defense and national emergency purposes
the vessels can be activated within 20 days to four months , in order to provide shipping during national emergencies , either military or non-military , such as commercial shipping crises
throughout its first thirty years , the ndrf vessels were activated to help transporting coal and grains in times of shortage , and ships were brought in during the korean war , the 1961 berlin crisis and the vietnam war
since then , ships have been activated to support united states troops and transport cargo in the gulf war in 1990 and aided in several humanitarian disasters in the new millennium
