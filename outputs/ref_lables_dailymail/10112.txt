a robot has been ' arrested ' by swiss police after it bought a supply of illegal drugs on a hidden region of the internet known as the ' dark net '
the automated computer program was designed as an online shopping system that would spend up to $ 100 each week by randomly purchasing an item offered for sale on the deep web
the robot would then have its purchase mailed to a group of artists who then put the items in an exhibition in the town of st gallen , in north east swiss
the random darknet shopper purchased a number of items for sale on the deep web ( pictured ) including trainers , jeans , cigarettes , a set of masterkeys and a dvd case ( far left ) containing 10 ecstasy tablets the items it bought included a pair of nike trainers , counterfeit designer jeans , the scan of a hungarian passport and a set of uk fire brigade masterkeys
however , it seems the random darknet shopper crossed the line when it purchased 10 ecstasy tablets , which arrived in a vacuum packed bag hidden in a dvd case
the dark net is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media
just 0.26 per cent of the daily internet traffic from the uk accesses this hidden part of the internet
police seized the drugs , the computer and the rest of the items it had purchased
the computer and the empty bag the ecstasy came in have now been returned to the group behind the bot , ! mediengruppe bitnik , along with the other items it bought
this is a great day for the bot , for us and for freedom of art ! ' the random darknet shopper project was set up as an attempt to highlight some of the dilemmas that can be thrown up by dark net markets and anonymous internet use
the tablets , pictured above , were sent from germany inside a dvd case and a vacuum sealed foil bag they were delivered to the artists by mail and then put on display in an exhibition at the kunst halle in st gallen
the ecstasy tablets were found to contain 90mg of mdma and were destroyed by the swiss authorities it has become notorious as a place to buy illegal pornography , drugs and weapons
it was sent from germany to swiss and apparently crossed the border hidden in a dvd case without being intercepted by the authorities
however , the police raided the exhibition when it came to an end and seized the computer and its purchases on the grounds the drugs were an endangerment of third parties
