vaughan will become the most powerful man in english cricket if he is confirmed as paul downton âs successor at the helm of the national team
it emerged on thursday that the former england captain has already held talks with new ecb chief executive harrison and is in pole position to become the new director of cricket ahead of andrew strauss and alec stewart
yet vaughan will demand almost unprecedented responsibility if he is to head up the revolution that harrison and chairman - elect colin graves have begun with wednesday âs sacking of downton as managing director
vaughan has emerged as the favourite for the newly created role of director of england cricket vaughan was understood to be talking to the ecb about the role on thursday after emerging as the no1 choice the exact terms of the new position were discussed at thursday âs meeting of the ecb management board but if the director is to be vaughan then he will command overall responsibility for coaching and selection
on the day that both andrew strauss and alec stewart threw their hats into the ring for the new job , one source told sportsmail that vaughan âs appointment was already a done deal and that he could even be unveiled before monday âs first test in the west indies
alec stewart , who is also in the frame , stands at the kia oval ahead of a surrey team photo shoot on thursday vaughan and alec stewart both work in the media as cricket analysts and commentators ultimately the decision will be taken by harrison and particularly graves , who is close to vaughan and is clearly keen to implement huge and rapid change in the national team as he did at yorkshire
if vaughan becomes supremo then there may not even be the need for a head coach and , if the position does remain , it is impossible to envisage moores surviving even if england win their test series against west indies
there is no doubt that colin graves â and vaughan â would love yorkshire coach gillespie to succeed moores , but convincing the australian to throw in his lot with england will be challenging
alastair cook has often been a target of vaughan âs sometimes inconsistent criticisms and would be on borrowed time as england captain under him unless he scores big runs and wins lots of test matches quickly
one man who would greet vaughan âs succession more warmly than most would undoubtedly be kevin pietersen , who would be handed a clear route back into the england team by the appointment of the captain he got on best with
if kevin pietersen scores heavily for surrey and vaughan is at the helm of the england team then a comeback that appeared impossible just a few months ago after the publication of his bitter autobiography really would be on
andrew strauss is another former england captain who is being considered for the role paul downton lost his job as the ecb 's managing director of cricket andrew strauss is widely respected by the england team and management but would be far more comfortable in a suit with distance between him and the players rather than in a tracksuit at the heart of the dressing room
the apparent moving of the goalposts , with the business side of paul downton âs role now disappearing , would seem to favour vaughan over andrew strauss
these are clearly seismic times for english cricket with colin graves and harrison apparently dismantling everything created by ex-chairman giles clarke , who was confirmed in a new role as ecb president
the bottom line is , with national selector james whitaker in danger of becoming the next to follow paul downton out of the door , the whole senior structure of the england team could change before this year âs ashes
if the dominoes keep crashing down , vaughan could be at the helm of an england team this summer with gillespie as his coach , joe root as captain and kevin pietersen back in the team
