brelo 's attorney d'angelo conceded that his tactics could be called into question given that brelo exposed himself to danger when he stepped onto the hood of a beat - up chevy malibu to fire 15 rounds into the windshield of the suspects ' vehicle
but brelo and 12 officers who shot a total of 137 rounds into the car in november 2012 had ample reason to believe that timothy russell and malissa williams were shooting at them , he said
self defense ? brelo 's attorney opened the case insisting the 31 - year - old ( pictured today ) had reason to believe he was being shot at when he jumped on the car and shot dead timothy russell and melissa williams d'angelo said he was n't calling what brelo and the other officers did that night heroic
brelo , charged with voluntary manslaughter , is the only officer charged because prosecutors said he waited until after the initial salvo had ended to reload and discharge the last of the 49 rounds he fired that night
he faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted
assistant cuyahoga county prosecutor bell revealed that experts have concluded that another officer fired three rounds during brelo 's 15 - shot volley , something defense attorneys have argued in motions
bell said a medical examiner has concluded that brelo fired ' kill shots ' into timothy russell and malissa williams and that they were still alive when brelo fired from the top of a police cruiser and the trunk of the chevy malibu , striking malissa williams 11 times and timothy russell six times , when they were no longer a threat to anyone
