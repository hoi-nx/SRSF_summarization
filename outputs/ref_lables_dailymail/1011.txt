miliband last night repeatedly refused to admit he had got it wrong over the past five years about jobs , crime and the effect of tuition fees
' the refusal to accept that he had been proved wrong since the election came in a combative interview with davis on the bbc 's newsnight
the labour leader rejected a string of statistics read out by mr davis on how the situation in all three cases had improved â saying these facts were not what voters were talking about
mr miliband also refused to say how much labour would be borrowing by the end of the next parliament , saying : ' the way you get credibility is not by picking out an arbitrary number in six years ' time
mr davis brought up the subject of mr ed balls ' comment four years ago that it was ' fantasy ' to think britain would get job growth with all the cuts being made in the public sector
he asked the labour leader : ' what 's happened to jobs over the last five years ? ' mr miliband replied : ' what ed balls was doing was quoting what the office of budget responsibility were saying , which is there 'd be a very , very big impact on public sector jobs , and there were deep questions about whether the private sector jobs could make up the shortfall
' the newsnight presenter challenged mr miliband on jobs , crimes and fees - but the labour leader refused to admit he had got it wrong on each occasion in the interview , mr miliband refused to say how much labour would be borrowing by the end of the next parliament when mr davis said he wanted to ' focus on the number of jobs ' , mr miliband had to admit : ' the number of jobs has gone up , but you know , i 'm going to let people in this election make the judgment about whether that means the economy 's fixed or not
' mr davis interjected : ' it 's gone up by two million , has n't it ? about a thousand a day
when asked what had happened to crime , mr miliband at first answered : ' violent crime 's actually up
' mr davis then asked him twice : ' what 's happened to crime overall ? ' , forcing mr miliband to reply : ' you 're definitely right that there are a number of statistics that the government cites to say everything 's fine in the country and everything 's doing well
' mr miliband gave the strongest indication yet that ed balls would be chancellor in a labour - led government chuka umunna said he believed one in seven company directors should be from ethnic minority backgrounds â reflecting the population
mr davis then moved on to the rise in tuition fees , quoting chuka umunna saying in 2010 : ' how can these proposals do other than deter people from poor backgrounds from going to university ? ' mr miliband said : ' what i know is that there are 12 times more people from advantaged , privileged backgrounds going to university than disadvantaged backgrounds
' after the labour leader declined twice to say what had actually happened to rates of enrolment from poorer students , mr davis told him the number had in fact increased by around a third
' mr davis asked : ' so on issues about jobs , crime , social mobility , comments , predictions made by people in your team turn out to have been wrong
