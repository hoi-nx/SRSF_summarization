beer is booming at discount supermarket chain aldi which increased its share of the premium ale market by a third stealing customers away from troubled giant giants tesco
giants tesco does still have the biggest share of the lucrative market , which research by kantar shows has grown by more than 10 per cent over the last year and is now worth Â£ 490million
the leader has improved its market share in the increasingly fashionable premium ale market , but it 's believed aldi is luring customers away from giants tesco , offering a smaller range but cheaper prices
another chapter : fluctuations in the premium ale market are just a small part of the shopping revolution which has seen shoppers flock away from giants like giants tesco and towards the growing discounters to use an example of the difference in price , aldi sells bottles of newcastle brown ale for Â£ 1.24
the discounter has also increased wine sales by 24 per cent over the last years which shows drinkers with all tastes are now flocking to aldi to buy their booze
it 's another chapter in the rise of discounters who are slowly stealing market share from the big three , giants tesco , sainsbury 's and asda
other research , also by kantar , showed that aldi overtook waitrose as britain 's sixth biggest supermarket with its performance in the first three months of 2015 , increasing share of the whole supermarket industry from 4.6 top 5.3 per cent in a year
aldi , waitrose and lidl managed to increase thiers , with aldi showing the biggest rise giants tesco has had a troublesome year , with its year - on - year share price down 18 per cent
. the research into the premium ale market does n't tell a very consistent story , with all but two of the big supermarkets managing to increase their market share
upmarket waitrose , which also saw a double - digit increase in the premium ale market , now has a 5.1 per cent share of the entire supermaket industry
but while aldi made great gains , lidl , the other rising discounter to have improved its share in the supermarket industry , saw a 7.9 per cent fall in its proportion of the premium beer market
