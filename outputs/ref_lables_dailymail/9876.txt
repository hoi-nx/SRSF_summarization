rangers boss stuart mccall has delivered a sharp rebuke to david templeton after the winger criticised the training - ground methods deployed by the manager 's predecessors , mccoist and kenny
former hearts star david templeton claimed last week that stuart mccall had introduced a brand of coaching and tactical preparation which had been lacking under the previous management
but stuart mccall , who is busy transforming the club on the pitch after three successive wins in the scottish championship , was less than impressed by the player 's comments and hinted that they may have been motivated by the player 's lack of game time under mccoist and kenny
rangers winger david templeton spoke out about his former managers mccoist and kenny ' david templeton made an error , ' said the ex-rangers midfielder
' stuart mccall also had words of warning for skipper lee mcculloch , claiming his red card against hearts could cost him his place in the ibrox line - up
the light blues captain put his elbow into the face of hearts striker osman sow as the pair jumped for a high ball
stuart mccall , whose team clung on for a vital 2 - 1 win after playing 50 minutes a man down , had been happy with lee mcculloch 's displays until that point
he said : ' lee mcculloch made a poor decision
i understand why he did it but it was a blatant red card
lee mcculloch has been warned he could lose his place in the starting xi after being sent off against hearts ' since i 've been at the club he has done fine
but with 12 first - team players out of contract at the end of this season , stuart mccall has warned his squad they may have to wait for new deals
' the weekend victory over hearts moved rangers back into the box seat for the promotion play - offs
rangers boss stuart mccall has led his team to three consecutive victories in the scottish championship but that now leaves ex-motherwell boss stuart mccall facing the ' nightmare ' scenario that he could come up against his former fir park troops
motherwell 's 5 - 0 victory over basement boys st mirren has all but spared them from the automatic relegation spot but ian baraclough 's team could yet be made to scrap for their premiership place against rangers in the play - off final
' it 's not looking likely at all because motherwell are not going to finish in the bottom two - i hope , ' said stuart mccall
' before that , though , stuart mccall must continue to rack up the wins , starting with thursday 's trip to dumfries
