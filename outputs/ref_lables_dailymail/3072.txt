saunders âs position as the country âs top prosecutor looked bleak as she faced unprecedented criticism from the home secretary , police chiefs , crime tsars , prominent mps â and even one of her predecessors
mrs saunders said her job as head of the cps was to make the correct legal decisions in difficult cases , not the most popular ones
the home secretary told the bbc : â i was very concerned when i heard about this decision
â â â adam simmonds , police and crime commissioner for northamptonshire , said the decision not to charge janner on thursday made it a â dark day for our justice system â
saunders , right , said her job as head of the cps was to make the correct legal decisions in difficult cases , not the most popular ones , janner , left leicestershire constabulary , which has investigated janner four times over the past 25 years , is considering an unprecedented legal challenge against the decision
simon danczuk , the labour mp who exposed the late cyril smith as a paedophile , said that the weight of criticism against mrs saunders meant something had â clearly gone very badly wrong â
writing in today âs mail on sunday , below , he said : â mrs saunders is now seen as a roadblock to justice and it âs hard to see how her position remains tenable
â mrs saunders has also come under fire over other high - profile cases â and has been involved in a number of disputes over the competing rights of suspects and alleged victims in sex assault cases
last night the cps said : â the dpp is there to make the right legal decision
her role is to make these very difficult decisions , not to make popular decisions
â roadblock to justice must be removed by simon danczuk , mp who exposed the cyril smith scandal mp simon danczuk who exposed the cyril smith scandal a few weeks ago , i met an experienced former metropolitan police officer to discuss investigations into high - profile child abusers active in the 1970s
â a year earlier , i âd met police officers from leicestershire to discuss the case they were putting together against janner
and not just because in admitting previous failures to prosecute janner , saunders failed to apologise on behalf of the cps
it âs appalling because it âs the wrong decision and one she did nât have to make
when the home secretary says she âs â very concerned â , the former dpp lord macdonald is critical , and leicestershire police are talking about a legal challenge , then something has clearly gone very badly wrong
so wrong that mrs saunders is now seen as a roadblock to justice and it âs hard to see how her position remains tenable .
