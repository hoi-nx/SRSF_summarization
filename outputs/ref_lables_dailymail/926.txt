police ignored the sexual abuse of hundreds of young girls because they were too busy chasing labour crime targets that would earn bonuses for senior staff
whistleblower brookes , a former detective who tried to investigate the abuse , said money was diverted away from protecting the children from rape , trafficking and beatings in order to pursue so - called â priority crimes â
the offences , which included car crime , were considered crucial for satisfying a target culture introduced by the last labour government
now it has emerged the same targets were also linked to performance - related pay for top officers at south yorkshire police
tory parliamentary candidate michael ellis , a former member of the home affairs select committee , said : â labour âs grossly irresponsible obsession with targets led to a perverted sense of priorities whereby senior officers could get bonuses for prioritising car crime while hundreds of young girls were being abused with impunity
the documents and the testimony of former officers suggested the force failed to pursue a number of child sexual exploitation inquiries and ignored intelligence that girls as young as 12 were being raped
the dossier by professor alexis jay ( pictured ) into the rotherham scandal described how south yorkshire police were â more focused on dealing with offences such as burglary and vehicle crime â than child abuse in most cases , the files suggest there is no evidence police took any action
he says the other Â£ 8,000 was diverted to spend chasing â district priorities , to investigate robbery , burglary and car crime â
and her majesty âs inspectorate of constabulary found senior south yorkshire officers prioritised burglary and car crime over victims of abuse
labour âs crime targets meant forces were aware that chief constables could get the sack if performance was repeatedly inadequate
