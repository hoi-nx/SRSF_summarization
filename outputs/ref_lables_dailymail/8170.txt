angel di maria and radamel falcao were little more than fresh legs here on sunday , and any success van gaal has enjoyed in his first season at old trafford needs to be measured against the difficulties two phenomenally talented players have endured
angel di maria and radamel falcao were left on the bench by louis van gaal on sunday argentine Â£ 60m man di maria came on for juan mata in the 81st minute at old trafford radamel falcao replaced belgian marouane fellaini with seven minutes to play in the win over city a sixth successive premier league victory that cements united in third place owes much to the revival of ashley young , marouane fellaini and juan mata and the progress being made by chris smalling and phil jones
moyes once said chris smalling and phil jones were good enough to become england âs central defensive pairing and roy hodgson , a spectator here on sunday , is sure to be encouraged by their rate of development
in ashley young , marouane fellaini and juan mata the transformation has been most startling , however , and credit has to go to van gaal for the way he has managed three players who were so central to the downfall of moyes 12 months ago
in fairness to marouane fellaini , and indeed moyes , the belgian just needed time to make the transition from everton to united
ashley young celebrates after bringing united level having earlier trailed but ashley young is a triumph for the style of leadership van gaal has long been recognised for : his ability to work with players on a personal basis as well as part of a collective
ashley young , one of five englishmen in united âs outfield 10 , was the outstanding player in this hugely entertaining contest , scoring the equaliser that quickly cancelled out aguero âs opener , as well as providing the assists for marouane fellaini and chris smalling , but more to the point , responding most effectively to what , presumably , were his manager âs instructions
marouane fellaini headed in at the far post to give united the lead and continue his fine recent form juan mata slots under joe hart to extend united 's lead to 3 - 1 early in the second half van gaal would have seen how vulnerable city were to the aerial threat posed by crystal palace at selhurst park on monday and it was ashley young who delivered the crosses that enabled united âs tallest players to punish them again , on both occasions with headers
while united are in the ascendancy , pellegrini has overseen a period of decline for a stuttering city side
while united are now celebrating the renaissance of players like ashley young , pellegrini faces the question of what on earth has happened to a side who were so superior to united a year ago
chris smalling headed in a free - kick to score united 's fourth goal in the derby england manager roy hodgson watched the manchester derby from the stands at old trafford 5-games lost by city in 2015 , one more than the whole of 2014
4 - the first time since losing 4 - 3 to united in 2009 that city have conceded four in the league
70.8 - city 's pass completion rate percentage at old trafford was their worst of the season
it was a 3 - 0 win at old trafford that effectively finished moyes at united , with the eventual champions moving 15 points clear of their neighbours that day with two games to spare
louis van gaal shakes hands with his opposite number pellegrini after the final whistle united boss van gaal thanked supporters for their patience after sunday 's victory city boss pellegrini has come under increasing pressure after a dismal second half of the season compared to chelsea , united are some way short of the best in england too and both clubs will need to invest heavily again this summer to close that gap
