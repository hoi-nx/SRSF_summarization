a new kansas law tells poor families that they ca n't use cash assistance from the state to attend concerts , go swimming , visit theme parks or buy lingerie
the list of don'ts runs to several dozen items
but , the one included by the gop - dominated kansas legislature in a bill that gop gov. brownback planned to sign thursday appears to be the most exhaustive , according to state department for children and families officials
the taxpayer - funded temporary assistance for needy families program , currently provides cash payments of up to $ 497 per month for a family of four
cutting back : in this april 13 photo , kansas gop gov. brownback makes a point during an interview in his office in the statehouse in topeka , kansas the new restrictions , regarding kansas applicants , have inspired national criticism and mockery from the daily show

kansas department for children and families officials said that it 's difficult to track how often cash assistance is used for items on the state 's new list because recipients can use their benefits cards to obtain cash
phyllis gilmore , kansas secretary for children and families , said her state 's list is a ' composite ' of others and has educational value , sending the message that cash assistance should be used for necessities

they include a requirement that cash assistance recipients work at least 20 hours a week , be looking for work or enroll in job training
the new law also includes a much - criticized provision shortening the lifetime cap on cash assistance to 36 months from 48 months , although the state department for children and families said recipients rarely bump up against the lower limit
the number of cash assistance recipients in kansas has dropped 63per cent since brownback took office , to about 14,700 in february

brownback said his state 's list of prohibited cash - assistance uses has become a way for the left to argue against welfare - to - work policies
