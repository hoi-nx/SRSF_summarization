nicola sturgeon will today launch an extraordinary bid to â lead the uk â as she unveils a string of policies apparently tailor - made for a power - sharing deal with labour
the snp leader will unveil a manifesto including proposals for uk foreign policy , welfare payments , energy bills and england university tuition fees
several of her election pledges overlap with labour policy , including slashing tuition fees in england from a maximum of Â£ 9,000 a year to Â£ 6,000 , and rolling back competition in the english nhs
others are calculated to drag a minority labour government to the left , including halting the roll - out of iain duncan smith âs popular changes to benefits and cancelling the trident nuclear weapons system
scotland âs first minister , who is not herself running for a westminster seat , said yesterday the snp had much in common with left - wing labour mps and aimed to build a â progressive alliance â for people â right across the uk â
today âs snp election manifesto will be the first to be the focus of intense national scrutiny
the huge surge in support for the snp could see senior labour figures such as jim murphy ( left ) and douglas alexander ( right ) lose their seats the latest scotland - wide yougov survey shows the snp on a record 49 per cent , up three , with labour trailing on 25 per cent , down four
even senior labour figures , including the labour leader jim murphy and the shadow foreign secretary and the party âs election campaign coordinator , douglas alexander , are facing defeat
the snp will declare today that a â strong team â of snp mps in westminster would help â rebalance the uk - both politically and economically - from the chronic over-dominance of the city of london , which has harmed the overall uk economy and left regions of england neglected â
