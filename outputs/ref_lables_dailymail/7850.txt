israeli scholars are furious after new flooring was fitted ' behind their backs ' by the muslim authority in charge of judaism 's holiest site - potentially covering up clues to the location of the ' lost ark '
the work at the dome of the rock was simply meant to replace carpet , worn away by thousands of pilgrims at the gold - topped shrine , which overlooks old east jerusalem
but when the old carpet was lifted , it revealed previously undocumented ancient floor designs - which could point to where the gold - cased ark of the covenant was buried 2,500 years ago
but something is hidden there , ' said israeli archaeologist dvira , who studies the site
yet it looks likely it will remain a mystery : scholars did not get the chance to document the designs before workmen began laying the new carpet , paid for by king abdullah ii , the country which remains the custodian of the area 's muslim holy sites
it has sparked a war of words between the waqf , the muslim authority that administers the al aqsa compound , which includes the dome of the rock , and israeli archaeological authorities , who say the repairs were carried out behind their backs
israeli 's housing minister uri ariel , of the nationalist jewish home party , waded in to the argument to urge an immediate halt to the work
' row : the dome of the rock is one of the most contentious religious spots in all of east jerusalem , and the argument over the carpet is simply the latest in a long line of battle between muslim and jews groups holy : the dome of the rock and its hilltop plaza is considered judaism 's holiest spot and islam 's third holiest but the waqf reject the accusations
sheikh azzam tamimi , the head of the waqf , said the work is long overdue and has defiantly proclaimed that he was forbidding any israeli involvement
jamal al quda , a member of a group of jordan carpet layers who received israeli visas for the job , said it was necessary to affix the base layer of thin dark felt before rolling out the carpet above it
heritage : the dome of the rock is thought to be one of the most interesting archaeological sites in east jerusalem finance : this latest work , pictured last sunday , is being paid for by king abdullah ii of jordan this is not the first time tensions have flared over work at the dome of the rock
the dome of the rock is at the centre of competing claims
ancient jews traditions say the ark of the covenant
which contained the ten commandments , may have been hidden away in a chamber when the temple was destroyed
while east jerusalem may be the most excavated city in the world , the dome of the rock and its hilltop plaza are an archaeological goldmine which has never been properly dug because of the political sensitivities surrounding the site , which is considered judaism 's holiest spot and islam 's third holiest
for years , dvira and veteran israeli archaeologist barkay have been leading a team of archaeologists and volunteers in combing through the dirt for historical finds
israeli 's state comptroller wrote a scathing report in 2010 about the muslim authorities ' illicit work projects at the compound and israeli 's failure at enforcing supervision there
israeli officials kept the report classified out of concern that its publication could harm the sensitive relationship with jordan
' hasson , the director of the israeli antiquities authority , said once the government body learned about the renovation , it made arrangements with the waqf to send an archaeologist to document some of the floor patterns , but others already had been covered by the maroon and beige carpeting
