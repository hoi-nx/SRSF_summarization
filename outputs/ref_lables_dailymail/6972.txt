school safety experts have reported a ' worrying increase ' in e-terrorism , where threats are sent electronically - sometimes from thousands of miles away
the ohio - based national school safety and security services reviewed more than 800 school threats covered in the media during the first half of the 2014 - 15 academic year
researchers found that about one - third of cases involved violent remarks sent anonymously via text message , social media , email or other online means
worrying trend : in this january 13 , 2014 photo , students pass by school after being evacuated for the day after a bomb squad was called to remove a potentially explosive device in many cases , swift action is taken with lockdowns and evacuations
indeed , just this week a 16 - year - old from gateway high school in kissimmee , florida , was arrested for posting about a bomb threat on twitter because ' she was angry and did not want to go to school , ' according to the osceola county sheriff 's office
complicating matters , the threats are n't just coming from within school walls or even a school 's neighborhood
a 14 - year - old student was arrested after admitting the email had been sent by her online friend ' ryan ' after she told him to ' swat ' her school because she thought it would be funny , police said
in a separate case , a 14 - year - old in western michigan was ordered by a judge to pay nearly $ 8,000 in restitution to the coopersville area public schools and the ottawa county sheriff 's office for his involvement in a swatting incident that put schools in lockdown after a caller using computer - based technology made threats against the schools
authorities say the call was made by a person code - named ' ransom , ' whom the teen had met online
applications such as burnbook , afterschool , yik yak , whisper and kik also have been used by students to make threats anonymously
' the posting had been brought to the high school principal 's attention by a text message ; police quickly determined that it was not a credible threat
meanwhile , social media and other electronic means of communication are keeping parents informed about threats
