latika had a blissfully happy childhood running around care - fee with her seven siblings in their backyard in regional australian
although she was adopted from india along with two of her siblings , it never occurred to her that she should explore her origins in india , where she was born before being adopted and starting a new life in the lucky country as an eight month old baby
but that all changed when she watched the movie slumdog millionaire and realised how profoundly different her life would have been if her new parents did n't take her in their arms and change her life forever
the film was nothing short of life - changing for latika and led her to a fulfilling spiritual journey back to where it all began in an orphanage in the slums of india - the country she instantly fell in love with and has become her second home
' it took latika another three years to make it to india in 2012 and she has been every year since - admitting to being ' absolutely obsessed ' with her mother country
' latika 's parents had two children then adopted her and damian , from the same orphanage in bihar , and their sister rani from another part of india , and then had three another children of their own
