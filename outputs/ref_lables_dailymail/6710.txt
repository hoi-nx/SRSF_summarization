when two complete strangers living just an hour apart in ireland discovered they looked so alike they could be identical twins this week , the world was shocked
but unlikely as it may seem , geaney , 26 , and karen branigan , 29 , are n't the only pair to have found their real - life doppelgÃ¤ngers , either by mistake or after a social media hunt
now three similar british cases have been revealed ; a london - based journalist who found hers in birmingham , two male university students , also in london , and two retired men in essex
' jemison ' turned out to be jemison , a 74 - year - old former head teacher who was well - known to the town , and just so happened to look exactly like mr richardson
upon meeting , the pair , who are both grandfathers - of - four now living just 150 yards apart , also realised that as well as being doppelgÃ¤ngers , they had an awful lot in common
the pair finally came face - to - face in march when they coincidentally both boarded the same coach for a friends of braintree museum visit to the magna carta exhibition at the british library
' upon meeting , mr richardson ( left ) and mr jemison ( right ) , who are both grandfathers - of - four now living just 150 yards apart , also realised they had a lot in common in terms of their life stories mr richardson married his wife in 1968 ( left ) while mr jemison also married wife jenny in the sixties ( right ) in 2011 , devon - born journalist sophie robehmed became fascinated by the idea that there might be someone out there in the world who looked exactly like her
in much the same way , ms sophie robehmed launched her mission to find her doppelgÃ¤nger by publicising it on facebook , youtube , and through blogs around the world
and just like miss geaney , it turned out that ms sophie robehmed did n't need to look that far
her closest match turned out to be birmingham native hatcher , who worked in the film industry and shared a mutual friend
devon - born journalist sophie robehmed ( right ) launched a hunt to find her ' twin stranger ' in 2011 and found birmingham native hatcher ( left ) through a mutual friend after seeing ms hatcher 's photo , miss sophie robehmed set up a meeting in covent garden in london , and the rest is history
and in another accidental result , doppelgÃ¤ngers jonny sandgrove and harris , both based in london , got to know each other at university
doppelgã¤ngers jonny sandgrove ( left ) and harris ( right ) , both based in london , got to know each other at university , after friends kept getting them confused when mr harris married his then - girlfriend naomi a little while later , several members of his family approached johnny at the wedding to congratulate him
all this comes after miss geaney and miss karen branigan 's story blew up across the media yesterday , for being the most twin - like case yet
incredibly , miss geaney found miss branigan in just two weeks - just an hour away
uncanny : miss geaney , a 26 - year - old student from dublin ( left ) , found her ' twin stranger ' in miss branigan ( right ) , through a social media campaign she launched with friends â i would say karen branigan is the shyer of the two of us , â said miss geaney
miss karen branigan ( right ) turned out to be a fellow ireland native who lived just an hour down the road from miss geaney ( left ) , making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin - like photos together she added , ' some of the expressions she would pull i would think to myself or say aloud , " oh my god that âs my face " ' while miss geaney appears to have beaten her fellow twin strangers participants , 21 - year - old harry and 22 - year - old terence , hands down , the search is n't over until april 27
