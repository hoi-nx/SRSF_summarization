you 'd think that being a chef , i 'd want to escape the toils of the kitchen while on holiday - but the opposite is true
i jump at the chance to experience new flavours and gather fresh inspiration
and where better to tickle your tastebuds than in glorious grenada ? the island is known for its zesty spices and self - sufficiency - the only food it imports is milk
heading west : rosemary spent a week on grenada , where fresh foodstuffs like cocoa fruit are easily available meat and fish are plentiful and , because the soil is very fertile , the vegetables , fruit and salads are the glossiest you 'll ever see
grenada 's seasons are similar to our own , which means cauliflower , broccoli and pumpkins in spring
autumn heralds guavas , sweetsop ( sugar apples ) and soursop ( similar to pawpaw ) , and then there is the temptingly named mammee apple , which is a caribbean version of a peach
sumptuous sands : grenada is home to splendid beaches - such as the glorious arc of grand anse i am staying in the southwest of the island at mount cinnamon on grand anse beach , near the charming town of st george
i especially liked the beach cabana at mount cinnamon , where they serve fabulously strong cocktails made with local rum at all hours of the day and night
people come across from nearby islands to enjoy the weekly bonfire on the beach , at which local musicians play
this is the caribbean at its best
come dine with me : grenada is an island awash with fresh produce and intriguing local recipes the next day , i watch a fish cookery demonstration at mount cinnamon : a traditional dish of kingfish marinated in coconut , ginger , lime , spices , peppers and chives , wrapped in banana leaves and cooked over a wood fire , and served with delicious breadfruit chips
st george 's market brims with local spices and everything else that is grown on the island
a place to cool your heels : rosemary stayed at grenada 's elegant mount cinnamon resort no tour of the island would be complete without a visit to the river antione rum distillery - the last one in the caribbean to make the drink from cane sugar , as they did in the 18th century
we taste goat 's cheese and salt fish fritters , a popular local dish
