after the war the dutch government set the official date of anne frank 's death as march 31 , based on survivors accounts stating that the girls died sometime in march
but some accounts suggest that she might have died in the middle of february - just two months before british soldiers liberated the camp
their grave , which reads margot frank 1926 - 1945 and anne frank 1929 - 1945 , is a poignant memorial that still stands where the germany camp used to be
