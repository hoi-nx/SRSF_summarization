a couple who spent a lifetime paying off their mortgage have said it was a waste of time after a council scheme to sell neighbouring homes for just Â£ 1 has turned the street into a ' ghetto '
linda and george hunter , who raised their four children in their home in garrick street , wavertree , liverpool , became mortgage free around 15 years ago
but eight years ago , the street became part of a regeneration scheme and the council bought properties and boarded them up ready for demolition
estate agents say the couple would now struggle to sell their home for much more than Â£ 1 as other houses in the street are being sold off at that price by the council
' she picked out houses worth around Â£ 120,000 and the council said they would look into it for her in october , but months later the couple were told the offer had fallen through as their street was now part of liverpool 's ' home for a pound ' scheme
' it would be very hard for them to sell their home when other properties in the road are being sold for Â£ 1
' hunter , 62 , feels trapped in the area as property prices in neighbouring houses have dramatically fallen as the couple are unlikely to sell their home , they want the council to put its original offer back on the table
' who 's going to buy our house for thousands when they can get the house next door for Â£ 1 ? ' she added : ' the council created this ghetto that we are now trapped in and they feel they owe us nothing at all
' liverpool city council said the fact some vacant properties in the area are being offered for Â£ 1 so that they can be renovated does not mean that other houses which are occupied are only worth Â£ 1
