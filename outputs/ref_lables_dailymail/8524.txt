a valet parking attendant managed to plough a 200mph supercar through the front of a shop after mistaking the brake for the throttle in a ferrari worth Â£ 300,000
the car 's owner entrusted the car , which is one of the most powerful ever produced by ferrari , to a parking attendant who attempted to return it to the hotel in a timely manner
' he blamed the car 's semi-automatic transmission for bamboozling him
only 599 of the ferrari gto model were built , which is the manufacturer 's fastest ever road car
