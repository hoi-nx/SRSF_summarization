the man accused of killing a gay community college worker said the motorcycle he used to get away broke down along interstate 95 and he walked 30 miles before a woman headed to florida gave him a ride , according to a police report released on wednesday
the woman picked up the 20 - year - old stancil , whose face and neck are covered in dark , self - administered tattoos , some with neo-nazi symbolism
among his self - administered tattoos are the word ' brotherhood ' on his neck and the number ' 88 ' on his left cheek which is linked to neo-nazis stancil pictured with his mother debbie at his graduation
the mother also claimed that the victim had made sexually laced comments to her son the driver was headed to key west , florida , but dropped stancil off in daytona beach , where he was found sleeping on the beach on tuesday morning
stancil is awaiting extradition back to north carolina , where he is accused of fatally shooting 44 - year - old lane , a print shop director at wayne community college
he confessed to the shooting in an obscenity - laced statement , saying he ' ridded one last child molester from the earth ' , according to the station
he said lane , who had been his supervisor at the college 's print shop until stancil was fired last month , had been ' messing with ' one of stancil 's family members
an extradition hearing was scheduled for wednesday to send him back to north carolina to face a charge of open murder
during his first court appearance on tuesday in daytona beach , florida , stancil indicated he killed lane because his former supervisor molested a relative
the suspect 's mother , debbie stancil , said she knows the relative was not sexually abused by lane , as kenneth stancil claimed in court , because the relative and lane had never met

lane and stancil started working together in august
lane and stancil were linked - whether they knew it or not - by the suicides of people very close to them
stancil 's mother says her son never recovered after finding his father in the backyard after he had killed himself in 2009
police have not said whether stancil held white supremacist beliefs or what hate crime they are investigating
stancil 's mother said the tattoo marked a wannabe rather than someone with neo-nazi beliefs
stancil , pictured in court on tuesday , is awaiting extradition back to north carolina , where he is accused of fatally shooting 44 - year - old lane , a print shop director at wayne community college
