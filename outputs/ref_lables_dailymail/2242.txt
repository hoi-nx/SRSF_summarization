for mccall , the memories of may 11 , 1985 will never fade
as bradford celebrated promotion from the old english third division , a day of joy quickly became one of devastation as a fire ripped through the timber main stand at valley parade towards the end of the first half , claiming 56 helpless victims
just 21 years of age , mccall returned to his car , only to find the door handle was burning hot because it had been parked so near to the blaze
upon learning his father , andy â one of a large group of mccall âs relatives at the game â had been badly burned and was missing , the young midfielder set off frantically through the streets of bradford
the fire at bradford 's valley parade claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on may 11 , 1985 the 30th anniversary is approaching since the tragic fire that killed 56 people at bradford 's ground in 1985 still wearing his boots and kit , he was finally reunited with his father in pinderfields hospital in wakefield
those hours represented the worst of his life but given that other families lost loved ones that day , mccall has always declared himself and his father the fortunate ones
so how would the rangers manager â who donated money from his 2002 testimonial to the bradford burns unit that cared for his father and so many others â react to bombshell claims this week that mere bad luck had perhaps played no role in the disaster ? a book written by fletcher , a bradford fan who lost three generations of his family in the blaze , says the incident was just one of at least nine fires at businesses owned or associated with the club âs then chairman stafford heginbotham , in the previous 18 years , resulting in huge insurance claims
in his book fifty-six , published on thursday , fletcher believes the fire was not an accident and says he and his family are no longer willing to â live the myth â
fire engulfs valley parade on a day nobody can ever forget as 56 were killed at the football stadium a police officer uses his helmet to shield the heat from his face as he runs in front of the stand on fire from mccall âs annual visits to the club âs memorial services , he knows fletcher , who lost brother , andrew ( 11 ) â the youngest victim of the tragedy â as well as his father john ( 34 ) , uncle peter ( 32 ) and grandfather eddie ( 63 )
he also knows stafford heginbotham and attended the funeral of the â great chairman â in 1995
to mccall , the verdict of inquiry judge sir popplewell , who declared the fire had probably been started by a stray match , cigarette or pipe tobacco slipping through gaps on the floor on to a build - up of litter , remains the most likely cause of the tragedy
â i get so caught up in this job managing rangers that i do nât always see the news but someone told me the other day that the bradford story had been on sky , â said mccall on friday
