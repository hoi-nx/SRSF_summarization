scotland first minister nicola sturgeon boasted tonight how a brand - new Â£ 1billion hospital in glasgow had been ' entirely funded ' by scotland taxpayers
ms nicola sturgeon said the state - of - the - art south glasgow university hospital â which opened today complete with a fleet of robots delivering linen , a children 's cinema and helicopter landing pad â proved the snp 's commitment to the nhs
but ukip said the hospital had been funded with english taxpayers ' money ' shovelled ' to holyrood â despite gaping holes in hospital funding south of the border
despite the growing crisis in funding for england , the snp has demanded even more cash for scotland
dr david stewart , the medical director for glasgow and clyde , said the south glasgow university hospital ' allows us to truly bring healthcare into the 21st century ' snp leader nicola sturgeon has claimed the amazing building proves her party 's commitment to the nhs there are self - service check - in machines and nearly all of the 1,100 beds have their own room , with an en - suite bathroom and views out over the city the super hospital has a cinema and a roof garden in the children 's wing and is the latest to be built in the uk the building 's full 14 - storeys can be appreciated as soon as patients , visitors and staff enter the atrium the hospital cost Â£ 842m but the medical equipment inside has brought the final total closer to Â£ 1billion public funding north of the border is typically 20 per cent higher than in english â with scotland receiving an extra Â£ 1,200 on their health care alone
snp leader nicola sturgeon , appearing on bbc newsnight tonight , defended the scale of public funding north of the border - and vowed to push for even more last year , nineteen nhs trusts were referred to ministers after auditors raised concerns about their financial health
one of those referred was hinchingbrooke , which is the first hospital trust to be run by a private firm , circle public funding north of the border is typically 20 per cent higher than in english â with scotland receiving an extra Â£ 1,200 on their health care alone
the average public spending per person in the uk is just under Â£ 9,000 â but only Â£ 8,700 in england
this compares with some Â£ 10,275 in scotland
scotland is guaranteed extra public funding by the controversial barnett formula used by the treasury to dole out taxpayers ' money around the uk
despite receiving thousands of pounds more per person already , ms nicola sturgeon this morning vowed to use any influence after the election to push for more even public spending in scotland
the snp manifesto also calls for even more health spending over the next five years â vowing to wring out an extra Â£ 9.5billion from uk taxpayers every year by 2020
this would mean a total increase for scotland 's nhs of Â£ 2billion
ms nicola sturgeon this afternoon defended the level of health spending north of the border â by pointing to the new glasgow super hospital
the south glasgow university hospital â the uk 's newest hospital â has been nicknamed the ' death star ' by locals because of its giant 14 - storey star - shaped design , topped by a landing pad for aircraft
the hospital replaces four ageing hospitals across glasgow , some of which date back to victorian times
