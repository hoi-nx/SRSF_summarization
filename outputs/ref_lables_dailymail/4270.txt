cameron will put small business at the heart of the election campaign today by declaring that the conservatives are â the party of the grafters â
the prime minister , who has faced criticism over a campaign lacking in passion , said he made â no apology â for focusing on the economy , insisting : â nothing matters more
â mr cameron went on : â some people are saying to me , â you are putting too much emphasis on a strong and stable economy and securing our future â
â the tories will today unveil a separate manifesto for small businesses , calling them â the lifeblood of the economy â
thousands of small business leaders will back the party in an open letter
the prime minister , who has faced criticism over a campaign lacking in passion , said he made â no apology â for focusing on the economy , insisting : â nothing matters more â and mr cameron â who is understood to have ordered that all campaigning activity is now dedicated to the economy â will set out new proposals to support millions of small firms and self - employed
the tories are also promising to review the disadvantages faced by the self - employed , who make up 15 per cent of the workforce
in an echo of the campaign rhetoric of margaret thatcher , who famously celebrated napoleon âs supposed dismissal of britain as a â nation of shopkeepers â , mr cameron will say : â small businesses are the backbone of our economy â and conservatives are behind them 100 per cent
