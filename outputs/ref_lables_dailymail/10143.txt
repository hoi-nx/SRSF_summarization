queens park rangers manager ramsey is convinced he is the right man to bring long - term success to loftus road - whether queens park rangers are relegated or not
ramsey has overseen just one victory since he was appointed permanent manager in february but four points from games against aston villa and west brom , and a narrow defeat to chelsea , have revived hopes of survival
west ham 's sam allardyce and bournemouth 's eddie howe have both been linked with ramsey 's job in the summer but the former tottenham coach believes it would be unfair for his future to depend on queens park rangers avoiding the drop
queens park rangers manager ramsey is convinced he is the right man to bring long - term success to loftus road ' i would n't say i 'm expecting the sack ( if queens park rangers are relegated ) but i 've been in the game a long time and you have to be realistic about what generally happens , whether it 's fair or not fair , ' ramsey said
' ramsey worked with tim sherwood at tottenham 's academy , nurturing the likes of harry kane , ryan mason and nabil bentaleb - all of whom have thrived at white hart lane this season
rangers have hung their survival hopes on experienced , and often expensive , signings but ramsey believes he can carry out the club 's wish for a more joined - up strategy
the 52 - year - old is a popular and respected man within the game , with aspirations of getting the full - time job ' i think the chairman wants to go that way because we need to keep that stability at the club for the long term , ' ramsey said
' reports suggest that ramsey could link up with friend tim sherwood ( left ) at aston villa in the summer rangers are two points adrift of safety having played a game more than the three teams above them and saturday 's game at home to west ham looks crucial given the club 's next two fixtures are away to manchester city and liverpool
ramsey , however , insists he is not feeling the pressure
west ham manager sam allardyce has been linked with ramsey 's job in the summer ' it 's not about sleepless nights , it 's more trying to make sure the people around the club have well - deserved success
sam allardyce , whose contract expires in the summer , is not expected to remain at upton park next season but ramsey issued a warning to west ham fans
' sam allardyce made a comment if he was called allerdici he 'd get more plaudits and i agree with him , ' ramsey said
