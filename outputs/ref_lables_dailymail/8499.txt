china 's leadership has hit back at america president obama who condemned the country for constructing an artificial island in the disputed south china sea
only yesterday , obama claimed beijing was ' using its sheer size and muscle to force countries into subordinate positions ' amid reports of controversial land reclamation efforts
but a furious china leadership has argued that it is washington which possesses - and wields - the greatest military muscle
the war of words come as newly - released satellite images reveal a flotilla of china vessels dredging sand onto artificially - built land masses near the spratlys - an area which many other nations claim
war of words : china has criticised the america over accusations it is bullying neighbouring countries by building artificial islands ( pictured ) on the so - called mischief reef in the disputed south china sea untouched : images from before china began its construction there ( pictured in 2012 ) show no signs of tampering disputed : but newer images ( pictured in march ) show china vessels dredging sand onto artificially - built land masses near the spratlys territory : the area near the spratlys where china is constructing artificial islands is claimed by many other countries in the region agressor : after the america president condemned china for building land masses on disputed territory , its furious leadership claimed it was washington which possesses - and wields - the greatest military muscle a china foreign ministry spokeswoman said : ' the america leader talked about china 's ' sheer size and muscle ' , but one can also see clearly who has the biggest size and muscle in the world
the america - based csis ( csis ) has has been picturing and documenting the construction of an artificial island known as mischief reef in the south china sea
china used dredging vessels to dig up sediment from the sea before dumping it on submerged coral reefs to make islands , ethan rosen , a geopolitical researcher in china claimed
construction : the u.s. navy initially claimed china was creating a ' great wall of sand ' ( pictured in february 2014 ) in the south china sea controversial : a spokesperson from china 's foreign ministry said the country ' indisputable rights ' to the spratlys and it was protecting its nation 's sovereignty they claim china is illegally reclaiming the contested area and creating artificial islands with facilities that could have military use
late last month , the u.s. navy reported the latest land mass china had built was 1.5 square miles in size and created by dumping sand on live coral reefs , possibly damaging local ecosystems
it was just one of several artificial islands china had been creating in the region and their exact purpose remains unknown

' the america broadly supports its asian allies against china pressure and has asserted that freedom of navigation is in the country 's national interest
on friday , hua maintained that china has maintained ' security and peace ' in the region and was working with neighbouring countries
admiral harry harris jr added : ' china is building artificial land by pumping sand on to live coral reefs - some of them submerged - and paving over them with concrete
several south asian countries stake claim to the territory , though china tries to control the largest portion of the archipelago
beijing has claimed its right to the collection of land masses is 2,000 years old which , they say , includes the islands in china history
