the eighth wonder of the world is nearing completion in the seventh tier of english football
in a park in the middle of a working - class suburb east of the city centre , builders are putting the finishing touches to fc united 's broadhurst park
there are no pyramids , hanging gardens or light houses but there is a sweeping terrace , a series of football pitches and floodlight pylons
fc united of manchester 's new 5,000 - capacity stadium broadhurst park is nearing completion general manager andy walsh outside the new ground , which cost the democratic club a whopping Â£ 6.5m this a symbol that there is another way
another way a million miles away from billion - pound tv deals , fat - cat owners , sanitised stadia and all that many will tell you is wrong with modern football
set to host benfica for the official opening on may 29 , the 5,000 - capacity stadium will finally end a nomadic decade on the road for the breakaway outfit set up in may 2005 by manchester united fans sick of being exploited by the club they loved , for whom the arrival of the malcolm glazer family was a step too far
broadhurst ( some mischievous souls voted for fcum hall in the naming poll ) , dismissed by many as an impossible dream , cost around Â£ 6.5m
of that colossal sum around half came from the pockets of the democratic club 's 4,000 members
it is a ground for the fans , paid for by the fans
the function room at the new ground is part of a stadium that will also serve the local community broadhurst park is a far cry from the glamour and glitz of old trafford , seven miles away across the city but is it two fingers up at the debt - burdening american still in charge seven miles across the city ? ' that 's a daft question , ' says general manager andy walsh
' establishing this football ground is a statement of what football supporters can achieve if they are given the opportunity , ' he adds
far from marching proudly into a new stadium , 25 years ago andy walsh , now 52 , was nervously stepping into a prison cell for non-payment of poll tax
the changing rooms at the new ground are simple , but walsh says the club are ambitious for progress on matchdays one of the stands will house a food market , with local businesses from indian takeaways to vegan cafes offering fans their fayre
fruit trees will make it the first pollinator - friendly football ground in the country
' we have to get that one right , ' says andy walsh , but the provider will be a local firm in line with the club 's policy
the physio room will turn into a medical suite for the community on non-match days and there is a classroom for the club 's academy and for the use of those from the surrounding area
walsh explains the plans for the stadium to sportsmail 's mike keegan ( right ) at the new ground ' we 're a mile away from northampton road ( newton heath 's first ground ) , ' says andy walsh
' andy walsh , born and raised a stone 's throw from the stretford end , is expecting a 20 per cent rise on the club 's already impressive average attendances of 2,000 as they seek to end four years of play - off heartbreak and gain promotion to the conference north
' so will andy walsh , whose side need a maximum of five points from their remaining three matches to secure the title , be sat in the director 's box when the dream is finally realised and the teams run out ? ' no , ' he says
for andy walsh , however , it is an extension of a longstanding mancunian tradition
' unfortunately , andy walsh has to leave to try and push the project over the line
the fc united team in 2005 , when they played as a nomadic club without a ground the club 's fans turned their back on the commercialism of old trafford and started a democratic club time for one last question
so will louis van gaal find a ticket to a match at broadhurst park on his doormat ? ' that 's a good question , ' andy walsh says
