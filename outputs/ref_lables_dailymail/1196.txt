all of a sudden , it seems that everywhere we turn there are suncream ads and the shops are filled with offers on summer essentials
so should we be making the most of the bargains to restock the bathroom cabinet â or can we ignore the marketing ploys and dig out supplies that have been lurking at the back for years ? alice smellie asked industry experts to find out if it âs really vital to buy new supplies for summer
but a recent survey revealed that almost three - quarters of uk holidaymakers are at risk of uv exposure because they use out - of - date sun cream
so , can we use old suncreams ? â sun cream contains uv filters which fall into two main categories : synthetic or organic filters , which absorb uv light ; and mineral or inorganic filters , such as titanium dioxide , which mainly reflect uv light
the issue is that out - of - date lotions may separate and not spread evenly , meaning you may not be completely covered with those vital uv filters , even if the active ingredients remain stable
when it comes to sun cream , experts advise playing it safe and restocking your supllies to ensure skin is properly protected from damaging damaging uva and uvb rays out - of - date lotions are also more likely to cause skin irritations
ingredient specialist and product developer tammy hollis says : â look at how we treat our suncreams â carrying them from sandy beach to sunny bar and air - conditioned hotels
â so experts recommend you do nât use a sun cream beyond the recommended period after opening
after - sun in an ideal world none of us would get sunburn , but occasionally we underestimate the heat of the sun. while it ca nât reverse the damaging effects of the sun , after - sun contains soothing ingredients such as water , aloe vera and silicones , which evaporate quickly from the skin and cool it down
dr flower says : â the main effect is to cool and reduce the effect of over-heating and to help avoid skin peeling
â while after - suns may seem innocuous products , people forget they are applied to vulnerable , damaged skin
for this reason it âs vital that you adhere to the recommendations regarding when you should discard lotions while after - suns may seem innocuous products , people forget they are applied to vulnerable , damaged skin
â damaged skin may be more prone to developing irritations , allergies or infections anyway , â says dr flower
â so the older the after - sun , the more likely it is to contain bacteria
if a pathogenic organism â a disease causing bacteria â was applied to damaged skin , then it âs possible you might develop an infection of the skin
but can you keep using the same spray year after year ? â insect repellents work in two different ways , â says howard , ceo of incognito mosquito spray and a mosquito bite prevention expert
â when it comes to bottles of insect repellent , experts say you 're probably ok to use the same bottle for a couple of years , but keep a close eye on the use - by date , especially if travelling to far - flung countries howard says that if any bottle of deet is open it must be replaced after two years because the active ingredient may stop working as effectively
verdict : you âre probably ok for a couple of years , but keep a close eye on the use - by date , especially if travelling to far - flung countries
â when it goes on the skin it âs not stimulating melanin production ( which is what happens when you âre in the sun ) , but reacts with proteins on the top layer of skin known as the epidermis to turn brown
once it is past its use - by date it oxidises and goes green â this active ingredient is usually in water - based solutions without many preservatives
once it is past its use - by date it oxidises and goes green
â verdict : restock as soon as it is out of date , or if it is runnier than normal or smells funny
