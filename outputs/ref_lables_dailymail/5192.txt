chinese scientists have admitted to changing the genes of human embryos for the first time
the announcement confirms rumors that some researchers have been conducting ethically questionable genetic experiments
some scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea , for fear it could be misused to allow parents to ' select ' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren
chinese scientists have admitted to changing the genes of human embryos , like the one above , for the first time in history
the announcement confirms rumors that some researchers have been conducting ethically questionable experiments the team tried to tweak the gene responsible for Î² - thalassaemia , a potentially deadly blood disorder , using a germ line editing technique known as crispr / cas9
crispr technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code
unlike other gene - silencing tools , the crispr system targets the genome 's source material and permanently turns off genes at the dna level
in this way , researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome
the team studied the ability of the crispr / cas9 system to edit the gene called hbb responsible for Î² - thalassaemia however , others argue that the technology could also be used to rid families of devastating inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis or certain cancers
researchers at sun yat-sen university in guangzho have today published their research in the journal protein & cell , according to a report in nature
the team tried to tweak the gene responsible for Î² - thalassaemia , a potentially deadly blood disorder , using a germ line editing technique known as crispr / cas9
but the researchers involved said that their results revealed ' serious obstacles ' in using the technique on human embryos
huang 's group studied the ability of the crispr / cas9 system to edit the gene called hbb
modifying the dna of human embryos so that dna changes are preserved in the germ line - the sperm and eggs - means such alterations can be passed on to future generations
improvements in genetics are causing designer babies to near ' 100 per cent efficiency ' in trials using mice , a leading scientist has warned
the warning follows a breakthrough last april in which scientists were able to cure a genetic liver disease in living , adult mice using the crispr - cas9 gene editing technique
the crispr technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code and could be used to create designer babies
such work is already illegal in many countries around the world including the uk , but is permitted in the us and chinese
xingxu huang , from shanghai tech university in chinese has been seeking permission to perform the technique on discarded human embryos after having successfully using it to modify monkey embryos that developed into live animals
the immature egg would be grown and coaxed into dividing before a gene - editing technique known as crispr would be used to correct the genetic fault that was causing the ovarian cancer
dr yang , however , has been reported to have been involved in a similar project in chinese
uk and us scientists have already expressed concerns over the ethics of the latest experiment , with one doctor calling for the research to be banned
if chinese does not want to get the reputation of being the wild west of the new eugenics it must join the many countries â including the uk â which would ban such research
â many scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea , for fear it could be misused to allow parents to ' select ' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren while genetic modification of human embryos is illegal in the uk , the historic decision was taken in february to allow â three - parent babies â
although the procedure has its critics , it would not alter the genetic characteristics of a child , unlike the chinese experiment
alastair kent , from genetic alliance uk which supports families with genetic conditions , said patients would be interested to hear about the chinese experiment â but undoubtedly would be aware that â ethical challenges will need to be resolved â
a dna technique which allows scientists to tell the difference between identical twins has been discovered
â last month a leading group of biologists called for a worldwide moratorium on germ line research amid rumours that it had already been used to alter human embryos in chinese
' this makes it dangerous and ethically unacceptable
' their fears tap into concerns that such technology could be used to create ' designer families ' where certain traits are selected for
