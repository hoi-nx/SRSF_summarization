whatever caused small space rocks to lump together billions of years ago , magnetism is unlikely to be the reason
scientists announced today that measurements made by the european space probe philae , which landed on comet 67p in november , show the comet 's core is n't magnetised
some astrophysicists have suggested that magnetism might have been responsible for aligning and then binding together rocks into larger boulders during the early stages of planet formation
a composite of 18 images showing off the comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko activity from different angles as seen between 31 january ( top left ) and 25 march ( bottom right ) , when the spacecraft was at distances of about 30 to 100 km from the comet but in a paper published online by the journal science , the team led by auster at the technical university of braunschweig , germany , said their data â which benefited from three unexpected bounces that allowed philae to collect more results than planned â do n't support this theory
' treiman , a senior scientist at the lunar and planetary institute in houston , texas , who was n't involved in the study , said the results credibly suggest other forces were responsible
' the findings are part of a series of scientific results obtained by scientists analyzing data collected by the philae lander and its mothership rosetta , which is flying alongside the comet on its elliptical orbit around the sun. magnetic data providing an estimate of the final landing region
