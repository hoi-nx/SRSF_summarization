success is a gloriously familiar routine for johnny sexton
as he prepared for a european champions cup quarter - final showdown with saracens on sunday in paris , racing metro âs no 10 and irish icon reflected on his healthy habit
in fact , since the 29 - year - old established himself at senior level , 2010 stands alone as a year without substantial reward
johnny sexton wants to full the void by winning a medal with racing metro this season short of helping ireland to win the world cup later this year , there âs not much left for johnny sexton to achieve , but he wo nât settle for what he has
none of the medals have been earned in the colours of racing metro , and filling that void in his check - list is a pressing priority
with a summer return to dublin approaching , johnny sexton said : â i was speaking to ronan ( oâgara â former ireland team - mate and racing metro âs kicking coach ) last week and saying , for me , for my two years here to be a success , we need to pick up a trophy
whenever i come back to french , i want to be able to hold my head up high , say that i gave my best to racing metro while i was here and helped the club achieve something
â the paris team are in the knock - out stages of europe âs elite event for the first time , but it is familiar territory for their irish playmaker
johnny sexton has featured in 11 knock - out games in continental rugby and won the lot
johnny sexton has helped french side reach the knock - out stages of europe âs elite event for first time â i had nât realised that
â i â ve never played a knock - out game for racing metro , so hopefully it âs going to be one from one ! â pressure is no problem to him
when leinster were staring down the barrel in the 2011 heineken cup final in cardiff â trailing 22 - 6 to northampton at half - time â johnny sexton scored two second - half tries in a 28 - point haul to propel his province to a comeback victory which took an instant place in the folklore of club rugby in the northern hemisphere
â johnny sexton intends to return to dublin in the summer after two years in french in truth , there have been more of the ups than the downs
johnny sexton had to bide his time to become a fixture in the ireland team â serving an impatient apprenticeship behind oâgara
â it was many years ago that we were probably best of enemies , â said johnny sexton
â initially , both irishmen struggled to settle in paris
a lack of fluent french was a significant issue for johnny sexton , as the man charged with orchestrating his gallic club âs attacking game
â when i came over , i did nât have a great grasp of the language and i play in a position where it really helps to have a good grasp of french
â last summer , johnny sexton agonised over his next career move and eventually resolved to re-join leinster , rather than sign another contract with racing metro â who have made light of the setback by recruiting no less than dan carter to pick up the baton after the world cup
while he called it a â tough decision â , the issue of work - load at key times was decisive for johnny sexton
â the additional demands have put a strain on him , but johnny sexton has managed to juggle his duties effectively , to keep racing metro in the hunt in the top 14 and european champions cup , and help ireland retain their six nations title , in dramatic fashion â once again edging out england on points - difference
asked to address criticism of ireland âs often pragmatic tactics in the six nations â and a lack of tries prior to the torrent against scotland on the final day â johnny sexton offered a defiant retort
â if it clicks again for ireland at the world cup , they have a growing belief that â driven on by their lion at no 10 â they can mount a genuine challenge for the webb ellis cup
