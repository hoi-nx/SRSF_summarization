charity runners taking part in a 10km fun run at the weekend were left exhausted after being sent on an unscheduled two - mile detour
the blunder was believed to have been caused by a race marshal taking a toilet break during the event , missing 300 runners who should have been directed at a junction point
it was reported that some runners were ' in tears ' while one described the event 's organisation as ' shambolic '
' we saw loads of people walking at the end , some were in tears , i felt so sorry for them - i felt like crying at the 10km mark
a map shows where up to 300 runners continued along the coastal path after a marshal who was meant to direct them on to a turn went to the toilet reaction : two people vent their frustration at the bournemouth bay run on twitter yesterday it also emerged that water stations ran out of supplies during the race , forcing some runners to drink from half - empty bottles that had been left on the ground as they battled against dehydration
commenting on the daily echo website , one runner said : â we had a bottle of water at the three mile station , but at the six mile point they had totally ran out , so nothing
' we understand runners have trained for a long time for the event and it 's hard for them and we do empathise with how they are feeling
