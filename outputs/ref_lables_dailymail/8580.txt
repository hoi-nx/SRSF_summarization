louis van gaal could nât let the moment pass
united had just rattled off their 13th home win of the season and the dutchman wanted to crank up the pressure
a comfortable victory over aston villa , inspired by two goals from the excellent herrera and crowned by rooney âs magnificent strike , had seen united leap above city in the table for the first time since november 23 , 2013
but now , as they head into their latest local squabble , there is mounting confidence around old trafford that united will not surrender their position
louis van gaal has piled pressure on city ahead of their games against crystal palace and united united picked up all three points at the weekend by beating aston villa 3 - 1 at old trafford van gaal believes city 's players may struggle to get to grips with being in fourth spot united ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : de gea 6 ; valencia 7 , jones 7 , rojo 7 , blind 7 : herrera 8.5 , carrick 7 , fellaini 6.5 ( falcao 77mins ) : mata 7.5 , rooney 8 , ashley young 6.5 ( di maria 70
6.5 ) subs not used : valdes , rafael , januzaj , mcnair , pereira scorers : herrera 43 , 90 , rooney 79 aston villa ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : guzan 7 : hutton 5.5 ( bacuna 46 , 5 ) , okore 5.5 , clark 5.5 , lowton 5 : nâzogbia 5 ( baker 61 , 5 ) , sanchez 6 , delph 6 , weimann 5 ( cole 77 ) : benteke 6.5 , agbonlahor 5 subs not used : given , vlaar , gil , grealish booked : delph scorer : benteke 80 man of the match : herrera referee : roger east 6 is it feasible for city to finish fourth ? they face crystal palace on monday evening and van gaal believes dropping down two positions will creep into the psychology of manuel pellegrini âs squad
even if city win at selhurst park , how will they handle the furnace that awaits this sunday ? â it plays a part in the spirit of the players â of our opponents but also our players , â said van gaal
â i do nât know the individual players of city so well , so i can not judge them
â van gaal is aware recent history spells doom for united
remarkably , they have not beaten city at home since rooney scored that breath - taking bicycle kick in february 2011
united have not beaten city at old trafford since rooney 's wonder goal in february 2011 city striker sergio aguero scored in his side 's 1 - 0 win over united back in november rooney likes playing against aston villa â this was his 13th career goal against them
united lead rivals city by one point â it was another united , i believe , â said van gaal , when asked how he reflected on the 1 - 0 defeat he suffered at the etihad stadium in november
united âs run - in is laced with demanding assignments â aside from city , they must go to stamford bridge on april 18 , face a trip to goodison park the following week and host arsenal on may 16 â but they have an aura once more
united defender chris smalling saw red during the premier league clash at the etihad stadium united vs city - april 12 chelsea vs united - april 18 everton vs united - april 26 united vs west brom - may 2 crystal palace vs united - may 9 united vs arsenal - may 17 hull vs united - may 24 crystal palace vs city - april 6 united vs city - april 12 city vs west ham - april 19 city vs aston villa - april 25 tottenham vs city - may 3 city vs queens park rangers - may 10 swansea vs city - may 17 city vs southampton - may 24 aston villa , stymied by injury problems that tim sherwood described as â crippling â , simply could nât cope once they went conceded in the 43rd minute and the manager , who was noticeably glum afterwards , can at least take solace from the fact queens park rangers will not offer the same threat on tuesday
