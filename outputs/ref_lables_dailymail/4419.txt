a first - of - its - kind 3d simulation has revealed what happens when two supermassive black holes dramatically collide in a disk
and the simulation is particularly interesting , because recent observations show two such black holes are going to collide in just seven years - so the prediction can be tested in real life
it shows what happens when two supermassive black holes collide the simulation was led by scientists at the university of illinois and included dr roman gold , dr vasileios paschalidis , dr stuart shapiro , dr milton ruiz , dr zachariah etienne , and dr harald pfeiffer
once merged , the material around the black holes continues to swirly intensely
known as a quasar , this is a region of superheated dust and gas that surrounds supermassive black holes
this first simulation shows the gas and magnetic fields as the two supermassive black holes collide this second simulation shows the gravitational waves - ripples in space - time - in the merger material swirls around the objects in a quasar and jets fire out from the poles in the merger
it comes after two black holes were found to be seven years from merging
shown here are gravitational waves produced the simulation takes on added significance because , just the other day , it was revealed that two black holes 10.4 billion light years away are likely to collide in seven years
each of the black holes found inside the quasar pso j334.2028 +01.4075 has the mass of ten billion suns , and this simulation could provide an insight into what will happen if - or when - they merge
â supermassive black holes at the centre of large galaxies could be powering blasts from deep inside the galaxy 's core , astronomers have claimed
